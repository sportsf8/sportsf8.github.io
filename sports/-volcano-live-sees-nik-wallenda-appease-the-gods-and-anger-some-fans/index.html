<p>Daredevil Nik Wallenda took on the active Masaya Volcano in Nicaragua this evening in an ABC special, <em>Volcano Live!</em> As the title suggests, the highwire walker attempted an 1,800-foot walk over the active volcano.</p>
<p>Wallenda is part of the seventh generation of the wire-walking family, whose outrageous stunts have brought fame and tragedy to the family.</p>
<p>This latest feat marked Nik’s longest and highest highwire walk ever attempted, as he tried to become the first person to walk across the volcano. But in the course of the task, some viewers were left angry by a certain feature of the stunt.</p>
<p><strong>*** SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN THE SHOW ***</strong></p>
<p>First, the good news – Wallenda made it across the Masaya Volcano. Nik Versus the Volcano saw him battle the fumes, the heat, the winds and the Gods of Destiny to make it all the way.</p>
<p>Yet some fans felt cheated, because Wallenda, per ABC’s insistence, was wearing a safety harness.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/news/20200303/nik-wallenda-is-ready-for-volcano"><em>Sarasota-Herald Tribune</em></a>, Wallenda said that ABC tasked him with wearing the harness for the stunt, as they did on a previous stunt in New York City.</p>
<p>“That’s for ABC. It is what it is,” he explained. “It’ll be the same as Times Square.”</p>
<p>Walllenda also wore a gas mask and a mask to cover his eyes.</p>

<p>I really don’t give a damn what y’all say this is a great man of God did he fall? hell no! did he have a harness! yes oh well! Can a harness break! Hell yeah! None of us has the balls to do what he has done so shut the hell up!</p>
</li>

<p>DUDE. YOU TRY WALKING ACROSS A FUCKING VOLCANO WITHOUT A HARNESS. I swear y’all are quick to jump on him when he does something to make sure he’s coming out alive but y’all wouldn’t last a minute on that thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ABC also made Nik Wallenda wear a harness system with a trailing runner for the Niagara Falls walk in 2012. Readers should understand that Nik and his team fought this intensely to the last day. Yet this safety practice is a function of necessary event sponsorship and American liability and the law for any spectacle. Otherwise ABC would be open to almost certain lawsuit.</p>
<p>It is not easy to make or test a safety device that does not impede the performance. I was the Safety Engineering Professional Engineer who tested the device proposed by his group for adequate reliability in the Niagara walk.</p>
<p>Note that the ABC commentary never brought up the use of the horizontal lifeline system which behaved flawlessly.</p>
<p>Having a lifeline should not interfere with the half hour walk across the volcano which was a magnificent achievement.</p>
<p>Nik did his job overcoming personal fear and should not be criticized in any way for this remarkable feat. Providing family entertainment not a Roman spectacle I believe was the goal of ABC.</p>
<p>Walking/working at heights is necessary in bridge/building construction and fall protection should be practiced in all cases with carefully designed systems which eliminate or address the hazards with the appropriate worker training.</p>

<p>Nik is, as always, awesome! Those criticizing him for the harness couldn’t take the time to learn that ABC would not have aired it if he did it untethered. The man is brave and skilled, period.</p>

<p>People upset they didn’t see someone die live on television. This is the world we live in today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet he would’ve done it harness-free if he was allowed to. He still made it across without slipping – I’m impressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did. Across the Grand Canyon. No harness there. Fall and die. That’s how they prefer it. Everytime he is forced to wear a tether/harness he complains about it because it adds bulk and that’s not how they train. They train with no safety net. Period.</p>
</li>

<p>Some of you people don’t get it. Do you remember his Grand Canyon and Times Square walks? No harness. No safeguards. He loathes the harness and has publicly said so. ABC requires it or they wouldn’t publicize the stunt. The aforementioned walks I mentioned weren’t covered by ABC so he said forget the harness- and he did just fine.</p>
<p>When you’re ready to walk across the Grand Canyon on a tightrope with no harness, as he did, let us know…. until then shut your mouth.</p>

<p>“In an interview with the Sarasota-Herald Tribune, Wallenda said that ABC tasked him with wearing the harness for the stunt, as they did on a previous stunt in New York City.</p>
<p>‘That’s for ABC. It is what it is,’ he explained. ‘It’ll be the same as Times Square.'”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You guys are crazy! Do you remember Wallenda’s Grand Canyon and Times Square walks? No harness. So you go ahead and walk across the Grand Canyon on a rope with no safeguards if you think you’re hot stuff. ABC requires a safety harness or they won’t televise the stunt. The Wallendas don’t like safety devices. A few years ago, Nik’s Wallenda’s sister fell during a training session and smashed every bone in her face. It is what it is. They understand the risks. And they’re ok with that.</p>

<p>Anonymous on March 5, 2020 4:53 am</p>
<p>Lets see any of you complainers try it, with or without the mask and harness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anonymous on March 5, 2020 4:03 am</p>
<p>C’mon, did anybody really think he wasn’t going to wear safety gear? No way was ABC going to allow that.</p>
</li>

<p>If you wanted no harness, you’re not a fan, you’re sick. Get professional help.</p>
</li>

<p>Anonymous on March 5, 2020 1:38 am</p>
<p>Had he not worn the harness, he should have been committed.</p>

<p>Anonymous on March 5, 2020 12:04 am</p>
<p>Lighten Up. The problem with the Free Solo SOP is that people often die. Doing these daredevil things are dangerous enough. Why not be in awe of the awesome skills required rather than be disappointed… death was taken off the table?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vince on March 4, 2020 11:14 pm</p>
<p>It’s not a true high wire walk w a safety harness..Again trying to fool people. total bs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See his Grand Canyon walk then. All done with no harness. He had a different network air the stunt and they didn’t force him to wear the harness. So when did you want to tightrope across Grand Canyon with no harness then tough guy??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larry on March 4, 2020 10:12 pm</p>
<p>He didnt even die. So disappointing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anonymous on March 5, 2020 3:23 am</p>
<p>I wanted to watch him fall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MaderaGuy on March 4, 2020 9:44 pm</p>
<p>Safety harness? That wasn’t in the promo. What a fake! His grandfather would have never lied to the people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anonymous on March 4, 2020 9:22 pm</p>
<p>I am glad ABC had him wear a harness. Who wants to see the guy fall into an active volcano? Regardless of the harness he still made it across the entire length, with the winds, the gases, the heat and the smoke making it difficult for him to see. The harness did not keep him on the tight wire. He is crazy for doing the challenge, but he is also very gifted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anonymous on March 5, 2020 6:05 am</p>
<p>exactly then they complained about the mask…well human eyes cant handle the fumes coming from the volcano and without it the walk would have been over due to him being “blinded” and falling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Barbara W on March 5, 2020 2:52 am</p>
<p>I agree. The harness was just there it was not used by nik nor was it needed. But I for one am glad it was there.</p>
