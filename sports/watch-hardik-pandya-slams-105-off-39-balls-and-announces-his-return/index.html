<p>Hardik Pandya makes a stunning comeback following his lower-back surgery. The all-rounder scored above a century in just seven overs. To be precise, his score stands at 105 runs from 39 balls. This excellent score is for Reliance 1 at the DY Patil <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/cricket-news-ellyse-perry-is-not-going-to-play-t20-world-cup/">T20 World Cup</a>.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old returned to competitive cricket just last week. The road to recovery was almost five months long. In fact, the injury is the reason why he did not take part in the <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/cricket-news-ellyse-perry-is-not-going-to-play-t20-world-cup/">New Zealand</a> tour.</p>
<p>The match between Reliance 1 and CAG is Hardik Pandya’s second match after his return to the field. The records show his achievements from the match are 10 sixes, 8 fours, and 5 wickets.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even Pandya himself feels that this event is a great way for him to judge current form. In fact, it’s a great platform for anyone who wishes to test their body after being away for long.</p>
<p><em>“It’s fantastic (platform) for someone like me. I have been away for almost six months. This is my second game after a long time. For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body. I am really happy with the way things have gone.”</em></p>
<p>Coming to his own playing tactics, he explains how smashing it is not the goal. However, he tries to ensure that every ball is tackled with the best shot.</p>
<p><em>“If it’s there in my arc I just back myself and go for it. Most of the times, it comes out pretty well. There is no plan that I am going to go out there and smash it.”</em></p>
<p>Not only did all his fans watch him in awe, but also the chairman of selectors, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._S._K._Prasad">MSK Prasad</a>.</p>
<p>Reliance 1 dismissed CAG for 151 runs. This put them on a 101-run win for the final league match at the Reliance Corporate park at Ghansoli.</p>
