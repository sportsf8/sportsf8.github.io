<p>This makes three channels whose ads I don&rsquo;t skip because the reads are great. Move over Sam Riegel, you&rsquo;ve got company on your throne of slapstick adverts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of raycon ads, that was one of the funniest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the majority of your dnd shorts and always thought they were on point making fun of the many things they are about. However, this time I think it&rsquo;s a bit too far, you are defending YT too much. It&rsquo;s fair to say that many youtubers don&rsquo;t know the exact terms &amp; conditions of the site, and the actual procedures of the copyright claims. Hating on YT became in the last two years a meme/trend in and of itself. People were making videos on the topic just because they&rsquo;ve seen Pewds fighting with the media and decided to go in for those sweet clicks. But this clip kinda feels like it tries to diminish entirely the critique that&rsquo;s been formulated against YT and it&rsquo;s anti-consumer, anti-creator, detached from reality, corpo sellout, hypocritic, and sometimes outright biased platform. Yes, this is a privately owned space, not a town market, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can&rsquo;t have opinions about it, and when the majority feels like its service management becomes progressively worse, people will voice their thoughts about it. And terms &amp; conditions can also be modified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The terms and conditions you agreed to when you signed up-&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-that have changed like 50 times since you joined, are applied unevenly and in a draconian manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You receive a puurly spelled compliment in tge comments&hellip; &quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get 37+ self esteem points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thing is, youtube basically has a monopoly and effectively does function as a town square. Just not in a legal sense.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>And even when demonitization does get overturned, it&rsquo;s only after the video has gotten the bulk of the views it will ever get, for which there will be no compensation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New wireless earbud falls out of ear and immediately goes back into the vacuum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;YouTube&rsquo;s a private company, not your town square&rdquo; is an interesting aspect of the conversation. Communication technology companies fall under basically two categories of legal interpretations: platforms and publishers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YouTube removed video by Agadmator Chess Channel because it contained &ldquo;harmful or dangerous content&rdquo;. Video about chess. Appeal rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probably got triggered White ones go first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond the terms and conditions that you agreed upon when you signed up for your free account&rdquo; I mean, yes, but also no. Their terms are intentionally vague and open to their discretion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Now all I need&rsquo;s a wireless vacuum.&rdquo; Time for Dyson sponsorship??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL! I LOVE how he did NOT answer that question!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Did you learn anything?”</p>

<p>Sarah: “No&hellip;did you (grin)”

<p>I didn’t even mind that Raycon ad.  Well done. Also, I have a couple of pairs of Raycon ear buds. Best I’ve ever owned. The sound quality is really good and they are surprisingly comfortable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done on making a commercial for them that was actually amusing and entertaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, this is the first time I’ve ever commented on a video and talked about the ad and not the video! LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh dear&hellip; if they did this, imagine if they did Artist&rsquo;s Edition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m posting my art on Tumblr.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to avoid that, I&rsquo;m gonna throw it on Twitter.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll be sticking it on DeviantArt here.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No kidding, because this was Youtuber Edition, I actually thought the ad sketch at the beginning was part of the video. It&rsquo;s perfectly in line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YouTube IS the &ldquo;town square&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s &ldquo;No. Did you?&rdquo; was amazingly sassy. Love her! :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only thing Waylon was missing was twelve forms of asking for money including crypto currency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m kind of surprised no one has complained that Mann Shorts is sexist and should be called People Pants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah: No. Did you?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I love me some Sarah attitude!!!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I attempt to talk a cordless vacuum manufacturer into sponsoring the party!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Usually love your video&rsquo;s but this one&hellip; didn&rsquo;t enjoy it at all and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if all these people complaining about youtune demonetising their videos even realise there&rsquo;s a review process&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t mind the adds when they feel like a natural part of the show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being monetized and flagged is a being actually abused. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of people who actually always fight under fair use and almost never win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whispers wrestling is essential business (In all seriousness I hope that Vince comes to his senses and stops)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as he talked about moving to another platform, i remembered when all the gun review channels moved to PH, and then thought how it would go if Mann Shorts ended up on PH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ok. that commercial is something i actually wouldn&rsquo;t skip on tv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I usually hate advertisements, but yours are actually entertaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raycon has been nailing their channels to ad on recently, and the ads don&rsquo;t even suck lol. Might buy a pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These ads and the internet historian ads are the only ones I watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate paid promotions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That being said&hellip; this was tolerable if not even alittle funny</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love you guys ❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &ldquo;ad&rdquo; at the beginning was actually just a scheme to get that sweet wireless-vacuum sponsorship&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These Ads are top tier STOP MAKING ME WANT TO BUY THINGS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The terms and conditions that you agreed to when you made your free account&rdquo; lol that was AGES ago they have changed tos probably at least 10 times since then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ngl. this is the closest I&rsquo;ve ever gotten to buying a pair of raycons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Sara&rsquo;s response to &ldquo;did you learn anything?&quot;, whoever wrote this episode, awesome job 👍</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and looking forward to the day-glo outfits 😁

<li>
<p>You got the like for the ad.  Just so you know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how well Mann Shorts has done their ads. They actually make it fun and enjoyable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m disappointed because it seems you are just sucking up to YouTube while marginalizing the problems of censorship of others, who just happen to be your competition.  You fail to point out that manual reviews take days if not weeks to get restricted content overturned. For those who rely on current/up-to-date content, delays render their channels irrelevant. YouTube’s TOS wording is so broad that it allows them to censor that it allows them to censor anyone that they don’t like what they are saying. Sure, YT is a private company and the 1st amendment only applies to the government. The thing is, YT want to call itself a platform while behaving like a publisher and you know that flies in the face of section 230. Lastly, calling an alternative platform home of nazis is petty. I’m assuming that’s a jab at Bitchute. Yeah, you’ll see that stuff on there as well as other platforms. You can still find the same thing on YT if you look hard enough. The difference between the two is that YT is still the largest of these kind of sites with millions upon millions in more content, however, at least Bitchute’s stance is to use the light of exposure to being the best for of sanitation. Go read what they have said about it. Overall, with all of the funny and thought provoking material ya could have used, I wish you hadn’t gone this route and cheapen your channel. Still, it was a good commercial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations. You made the advertisement entertaining enough that I actually watched it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish to hear more about Lancypants wrestling..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yea the company that strikes you gets to be the one that decides if the strike goes threw or not and the strike claim remains on your account regardless and builds up&hellip; i love yall but stop being stupid&hellip;. and you tell us to move to another platform so we creat 1 (example parlor) and yall call it a gathering place for radicals and reeee and scream till no bank or company will touch them or ull cancle said company or bank&hellip;..man i hate your ways!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be silenced&rdquo; 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That ad is like those infomercials where the old way of doing things is in black and white and over-the-top bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;we are going to start using ads.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creates pure entertainment artwork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always laugh at Sara&rsquo;s rolls&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That PeeWee Herman-esque laugh at the end of the ad was priceless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was a pretty tasteful advert, I must say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to ask:  where did that giant d20 come from?  It’s amazing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your advertisements are so good I can&rsquo;t imagine skipping them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that Bluntman and Chronic as Loki and Thanos? Nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interestingly only one side is being censored. Milo, Tommy Robinson, crowder, rebel media, mark dice etc etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90&rsquo;s, when Netscape still existed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90’s edition, huh? I can see the DM thinking&hellip; “welcome to my world, btches&hellip;” <em>insert evil laughter here</em> Oh sheesh&hellip; no widespread internet, programming your webpage in HTML on Geocities, no mobile phones except those die hard Nokia’s&hellip; happy hardcore&hellip; but still that eufemistic optimism that the Cold War was over and that we were moving towards a society a la Star Trek&hellip; good times.

<p>Great ad, guys! &ldquo;Now if only I can find a wireless vacuum! Heh heh!&rdquo; Lmaooo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m with Sarah on learning lessons - and I love that she ended up with the giant metal die!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was the best sponsor I&rsquo;ve seen. I&rsquo;m totally ok with ads in videos if you keep this up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn you for making me enjoy the sponsor&rsquo;s content!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am waiting for the day that Sarah rolls something other than a die, even an inappropriate one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sarah: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Nat 20.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As much as I do like this I have to ask, is Anime Edition Part 2: Sailor Chaz still coming?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My first thought while watching the opening ad - &ldquo;What? First Beats By Dre, now Raekwon has headphones too ??&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>is this youtubepaganda? well, ok, I for one welcome our corporate overlords</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baggy/Saggy pants next session, everything is gonna be &ldquo;hella cool!&rdquo; none of this &ldquo;yeet&rdquo; crap :P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love that they&rsquo;re watching Drunk Before Noon in the background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now THAT&rsquo;S how you do a sponsership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I REALLY didn&rsquo;t want to like that ad but it was just too good!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Course, there are still some channels that get demonetized despite NOT violating T&amp;C.</p>
</li>

<p>Just look at Tipster, what did he do? Reported and commented on drama going on around various channels including Suzy Lu (who while he did in some of his podcasts mention her pet peeve physical feature, he immediately stopped doing so as soon as he became aware that she didn&rsquo;t appreciate that), yet he is 100% demonetized and his attempt at an appeal resulted in it being upheld with no explanation, and now he can&rsquo;t even access YT support. Just try to tell me that isn&rsquo;t absolute BS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to say that you forgot the totally heartwarming youtuber. The one who started doing it for some family member or because he/she wanted to inform/teach someone else something and then it blew up and got popular without anything stopping it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dyson makes cordless vacuums, good luck getting them as a sponsor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What the hell?  Vampire cannibal society is total clickbait.  Waylon should be getting half a million subscribers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg im loving your paod advertisements. Now on with the show.

<li>
<p>Raycon reminds me of the Dr. Who episode where people were converted to Cybermen through 1st gen BT headsets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>having that ad makes the Youtuber Edition very meta actually</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it just me or is &ldquo;drunk before noon&rdquo; being shown on the tv?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really appreciate the level of effort and class in these ads. I get a good laugh, they get sponsored, everyone wins. Keep it up guys!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds&hellip;unhealthy&hellip;&rdquo;    Looking at you, Twitch.  XD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I so wish I was friends with these guys. That Raycon spot was hilarious!!😂 Also, then I&rsquo;d have someone to game with. #ImSoLonely 😏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ads haven&rsquo;t bothered me at all.  I keep forgetting they are a thing now and then get a pleasant surprise skit at the beginning of the videos :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didnt watch the vid, got the urge to vacuum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotta say,  you&rsquo;re really off base on this.  There are plenty of channels who conform to the TOS who are being demonetized simply for their political views.  Look at Stephen Crowder.  YouTube admitted that he hadn&rsquo;t broken any rules and still demonetized his channel.  There&rsquo;s a whole slew of political channels that are dealing with this issue,  and manual review doesn&rsquo;t do them any good. Maybe before making fun of an issue you should figure out what&rsquo;s actually happening so you don&rsquo;t simply come across as tone deaf.  Btw, one of the channels they did this to was Pewdiepie, and he had the largest subscriber count of any independent youtuber. Several others that I watch have millions of subscribers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thumbs up for the entertaining ad at the beginning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brilliant ad, but wires still best Bluetooth where actual sound quality is concerned. Only audiophiles actually care about that though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the commercial is funnier than the show I mean uh SORRY, MY PEEPS, BUT WRITE WORSE COMMERCIALS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s kinda sad how true this skit is lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SO disappointed this wasn’t sponsored by RAID: SHADOW LEGENDS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it happens&rdquo; lol good way to do an ad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the wrestling channel references.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love the advertisement XD was funny. Another good episode n stoked for the 90s edition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As someone who lives in arizona, I appreciate how much shade this video provides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would you actually even bother to read that email all the way? If it&rsquo;s THAT hateful, you laugh at the guy after the first line and ignore it. The guy will move on eventually. I&rsquo;m not even a YouTuber and I know that. Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe do this again with a bit more research or in a more comedic fashion.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was like an actual ad with a budget and script and all lol pretty good ngl 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was interesting. Not my favorite of the d&amp;d editions, but still entertaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sets down a goddamn table centerpiece</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;81&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ima be honest all of his promotions are top teir, dont even care if im watching an ad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me guess sarah/melissa is speaking from some sort of experience xD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would be a total mark for Lancey Pants Wrestling. Make it happen!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even mind the adds on this channel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I liked at the end of the paid promotion. It was amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love it when the ad reads are hilarious &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: it&rsquo;s funny and weird to me that our generation is probably gonna view the 90&rsquo;s the same way that a lot of the previous generation view the 50&rsquo;s/60&rsquo;s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im not okay rn. i genuinely just got my headphones stuck in the vacuum so either you sabotaged my headphones or rhis was just a weirdly accurate ad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So I was thinking of starting a channel myself but now I&rsquo;m thinking its a bad idea</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love the DBN Raycon promo. Still waiting for D&amp;D promo edition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thud &hellip;&ldquo;81&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I laughed out loud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you all are turning Drunk Before Noon into your advertising bit, I just want to say I&rsquo;m good with that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the thumbnail I thought Lance would be doing a reaction channel, and sitting in on every other player&rsquo;s video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t wait for dice that make the table groan and crack with their weight.

<li>
<p>That was a clean add though yazik makes me laugh too hard fr dude</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man&hellip; they really don&rsquo;t care about Sarah&rsquo;s dice anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg 90s edition travel to 2020, I prayed and the dm heard my call!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Raycon commercial is so meta for this edition..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost it so hard at the casualness of the 81 bit that my roommate asked me if I was okay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The advertisements are killer. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re getting sponsors, you all definitely deserve it considering the hilarious content you make.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Awwww yeah! More 90&rsquo;s edition coming up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ah the 90&rsquo;s when i started to exist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes 90’s awesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ah yes, the &rsquo;90s, when RATM and Bodycount first hit large telling the truth and predicting what&rsquo;s happening right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When is 2020 edition coming out?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How meta is it that they are watching Drunk Before Noon in the background?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dude great advertisement job! and now to continue with the show lol!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like I just watched two in-video ads. Did Youtube pay for the second one, or was that done on faith?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yall do any ads yall want. These are some of the best so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not gonna lie the ad was pretty good 😂 so happy to see y’all a channel grow!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of Big D20 Energy coming off these vids lately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes. Sarah&rsquo;s die. YES.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting ten views with 4 of them being lance&hellip;dang, that is actually what has gone on for a channel I have.

<li>
<p>All I have to say is I need MOAR commercials with the Drunk Before Noon cast!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love these intros. Drunk before noon, so good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In regards to the ad at the beginning, I had something similar happen to me once. It involved a band saw and the drawstring of my hoodie and the results was surprisingly similar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t end in a DM meltdown? I would say they did learn something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved the ad! Made me chuckle, keep up the good work, but I can&rsquo;t wait for a serious one like the road accident video much love from South Africa buds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that raycon add could legit work standalone, and was pretty entertaining. other youtubers should take notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ooohhh 90s I can&rsquo;t wait</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one was funny though :P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As advertisements go that one wasn’t bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90&rsquo;s Edition coming back?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>AWESOME!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is awesome. Except small channels like Wailin&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t monetize because they have less than 10,000 subs now. At least that&rsquo;s what they told me when they stopped it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yay, 90s edition! Love the giant dice too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg that awkward silence about software detection vs a manual review lmao I love you guys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impressive ad. Also that was super meta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am honestly waiting for the supercut of all the ads you guys do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lances Jay and Silent Bob shirt&hellip; nice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We still getting that Chaz anime session though?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That intro for the ad&hellip; priceless.

</li>
<li>
<p>Best ad EVER!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bring in 90&rsquo;s edition!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait, is that their ad playing on the tv in the background?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I normally skip.ads but I almost always watch these</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh man&hellip; you all make these ads actually fun to watch.  This is so refreshing. 快い</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guys this was great. The struggle is real ha ha. As a small dnd channel the niche comments were good. Also I love Sarah’s rolls. At least she had a d20 this time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just started the video and am ready, subliminal messaging with the Drunk Before Noon on in the background!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D&amp;D Book Edition. Reviewing books could be very comical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the ads are just as good as the content! You guys rock!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They do the best adds period lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90&rsquo;s edition? CROSSOVER TIME!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love this! Even better, I was watching FL Edition when this video came up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90&rsquo;s edition, pogs, All that, and constantly thinking abut how to prevent 9/11</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best commercial I&rsquo;ve seen in a while</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watched the whole commercial.  I regret nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genuinely a great ad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey, I&rsquo;m a guy named Dave!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pure goldness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was informative and fun, nice job. I have no interest in running a youtube but it is nice to know what you all go through.

<p>Best add ever! Well done guys, well done!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You had me at wireless vacuum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YES! 90&rsquo;S EDITION!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Youtuber always makes me visualize since kind of starchy root vegetables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, the giant D20 is a communal dice, eh?😎</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Is that roll of 81 from Sara the highest ever of the series? 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had to stop after the ad just to say that was gold. Now to the other funny bits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paid advertisement!? I thought that was a DBN teaser!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not gonna lie. I started rooting for the vacuum. 😆</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the clean production of this channel is amazing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On point, my dudes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would start a YouTube channel where each week we play a homebrew comedy focused type of DnD one shot!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best raycon ad ever&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots pof love for the huge D20 placed on the table.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun as usual! Glad you’re all still okay! Stay safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yay! More 90s edition!  I love the shade sent flying through this btw.  Always good stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to see what content you come up with for your next sponsor. Also, yeah Wailin would not have a channel I would want to see. That just sounds really, really creepy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liked the video already for the ad alone. Y&rsquo;all earn that sponsorship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After several more you are going to have to put together an ad compilation. :)

</li>
<li>
<p>HOLY CRAP! Where&rsquo;d she get that orc-killer? I want one!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More big D20 please!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ad was ok, i usually catch my earbud cord on door handles, not vacuums. Or my dogs keep jumping up and pulling them out. Still good and creative ad though</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone Sarah and you will never Vacuum my house 😂😂 AWESOME CONTENT!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best Ad Ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luckily, Sarah is adored by strangers on the internet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little personal this time, eh?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another great D&amp;D edition.  Happy I found this channel. 😀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is going on in that video behind Sara? Do they realize it&rsquo;s on and that the DM is on it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something less existential&hellip; fantastic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LMAO!  WAYLON, WTF!  LMAO!!!  Lance, you&rsquo;re ever the optimist.   &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOVE LANCE&rsquo;S SHIRT!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man Shorts-Wireless Vacuum Edition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kraken die is back, nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dang being a YouTuber looks hard. You guys are doing a great job!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t watched wrestling in maybe a decade but I&rsquo;m subscribed to four different wrestling channels with at least 100k subscribers, so it&rsquo;s not that bad of a market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hooray, 90s edition!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another wonderful add.  Thank you for the ad humor.  Get that ad money!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That giant metal d20 is gonna crack a floor or a foot eventually

<p>Ah&hellip; To live the life where $60 isn&rsquo;t a lot of money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viva the 90&rsquo;s :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ouch! this hurts! too close to home for us new Tubers,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but imma make a Benz outta this Datsun, i&rsquo;ve got ambition baby, look in my eyes &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy there&rsquo;s the large metal dice. I want it in each video. Congrats on sponsors and great ad reads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perfect episode. Funny, insightful and entertaining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait&hellip; was that an ad for ear buds or vacuuming? Cause he made vacuuming look pretty interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That Bluntman &amp; Chronic shirt though!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I monetize watching YouTube?  Making content sounds like work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have tried multiple version of raycon earbuds over the last few years and honestly they are absolute trash. I would give the company 2/5 stars.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>But for mann shorts I&rsquo;d give you 100/10 stars for your wonderful and amazing content and im glad you have found a sponsor so I will be trying raycon again to be massively disappointed  just to support you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello do you know the name of the dice that she holding , what geometric group that dice is from ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love the giant dice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That ad should win an award! Sarah is on point as usual. Metal D20 FTW! Did you learn anything? No&hellip;😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need your ads on all Youtube vids!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I get a link to Wailin&rsquo;s channel? Im sure he will have some good content when he comes back about how Susan is a reptilian and YouTube is oppressing small content creators and their viewers in favor of corporations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were EVER going to buy Raycons I&rsquo;d use your link 👍 👍 👍</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Sarah did the editing? She seems more the writing type.

<li>
<p>Wow, you made me actually watch the raycon ad. Good job!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>video wasn&rsquo;t ten minutes long so its not a true youtuber edition lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmao I might just have to buy some those ear buds . Great video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you actually vacuum like that normally to the outro rap, it could good exercise&hellip;.I&rsquo;m going to try it lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was hilarious- would you maybe do star trek edition? Maybe TOS vs TNG vs Reboot?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hilarious as always! Let me just point out though that 5 companies control the majority of the speech/expression that occurs in first world countries&ndash; Youtube in particular having a near monopoly on the long-form video scene, so them choosing to censor certain points of view, while legal, is ethically problematic for the same reasons it would be problematic for the government to do so. Flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, the majority of us find these views totally wrong, but that&rsquo;s precisely why they need to be allowed to speak, and the rest of us counter with better speech. Sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YES! 90s edition! I can&rsquo;t wait!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watched the video and my algorithm thought it was excellent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>90’s EDITION!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you mean they dont just throw money complements at you for any video you put up. Its heresy I tell you&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great video though guys i really mean it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh boy 90s edition again!!!!</p>

<p>90&rsquo;s rough draft scenario : getting by : it&rsquo;s Friday night and the party is split up; one member waits at home for a FedEx delivery to arrive with important mission details required to earn money for the rent. The party in total starts with $300 and rent is $400, the FedEx package is worth $150. The nearest branch is located at the strip mall just outside the suburbs and they&rsquo;re closed tomorrow. Be there when it arrives or else somebody will have to pick it up before they close at 4PM( but it can&rsquo;t be picked up before, or less than an hour after the delivery attempt has been made) . They have all the typical central command tools afforded to a lower middle class household and a couple extras (a single landline telephone, fax machine, pens and legal paper, 24.6k modem internet subscription, a Macintosh computer, a brand new 10-speed Schwinn, the Yellow Pages phone book, television with cable). The computer has pictures and detailed information about businesses, but requires using the phone line; the phone book has addresses and a quick to use directory, and does not take the phone line; the fax machine can send documents between home and businesses; the television has random information about local businesses and also helps balance/preserve emotions; the Schwinn can make it to the edge of the suburbs in 15 minutes, seemingly by the magic of cutting through neighbors&rsquo; yards, but it can&rsquo;t cross the highway into town. How is a middle class household struggling to pay rent? That&rsquo;s a question for the landlord; he&rsquo;s an aging Veitnam vet named Buzz; the party are just house mates. The one house rule is &ldquo;do not go in the basement&rdquo; Buzz can somehow find a way to laugh off anything else so long as it&rsquo;s covered in next months&rsquo; rent.</p>

<p>Wow, I almost expected Lance to be the &ldquo;Censorship!&rdquo; type rather than Wailin. But once they got into the channel types, yeah, it made a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Uhn actually have you paid attention to the ToS? It changes and they ban people all the time that don&rsquo;t break the rules because the rules are intentionally misleading and vague. And they don&rsquo;t care about money they made that excessively obvious. I know you are trying to paint a specific narrative here but the evidence is pretty staggering. Yes its (Mostly) legal, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it morale. That aside though was a fairly amusing video though seemed a lot more psa than joke ridden.</p>
