PODGORICA (Montenegro), May 28 (SeeNews) - Montenegro plans to invest 246 million euro ($273 million) in the construction of a 170 MW hydropower plant (HPP) on Komarnica river, the ministry of sustainable development said.</p>
<p>The construction of the hydropower plant in Montenegro&rsquo;s north is expected to take five years to complete, the ministry said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Montenegrin government has adopted a detailed spatial plan for the multipurpose water reservoir on the Komarnica river and plans to develop a strategic environmental assessment of the project, the head of the directorate for spatial planning at the ministry, Marina Izgarevic Pavicevic, said in the statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the preparation of the detailed spatial plan, all international regulations, agreements and conventions were respected, regulations in the field of infrastructure, regulations related to cultural heritage, environment, etc. were respected,&rdquo; Izgarevic Pavicevic said.</p>
<p>The plan also complies with the recommendations of the government of neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, she added.</p>
<p>The Komarnica hydropower project was initiated in the 1980s. Since then, research work needed to obtain data for the planned implementation of the project has been carried out by several regional companies. The power plant is expected to produce 200 GWh of electricity per year.</p>
<p>($ = 0.900868 euro)

<h3 id="family-members-concerned-after-246-cases-of-covid-19-at-greensville-correctional-center">&ldquo;Family members concerned after 246 cases of COVID-19 at Greensville Correctional Center&rdquo;</h3>

GREENSVILLE COUNTY, Va. &ndash; According to the Virginia Department of Corrections (DOC), approximately 29,000 inmates have been tested for COVID-19 statewide. But CBS 6 has received dozens of emails from family members concerned by the conditions that COVID-19 patients are living in at Greensville Correctional Center.</p>
<p>Damisha Perry said that her cousin is COVID-19 positive and locked behind bars at the Greensville Correctional Center in Southern Virginia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nightmare that hasn&rsquo;t ended yet,&rdquo; Perry said. &ldquo;He informed us they are quarantined with other sick inmates, two to a cell, and they don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re going to thrive let alone survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perry learned about her loved one&rsquo;s condition six days ago.</p>
<p>The DOC reports nearly 3,000 inmates and staff were tested last week at the prison, through what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Point Prevalence Testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The process involves testing asymptomatic offenders, which allows positive cases to be discovered and therefore treated sooner. As of Thursday, 193 inmates and 53 staff members tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Prior to testing, only two inmates had symptoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We care for inmates. Inmates are still people, they are still human beings! Help them,&rdquo; wrote Asharma Rives in another letter recieved by CBS 6.</p>
<p>Other letters claim that the correctional center has refused to give wellness updates on prisoners to their family members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we call Greensville they won’t give us a wellness check,&rdquo; Wrote LeTai Saunders. &ldquo;Please help me I’ve lost both my parents and I don’t want to lose my youngest brother in prison dying from the Coronavirus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just want an explanation as to how they came in contact with the virus and why aren&rsquo;t they receiving any medical treatment,&rdquo; Perry added.</p>
<p>The DOC said medical staff are working around the clock to test and provide care to offenders during the pandemic, and that that those who are positive are quarantined, but not housed with inmates who have tested negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inmates, they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, they&rsquo;re only have contact with each other and the staff, so it&rsquo;s going to be up to them to do something to stop this pandemic inside of their correctional facility,&rdquo; Perry said.</p>
<p>The DOC said it has tested approximately 29,000 offenders state wide and said they will continue to follow CDC guidelines to ensure the safety of everyone in its facilities.</p>

GORDON Ramsay travelled 246 miles back to London from Cornwall after a feud with his neighbours over him relocating to his second home.</p>
<p>The TV chef moved his family to his £4million coastal mansion last month - when people could be fined for any non-essential travel.</p>
<p>10 Gordon Ramsay travels 246 miles back to London after angering Cornwall neighbours by moving to second home in lockdown</p>
<p>The journey between the two is a long slog with 245 miles by road and a five hour car journey.</p>
<p>But Gordon made it back to his London townhouse in Wandsworth this week, where he announced the reopening of his restaurant.</p>
<p>Gordon, 53, kept quiet on how he&rsquo;d made it from A to B but insisted his lockdown experience had been a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo;.</p>

<p>10 Gordon&rsquo;s garden walls revealed he had returned to his London home to prepare for his restaurant opening</p>
<p>10 The distinct brick walls are a feature of his London home</p>
<p>He told fans: &ldquo;Hi guys it&rsquo;s Gordon, I&rsquo;ve got some really exciting news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this lockdown has been a nightmare for absolutely all of us but, tomorrow at midday we&rsquo;re going to open for an amazing BBQ at The Narrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most amazing burgers, great ice creams, ciders, beers and wines.At midday on Friday. Can&rsquo;t wait to see you. Enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New UK Government advice has warned people to &lsquo;stay alert&rsquo; and Boris Johnson announced plans yesterday to slowly ease the lockdown in England – including plans to open pubs and restaurants as well as ditch the two-metre social distancing rule.</p>
<p>Though Gordon insisted his lockdown experience had been a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo;, he has been spotted on boat trips and bike rides since the Government told Brits to &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Gordon - who owns three Cornish homes - also recently enjoyed a day at the beach on Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The restaurant owner spent time watching the sunset on a dog walk as he admired those having BBQs by the sea amid lockdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful Bank Holiday Weekend,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some of the most gorgeous beaches in the country here. It&rsquo;s so nice to see the kids, kites, dogs, mums and dads, kids in and out the rock pools. It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the sun sets it&rsquo;s so nice to see on the beach, swimmers, bbqs, how beautiful. That&rsquo;s what Bank Holiday Weekends should be about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week, Gordon took to the seas after being hounded with complaints over a string of long-distance bike rides in Cornwall.</p>
<p>He goaded his neighbours after going on a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; cycling trip at his £4million holiday home, telling them: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on an app - don&rsquo;t get your knickers in a twist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve been at war ever since Gordon flouted lockdown rules and fled London to isolate in Cornwall.</p>
<p>One local seethed: &ldquo;Don’t you realise that by doing that you’ve possibly brought the virus with you and because Cornwall is not your main residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you and your family get sick you will place yet more strain on an already fragile infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over 1200 cops have so far been tested for coronavirus.</p>
<p>While lower rung personnel are the worst affected by the pandemic, it has not spared top officials including IPS. At least seven SHOs have tested positive for COVID-19 while two IPS officers - Additional DCP of Shahdara and a DCP of North Delhi - have contracted the disease.</p>
<p>On the questions being raised about a high number of infection among the cops, senior officials said they work on the ground as front warriors which increases the chances of infection. They are working as per a rotation system and shifts have been fixed so in the case of infection contact tracing becomes easier.</p>
<p>The police department is also taking various measures to strengthen the immune system of cops, including regular Yoga classes and kadha prescribed by AYUSH Ministry.</p>
<p>To deal with the mental challenges, cops are being given counselling sessions by psychologists.</p>
<p>If any personnel tests positive, he or she is given financial assistance of Rs 10,000 immediately from the Delhi Police Welfare Fund while Rs 10 lakh is given in case of death.

hree Six Mafia won an Oscar for a song called “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp”. It shines when Brandon Clarke puts up historic rookie numbers despite tumbling down draft boards almost a year ago.</p>
<p>It shines when a single parent goes to work a second job to try to provide better opportunity for their children, or when those kids get themselves ready to go to school and do their homework despite mom and/or dad not being home. It shines when a nurse works a sixth shift in four days, or a local citizen donates their time or treasure to a local food bank. It is illuminated by the faces of all who give of themselves to not just provide aid their fellow men and women, but literally and figuratively rebuild the city itself. It isn’t heroics - it’s day to day life for many Memphians.</p>
<p>So whether it’s the team first making the playoffs in 2004, 50 wins with the legend Hubie Brown at the helm, Zach Randolph becoming an All-Star in 2010, when the 8-seed Grizzlies upset the 1-seed Spurs in 2011, or the 2019-2020 Grizzlies drastically outperforming expectations, the professional basketball team in Memphis has consistently modeled being the ultimate underdog quite well. That is a reflection of the struggles of their city - no one outside of Memphis expects much from a city with so many holes, or an NBA franchise with such a small market to play in. That suits the Grizzlies and their community just fine. Because it is what drives them. What brings them together.</p>
<p>There is beauty and sort of peace in a common fight, and in a city so often divided in too many ways the unifying force that comes with being counted out so often can make a massive difference. It is part of why the Grizzlies came to Memphis - to provide a new way for Memphians to come together. Some teams and cities can simply judge success in wins and losses. In Memphis, it isn’t that simple.</p>
<p>It’s about moments of impact. Finding a greater purpose and using that energy for the greater good, all while striving for something better. In that pursuit, you find yourself and each other. For close to two decades, the Grizzlies and their Memphis home have gritted their teeth, grinding down that path of progress together. The work is not done - it is a neverending, long, and winding road. The pursuit of that ideal though, with all the obstacles and issues in their way, make for a story worth telling.</p>
<p>It also makes for a city worth fighting - and team worth rooting - for. No matter the odds against them.</p>

Victors are determined decisively on the court, but one great joy of fandom outside the lines has no clear winner. We love to weigh the merits of our favorite players against each other, and yet a taproom full of basketball fans can never unanimously agree on the GOAT. In this series, we attempt to settle scores of NBA undercard debates — or at least give you fodder for your next “Who is better?” argument.</p>
<p>THE MATCHUP: Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James</p>
<p>Prime numbers</p>
<p>Bryant was voted the NBA’s youngest ever All-Star Game starter at age 19 in 1998, when he finished second in the Sixth Man of the Year race, but he was far from a dominant force. He made a leap the next year and another two years after that to emerge a fully realized superstar. We will split the difference for argument’s sake, marking the 1999-2000 campaign as the beginning of his prime. That was his first of 14 straight seasons averaging 20 points, a run that lasted until a torn Achilles expedited his career descent.</p>
<p>From 1999-2013, Bryant averaged 27.8 points (55.6 true shooting percentage), 5.7 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 2.1 combined blocks and steals in 38.8 minutes per game. Excluding the 2011-12 lockout-shortened season, he averaged 76 games per season and never played fewer than 65. During that span, he finished top five in MVP voting 11 times, winning in 2008 and finishing runner-up the following year. He placed top five in Defensive Player of the Year voting on three occasions, peaking with a third-place finish in 2002.</p>
<p>Bryant’s Los Angeles Lakers made the playoffs every year but once in his prime (2004-05), winning five championships in seven trips to the Finals. The Lakers lost three first-round series in that stretch, including a 2013 set when Bryant was nursing his Achilles injury. In that 14-year span, Bryant averaged 27.7 points (54.3 TS%), 5.4 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.1 blocks/steals in 41.5 minutes over 192 playoff games.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Bryant was the best player on two of his five championship teams. In his prime, he never played with more than one active All-Star, sharing the court with Shaquille O’Neal for the first five of those seasons and Pau Gasol the final six. Andrew Bynum and Dwight Howard also made All-Star appearances alongside Bryant.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James (Yahoo Sports graphic)</p>
<p>James entered the league as advertised in 2003, averaging a 21-6-6 en route to 2004 Rookie of the Year honors, but he made his leap to superstardom as an NBA sophomore and has remained in his prime since.</p>
<p>From 2004 to the present, James has averaged 27.5 points (59.2 true shooting percentage), 7.6 rebounds, 7.5 assists and 2.4 blocks/steals in 38.3 minutes per game. Excluding the 2011 lockout and the current hiatus, he has averaged 76 games per season and played fewer than 69 just once. On that run, he has 13 top-five MVP finishes, winning four times and placing second twice (with another likely coming this season). He also has a handful of top-five Defensive Player of the Year finishes, peaking at second in 2009 and 2013.</p>
<p>James’ teams have made the playoffs in all but the first and last of his completed prime seasons, winning three titles in nine Finals trips and never losing a first-round series. Over the past 15 years, he has averaged 28.9 points (57.9 TS%), 8.9 boards, 7.1 assists and 2.8 blocks/steals in 42 minutes over 239 playoff games.</p>
<p>James has been the best player on all three of his championship teams. Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams each made a single All-Star appearance during James’ first seven seasons on the Cleveland Cavaliers. He joined All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh for four seasons on the Miami Heat before returning to Cleveland, where he teamed with All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love for another four years. He spent last season with a starless team in Los Angeles before luring Anthony Davis to the Lakers.</p>
<p>We will get to the question of how much weight Bryant’s two extra rings carry in comparison to James’ two additional shots at one, and what their supporting casts meant to both, but if you were starting a team with the knowledge of what both would bring to the table statistically for their primes, you would take James and not think twice. He scores as much as Bryant, more efficiently, while owning a sizable edge in almost every other category, and has done it all for two more years and counting. James is a prime numbers god.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>Career high</p>
<p>As we laid out when we pitted him opposite Tim Duncan, Bryant’s career apex depends on your preference. He posted an efficient 30-7-6 for the three-time defending champs as a 24-year-old, one of eight times he made First Team All-NBA and All-Defense. Three years later, he averaged 35.4 points per game, the most since Michael Jordan. Bryant captured his lone MVP award in 2008, and then followed with his sole runner-up MVP finish, avenging the previous year’s Finals loss to Boston and capturing his first O’Neal-less title.</p>
<p>It is that 2008-09 season that struck me as Bryant’s peak. Coming off his contribution to the Redeem Team, a 30-year-old Bryant lifted the Lakers to 65 wins and placed them on the short list of most dominant teams of the past two decades. He finished second in MVP voting to James after winning in 2008, and then added his first Finals MVP award, erasing any doubt he could win a title as his team’s top player and vaulting himself onto the league’s list of immortals. Bryant made First-Team All-NBA and All-Defense again, averaging 26.8 points (56.1 TS%), 5.2 rebounds, 4.9 assists and two blocks/steals in 36.1 minutes a game.</p>
<p>In the 2009 playoffs, Bryant elevated those numbers to 30.2 points (56.4 TS%), 5.5 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocks/steals in 40.9 minutes per game. And in a gentleman’s sweep of the Orlando Magic in the Finals, he averaged a 32-6-7 on 52.5 percent true shooting with three blocks/steals in 44 minutes a night. Bryant won his first of back-to-back Finals MVPs during a string of three straight Finals appearances.</p>
<p>James’ pinnacle is easier to pin down, even if he submitted four MVP campaigns. Coming off his stewardship of the gold medal-winning 2012 U.S. Olympic men’s national team at age 28 in 2012-13, he averaged 26.8 points (64.0 TS%), eight rebounds, 7.3 assists and 2.6 blocks/steals in 37.9 minutes per game. He received all but one of 121 first-place MVP votes and finished a close second to Marc Gasol in the Defensive Player of the Year voting, as his Heat won 66 regular-season games, including 27 straight.</p>
<p>In the 2013 playoffs, James averaged 25.9 points (58.5 TS%), 8.4 rebounds, 6.6 assists and 2.6 blocks/steals in 41.7 minutes per game. And in the seven-game barnburner against Duncan’s San Antonio Spurs dynasty in the Finals, James averaged a 25-11-7 on 52.9 true shooting with three blocks/steals in 43 minutes a night. He won his second of three Finals MVPs en route to eight straight Finals appearances.</p>
<p>Players with the same regular-season stat line (or better) as Bryant’s most complete campaign: James Harden, Michael Jordan, Tracy McGrady, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Stephen Curry, Larry Bird, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Clyde Drexler, Kawhi Leonard, Wade and James &hellip; seven times. Bryant’s was the least efficient scoring season of the bunch, and yet it was among the most efficient of his career. James has not had a season as inefficient since he turned 23 years old.</p>
<p>Players who posted the same stat line as James at his best: LeBron James. Even removing true shooting percentage from the equation, only Jordan and Bird averaged a 26-8-7 with at least 2.5 steals/blocks in a single season. (Steals and blocks were not recorded when Robertson and John Havlicek met the standard).</p>
<p>And only James did it during a season in which he led his team to a championship.</p>
<p>In fact, only 10 players have won MVP and Finals MVP in the same season: Jordan (four times), James (twice), Abdul-Jabbar, Bird, Duncan, O’Neal, Magic Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Moses Malone and Willis Reed. James was the regular-season MVP both times Bryant won Finals MVP, including the 2009 season.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>Clutch gene</p>
<p>Reputation rates Bryant as more clutch, given the mythology surrounding his Mamba Mentality and the notion that James wilted in big moments for much of his career. There is no evidence to support this.</p>
<p>Bryant averaged 25.3 points (50.7 TS%), 5.7 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.7 blocks/steals in 37 games across seven Finals bids, logging a 5-2 record (lost to the 2004 Pistons and 2008 Celtics). Meanwhile, James has averaged 28.2 points (55.1 TS%), 10 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 2.6 steals/blocks in 49 games over nine Finals, finishing 3-6 (three losses to the Warriors, two to the Spurs and one to the Mavericks).</p>
<p>In eight advance-or-go-home games in his playoff career, including a pair of Finals Game 7s, James has averaged 34.9 points (59.9 TS%), 9.9 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.6 blocks/steals, posting a 6-2 record. In a 95-88 win over the Spurs in Game 7 of the 2013 Finals, James scored 37 points on 12-for-23 shooting, adding 12 rebounds, four assists and two steals. And in a 93-89 victory against the Warriors in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals, he posted 27 points (9-24 FG), 11 rebounds, 11 assists, three blocks and two steals.</p>
<p>Bryant finished 5-5 in 10 career advance-or-go-home playoff games, averaging 23.5 points (47.4 TS%), 7.8 rebounds, four assists and 2.7 blocks/steals. He played in one Finals Game 7, scoring 23 points on 6-for-24 shooting, willing 15 rebounds and adding two assists and a steal in an 83-79 win over the Celtics in 2010.</p>
<p>James is 10-for-25 (40 percent) in the playoffs on shots attempted when tied or trailing by two points or fewer in the final 24 seconds. Bryant was 7-for-28 (25 percent). James is 12-for-23 (52 percent) on playoff game-tying or go-ahead field goals with less than 10 seconds left. Bryant was 5-for-22 (23 percent). James has made five buzzer-beating game-winners in his playoff career. Bryant made one. This is not close.</p>
<p>James detractors will point to his relative disappearance in the 2007 and 2011 Finals or the 2010 Eastern Conference finals that he mailed in as examples of his inability to perform in the clutch. They rarely mention Bryant’s equally troubling numbers in the 2000 and 2004 Finals or how he quit in Game 7 of a first-round series loss to the Phoenix Suns in 2006. We can cherry pick narratives, but the evidence is the evidence.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>• Bryant: Five-time NBA champion (2x Finals MVP); 2008 Most Valuable Player; 15-time All-NBA selection (11x First Team, 2x Second team); 18-time All-Star (4x All-Star Game MVP); 12-time All-Defensive selection (9x First Team); two-time scoring champion; 1997 slam dunk champion; two-time Olympic gold medalist</p>
<p>• James: Three-time NBA champion (3x Finals MVP); four-time Most Valuable Player; 15-time All-NBA selection (12x First Team, 2x Second Team); 16-time All-Star (3x All-Star Game MVP); six-time All-Defensive selection (5x First Team); 2008 scoring champion; 2004 Rookie of the Year; two-time Olympic gold medalist</p>
<p>This is the question of all questions when it comes to NBA royalty. Would you rather have Bryant’s two additional rings on display or James’ extra Finals MVP and three additional regular-season MVPs in the trophy case? Nothing else really matters in this conversation, although a slam dunk title is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Bryant collected a fistful of rings. On the other, James was the best player on all three of his title-winning teams to Bryant’s two of five. Who knows how many championships James may have won had he played alongside some equivalent of prime O’Neal in the early stages of his career. He also chased rings with Wade and Bosh in Miami and returned to a Cleveland situation with Irving and Love awaiting.</p>
<p>Were those triumvirates greater than the collection of Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Lamar Odom and Metta World Peace that surrounded Bryant for his 2009 and 2010 title runs? Regardless of how you answer that question, there is no doubt James’ effort in the 3-1 comeback against a 73-win Warriors team in the 2016 Finals is more impressive than anything Bryant accomplished in any of his seven Finals appearances.</p>
<p>You could argue Ray Allen’s three-pointer in Game 6 of the 2013 Finals and Irving’s in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals saved James from a 1-8 Finals record. But Bryant also benefited from Robert Horry’s winner in Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference finals, several blown chances by Orlando in the 2009 Finals and World Peace’s dagger in Game 7 of the 2010 Finals, not to mention the fact he was on the winning side of two of the most controversially officiated games in NBA playoff history. Legacies can hinge on makes or misses.</p>
<p>The matter of hardware comes down to opinion. James’ four regular-season MVP trophies can be pointed to as evidence he was the league’s best player for a longer stretch than Bryant, just as we can argue his three Finals MVPs make him more valuable in capturing his rings than Bryant was to collecting his. But the ultimate goal is winning, and I think I would rather point to five Larry O’Brien trophies, two Finals MVPs and a single regular-season MVP as hard evidence of greater team success in what is at its heart a team sport.</p>
<p>Advantage: Bryant</p>
<p>For the culture</p>
<p>The question at the core of this category may be harder to answer. It is certainly more serious.</p>
<p>James has surpassed all expectations since emerging as a can’t-miss prospect out of high school and overcame the public-relations nightmare of “The Decision” to become one of the most respected figures in NBA history among his peers (Paul Pierce excluded). As the face of the NBA’s player empowerment era, he has reshaped the league in his own image, and his foundation’s I Promise School is a model for superstars to follow in serving their communities. James is the voice of this NBA generation both on and off the court.</p>
<p>He is also well on his way to building a billion-dollar brand. In addition to his playing career earnings and endorsement deals, James has made lucrative investments in Beats By Dre, Blaze Pizza and Liverpool F.C., among others, and established himself as an entertainment mogul. He will star in “Space Jam 2,” co-starred in the hit comedy “Trainwreck,” and his production company has launched a number of television and documentary series, including HBO’s “The Shop,” on which he regularly contributes to the discussion.</p>
<p>Bryant has him trumped there, given the Academy Award he won for the animated short on his 2016 retirement letter, “Dear Basketball.” He also developed the “Detail” series for ESPN after experimenting with “Musecage.” Likewise, Bryant developed a series of children’s books and podcasts that demonstrated his willingness to take artistic storytelling risks, even if they all fell short of his first post-basketball project.</p>
<p>He was on his way to forging another admirable career when he died in a helicopter crash that also claimed the lives of his daughter Gianna and seven others traveling to a youth basketball tournament at Bryant’s Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks, Calif. His death was felt the world over, as shocking as any in recent memory, a testament to his cultural impact. Athletes across the globe shared stories of his mentorship and inspiration. Parents shed tears for a man who died carrying out his daughter’s dreams. L.A. worshiped him.</p>
<p>As incredibly powerful as the joy he brought to so many in life was, Bryant left behind a legacy that also included a brutal sexual assault allegation in the summer of 2003. Criminal charges were later dropped, but he acknowledged publicly, “I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.” As I have written in this space before, culturally speaking — in any manner of speaking — that is reprehensible.</p>
<p>Even if we limit this conversation solely to their impact on basketball culture, I think we have to consider James has had a broader impact on shaping the sport, for better or worse. What Bryant’s mentality did to inspire this generation of rising NBA talent, just as Jordan did before, James is doing in a manner all his own — from his selfless style of play to his commitment to preserving his body to taking ownership of his career to brand-building and leveraging his stardom to serve his community beyond the next generation.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>THE DAGGER: LeBron James has had the better career.</p>

<h3 id="a-look-back-at-gilbert-arenas-and-his-career-with-the-warriors">&ldquo;A look back at Gilbert Arenas and his career with the Warriors&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://usatwarriorswire.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ap_03030902557.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
Before Gilbert Arenas became a star with the Washington Wizards, he was an up-and-coming player hooping in the Bay.</p>
<p>Arenas was drafted No. 31 overall by the Golden State Warriors in the second round of the 2001 NBA Draft, and he played his first two seasons with the franchise. A guard out of Arizona, Arenas displayed his penchant for scoring in college. In two seasons with the Wildcats, he averaged 15.8 points per game on 46.6% shooting.</p>
<p>The first two seasons of Arenas’ career were filled with promise. During the 2001-02 campaign, his rookie season, Arenas ranked fourth among rookies in points per game (10.9), with his teammate Jason Richardson ahead of him at third.</p>
<p>With his passing ability, Arenas ranked third among rookies in assists per game (3.7), with only Jamaal Tinsley and Tony Parker ahead of him.</p>
<p>The following season, Arenas continued to build his reputation around the league. During his sophomore campaign, Arenas was second on the Warriors in scoring behind Antawn Jamison.</p>
<p>He was second among sophomores in points per game (18.3), right behind Pau Gasol. Arenas won the Most Improved Player award in 2003, and he was second among second-year players in assists per game (6.3), only behind Tinsley.</p>
<p>Arenas had one of the best performances of his career during March 2003, when he dropped 41 points, grabbed six rebounds and dished five assists in a win against the Wizards.</p>
<p>Throughout most of his career, Arenas could drive through the lane and finish at the rim. But he could also size up an opponent, create space with his dribble and pull up for a smooth jumper.</p>
<p>His moves were made with purpose, and once he created the space he needed, he usually scored. Arenas’ scoring peaked with the Wizards, and he earned all three of his All-Star appearances with the franchise.</p>
<p>He signed with the Wizards in the summer of 2003, as the Warriors couldn’t match the offer sheet Washington gave him. Arenas was a restricted free agent early in his career because he wasn’t on a rookie scale contract; only first-round picks qualify for those.</p>
<p>Because of this, the NBA made a provision that limits the amount of money teams can offer restricted free agents who only have one or two years of experience, per Hoops Rumors. With the provision, teams cannot offer a first-year salary higher than the non-taxpayer mid-level exception.</p>
<p>Arenas’ career with the Wizards was stellar. He had his best overall season during the 2005-06 campaign, when he scored a career-high 29.3 points per game and dished 6.1 assists a game. That season, he ranked fourth in the league for scoring, with the late Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson and LeBron James ahead of him.</p>
<p>Knee injuries and the gun incident with Javaris Crittenton unfortunately shortened Arenas’ career, but his standing in the Wizards’ record books remains high.</p>
<p>Per Basketball Reference, Arenas ranks 10th all-time in points on the franchise’s all-time leading scorers list. He ranks seventh on the list in assists.
