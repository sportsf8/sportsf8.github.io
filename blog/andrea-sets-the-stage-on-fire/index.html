<p>Pau Gasol entered the NBA in 2001 from Spain. He was the third overall pick in the 2001 draft by the Atlanta Hawks and then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
<p>Since then, Gasol has won two NBA championships and made $220,990,766 through NBA contracts, per Spotrac.</p>
<p>The first NBA contract Pau Gasol signed was his rookie deal with the Grizzlies. It was a three-year, $8.78 million contract. Gasol made $2,970,840 during his rookie season while averaging 17.6 points and 8.9 rebounds. He won the Rookie of the Year Award.</p>
<p>In his second season, Gasol averaged 19.0 points and 8.8 boards. He earned $3,193,680. It appeared the Spaniard was going to be an All-Star fairly soon for the Grizzlies.</p>
<p>With that said, it was a no brainer for Memphis to exercise Gasol’s third-year option worth $2,618,395. Pau averaged 17.7 points and 7.7 rebounds in 2003-04.</p>
<p>In September of 2004, the Grizzlies rewarded Pau Gasol for his stellar play in his first three years in the NBA by signing him to a six-year, $86.5 million rookie extension. The contract was set to kick in during the 2005-06 season but Gasol and the Grizzlies couldn’t skip past the 2004-05 campaign.</p>
<p>While making $4,318,481, Gasol averaged 17.8 points and 7.3 rebounds in 2004-05. He finally made his first All-Star team in 2005-06. That was a good year for Pau. He made $10,993,000 from the Grizzlies and put up 20.4 points and 8.9 boards.</p>
<p>He wasn’t going to win a title in Memphis but Gasol was showcasing his skills for other teams, one of those teams being the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
<p>In February of 2008, the Lakers acquired Pau Gasol from the Grizzlies, giving Kobe Bryant the second star he needed to win a championship. Gasol made $13,735,000 in 2007-08 and put up 18.8 points and 7.8 rebounds in 27 games with the Lakers following his trade from Memphis.</p>
<p>In his first full season with Los Angeles, Gasol made $15,106,000 and finished the regular season with averages of 18.9 points and 9.6 rebounds. The Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in the 2009 Finals to give Kobe his fourth championship and Pau his first.</p>
<p>In December of 2009, the Lakers signed Gasol to a three-year, $57 million veteran extension. Bryant and Pau repeated as champions in 2010 by taking down the Boston Celtics in seven games. Pau made $16,452,000 during the 2009-10 season.</p>
<p>After the Lakers won the title in 2010, though, things began to change in Los Angeles. Pau Gasol ended up leaving the Lakers in the summer of 2014 as a free agent to sign with the Chicago Bulls. He signed a three-year, $22.3 million deal with the Bulls.</p>
<p>During the 2014-15 season, Gasol made $7,128,000 and helped the Bulls get to the second round of the playoffs. He made the All-Star team as well and finished the season with averages of 18.5 points and 11.8 rebounds.</p>
<p>The future Hall of Famer made $7,448,760 in his second and final year with the Bulls. Gasol decided to decline his 2016-17 player-option with Chicago and resume his playing career with the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>Pau Gasol signed a two-year, $31.7 million contract with the Spurs in the summer of 2016. He made $15,500,000 during the 2016-17 season and averaged 12.4 points and 7.8 rebounds in 64 games.</p>
<p>The following season, Gasol put up 10.1 points and 8.0 boards while making $16 million.</p>
<p>The 2018-19 season was a tough one for Gasol. He appeared in just 30 games with the Spurs and Milwaukee Bucks. San Antonio waived Pau in March of 2019, allowing him to sign with a contender such as the Bucks. The man they used to call the Meal Ticket only played in three games with Milwaukee before his foot injury started acting up again.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2019, Pau Gasol signed with the Portland Trail Blazers on a one-year deal worth $2.56 million. However, he was never able to recover from the same foot injury which haunted him in San Antonio and Milwaukee and was waived by the Blazers in November.</p>
<p>Pau Gasol has career NBA averages of 17.0 points and 9.2 rebounds. He will be a future Hall-of-Famer one day but hopefully, Gasol can play one more season before calling it quits.

<p><img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pau-4-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
If Pau Gasol’s NBA career is over, then he’s had one helluva run. The Spaniard not only won two championships and cemented himself as a Hall of Famer, but Gasol also made a ton of money during his playing career.</p>
<p>Per Spotrac, Pau made $220,990,766 in NBA money during his legendary pro career. Gasol entered the league with the Memphis Grizzlies in 2001. He made $2,970,840 during his debut season and finished as the Rookie of the Year. Gasol averaged 17.6 points and 8.9 rebounds.</p>
<p>In his second season, Pau Gasol earned $3,193,680. He completed his rookie contract with the Grizzlies by making $2,618,395 in Year 3 and $4,318,481 in Year 4. Memphis signed Gasol to a rookie-scale extension before Year 4, giving Pau a six-year, $86.5 million deal.</p>
<p>Gasol’s extension kicked in during the 2005-06 season. The talented big man made $10,993,000 and put up 20.4 points and 8.9 boards. Pau played in his first All-Star game as well.</p>
<p>The 2006-07 campaign was Pau Gasol’s final full season with the Grizzlies. He earned $12,364,000. The following season, Memphis traded Gasol to the Los Angeles Lakers in February of 2008. Pau made $13,735,000 in 2007-08 and averaged 18.8 points and 7.8 rebounds in 27 games with the Lakers following his trade from the Grizzlies.</p>
<p>Pau Gasol’s first full season with the Lakers was special. He not only made $15,106,000, but Pau also won his first NBA title in 2009 after the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic in five games. Los Angeles rewarded Gasol with a three-year, $57 million veteran extension in December 2009. Pau made $16,452,000 in 2009-10 and helped the Lakers win the championship again, this time over the Boston Celtics.</p>
<p>During the 2010-11 season, Gasol made $17,823,000. He played three more years with the Lakers after the 2010-11 campaign. Pau earned $15,062,609 in 2011-12, $19 million in 2012-13 and $19,285,850 in 2013-14.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2014, Pau Gasol signed a three-year, $22.3 million free-agent deal with the Chicago Bulls. During the 2014-15 season, Gasol made $7,128,000 and averaged 18.5 points and 11.8 rebounds. He played one more season in Chicago before leaving the Windy City in the summer of 2016. Pau made $7,448,760 from the Bulls during the 2015-16 campaign.</p>
<p>Gasol signed a two-year, $31.7 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs following his Bulls stint. He made $15.5 million during the 2016-17 season and put 12.4 points and 7.8 rebounds in 64 regular-season games. The following season, Gasol averaged 10.1 points and 8.0 boards while making $16 million after signing a new three-year, $48.8 million contract with the Spurs.</p>
<p>In 2018-19, Pau Gasol split time between the Spurs and Milwaukee Bucks. He was waived by San Antonio and signed with the Bucks in March of 2019 for $527,467. However, Gasol only played in three games with Milwaukee before his foot injury started acting up.</p>
<p>The last NBA contract Gasol signed was a one-year, $2.56 million deal with the Portland Trail Blazers in the summer of 2019. Unfortunately, Pau wasn’t able to play with Portland because his foot never properly healed.

<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200502151911/1929b6bb-127c-4602-840c-541a83fbf74e-large16x9_58.jpg" alt="img">
Pau Gasol and Kobe Bryant had a very special relationship. The two won championships together in 2009 and 2010 for the Los Angeles Lakers. Gasol moved to Lakers from Memphis in 2008. He had all the trademarks of being a remarkable player: third draft pick overall, first non-American Rookie of the Year in 2002, and more. He formed the core of the team. However, the team wasn’t a winning one and Kobe decided to call him to Lakers, thus shifting the paradigm of his career.</p>
<p>Gasol Celebrates Anniversary of Vanessa and Kobe Bryant</p>
<p>Even after the untimely death of Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol continues to honor the friendship that the two shared. He often goes to interviews to talk about Kobe, his work ethics, and how he influenced him as a player. More importantly, he is looking out for Vanessa Bryant and her family.</p>
<p>On the couple’s anniversary, Gasol sent flowers to Vanessa, something she posted on her Instagram.</p>
<p>Pau Gasol Misses Gigi</p>
<p>Later today, Vanessa Bryant took onto Instagram to celebrate Gigi’s birthday. She asked her followers to spread love and wear her trademark red band as tribute. Later, in one of her Instagram stories, she revealed that Gasol and his wife sent her a beautiful birthday cake to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>.@paugasol and his wife, Cat, sent the Bryant family a cake for Gigi&rsquo;s 14th birthday 💛💜 (via Vanessa Bryant/Instagram) pic.twitter.com/sEyHl1FLtK — ESPN (@espn) May 1, 2020</p>
<p>He also participated in Vanessa Bryant’s request to wear the red band and posted this photo on his Twitter. Something special, indeed.</p>
<p>The gesture might be small, but it shows how much Kobe Bryant could touch the lives of his teammates, including Gasol. As a leader, he was extremely competitive, always pushing everyone to do more and do better. His untimely death has left a big void for not just his friends and family, but also for all his fans, who he inspired with his determination.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant’s death has created a void which shall never be filled. He was something else altogether with his Mamba attitude, his love for his family and his strife for perfection. This week’s episode of Michael Jordan’s The Last Dance documentary is rumored to be dedicated to him. It will surely bring back a pool of emotions, whenever it is aired.

<h3 id="marc-gasols-nba-contracts">&ldquo;Marc Gasol’s NBA contracts&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/marc2-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
Marc Gasol was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2007 NBA Draft. However, the Spaniard didn’t make his NBA debut until the 2008-09 season. Moreover, he wasn’t with the Lakers either, as Los Angeles traded Gasol to the Memphis Grizzlies in January of 2008 for none other than his brother, Pau Gasol.</p>
<p>In July of 2008, Marc signed a three-year, $9.8 million rookie contract with the Grizzlies. He made $3,093,333 during his rookie season while averaging 11.9 points and 7.4 rebounds. He made the All-Rookie team as well.</p>
<p>In his second year in the NBA, Marc Gasol put up 14.6 points and 9.3 boards per game. He earned $3,240,000 and, suddenly, the Grizzlies had another Gasol leading the franchise.</p>
<p>Pau, of course, was a star for Memphis before getting traded to the Lakers.</p>
<p>Marc made $3,480,000 during his third season. He averaged 11.7 points and 7.0 rebounds and was all set to enter restricted free agency. However, the 2011-12 season was the lockout year, so Gasol couldn’t sign his contract until December of 2011. He wound up agreeing to a four-year, $57.5 million contract with the Grizzlies before the start of the 2011-12 campaign.</p>
<p>Gasol averaged 14.6 points and 8.9 rebounds in the lockout year and made his first All-Star team. He also earned $10,400,790.</p>
<p>In 2012-13, Marc Gasol won the Defensive Player of the Year Award. He made $13,891,359 that year and finished the regular season with averages of 14.1 points, 7.8 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.7 blocks. The Grizzlies won 56 games and got all the way to the Western Conference Finals, where they got swept by Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
<p>After his 2011 extension ended with the Grizzlies, Gasol signed a five-year, $113.2 million contract with Memphis in the summer of 2015. He made $19,689,000 during the 2015-16 season while averaging 16.6 points and 7.0 boards.</p>
<p>Marc then earned $21,165,675 in 2016-17 and $22,642,350 in 2017-18, which wound up being his last full season with the Grizzlies.</p>
<p>During the 2018-19 season, Marc Gasol was traded from Memphis to the Toronto Raptors. He made $15,534,287 from the Grizzlies and $8,584,738 from the Raptors.</p>
<p>Toronto won the 2019 championship over the Golden State Warriors in six games, so the trade worked out great for Gasol even though he never wanted to leave Memphis.</p>
<p>After winning the title, Marc Gasol exercised his $25,595,700 player option for the 2019-20 season. He was averaging 7.6 points and 6.3 rebounds for the Raptors before games were suspended due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Gasol becomes an unrestricted free agent whenever the 2020 offseason period begins. He’s made $178,007,443 through NBA contracts in his career, per Spotrac.

<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G02IgGjRP4ajdNQxnbzmOGWWdEM=/579x308:2561x1346/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19983686/usa_today_13580963.jpg" alt="img">
It is one of the most famous dunk attempts in Memphis Grizzlies history.</p>
<p>And it missed. But the assault on the rim never should’ve happened in the first place.</p>
<p>So it has gone for the young basketball career of Ja Morant. An audacious, angry declaration of war against all those that doubted him dating back to the days of playing in the side gym at AAU tournaments. All along, his belief in himself never waned. From the backyard court at home in South Carolina to the NBA hardwood and everywhere in between, Ja has proven that just because his story started out in the shadows that doesn’t mean that is is how it would end. Ja Morant would not be denied. And now there’s a Rookie of the Year out of South Carolina, just as everyone predicted.</p>
<p>It just isn’t the one folks expected.</p>
<p>So when Ja rose up on Kevin Love, it wasn’t out of character for him. And the city of Memphis loved him for it. For even though it goes down in the record books as a missed dunk attempt, it is much more than that. It is a symbol of an attitude that personifies Morant’s new home.</p>
<p>A ruthless refusal to accept the hand they are dealt. That describes an underdog. That describes Ja Morant. And that describes Memphis.</p>
<p>It is one of the most famous images in Memphis Grizzlies history.</p>
<p>And it had nothing to do with basketball. But the moment between a young man and his hero never should have happened in the first place.</p>
<p>Zach Randolph, upon his arrival in Memphis back in 2009, would not have been called a hero by very many folks. His “Jail Blazer” reputation preceded him - he was troubled, and despite his elite basketball skill he carried quite a bit of baggage to the Bluff City. But over time, slowly but surely that all eroded away. The beauty of this process was, while Zach certainly shined on the court and helped bring on the greatest era in Memphis Grizzlies basketball, it was his actions off of it that solidified the legend of Z-Bo.</p>
<p>The donations to keep heat and electricity running in houses. The holiday meals and gifts that were paid for. The compassion and emotional investment all across the areas of Memphis that needed that attention the most. Zach understood what those that were struggling were going through, and he stood as a shining example to aspire to. You can learn, and grow, and change for good. Your past does not have to determine your future.</p>
<p>So when Zach made a point to return the love that was being shown to him by a fan in such a meaningful way, it wasn’t out of character for him. And the city of Memphis loved him for it. For even though Zach Randolph to some will always be viewed in a negative light, in Memphis he is not just a basketball player. He is much more than that - he is a civic icon. A success story of the highest caliber. A person that made the most of his given abilities and rose above what he was to become something more, all while reaching out to help others along the way.</p>
<p>It doesn’t get more Memphis than that.</p>
<p>It was one of the most famous names in Memphis Grizzlies history.</p>
<p>And it had nothing to do with what Marc Gasol contributed to it. It held that status before Marc arrived - his brother Pau Gasol, who was coincidentally involved in the trade, was the greatest player in Grizzlies history to that point. But Pau and Memphis had fallen out of love, and it was time for the elder Gasol brother to move on. Not many people expected very much from Marc, as was evident in the reactions to the trade when it went down.</p>
<p>All Marc did was become the most highly acclaimed Grizzlies player in history. Which is quite impressive, when you consider what Memphians saw him as when he returned to the city.</p>
<p>He was Pau’s little brother. The chunky kid that was called the “big burrito” at Lausanne, who grew up in Memphis not once but twice. He was a teenager the first time, watching his brother and the Grizzlies labor in the Pyramid and then FedExForum. He left for Europe and upon his return to the city transformed who he was, and what the perception of him would be. He was always skilled, but he became a focal point of scheme and game plans. He was always smart, but his basketball mind became the stuff of NBA Twitter/blog legend. He was always a Gasol, but he stepped out of the Pau shadow during his time as a Grizzly.</p>
<p>He made the Gasol name his - at least in Memphis.</p>
<p>So when Marc chose to stay, and showed disappointment when his time in Memphis came to an end, it wasn’t out of character for him. Because he became a man there. A father, a leader of men, and of the community given his work with St. Jude and other organizations. It was his city and team, which no one would have predicted when he came in that infamous trade with the Los Angeles Lakers. Grit and Grind was inspired by Randolph and Tony Allen, it was guided by Mike Conley, but it was built upon the cornerstone of Marc Gasol. It wasn’t easy - it took work. And time. And he wasn’t able to do it alone.</p>
<p>He needed Memphis. And Memphis needed him. That symbiotic relationship made the fact that it was real - that Marc was a son of the city, one that wanted nothing more but to help build upon what had been built by those before him.</p>
<p>The definition of an underdog, according to Merriam-Webster, is “a loser or predicted loser in a struggle or contest.” The Grizzlies, and their city of Memphis, are the quintessential underdogs. The earliest success for the Grizzlies in the playoffs involved getting swept multiple times. Memphis as a city is more know for its flaws and darkest moments than for all the good that has come from the land just east of Arkansas alongside the Mississippi River. The struggles of Memphis are real - but there are people day in and day out striving to make things better, attention or no attention.</p>
<p>Some of those people have made up the Grizzlies organization since their arrival almost twenty years ago.</p>
<p>From Michael Heisley getting the team there in the first place to John Konchar going from a Mastadon to a presumed Grizzlies full timer next season whenever it begins and everywhere in between, the story of the underdog has defined what being a Memphis Grizzly is. And as Memphis builds a better future for itself through the blue collar mentality that made Zach Randolph so beloved, that underdog philosophy continues to shine. It shined when Three Six Mafia won an Oscar for a song called “It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp”. It shines when Brandon Clarke puts up historic rookie numbers despite tumbling down draft boards almost a year ago.</p>
<p>It shines when a single parent goes to work a second job to try to provide better opportunity for their children, or when those kids get themselves ready to go to school and do their homework despite mom and/or dad not being home. It shines when a nurse works a sixth shift in four days, or a local citizen donates their time or treasure to a local food bank. It is illuminated by the faces of all who give of themselves to not just provide aid their fellow men and women, but literally and figuratively rebuild the city itself. It isn’t heroics - it’s day to day life for many Memphians.</p>
<p>So whether it’s the team first making the playoffs in 2004, 50 wins with the legend Hubie Brown at the helm, Zach Randolph becoming an All-Star in 2010, when the 8-seed Grizzlies upset the 1-seed Spurs in 2011, or the 2019-2020 Grizzlies drastically outperforming expectations, the professional basketball team in Memphis has consistently modeled being the ultimate underdog quite well. That is a reflection of the struggles of their city - no one outside of Memphis expects much from a city with so many holes, or an NBA franchise with such a small market to play in. That suits the Grizzlies and their community just fine. Because it is what drives them. What brings them together.</p>
<p>There is beauty and sort of peace in a common fight, and in a city so often divided in too many ways the unifying force that comes with being counted out so often can make a massive difference. It is part of why the Grizzlies came to Memphis - to provide a new way for Memphians to come together. Some teams and cities can simply judge success in wins and losses. In Memphis, it isn’t that simple.</p>
<p>It’s about moments of impact. Finding a greater purpose and using that energy for the greater good, all while striving for something better. In that pursuit, you find yourself and each other. For close to two decades, the Grizzlies and their Memphis home have gritted their teeth, grinding down that path of progress together. The work is not done - it is a neverending, long, and winding road. The pursuit of that ideal though, with all the obstacles and issues in their way, make for a story worth telling.</p>
<p>It also makes for a city worth fighting - and team worth rooting - for. No matter the odds against them.</p>

Victors are determined decisively on the court, but one great joy of fandom outside the lines has no clear winner. We love to weigh the merits of our favorite players against each other, and yet a taproom full of basketball fans can never unanimously agree on the GOAT. In this series, we attempt to settle scores of NBA undercard debates — or at least give you fodder for your next “Who is better?” argument.</p>
<p>THE MATCHUP: Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James</p>
<p>Prime numbers</p>
<p>Bryant was voted the NBA’s youngest ever All-Star Game starter at age 19 in 1998, when he finished second in the Sixth Man of the Year race, but he was far from a dominant force. He made a leap the next year and another two years after that to emerge a fully realized superstar. We will split the difference for argument’s sake, marking the 1999-2000 campaign as the beginning of his prime. That was his first of 14 straight seasons averaging 20 points, a run that lasted until a torn Achilles expedited his career descent.</p>
<p>From 1999-2013, Bryant averaged 27.8 points (55.6 true shooting percentage), 5.7 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 2.1 combined blocks and steals in 38.8 minutes per game. Excluding the 2011-12 lockout-shortened season, he averaged 76 games per season and never played fewer than 65. During that span, he finished top five in MVP voting 11 times, winning in 2008 and finishing runner-up the following year. He placed top five in Defensive Player of the Year voting on three occasions, peaking with a third-place finish in 2002.</p>
<p>Bryant’s Los Angeles Lakers made the playoffs every year but once in his prime (2004-05), winning five championships in seven trips to the Finals. The Lakers lost three first-round series in that stretch, including a 2013 set when Bryant was nursing his Achilles injury. In that 14-year span, Bryant averaged 27.7 points (54.3 TS%), 5.4 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.1 blocks/steals in 41.5 minutes over 192 playoff games.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Bryant was the best player on two of his five championship teams. In his prime, he never played with more than one active All-Star, sharing the court with Shaquille O’Neal for the first five of those seasons and Pau Gasol the final six. Andrew Bynum and Dwight Howard also made All-Star appearances alongside Bryant.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant vs. LeBron James (Yahoo Sports graphic)</p>
<p>James entered the league as advertised in 2003, averaging a 21-6-6 en route to 2004 Rookie of the Year honors, but he made his leap to superstardom as an NBA sophomore and has remained in his prime since.</p>
<p>From 2004 to the present, James has averaged 27.5 points (59.2 true shooting percentage), 7.6 rebounds, 7.5 assists and 2.4 blocks/steals in 38.3 minutes per game. Excluding the 2011 lockout and the current hiatus, he has averaged 76 games per season and played fewer than 69 just once. On that run, he has 13 top-five MVP finishes, winning four times and placing second twice (with another likely coming this season). He also has a handful of top-five Defensive Player of the Year finishes, peaking at second in 2009 and 2013.</p>
<p>James’ teams have made the playoffs in all but the first and last of his completed prime seasons, winning three titles in nine Finals trips and never losing a first-round series. Over the past 15 years, he has averaged 28.9 points (57.9 TS%), 8.9 boards, 7.1 assists and 2.8 blocks/steals in 42 minutes over 239 playoff games.</p>
<p>James has been the best player on all three of his championship teams. Zydrunas Ilgauskas and Mo Williams each made a single All-Star appearance during James’ first seven seasons on the Cleveland Cavaliers. He joined All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh for four seasons on the Miami Heat before returning to Cleveland, where he teamed with All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love for another four years. He spent last season with a starless team in Los Angeles before luring Anthony Davis to the Lakers.</p>
<p>We will get to the question of how much weight Bryant’s two extra rings carry in comparison to James’ two additional shots at one, and what their supporting casts meant to both, but if you were starting a team with the knowledge of what both would bring to the table statistically for their primes, you would take James and not think twice. He scores as much as Bryant, more efficiently, while owning a sizable edge in almost every other category, and has done it all for two more years and counting. James is a prime numbers god.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>Career high</p>
<p>As we laid out when we pitted him opposite Tim Duncan, Bryant’s career apex depends on your preference. He posted an efficient 30-7-6 for the three-time defending champs as a 24-year-old, one of eight times he made First Team All-NBA and All-Defense. Three years later, he averaged 35.4 points per game, the most since Michael Jordan. Bryant captured his lone MVP award in 2008, and then followed with his sole runner-up MVP finish, avenging the previous year’s Finals loss to Boston and capturing his first O’Neal-less title.</p>
<p>It is that 2008-09 season that struck me as Bryant’s peak. Coming off his contribution to the Redeem Team, a 30-year-old Bryant lifted the Lakers to 65 wins and placed them on the short list of most dominant teams of the past two decades. He finished second in MVP voting to James after winning in 2008, and then added his first Finals MVP award, erasing any doubt he could win a title as his team’s top player and vaulting himself onto the league’s list of immortals. Bryant made First-Team All-NBA and All-Defense again, averaging 26.8 points (56.1 TS%), 5.2 rebounds, 4.9 assists and two blocks/steals in 36.1 minutes a game.</p>
<p>In the 2009 playoffs, Bryant elevated those numbers to 30.2 points (56.4 TS%), 5.5 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 2.6 blocks/steals in 40.9 minutes per game. And in a gentleman’s sweep of the Orlando Magic in the Finals, he averaged a 32-6-7 on 52.5 percent true shooting with three blocks/steals in 44 minutes a night. Bryant won his first of back-to-back Finals MVPs during a string of three straight Finals appearances.</p>
<p>James’ pinnacle is easier to pin down, even if he submitted four MVP campaigns. Coming off his stewardship of the gold medal-winning 2012 U.S. Olympic men’s national team at age 28 in 2012-13, he averaged 26.8 points (64.0 TS%), eight rebounds, 7.3 assists and 2.6 blocks/steals in 37.9 minutes per game. He received all but one of 121 first-place MVP votes and finished a close second to Marc Gasol in the Defensive Player of the Year voting, as his Heat won 66 regular-season games, including 27 straight.</p>
<p>In the 2013 playoffs, James averaged 25.9 points (58.5 TS%), 8.4 rebounds, 6.6 assists and 2.6 blocks/steals in 41.7 minutes per game. And in the seven-game barnburner against Duncan’s San Antonio Spurs dynasty in the Finals, James averaged a 25-11-7 on 52.9 true shooting with three blocks/steals in 43 minutes a night. He won his second of three Finals MVPs en route to eight straight Finals appearances.</p>
<p>Players with the same regular-season stat line (or better) as Bryant’s most complete campaign: James Harden, Michael Jordan, Tracy McGrady, Kevin Durant, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Stephen Curry, Larry Bird, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Clyde Drexler, Kawhi Leonard, Wade and James &hellip; seven times. Bryant’s was the least efficient scoring season of the bunch, and yet it was among the most efficient of his career. James has not had a season as inefficient since he turned 23 years old.</p>
<p>Players who posted the same stat line as James at his best: LeBron James. Even removing true shooting percentage from the equation, only Jordan and Bird averaged a 26-8-7 with at least 2.5 steals/blocks in a single season. (Steals and blocks were not recorded when Robertson and John Havlicek met the standard).</p>
<p>And only James did it during a season in which he led his team to a championship.</p>
<p>In fact, only 10 players have won MVP and Finals MVP in the same season: Jordan (four times), James (twice), Abdul-Jabbar, Bird, Duncan, O’Neal, Magic Johnson, Hakeem Olajuwon, Moses Malone and Willis Reed. James was the regular-season MVP both times Bryant won Finals MVP, including the 2009 season.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>Clutch gene</p>
<p>Reputation rates Bryant as more clutch, given the mythology surrounding his Mamba Mentality and the notion that James wilted in big moments for much of his career. There is no evidence to support this.</p>
<p>Bryant averaged 25.3 points (50.7 TS%), 5.7 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.7 blocks/steals in 37 games across seven Finals bids, logging a 5-2 record (lost to the 2004 Pistons and 2008 Celtics). Meanwhile, James has averaged 28.2 points (55.1 TS%), 10 rebounds, 7.7 assists and 2.6 steals/blocks in 49 games over nine Finals, finishing 3-6 (three losses to the Warriors, two to the Spurs and one to the Mavericks).</p>
<p>In eight advance-or-go-home games in his playoff career, including a pair of Finals Game 7s, James has averaged 34.9 points (59.9 TS%), 9.9 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.6 blocks/steals, posting a 6-2 record. In a 95-88 win over the Spurs in Game 7 of the 2013 Finals, James scored 37 points on 12-for-23 shooting, adding 12 rebounds, four assists and two steals. And in a 93-89 victory against the Warriors in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals, he posted 27 points (9-24 FG), 11 rebounds, 11 assists, three blocks and two steals.</p>
<p>Bryant finished 5-5 in 10 career advance-or-go-home playoff games, averaging 23.5 points (47.4 TS%), 7.8 rebounds, four assists and 2.7 blocks/steals. He played in one Finals Game 7, scoring 23 points on 6-for-24 shooting, willing 15 rebounds and adding two assists and a steal in an 83-79 win over the Celtics in 2010.</p>
<p>James is 10-for-25 (40 percent) in the playoffs on shots attempted when tied or trailing by two points or fewer in the final 24 seconds. Bryant was 7-for-28 (25 percent). James is 12-for-23 (52 percent) on playoff game-tying or go-ahead field goals with less than 10 seconds left. Bryant was 5-for-22 (23 percent). James has made five buzzer-beating game-winners in his playoff career. Bryant made one. This is not close.</p>
<p>James detractors will point to his relative disappearance in the 2007 and 2011 Finals or the 2010 Eastern Conference finals that he mailed in as examples of his inability to perform in the clutch. They rarely mention Bryant’s equally troubling numbers in the 2000 and 2004 Finals or how he quit in Game 7 of a first-round series loss to the Phoenix Suns in 2006. We can cherry pick narratives, but the evidence is the evidence.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>• Bryant: Five-time NBA champion (2x Finals MVP); 2008 Most Valuable Player; 15-time All-NBA selection (11x First Team, 2x Second team); 18-time All-Star (4x All-Star Game MVP); 12-time All-Defensive selection (9x First Team); two-time scoring champion; 1997 slam dunk champion; two-time Olympic gold medalist</p>
<p>• James: Three-time NBA champion (3x Finals MVP); four-time Most Valuable Player; 15-time All-NBA selection (12x First Team, 2x Second Team); 16-time All-Star (3x All-Star Game MVP); six-time All-Defensive selection (5x First Team); 2008 scoring champion; 2004 Rookie of the Year; two-time Olympic gold medalist</p>
<p>This is the question of all questions when it comes to NBA royalty. Would you rather have Bryant’s two additional rings on display or James’ extra Finals MVP and three additional regular-season MVPs in the trophy case? Nothing else really matters in this conversation, although a slam dunk title is pretty sweet.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Bryant collected a fistful of rings. On the other, James was the best player on all three of his title-winning teams to Bryant’s two of five. Who knows how many championships James may have won had he played alongside some equivalent of prime O’Neal in the early stages of his career. He also chased rings with Wade and Bosh in Miami and returned to a Cleveland situation with Irving and Love awaiting.</p>
<p>Were those triumvirates greater than the collection of Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum, Lamar Odom and Metta World Peace that surrounded Bryant for his 2009 and 2010 title runs? Regardless of how you answer that question, there is no doubt James’ effort in the 3-1 comeback against a 73-win Warriors team in the 2016 Finals is more impressive than anything Bryant accomplished in any of his seven Finals appearances.</p>
<p>You could argue Ray Allen’s three-pointer in Game 6 of the 2013 Finals and Irving’s in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals saved James from a 1-8 Finals record. But Bryant also benefited from Robert Horry’s winner in Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference finals, several blown chances by Orlando in the 2009 Finals and World Peace’s dagger in Game 7 of the 2010 Finals, not to mention the fact he was on the winning side of two of the most controversially officiated games in NBA playoff history. Legacies can hinge on makes or misses.</p>
<p>The matter of hardware comes down to opinion. James’ four regular-season MVP trophies can be pointed to as evidence he was the league’s best player for a longer stretch than Bryant, just as we can argue his three Finals MVPs make him more valuable in capturing his rings than Bryant was to collecting his. But the ultimate goal is winning, and I think I would rather point to five Larry O’Brien trophies, two Finals MVPs and a single regular-season MVP as hard evidence of greater team success in what is at its heart a team sport.</p>
<p>Advantage: Bryant</p>
<p>For the culture</p>
<p>The question at the core of this category may be harder to answer. It is certainly more serious.</p>
<p>James has surpassed all expectations since emerging as a can’t-miss prospect out of high school and overcame the public-relations nightmare of “The Decision” to become one of the most respected figures in NBA history among his peers (Paul Pierce excluded). As the face of the NBA’s player empowerment era, he has reshaped the league in his own image, and his foundation’s I Promise School is a model for superstars to follow in serving their communities. James is the voice of this NBA generation both on and off the court.</p>
<p>He is also well on his way to building a billion-dollar brand. In addition to his playing career earnings and endorsement deals, James has made lucrative investments in Beats By Dre, Blaze Pizza and Liverpool F.C., among others, and established himself as an entertainment mogul. He will star in “Space Jam 2,” co-starred in the hit comedy “Trainwreck,” and his production company has launched a number of television and documentary series, including HBO’s “The Shop,” on which he regularly contributes to the discussion.</p>
<p>Bryant has him trumped there, given the Academy Award he won for the animated short on his 2016 retirement letter, “Dear Basketball.” He also developed the “Detail” series for ESPN after experimenting with “Musecage.” Likewise, Bryant developed a series of children’s books and podcasts that demonstrated his willingness to take artistic storytelling risks, even if they all fell short of his first post-basketball project.</p>
<p>He was on his way to forging another admirable career when he died in a helicopter crash that also claimed the lives of his daughter Gianna and seven others traveling to a youth basketball tournament at Bryant’s Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks, Calif. His death was felt the world over, as shocking as any in recent memory, a testament to his cultural impact. Athletes across the globe shared stories of his mentorship and inspiration. Parents shed tears for a man who died carrying out his daughter’s dreams. L.A. worshiped him.</p>
<p>As incredibly powerful as the joy he brought to so many in life was, Bryant left behind a legacy that also included a brutal sexual assault allegation in the summer of 2003. Criminal charges were later dropped, but he acknowledged publicly, “I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.” As I have written in this space before, culturally speaking — in any manner of speaking — that is reprehensible.</p>
<p>Even if we limit this conversation solely to their impact on basketball culture, I think we have to consider James has had a broader impact on shaping the sport, for better or worse. What Bryant’s mentality did to inspire this generation of rising NBA talent, just as Jordan did before, James is doing in a manner all his own — from his selfless style of play to his commitment to preserving his body to taking ownership of his career to brand-building and leveraging his stardom to serve his community beyond the next generation.</p>
<p>Advantage: James</p>
<p>THE DAGGER: LeBron James has had the better career.</p>

<h3 id="a-look-back-at-gilbert-arenas-and-his-career-with-the-warriors">&ldquo;A look back at Gilbert Arenas and his career with the Warriors&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://usatwarriorswire.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/ap_03030902557.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
Before Gilbert Arenas became a star with the Washington Wizards, he was an up-and-coming player hooping in the Bay.</p>
<p>Arenas was drafted No. 31 overall by the Golden State Warriors in the second round of the 2001 NBA Draft, and he played his first two seasons with the franchise. A guard out of Arizona, Arenas displayed his penchant for scoring in college. In two seasons with the Wildcats, he averaged 15.8 points per game on 46.6% shooting.</p>
<p>The first two seasons of Arenas’ career were filled with promise. During the 2001-02 campaign, his rookie season, Arenas ranked fourth among rookies in points per game (10.9), with his teammate Jason Richardson ahead of him at third.</p>
<p>With his passing ability, Arenas ranked third among rookies in assists per game (3.7), with only Jamaal Tinsley and Tony Parker ahead of him.</p>
<p>The following season, Arenas continued to build his reputation around the league. During his sophomore campaign, Arenas was second on the Warriors in scoring behind Antawn Jamison.</p>
<p>He was second among sophomores in points per game (18.3), right behind Pau Gasol. Arenas won the Most Improved Player award in 2003, and he was second among second-year players in assists per game (6.3), only behind Tinsley.</p>
<p>Arenas had one of the best performances of his career during March 2003, when he dropped 41 points, grabbed six rebounds and dished five assists in a win against the Wizards.</p>
<p>Throughout most of his career, Arenas could drive through the lane and finish at the rim. But he could also size up an opponent, create space with his dribble and pull up for a smooth jumper.</p>
<p>His moves were made with purpose, and once he created the space he needed, he usually scored. Arenas’ scoring peaked with the Wizards, and he earned all three of his All-Star appearances with the franchise.</p>
<p>He signed with the Wizards in the summer of 2003, as the Warriors couldn’t match the offer sheet Washington gave him. Arenas was a restricted free agent early in his career because he wasn’t on a rookie scale contract; only first-round picks qualify for those.</p>
<p>Because of this, the NBA made a provision that limits the amount of money teams can offer restricted free agents who only have one or two years of experience, per Hoops Rumors. With the provision, teams cannot offer a first-year salary higher than the non-taxpayer mid-level exception.</p>
<p>Arenas’ career with the Wizards was stellar. He had his best overall season during the 2005-06 campaign, when he scored a career-high 29.3 points per game and dished 6.1 assists a game. That season, he ranked fourth in the league for scoring, with the late Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson and LeBron James ahead of him.</p>
<p>Knee injuries and the gun incident with Javaris Crittenton unfortunately shortened Arenas’ career, but his standing in the Wizards’ record books remains high.</p>
<p>Per Basketball Reference, Arenas ranks 10th all-time in points on the franchise’s all-time leading scorers list. He ranks seventh on the list in assists.
