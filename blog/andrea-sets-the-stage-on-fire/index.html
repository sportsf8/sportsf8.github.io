PODGORICA (Montenegro), May 28 (SeeNews) - Montenegro plans to invest 246 million euro ($273 million) in the construction of a 170 MW hydropower plant (HPP) on Komarnica river, the ministry of sustainable development said.</p>
<p>The construction of the hydropower plant in Montenegro&rsquo;s north is expected to take five years to complete, the ministry said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Montenegrin government has adopted a detailed spatial plan for the multipurpose water reservoir on the Komarnica river and plans to develop a strategic environmental assessment of the project, the head of the directorate for spatial planning at the ministry, Marina Izgarevic Pavicevic, said in the statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the preparation of the detailed spatial plan, all international regulations, agreements and conventions were respected, regulations in the field of infrastructure, regulations related to cultural heritage, environment, etc. were respected,&rdquo; Izgarevic Pavicevic said.</p>
<p>The plan also complies with the recommendations of the government of neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, she added.</p>
<p>The Komarnica hydropower project was initiated in the 1980s. Since then, research work needed to obtain data for the planned implementation of the project has been carried out by several regional companies. The power plant is expected to produce 200 GWh of electricity per year.</p>
<p>($ = 0.900868 euro)

<h3 id="family-members-concerned-after-246-cases-of-covid-19-at-greensville-correctional-center">&ldquo;Family members concerned after 246 cases of COVID-19 at Greensville Correctional Center&rdquo;</h3>

GREENSVILLE COUNTY, Va. &ndash; According to the Virginia Department of Corrections (DOC), approximately 29,000 inmates have been tested for COVID-19 statewide. But CBS 6 has received dozens of emails from family members concerned by the conditions that COVID-19 patients are living in at Greensville Correctional Center.</p>
<p>Damisha Perry said that her cousin is COVID-19 positive and locked behind bars at the Greensville Correctional Center in Southern Virginia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nightmare that hasn&rsquo;t ended yet,&rdquo; Perry said. &ldquo;He informed us they are quarantined with other sick inmates, two to a cell, and they don&rsquo;t feel like they&rsquo;re going to thrive let alone survive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perry learned about her loved one&rsquo;s condition six days ago.</p>
<p>The DOC reports nearly 3,000 inmates and staff were tested last week at the prison, through what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Point Prevalence Testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The process involves testing asymptomatic offenders, which allows positive cases to be discovered and therefore treated sooner. As of Thursday, 193 inmates and 53 staff members tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Prior to testing, only two inmates had symptoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We care for inmates. Inmates are still people, they are still human beings! Help them,&rdquo; wrote Asharma Rives in another letter recieved by CBS 6.</p>
<p>Other letters claim that the correctional center has refused to give wellness updates on prisoners to their family members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we call Greensville they won’t give us a wellness check,&rdquo; Wrote LeTai Saunders. &ldquo;Please help me I’ve lost both my parents and I don’t want to lose my youngest brother in prison dying from the Coronavirus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just want an explanation as to how they came in contact with the virus and why aren&rsquo;t they receiving any medical treatment,&rdquo; Perry added.</p>
<p>The DOC said medical staff are working around the clock to test and provide care to offenders during the pandemic, and that that those who are positive are quarantined, but not housed with inmates who have tested negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inmates, they aren&rsquo;t going anywhere, they&rsquo;re only have contact with each other and the staff, so it&rsquo;s going to be up to them to do something to stop this pandemic inside of their correctional facility,&rdquo; Perry said.</p>
<p>The DOC said it has tested approximately 29,000 offenders state wide and said they will continue to follow CDC guidelines to ensure the safety of everyone in its facilities.</p>

GORDON Ramsay travelled 246 miles back to London from Cornwall after a feud with his neighbours over him relocating to his second home.</p>
<p>The TV chef moved his family to his £4million coastal mansion last month - when people could be fined for any non-essential travel.</p>
<p>10 Gordon Ramsay travels 246 miles back to London after angering Cornwall neighbours by moving to second home in lockdown</p>
<p>The journey between the two is a long slog with 245 miles by road and a five hour car journey.</p>
<p>But Gordon made it back to his London townhouse in Wandsworth this week, where he announced the reopening of his restaurant.</p>
<p>Gordon, 53, kept quiet on how he&rsquo;d made it from A to B but insisted his lockdown experience had been a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo;.</p>

<p>10 Gordon&rsquo;s garden walls revealed he had returned to his London home to prepare for his restaurant opening</p>
<p>10 The distinct brick walls are a feature of his London home</p>
<p>He told fans: &ldquo;Hi guys it&rsquo;s Gordon, I&rsquo;ve got some really exciting news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know this lockdown has been a nightmare for absolutely all of us but, tomorrow at midday we&rsquo;re going to open for an amazing BBQ at The Narrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most amazing burgers, great ice creams, ciders, beers and wines.At midday on Friday. Can&rsquo;t wait to see you. Enjoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New UK Government advice has warned people to &lsquo;stay alert&rsquo; and Boris Johnson announced plans yesterday to slowly ease the lockdown in England – including plans to open pubs and restaurants as well as ditch the two-metre social distancing rule.</p>
<p>Though Gordon insisted his lockdown experience had been a &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo;, he has been spotted on boat trips and bike rides since the Government told Brits to &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Gordon - who owns three Cornish homes - also recently enjoyed a day at the beach on Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The restaurant owner spent time watching the sunset on a dog walk as he admired those having BBQs by the sea amid lockdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful Bank Holiday Weekend,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some of the most gorgeous beaches in the country here. It&rsquo;s so nice to see the kids, kites, dogs, mums and dads, kids in and out the rock pools. It&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As the sun sets it&rsquo;s so nice to see on the beach, swimmers, bbqs, how beautiful. That&rsquo;s what Bank Holiday Weekends should be about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week, Gordon took to the seas after being hounded with complaints over a string of long-distance bike rides in Cornwall.</p>
<p>He goaded his neighbours after going on a &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; cycling trip at his £4million holiday home, telling them: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on an app - don&rsquo;t get your knickers in a twist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve been at war ever since Gordon flouted lockdown rules and fled London to isolate in Cornwall.</p>
<p>One local seethed: &ldquo;Don’t you realise that by doing that you’ve possibly brought the virus with you and because Cornwall is not your main residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you and your family get sick you will place yet more strain on an already fragile infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Over 1200 cops have so far been tested for coronavirus.</p>
<p>While lower rung personnel are the worst affected by the pandemic, it has not spared top officials including IPS. At least seven SHOs have tested positive for COVID-19 while two IPS officers - Additional DCP of Shahdara and a DCP of North Delhi - have contracted the disease.</p>
<p>On the questions being raised about a high number of infection among the cops, senior officials said they work on the ground as front warriors which increases the chances of infection. They are working as per a rotation system and shifts have been fixed so in the case of infection contact tracing becomes easier.</p>
<p>The police department is also taking various measures to strengthen the immune system of cops, including regular Yoga classes and kadha prescribed by AYUSH Ministry.</p>
<p>To deal with the mental challenges, cops are being given counselling sessions by psychologists.</p>
<p>If any personnel tests positive, he or she is given financial assistance of Rs 10,000 immediately from the Delhi Police Welfare Fund while Rs 10 lakh is given in case of death.

 me, it was everything. I was living my best life. When it was done, I realized how much effort it took to just get that hour and a half class, and I was like, “Do I really want to go through all that again just to take this one hour and a half class?” I said to myself, “Yeah, I do. I do want to do this again.” And I never looked back.</p>
<p>MW: It’s amazing you knew at such a young age exactly what you wanted to do. Most six-year-olds wouldn’t have the attention span to move forward in the way that you did. It’s very enterprising.</p>
<p>GUILLEN: I had to grow up really quickly. I was always aware of my surroundings. I knew that my mom was working several jobs just to keep the lights on. Which isn’t to say that I had a horrible childhood. We were poor growing up, but I didn’t know that poor was bad. I was happy because I had found my outlet. I knew that I was in charge of my happiness. You can’t rely on someone else to provide that for you — you have to do it yourself.</p>
<p>I think most kids are sheltered, where they are given that way of life. If you can get that, that’s absolutely great. Nothing against that. But a lot of families, especially people of color, it’s not a luxury you get. I’m glad everything worked out the way it did because it motivated me. A lot of people say, “You’re an overnight success!” But they don’t see the work that’s been put in to come this far.</p>
<p>“Guillermo resonates with people because he represents all of us. We’ve all been at a job where we are underappreciated. We’ve all been in a relationship where we’re giving it our all, and our partners probably have one foot out the door.“</p>
<p>MW: You are very well known in the Latinx community as a spokesperson for MetroPCS.</p>
<p>GUILLEN: I did them in Spanish, yeah. They were national commercials. They had other actors do it in English and then I’d do it in Spanish. We did about 26 commercials. That was a campaign that ran for years. And for years and years anywhere I would go — if there was a Spanish person at a Mexican restaurant, say, or a guy at a taco stand, they’d go “It’s that guy from MetroPCS!” It’s a funny thing about demographics. You can be a pop star from South America, come to the United States and walk around in L.A. and not one person will blink because in this demo that celebrity is not in front of you every day.</p>
<p>But there’s a demographic for everything. If I go to a mall, it’ll be a 14-year old girl who’s like, “Oh my god, I loved you in Eye Candy.” I go to Disneyland and there’ll be little kids that will be like, “Cousin Blobbin!” — calling out the character from The Thundermans, a Nickelodeon show I did. I’ve realized my fan base is, across the board, all over. Different people and backgrounds and languages. It’s fun, because you can tell what really spoke to people when you do the work that you do.</p>
<p>“I was being told, ‘You’re too fat, you’re too brown, you’re too queer.’ I realized, why am I trying to fit a mold to please someone, when I’m my own mold? I’m selling myself. My product is me. My best asset is who I am.“</p>
<p>MW: Who’s your fan base for What We Do in the Shadows?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: What We Do in the Shadows is the first time it’s a mixture of everything. I went to a couple of the Cons, and what was really great was finding Latinos who are into goth and dark, cool comedy. Those kids came forward and said, “I never saw anyone that looked like me on television until I saw you on the show. Now I feel seen.” That really resonated with me because I know exactly what those kids feel like. Growing up, there were no kids on TV at the time that looked like me. As I got older, there was no adolescent that looked like me. There was not a lot of representation for someone that I could relate to, being queer, being plus size, being Latino — all these things mixed into one is a rare formula that you didn’t often see on television. Acting didn’t look like a promising avenue for me because I didn’t see myself. But then I realized that just because you don’t see yourself, doesn’t mean you can’t be the first.</p>
<p>MW: Your character, Guillermo, is a Familiar to a vampire. It’s interesting because his goal is to be turned into a vampire — essentially, he has a death wish. Or maybe it’s better put as an eternal life wish.</p>
<p>GUILLEN: It can be the same thing.</p>
<p>MW: Guillermo allows himself to be the floor mat of his master, yearning just to get a little bit of approval. He really resonates with audiences in a relatable way.</p>
<p>GUILLEN: Guillermo is the only human character. He’s had to deal with human emotions and with human storylines. He doesn’t have that whimsical side, as the vampires do, where anything can happen. He’s not a vampire, so he can’t fly, he can’t transform. And he is still dealing with human emotions, which is why I think Guillermo resonates with people because he represents all of us. We’ve all been at a job where we are underappreciated. We’ve all been in a relationship where we’re giving it our all, and our partners probably have one foot out the door. We’ve all been at points where we set goals for ourselves and keep trying and keep trying but we’re not getting anywhere closer. I’ve had so many people come up and say, “I really want the vampires to be nice to him, I really want him to get what he wants, I really want Guillermo to be happy.” We’re all human, we all root for each other. We are all Guillermos at one point or another.</p>
<p>MW: What do you see of yourself in Guillermo?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: I see myself having the determination that Guillermo has. Even though he’s been [with the vampires] ten years, he’s still determined to become one. But he’s starting to look at things differently. I can relate to that. For the longest time in this industry, I was being told, “You’re too fat, you’re too brown, you’re too queer.” You’re being told that you’re all these things. But the second you realize that the things people say are wrong with you are actually your strengths — the second you realize that — you change your mentality, you change your focus. You start thinking, why am I trying to fit a mold to please someone, when I’m my own mold? I’m selling myself. My product is me. My best asset is who I am. And that’s what I’m selling. It’s my organic self.</p>
<p>MW: The vampires — Nandor, Laszlo, and Nadja — are very funny and very loveable, but they’re also essentially idiots, especially Nandor and Laszlo. They’re full of themselves. Guillermo really puts up with a lot. His patience for what his ultimate goal is seems boundless. He’s waiting for that moment Nandor will turn him, but deep inside he must realize that they’re stringing him along.</p>
<p>GUILLEN: It’s like working for someone who doesn’t know the privilege they have. You’re around them, listening to them bitch and complain about their life when it’s like, “Are you kidding me? You’re a vampire, you can fly, you can live forever. What are you complaining about?” The idea of being patient — it’s actually one thing that I wish I had more of. I have patience, but only to a certain extent. Guillermo has way more patience than I do. But I think his patience is wearing thin.</p>
<p>Slowly this season, he’s starting to have enough. Because, essentially, he’s realizing “Wait a minute, I have power in being myself.” I think this was done in the pilot. Taika Waititi directed a brilliant scene where Guillermo opens the curtain at the end and looks over at the coffin and sees a little bit of light touch the coffin. For a brief second, he forgets the documentary crew is there. He looks up at the camera and the camera catches him thinking what he’s thinking, and then we see his reaction of self-realization and horror in his face. Where it’s like, “No, I’m not doing that.”</p>
<p>MW: It’s a wonderful moment. And a very defining one for the character. He’s evolved from the first season in a very unexpected way. He clearly has an affection for the vampires and works hard to protect them from themselves. Yet deep inner-conflicts have arisen in Guillermo in season two. It’s a great twist for the character and deepens the narrative of the series. Can you talk a little bit about it without giving too much away?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: As an actor, I had no idea we were going down that avenue. They don’t tell the actors ahead of time where the story’s going. We also shoot the series out of order. So, we’ll be shooting episode one and that same week we’ll have to shoot a bit of episode five. They don’t tell us what has happened in between, so when we’re shooting five and we ask, “Why is there a car now, and why is it covered in blood?” the writers won’t tell us what we missed in between episodes. Which makes it hard for the actor, I have to say honestly, because you don’t know exactly what your journey was. You don’t know how you got there. You have to beg them for a little snippet of “Can you at least tell me how we got there?” They’re like, “Let’s just say there was an accident.” It keeps you on your toes and it’s really challenging. But the twist that happened in season one I didn’t see coming. I definitely did not even think of that until we were at the first table read, reading it out loud. We were like, “Whoa, this is happening!”</p>
<p>MW: It’s become a driving mechanism of the narrative. And has afforded Guillermo a lot of power, to which the vampires are totally, stupidly oblivious.</p>
<p>GUILLEN: He may not be immortal, but he is very powerful as a human, just with everyday talents.</p>
<p>MW: Guillermo’s goal is to be undead, to become a vampire. But he doesn’t enjoy killing. He doesn’t want to murder people. He hates finding virgin victims for his master to feed on.</p>
<p>GUILLEN: Yeah, he doesn’t love parts of his job where he has to find victims. He is human — and he has feelings and a conscience and regrets. He’s still dealing with those everyday issues that he has to put up with when requested to do the things that are in his work requirements. But he doesn’t want to do them. He’s a softy.</p>
<p>But he does want to be a vampire, which is a contradiction. I feel the angle Guillermo’s coming from is that he didn’t have a great time as an adolescent. He spent a lot of time by himself, probably. He fell in love with this world of vampires because it was so romanticizing. It was sexy, it was badass, it was cool. They get to fly. They wear cool garments. He fell in love with the whole package of living this life because that life is different than the life that Guillermo was dealt. We don’t know what his backstory is — we haven’t seen it yet — but, I, as the actor, made that decision to think his life wasn’t amazing. So the reason he wants to become a vampire is basically because he wants to escape into that world. In a weird way, Taika and Jemaine created a character that’s perfectly aligned with my personal life. I didn’t see representation on screen and wanted to live in that world. You asked me about similarities. I guess Guillermo and I are very similar in that way.</p>
<p>MW: I’m assuming all the filming was completed before the pandemic hit?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: Yeah, the only thing left on season two is ADR — Automated Dialog Replacement. ADR is what we do when, let’s say, a plane flew over the set during a scene and they didn’t get a clear sound of what you said. Normally, you’d go back into a studio and they play back that scene and you try to match the audio. Because of the pandemic, I’ve been doing it in a closet, a soundproof area. I still have episodes 9 and 10 to do for this season.</p>
<p>MW: Do you know yet if there’s going to be season three?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: We do not know yet. Also, because of what’s happening, we don’t know what that would look like. I’m hoping to know soon and how we would go forward with that. Right now, I’m doing more voiceover projects that can be done at home. Things like animation. Those are actually still thriving because we can record anywhere that’s quiet and no one will ever know that that cartoon voice was created in a closet.</p>
<p>MW: I’m sure you can’t tell me anything about the final episodes, but can you reveal if things have been set up to lead into a potential season three?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: We have a great cliffhanger for season two. So the possibility of going forward is there, absolutely. The writers have all done an amazing job. In fact, Episode 10 of season two is one of my favorites, if not my favorite. I also loved the mosquito collector’s episode, which was called “The Curse.” I love that we got to do action in the house with Guillermo. That was a lot of stunt training for me. The producers were like, “Okay, we’re going to get you a personal trainer. You’ve got to go to the gym. You’ve got to work on body strength because it’s about stamina.” Doing those takes over and over, running down the stairs, up the stairs, down the stairs, up the stairs, jumping out of windows. I did every stunt that they threw my way. It was a nice challenge as an actor because I don’t get the opportunity often to be an action character.</p>
<p>MW: What does it mean to you to be an out gay actor working in Hollywood, to not have to hide anything?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: I never wanted to start a career pretending. I knew about Rock Hudson, I knew about all those old Hollywood stars living in the closet because mainstream society wouldn’t accept them. I just felt like I needed to be straightforward with who I am. At the end of the day, if that was going to cost me a job then I probably wouldn’t want to be working with you. If me being myself was going to jeopardize the way you see me because you don’t approve of my lifestyle and who I am, then we probably wouldn’t want to work together. And there’s no amount of money that would be worth the uncomfortableness of being around someone who secretly does not approve of me being who I am.</p>
<p>MW: Have you always been out?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: When I was growing up, people who knew that I was queer knew because I had shared that information. We were comfortable enough to talk about it. Again, it’s my life, no one goes around expressing that they’re straight every day. If you’re in my life, we talk about it, and I tell you who I am. I never shied away from it. And I’m always an advocate and a big supporter, but it shouldn’t be the focus of people’s mentality of how to treat someone. That’s always been my thought. You shouldn’t treat me any differently, because I wouldn’t treat you any differently because you’re straight.</p>
<p>I live on the West Coast where it was an easier transition for me. Growing up in high school, my best friend was a gay Vietnamese kid and my two other best friends were a bisexual girl and a lesbian girl. I grew up with the luxury of being surrounded with queerness and embracing it and being told that it was okay to be that. But you get reminded that’s not the case all over the world. There are states where you get treated differently if they even have a hint you might be queer. I didn’t recognize this until filming a movie in a Southern state. I was out in public — and I don’t consider myself extremely flamboyant — and I just felt this sense of “His skin looks different, he doesn’t belong, he’s not our neighbor, he doesn’t live around here, and I think this guy might be queer.” That was the vibe you just got from walking around. I didn’t like that.</p>
<p>There’s kids out there who have to deal with this every day. I just got a message last night from a fan who is trans and is living in quarantine with their homophobic parents. The idea that there’s a kid out there who has to be quarantined with people who tell him every day that transitioning is wrong. He can’t even escape that environment to run out and try to get some fresh air and get away from the house. He’s literally trapped with his family that’s telling him transitioning is wrong. Well, it’s not wrong. It’s his journey and it’s his right. My heart goes out to him. I wrote him a long essay encouraging him to not give up and to know that he gets to choose his family as well, being part of the queer community, and not to let this one-time circumstance determine the rest of his life, because it will get better.</p>
<p>MW: How does it feel to be a role model in that regard?</p>
<p>GUILLEN: I didn’t set out to be a role model. But creating my own path and my own journey has made people latch on and say, “Hey, if that guy can do it, I can do it,” and that’s great. So, if you think you can do it because you see me as an example, then by all means, yes, I’ll be a role model. We all need something to look forward to. We all need something to aspire to. So, I will gladly accept being a role model.</p>
