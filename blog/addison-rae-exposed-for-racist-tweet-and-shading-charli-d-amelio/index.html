<h3 id="comments">comments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Did not expect that from Addison doe&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the way addison immediately made the situation about herself. NO apologize and go. theres no excuse to hate on others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry but yall need to stop defending her- she was 19 and liking comments about a 15 year old child’s appearance and then she bought a mental health card as a excuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obviously if she’s done these things she Isn’t the sweet person u guys say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 and &ldquo;liked by creator&rdquo; really showin EVERYONES true colors 🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If these tiktokers don&rsquo;t stop with these lil quotes- 💀 &ldquo;live learn love&rdquo; remeber when she said &ldquo;hope&rdquo; about everything going on with the blm movement i- 😭🤚</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly why do they always put the &ldquo;I was in a very bad mental space&rdquo; card for their excuse? smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>honestly didn&rsquo;t expect addison to get into this much drama, she seems like this really kind and sweet person and i lowkey liked her</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>edit: y&rsquo;all being really hash to her since she did this, i don&rsquo;t agree with a 19 yo bringing down a 15 yo too but sexualizing her and wanting to cancel her is really bad, she did one bad thing since she got on tiktok and the d&rsquo;amelios forgave her, so like stop, be kind aren&rsquo;t we supposed to change the rest of the year? hating won&rsquo;t do anything and cancel culture is so toxic y&rsquo;all cancel everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That insta post wtf. Why tf is being “pretty” a quality that ppl think should dictate your success. Your work ethic, passion, etc should be dictate that, not if you’re “pretty”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their friendship went down faster than an iphone 6 battery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t be the only one who never liked her because she has this vibe&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>edit: y’all this comment section is ww3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👁👄👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“this isn’t an excuse” …proceeds to give an excuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her pretty privilege is kicking in 😹✨🙈😍

<li>
<p>I knew sumn wasn’t right with Addison she seemed too nice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i knew she was off lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;THIS IS NO EXCUSE! Anyway here&rsquo;s an excuse.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even in quarentine there&rsquo;s drama omg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was just a matter of time🤦🏾‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At literally every week a tiktoker always get exposed for being racist, for saying the n word or other. At his point is at least one tiktoker good ?! 💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if it was the past she still needs to apologise if it was a different tiktoker/celebrity yall would cancel them ASAP have the same energy 🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y&rsquo;all only defending addision because shes pretty no hate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was a grown ass adult hating and shading a child 😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people legit defending her just cause she’s pretty🤦🏻‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>literally i don&rsquo;t like anything about addison she just seems so fake to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everytime there is addison rae drama, addison rae sounds like shes lying everytime she gets to drama in my opinion&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ADDISON RAE IS A RACIST</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their evidence : a 4 year old tweet</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>moral of the story: dont get involved with cancel culture twitter stans 😟</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was a huge idol for me I can’t believe this :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else is excited that aexotiic finally posted??💕</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was lowkey rooting for her she’s kind sweet and looked like a genuine person and she was gorgeous and uplifted body positivity but this- no hunny byeeeee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be honest Charli is the only person on tiktok who hasn’t been racist / caused drama . We Stan

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that addison a 19 year old bringing downs 15 year old at the time is just jelousey  charli is just a teenager trying to live her life and it is discusting that a almost adalt tries to bring down a 15 year old like just because you have boyfriend problems didn&rsquo;t mean you have to bring down a 15 year old that is truly discusting she should have know better smh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addison has no flavor in her tiktok it’s all the same</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>okay the whole &ldquo;it was in the past&rdquo; thing isn&rsquo;t an excuse. they still said it or tweeted it and they probably meant it. she was old enough to know what was right and was wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think she hates Charlie at all, I think all tiktoker&rsquo;s were jealous of Charlie at the time because they wanted hype</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People being surprised about this is what actually surprises me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WE WERE ROOTING FOR YOU WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>okay if someone doesnt get &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; y&rsquo;all love them but if they get &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; everyone proceeds to say how much &ldquo;they didnt like that person&rdquo;. im kinda shocked lowkey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>first of all&hellip;. cancel addison. second of all&hellip;. i think that her apology was so fake like girl really? then she brought mental health into it and i get it but like there’s no excuses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly never thought I would see Addison in drama like this&hellip;I didn’t  think she would  have EVER liked those comments when she could have liked comments uplifting herself and not bringing down Charli. I also think she should talk about that tweet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>y’all saying “it was the past” like she was a little kid! she was definitely old enough to know right from wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This just sounds like dumb middle school drama lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can you do a video about madison beer? she&rsquo;s done so many things that no one calls her out for bc shes pretty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m ngl I always had a weird feeling about Addison and don’t get me wrong she is pretty but people overhype her a bit to much 🥴</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BISH! Addison is 19. She said she was in a 5 year abusive relationship. So you are telling me that her mum let her DATE at 13/14?! WTF SHERI? That&rsquo;s a bad mum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m the last person to every agree with anyone bashing the BLM movement or saying the n word (because I am a black individual) But in my opinion this situation was different, she was younger, wasn’t educated, didn’t understand what the movement was about. I feel bad that everyone is attacking her, but it is wrong. But at the same time, she was young and uneducated; where as people saying the n word recently or throwing it back to the Quran have access to information that is constantly being spread around and should be educated. I still don’t think what she did was right, but it’s wrong of people to go searching and digging around to “cancel” someone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I first saw Addison I thought she was super sweet and like a good person and stuff and then like a few weeks ago, I think, Larray and the dolan twins posted a video with her and to be honest I didn’t felt the vibes that she irradiated in her tiktoks in that video, like if she had  kind of another personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yeah she definitely ain’t invited to the tré lmaooooo 😭✋🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t wanna be that person but like if she so</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>call got out of an “toxic and mentally abusive relationship” that caused her to hate her self and became depressed you wouldn’t believe when someone is calling you pretty she’s just pulling the mental health card🤷🏽‍♀️ being with someone toxic and mentally abusive would cause you to be introverted and doubtful and suspicious when someone out of the blue would call you pretty &hellip; so idk her logic ain’t adding up😗🤷🏽‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She danced to a song ab eating disorders 😤 um girl byeee 😌

<p>to social media addison is a “sweet person” as most of her fans say. but inside i’m sure she wants all the spotlight and doesn’t like charlie getting more hype. people are defending her because it is an old tweet, she needs to be careful of what she posts or likes on the internet cause she has over 40 million followers like be more careful&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“If she wasn’t addison she would be cancelled”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She immediately pulled the victim card. 😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is what happens when you hype up a bunch of dancing idiots 🙄🙄🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The comments disappeared for me😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>never liked her anyway, there was just always something off about her and still is.                              edit: thank you for all the likes:)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all just because she smiles on camera DOESNT MEAN she’s a nice person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m back to not only not liking Addison, but to hating Her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your voice kinda sounds like Dixie’s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was I the only one who rlly is not surprised?&hellip; Damn 👁️👄👁️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She acts super cute and nice to that much. I get energy that she’s trying so hard! And ppl believe it.. i get scared of anyone who fake being super nice.. that’s mean they’re super dark and hiding it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the words of lizzo: “i’ve been WAITIN for this one”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ew why is her &lsquo;apology&rsquo; all me, me, I, myself blah blah damn she didn&rsquo;t say sorry ONCE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well there isn&rsquo;t a time in the day where tik tokers aren&rsquo;t in drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;ve been waiting for this one TURN IT UP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a feeling something about Addison and those posts about blm were fake. smh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alt TikTok saw right through her no cap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lost all my respect. i will not support someone who said racist things/posted something racist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being 18-19 and being jealous of a 15-16 yo bruh grow uppp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve never liked addison don’t know why I just don’t. Also she didn’t say thank u when marko gave her shoes

<p>Addison pulled the “I was in a bad mental place” card. They all do. I’ve seen it. ‘Infulencers’ ALWAYS say that when they get cancelled. Stop making excuses sweetie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretty privilege is real, that’s the only reason she’s not getting cancelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and we all thought Addison was friendly asf 😳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hate how they put “depression” as an excuse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never liked her , IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE, TURN IT UP!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She literally said in a TikTok in September that she had not been in a relationship in a while, I-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is my opinion but how are you guys gonna say Addison is over hyped and so basic when Charli is 2x that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she still needs to apologize for making a dance to a song about having a ED all she did was take it down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I low-key never liked Addison she just gave me weird vibes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is everyone so invested in tiktok peoples lives? Is it really that interesting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BRUH PEOPLE TRY TO CANCEL JENNA MARBLES BECAUSE OF A VIDEO SHE DID WITH A DOG HARNESS BUT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WONT CANCEL ADDI WHEN SHE DOES ALL OF THIS ITS CLEAR DAYLIGHT THAT IF YOUR PRETTY YOU HAVE A EXCUSE</p>

<p>Just so y’all know, there’s a user going by “joe smith” that’s commenting on some people’s comments with nonsense. Just saying don’t fall for it although the replies will probably make you want to throw hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are influencer’s always using the mental health card? Literally take responsibility for your actions instead of throwing excuses to get yourself out of trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is NO excuse to bully someone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Adisson was 19. A LEGAL ADULT bullying a 15 year old for her appearance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bruh&hellip;.. i thought she was one of the most unproblamatic members of the hype house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that Addison immediately started saying she was in an abusive relationship (I’m not saying she wasn’t) and turned the situation to her shows that she still wants to be in the limelight and just wants fame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ALREADY KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH HERR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean Addison is sweet and all, but she doesn&rsquo;t deserve some sort of special treatment just bc it was &ldquo;in the past&rdquo; (just an opinion don&rsquo;t drag me pls😭🥺)

</li>
<li>
<p>i’m leaving the fandom- bye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and she gets away with everything cuz she “ pretty” lmao 💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I KNEW SHE HAD DONE SOMETHING RACIST BEFORE LMAOO i can&rsquo;t stand that girl-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry but I can’t stand it when people will go to a influencers profile and look for things &hellip; like wtf are you looking for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i just KNEW Addison was one of those fake nice girls. smh, poor charli :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why do the worst people get fame 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see the problem with the tweet but I feel like the comments weren’t a big deal and they could have handled that in private</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haha ofc she played the victim, I could&rsquo;ve seen that coming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bad thing is that pretty privilege exists yall just won’t cancel her or Madison just cuz they pretty-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And these people are making up allll these excuses stop holding these people on a pedestal 😩</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t she do a Photoshoot at a protest then leave?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: It was madison beer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I go on her page and 20% people are actually noticing her true colors and 80% are kids and they&rsquo;re fp 💀 I never liked Addison anyways🤦🏾‍♀️

</li>
<li>
<p>I came here from the channel &ldquo;Snow&rdquo; because he kept talking while she was lmao, how about anyone else?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i knew Addison had that bad toxic side of herself tbh :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her true colours are starting to show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t like when people say “oh she’s such a nice person!!!” Like y’all know nothing about her other than what she posts on tik tok</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WAIT A SECOND- she liked those comment in NOVEMBER WHY IS THE DRAMA HAPPENING NOW? i swear tik tok is TOXIC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“live learn love” SKSJSJDJDJDJDIDJDJDJD CHILE NO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and we thought addison was the genuine one 😳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addison apologized and I hope! She was sincere about it,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If she was truly be genuine then I don&rsquo;t have any problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I personally like Addison and ik she messed up but if she&rsquo;s being genuine and her apology was sincere then that&rsquo;s the end of that there should be no more hate on either side!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not to mention her making a TikTok dance to a song about eating disorders&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly feel bad for Addi, shes such a sweet person! She gets hate bc she was just kinda jealous! She has feelings too ya know :c</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Girl if being pretty or having &ldquo;dance&rdquo; is a talent than bruh I&rsquo;d get below -100</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You: gimme ur opinions me: WELL I GOT A LOT TO SAY-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THEN WHEN SHE DANCED TO A SONG ABOUT A ED</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why I never followed big influencers&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can we also talk about the fact that she got paid to do an add about dancing for masks but at the same time went out around all of her friends. don’t get me wrong everyone else is doing the same thing but like you can’t just go out and hang out with all of your friends and then preach wearing masks 💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ya’ll cancel anybody but when it comes to anybody who’s “beautiful” y’all literally are like, “they didn’t do anything wrong, forgive them!!!😡🤬” like stfu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really liked addison, i always thought she was such a fake and was just looking for views and i always thought she never really cared abt her supporters but after seeing what she did, even though its in the past, none of this is right, and even recently she made a dance to &ldquo;prom queen&rdquo; about eating disorders..🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ come on- if anyone deserves hype its definitely NOT addison</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people are always saying &ldquo;omg they were so YOUNG, they were 15!!&rdquo; um chile&ndash; i&rsquo;m fifteen&hellip;. and i have never said anything derogatory in my life. LMAO

<li>
<p>I always got a vibe I didn’t like from her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You guys wanna cancel Madison beer for saying the n word when she was like 13 but won’t cancel Addison for this? Bye</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i need to stop believing anyone has a perfect moral compose</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>insert pfp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dixi had every right to stick up for her sister</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like come on she made a mistake but it’s in the past everyone makes mistakes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Teehee I’m chillin :)”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“LIVE LEARN LOVE???” WHAT LOL then does a sob story about a toxic boyfriend and blames that on her mistake GIRL BYE🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yall forgimve addison about this tweet because it was four years agi and you cant forgive chase for saying the n word four years ago because addison is &ldquo;pretty&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna get attacked but i think her liking the comments questioning why she hasn&rsquo;t got the hype and Charli has was not because she wanted to agree with the person about Charli getting hype but like a way to say &ldquo;aww&rdquo; and thanking the person for complimenting her Tik tok?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people find anything at all to bring down others whoever/whatever it is. i hate it rip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i didn’t expect that side from addison..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not hating but I think she needs to apologize to everyone who she did wrong too❤️🙃</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ya&rsquo;ll are talking about addison shading charli but, when charli shaded avani ya&rsquo;ll don&rsquo;t care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was is the past when lil hoody said the n word and y&rsquo;all canceled him like it was nobody&rsquo;s business, but when Addison posts a racist tweet y&rsquo;all are defending her? What&rsquo;s 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im sorry but i didn&rsquo;t hear &ldquo;im sorry&rdquo; anywhere in that -</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These tiktokers won&rsquo;t stop with the drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think what she meant as “know” her as in she didn’t really know her personality and how she acts until later and I’ve watched another video about this and there is a lot more to it and also umm why are we bringing the past back?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m still confused

<li>
<p>Imagine being 19 but being jealous of a 15 year old &hellip; lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They’re both beautiful girls. This probably means Addison has some inner confidence issues which is crazy because she is so pretty 😿</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bruh addison apologized to charli she said “i told her she didn’t have to forgive me” just bc she’s not gonna post the message or however she apologized doesn’t mean it didn’t happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some of them arent towards charli, or doesn&rsquo;t even say who (well i didnt see the tiktok vid) so why hate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what am i doing watching a drama video about straight tiktok i-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone on the internet is being stupid, never seen this one before. I&rsquo;d love to hear about how racist and fascist this woman is, yay!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imagine being jealous of a literal minor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>idk why but this channel (even the intro) gives me night time vibes omg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remember when journalists actually had a job besides digging up tweets from years ago</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never liked Addison&hellip; bby addy just pressed Charlis wayyyyyy betteeerrr then addy..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at this point.. 🤦🏽‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I’m going be honest I thought these two were the same person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“live learn love” LMAOOOOOO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>always had a bad feeling about her tbh 🤷‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is the DEFINITION of pretty privilege.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to say one thing Addison didn’t know Charli D’Amelio in November</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let’s not forget that she also made a DANCE to a song talking and explaining ED!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Charli  is racist for being forced to make that video about her taking about george floyd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly always knew Addison would probably come out as a toxic person lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ppl who think that she can get away with it even tho its 2016 is delusional

<li>
<p>Everybody talking about her shading Charli, she said that she didn&rsquo;t meet her. And saying that Addison is racist, for a link of 2016. It&rsquo;s 2020 and she went to protest, posted lots of things on stories, posts and tik tok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;not an excuse but i&rsquo;ll still say it bc i want pity&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I mean we all knew it was coming. I’m just waiting for Charli and Dixie 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s true, being pretty is a privilege even when you&rsquo;re exposed🤭 y&rsquo;all really defending her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew there was something off about her&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I tell u I clicked so fast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addison we were all rooting for you, how dare you!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mmmmm, everybody thought she was perfect, she acted like an angel, but now da t coming through.🤭🤥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my gosh, &ldquo;this is no excuse&hellip; But-&rdquo; 💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i thought that addison would like never be apart of drama like this, my friend has even met her irl before and she said she is such a kind and sweet person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it just me or all the undirected tweets that “throw shade” but aren’t confirmed to that other person are just unnecessary and dramatic. Like just get to the point and talk about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i loved her her so much and she sounded like the sweetest person ever but i guess shes one of those ppl who act all kind and sweet but really arent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im so glad this is a comment section i agree with- i just came out of a comment section saying &ldquo;ITS FROM THE PAST GET OVER IT!!!!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why people expose things from 2019?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How you gon put a relationship into this. no!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Addison Rae was my favorite tiktoker 1 hours ago I love this girl with all my heart dint expect her to hate me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wasn&rsquo;t everyone jealous of Charli though? She literally came up out of no where? Didn&rsquo;t she?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im pretty sure by the age of fifteen you know the difference between right and wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tbh they all give me bad headaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why the hell does everyone in this situation care about looks so damn much?

</li>
<li>
<p>Didn’t expect this from Addison but she needs to apologize for everything she’s just a rude person now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look in her defence she could’ve been saying how bad it was instead of promoting is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yikes, tbh we been knew lmao. I never understood why Addison got famous I’m sorry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also she blamed her ex I-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never really liked Addison in the first place but ever since I found out about her I knew that something was off about her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All I have to say is oof :'(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fact that Addison got her mom involved lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i didn&rsquo;t know one of the kindest girls could be like this. 😳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>actuallyyyy , I did expect that from Addison tho - I think she’s trying to look nice and cute but actually behind the screen she isn’t . PERIOD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well&hellip; this was unexpected😳😳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New way to lose friends shade them😌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve always hated Addison Rae</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all are getting a little too extra with this “cancel Addison” mess. Y’all be the same ones chill with lil huddy having a full platform. What she did was shady, but we all have our shady moments. Don’t think so highly of yourself.🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, I really thought Addison and Dixie would be two of the most unproblematic tiktokers out there (besides Charli)&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apparently Dixie and Addison are back to being friends so this drama was all for FREACKIN nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn’t know there was a 13th month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait but I thought Addison was really nice? D:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is actually reaching lmao

<li>
<p>When I saw the title of the video I was shook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she made the situation about her lmfao💀💀💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a lot of mixed feelings- all I can say is wow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never like Addison I knew something was sus abt her but 🤷‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BRO WHEN I SAW THIS I WAS LIKE FINALLY, why finally? Their is this weird vibe that came from the whole house that just made me go like, &ldquo;Yeap their gonna be toxic. Just wait a few more moths for it to come&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That video of the lady speaking is the truth so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was waitingggg for Addison to get exposed because she’s one of those girls who act way too nice but are secretly horrible people. If you’re this nice then somethings gotta be wrong&hellip; idk how so many people are surprised</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will forever love your intro 😭💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ughhhhhh can’t they just be good people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charli is so nice. my respect goes to her man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always knew there was something about her ngl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You finally post after 1 million years it&rsquo;s been a minute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well I’m just going to say this I know what it is like to be in second place plus being in a mentaly bad state and you don’t thing you try to cover it up by putting a smile on your face but in the end it just tears you down your always placed against this person and you try to work your way to the top but you fail so for some people back lashing try to be understanding and put your self in her shoes because being second place can cause a lot of anxiety and more so think if you were in her shoes what have you done because I would have probably just have a complete mental breakdown into result of me tearing every bit of happiness into negativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wait a damn minute.. “i got out of a toxic relationship. with bryce? because girl she literally was the one to bail him out of jail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post more Often please! I feel The last time he post was it a year ago even though it was a month ago</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i-</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>i don&rsquo;t know why i like her still- is it only me that thinks she meant it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was 15?!?! You should more mature by then I&rsquo;m only 13 and my 11 y/o brother and we both know better than that. Y&rsquo;all just letting her slip through this because shes famous, and if I did this with a small fan base I would be cancelled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I unfollowed Addison after this
