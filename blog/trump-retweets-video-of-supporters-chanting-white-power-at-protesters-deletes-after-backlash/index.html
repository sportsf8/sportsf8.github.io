<li>
<p>White House: Trump has great hearing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>video clearly says White Power</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump: I could not hear it.</p>
</li>

<p>Coronavirus cases surging again, civil unrest, economy crashing</p>

<li>
<p>Trump: Perfect time to play golf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet another ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not responsible‚Äù comment from The Traitor Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s like the mofo doesn&rsquo;t want to get elected. That&rsquo;s fine with me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm surprised they weren‚Äôt screaming ‚ÄúOrange power‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ofcourse he did, at this point I‚Äôd be shocked if he wasn‚Äôt proud of his racism and ignorance in himself and his adoring fans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s losing it. Pretty soon he will drag out his  hood and robe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the going gets tough  - the  fool goes golfing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He just couldn‚Äôt resist whistling at his base, he needs them very badly right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t DT say recently &ldquo;I notice everything&rdquo;? I doubt he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t see that part&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we well know, 8 seconds is longer than his attention span.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we can&rsquo;t change the minds and actions of the People in Power . . . then we CHANGE the PEOPLE.  üóΩ VOTE HIM OUT IN NOVEMBER. üóΩ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations all you Bible thumping Evangelicals you put the most insane person since Adolf in charge of the United States!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t know about it. That&rsquo;s the fall back line. I  sure hope he&rsquo;s having a good time golfing. OMG unbelievable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is anyone here even surprised, I know I&rsquo;m notüòë.

<p>His tweet was a dog whistle for his fascist base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All right thinking Americans should spend their energy mobilising to get him voted out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The White House is a Jerry Springer show reboot ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If he didn‚Äôt know, it validates his stupidity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up next:  Kayleigh McEnany defends president Trump&rsquo;s &lsquo;white power&rsquo; tweet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He going kamikaze. He don‚Äôt want the job anymore so he‚Äôs going to destroy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deceptions,separatism,total disregard for life&hellip;Antichrist!!!üôèüèæ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everytime He Doesn&rsquo;t Knowü§î What Does He Knowü§Ø HE&rsquo;S GOLFING WHILE THE WORLD IS IN TERMOILüò∑</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New question for this president:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What DIDN&rsquo;T the president know and why DIDN&rsquo;T he know it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;white power&rsquo; screams the person who can&rsquo;t even walk under the power of their own two legs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a liar like he really didn‚Äôt know about that video. Why do you think he re-tweeted it? He probably lies in his sleep. Vote trump out of office vote blue 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CIA told Trump That Putin was paying off the Taliban for killing Marine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs playing freaking golf! ‚õ≥Ô∏è while thousands are dying in a pandemic! üò° sounds about right ü§î smh #Biden2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This fool always act like he doesn‚Äôt know anything smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he wonders why his numbers are low, people are tired of the madness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is so done!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not racist‚Äù shares racist video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump had a good excuse: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m stupid&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant help but laugh because its just so over the top ridiculous at this point it really is.

<p>trump thinks that if there&rsquo;s civil war by November, no one will care about him stealing the elections again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Genesis 25:25</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump heard ‚Äúwhite power‚Äù! A pathological liar lies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was always planning a hostile race take over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄôWhite Power‚Äô is something chanted when a bunch of domestic terrorists are about to MURDER someone. This is NOT to be tolerated. Investigate now!</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Best thing his staff could do is take his Twitter account down &amp; limit his smart phone use. Time for an intervention üò¨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did it because he knows that most voters are uneducated white laborers.

</li>
<li>

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>I heard it and it‚Äôs just me I don‚Äôt have thousands of people working for me</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen many conmen just like him and when they lie they could fool a  polygraph test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a &ldquo;genius&rdquo; he sure is absent of a LOT of faculties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This president never knows anything and he is responsible for nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, the world we are living in now can‚Äôt effort to have a racists leader nor a political extremist. We don‚Äôt need stirring narcissist!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still playing golf while American are dying&hellip;.. &ldquo;yey! make America gret again!&quot;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>puiittt *spitting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psalms 58:3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He Really KNOWS Nothing And His Staff Is Full Of EXCUSES.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will do anything to win coz he knows he‚Äôs so done old bum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is just trying to intimidate his opponents. The last kicks of a dying horse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2.5mil infected 120k+ dead and he still has time for golf? What a guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s dangerous he needs to be removed from office</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He knows what he is doing. It is called: playing with the subconscious of the people. What a mistake this president really is. He is not only not fit for office, he is not fit for living. The world is a better place without him and all racist people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As always a large amount of BS coming out of the White House.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lies/ and rantings of an enfeebled old man-  he always misses the  memo.  never aware of the controversy becase no one has &ldquo;informed him&rdquo;.    sociopathic impostor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The most perfect person&rdquo;, cant hear and dont know whats going on apparently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MAKE SURE YOU VOTE - DONT LET HIM STAY IN OFFICE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He Deleted the twitt without rebuking his supporters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He didnt hear the statement&hellip;

<p>&ldquo;The man clearly says white powder. It was all fake news.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People do get angry with Diaper Don Just &ldquo;VOTE HIM OUT&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He¬¥s out playing golf with Lindsey Graham! Spending quality time together in preparation for their sharing a prison cell in the near future:-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess trump only has a 7 second attention span&hellip; I would say 5 but I&rsquo;m not a doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&rsquo;re about 1-2 election cycles away from the GOP dropping all pretense an doing the White power salute at the GOP convention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IS IT NOT PATENTLY OBVIOUS THAT THERE WERE VERY FINE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s lying once again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man think he can win this election by tweeting every resist comments like 2016</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was hoping that this tweet will distract from the Russia/Afghanistan topic. Don&rsquo;t do him the favour!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah I‚Äôm sure he wasn‚Äôt aware about either</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And about a month ago he retweeted a video of a group of neo-cons saying &ldquo;The only good Democrat is a dead one&rdquo; and praised them for it. I reported it at the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the US fall apart and the Turd-in-chief is playing golf&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s not even hiding his racism anymore!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs more annoying that all his supporters/republicans are going to be like, ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt see the part where they chanted white power‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is it possible that you didn‚Äôt know??? Coming from the guy that knows everything üôÑ

<li>
<p>Yeah he knew, liar it&rsquo;s all he does all the time and tryna start a race war b4 November 3rd&hellip;. 45 worst ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was that footage taken at a Retirement village? üòÜüòÜüòÜ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was not &ldquo;aware&rdquo;. You got that right. He hasn&rsquo;t been &ldquo;aware&rdquo; throughout the presidency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Trump responds to the &ldquo;white power&rdquo; statement, he&rsquo;ll probably just say he &ldquo;believes all powers matter.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So he can&rsquo;t hear them chanting &lsquo;white power&rsquo;, he didn&rsquo;t hear the Intelligence Brief telling him about the bounties Russia placed on our soldier&rsquo;s lives, he doesn&rsquo;t hear people saying please do not take away our healthcare during a pandemic. Trump is a stain on what makes America great and the rest of the World sees it. And luckily more and more of US are&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This President is clearly unfit to remain in office. Pence should invoke the 25th.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That man is digging his own grave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>America IS coming together. Him and his cult following will know this in November</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other people lose their jobs for retweeting controversial subjects so should he</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Controversial&rdquo;? Really??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not controversial, it&rsquo;s crystal clear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im sure they will claim the Roseanne defense of: &quot; I blacked out&rdquo;&hellip;.or &ldquo;I was on sleeping pills&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just when you think Trump couldn&rsquo;t get any lower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And even if he did miss it, a protester immediately repeats even louder what that person had said, to highlight it - so how could Trump have NOT heard it??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We all see where Trump stands .what a shame , IN AMERICA WHERE BETTER THAN THAT !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He knew exactly what he was doing. He‚Äôs rallying his base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And that&rsquo;s why this country is falling apart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can no one feel pride in being gracious to a person that looks different to themselves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From whistleblowing to 152 dB train horn in 4 years, that&rsquo;s clarity for you.</p>

<p>Why aren‚Äôt we calling for his resignation! He is showing us his true colors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When &ldquo;Stinky Donnie&rdquo; came back from Tulsa, he staggered across the South Lawn, looking like a &ldquo;Wino&rdquo;, returning from a drinking party, which may be the reason,he smells BAD !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, it may be that he is just &ldquo;Full-of-IT&rdquo;!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old &ldquo;Trump is lazy and stupid so it&rsquo;s not his fault&rdquo; defense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excuse actually sounds honest, his attention span is only 2-3 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see them on YouTube and Twitter every day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He did not hear it, 90 million people did tho&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù seems to be Trump favorite phrase.  For a President, there‚Äôre a lot that Thump doesn‚Äôt know.  He‚Äôs not playing ignorance.  He is truly ignorant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When racial tensions are at a all time high number 45 POTUS has an amazing ability I‚Äôm making things chaotic troublesome and flammable</p>

<p>His father, Fred Trump was apparently involved with the KKK. I suspect there&rsquo;s a link between that fact and what&rsquo;s happening now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does he remember taking some kind of oath of office?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL wtf? I love those seniors rocking in the golf carts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üò∂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God I can&rsquo;t wait for November, the month will become a great history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Judging by his actions, I&rsquo;m starting to think Trump doesn&rsquo;t really want another term as POTUS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SMDH!!! SMFH!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was the first 10 seconds&hellip; he couldn‚Äôt have missed it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The re-opening is so funny everyone is out with no masks and now cases are getting higher than ever. Be responsible people wear a mask and only go out if its a necessity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>trump &lsquo;ooh golf cart, retweet&rsquo;! 10 seconds later &lsquo;d&rsquo;oh!&rsquo; haha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t hear the one statement which was loudly and repeatedly shouted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know he&rsquo;s lying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t agree with the &ldquo;white power&quot;comment. And this is just a curiosity but dose anybody feel that there phrase &ldquo;Black power&rdquo; or &ldquo;native pride&rdquo; is a racist comment?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sickening ü§¨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He knew exactly what he was doing. This tweet was directed at his base.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you kidding! He didn‚Äôt watch the video before tweeting it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can‚Äôt wait til he‚Äôs outta office and has to face all those sexual assault charges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is he tweeting any videos while his country is falling apart? let alone that one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m speechless

<li>
<p>Use your vote, USA! Each of us can vote, many of us do not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just out of curiosity in breeds, how are you gonna spin this one? By bringing up a Democrat who was racist 50 years ago? That‚Äôs all you in breeds seem to do lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like we are in The Matrix! We can‚Äôt make this stuff up. Everyone PLEASE don‚Äôt get distracted by yet another crazy day under his leadership&hellip;VOTE!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THIS COUNTRY IS OVER!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those old people are good as dead when Covid comes a calling,just a matter of time,any day now I‚Äôd bet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uh huh, right, he didn&rsquo;t know anything about the video&rsquo;s contents. Sure!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Golfing is more important for him then his countryü§î</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did Trump say &ldquo;Joe is shot&rdquo; ????  Is this Trump placing a bounty on Biden&rsquo;s head ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But has he actually come out and condemned it since? üí°</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Democrats can say black and brown power.. But this is wrong. Why the Hypocrisy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sweetüò∑</p>

<li>
<p>Another distraction to take away from his actual crimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boomers on Brigade! Hahahahaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unaware of the contents of what he is tweeting? So, they are saying he doesn&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s doing? That isn&rsquo;t what I want in a leader.

<p>I was taught, the first words that comes out your mouth about someone, was from their heart in truth. You cannot rebutle your comment on how you feel about the person or people, or place or country, or state, or city and not espect  backlash from no one or anyone, so living in a protected situation. And dont care about the lives of others</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why delete? I suspect great part of his supporters agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Just to clarify, I don&rsquo;t support neither this nor him at all).</p>

<p>The world would be a lot brighter without these people. Such a dark history we‚Äôre going to have.</p>

<p>Wow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;ll tweet about the last episodes of Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert he didn&rsquo;t like but you actually think he didn&rsquo;t see that racist remark eight seconds into this video. Come on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OH MY GOD! He isn&rsquo;t even trying to contempt for Americans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y&rsquo;all KNOW he knew that man said &ldquo;white power&rdquo; or he has less of an attention span than a goldfish. Either way, not great for a president, lol.</p>

<li>
<p>Yes he knew</p>

<p>They need go to their home and say that</p>

<p>I could swear that was one of Donald&rsquo;s kin.. lbvs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No way would his delicate ego allow him to highlight a video showing people criticizing his magnificence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He retweeted it and must take responsibility for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just wonder what his now Jewish Daughter would say after hearing him retweet these words. She should remember that these people also hate Jews and that includes his son in law.</p>

<p>Hahaha!  It keeps getting better!  I hope y‚Äôall are ready for 4 more years of Mr. Donald.  üòÇ</p>
