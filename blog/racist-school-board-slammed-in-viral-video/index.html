<p>Gary Chambers for Office in Baton Rouge.</p>
</li>

<p>Gary Chambers. That shit was no fucking joke. Talk about the perfect storm at that meeting! Lol. Having Connie shopping on-line as your all Talking important topics such as racism In our country which is The biggest thing besides coronaviris. It&rsquo;s always been.  Sucks everyone is finally getting it now. Better late than never tho. Then having someone like Gary there and that one guy who she didn&rsquo;t realize she should be fearing but not for the color of his skin but for his extreme intelligence. And having that super smart guy she should be afraid of catching her doing what she was doing!! Perfect storm.  But back to Gary. I&rsquo;ve never been so damn impressed with a regular Joe off the street spitting REAL shit at a town hall. That was pure badass. And shows how incredibly smart and intelligent you are. I hope this acts as a springboard for you. You deserve it with your mind and words. Even If it&rsquo;s not. Don&rsquo;t stop what your doing. It&rsquo;s all down from here. Cheers Gary.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>He should run for Office</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man is more human and more well educated that all of those in that school board. And for that trash of a person, I hope they fire you and you never ever step on school grounds and she should be labeled as a racist and a piece of trash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amen.  I am a descendent of slave holders, some who have been immortalized in statues. I say tear them down and grind them to dust.  Leave a plaque where those statues stood telling the story &ndash;who that person was, what they did and what they stood for, good and bad and how the decision was made to end their idolatry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow marvelous speaker!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wow reminds me of the passion that King had ,great job Gary Chambers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say it again brotha!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glad I graduated from Lincoln senior high school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy needs to be in federal politics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great job, Mr. Chambers! Your passion is inspiring and you should definitely seek elected office.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good Job , Gary Chambers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harper Valley PTA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someday I hope to become even half the speaker Gary Chambers 🔥🔥🔥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Powerful. That is exactly it. Renaming a school or street for someone more deserving doesn&rsquo;t change the quality of school or direction of the street. However, DON&rsquo;T erase history, give it it&rsquo;s proper platform for understanding. This is that politics that will make All Nations Great Now. DON&quot;T ban the viewing of Art, like movies: Gone With The Wind, Birth Of A Nation, even Triumph Of The Will&hellip; They must be available to be seen and not censored.  But now must be used to educate and draw judgement from today&rsquo;s evolved fight for sanity. THIS is the MODERN AGE NOW. Or can be&hellip; But never censorship art, at least past art where we can learn from. Let&rsquo;s finally break out into the modern age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gary Chambers, wow, what an incredible speaker and improvising on the spot like that. Power to that voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow.  I could listen to him all day.  Makes so many great points.

<li>
<p>Oh Brother Preach On Preach On my brother !!! Love this energy !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come on CONNIE!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that&rsquo;s power to the people you put together a well put argument check your facts and bring it to the man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well said 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome. He spoke truth to the truth deniers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There should be a love button!!!  Gary Chambers you are wonderful, powerful, and right on target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry racists.  The South will NEVER rise again. You LOST. Your heroes are LOSERS AND TRAITORS. and to claim otherwise is to deny history and is not American. We don&rsquo;t glorify traitors here any longer. We don&rsquo;t indulge your crybaby fantasies.  It is time to get those statues smashed into dust like they deserve to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robert E. Lee is my ancestor. Rename the school. Take down his statues. Do the right thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinchback High is an awesome name! Is there a petition I can sign?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well said sir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Told!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Role Model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need more people like him, thank you sir, those were powerful, POWERFUL, words you spoke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am white and was brought up in Virginia and the southern versions of history I was taught just didn&rsquo;t make sense.  With very little research I was able to find, and verify, a little of the real background of those glorified horrible people and history.  He is also right.  The people he is mentioning and hundreds of others should be recognized and honored in place of the current confederate &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; that were traitors too the United States and are currently glorified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched that video many many times. The most succinct point from this is &ldquo;We built this joint for free and we&rsquo;re done begging you to do what&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; It summarises the plight and fight that has taken decades and centuries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need more people like him, thank you sir, those were powerful, POWERFUL, words you spoke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautifully done I believe. 👏🏾💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now that was powerful, informative and effective.  Well researched and forcefuly presented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was by far the best argument I&rsquo;ve heard in this case - &ldquo;&hellip; we built this building for free&hellip;&rdquo;

<li>
<p>Gary Chambers is entirely correct on all counts. I am giving you a one man standing ovation right here, thank you for getting that lazy racist board member to hear you and then walk out - priceless!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve never heard of this man, PBS Hitchback, was it? I’m gonna look him up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nicely done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TYT needs to hire Gary Chambers!! You see that passion he has while explaining the real US history? Hearing him talk gets me riled up and motivated to face more people like Connie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a genuine history buff - Gary Chamber&rsquo;s suggestion is just plain awesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They actually remember selective history&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gary Chambers is a boss. Keep speaking the truth, brother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A progressive screaming someone or something is racist? Shocking! This never happens!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am Mr Chambers&rsquo; biggest fan!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s way past time for massive corrections to take place - - this garbage can&rsquo;t stand up to historical scrutiny.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>There is a move afoot to remove &ldquo;John Wayne&rdquo; from his namesake airport and use the original name: Orange County Airport&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every syllable this man utters is pure gold!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or heres another name. I dare someone to say a thing negative about this man. a white man who everyone can get behind. mr. rogers. yea I dare someone to talk shit about mr rogers. everyone loved that man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your comments were factual, on point, &amp; inarguable. Bravo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I was a young man, I&rsquo;m not proud to admit that I was guilty of being a racist. . As an adult I am begging for forgiveness. I will stand anywhere, anytime with my fellow black Americans against any oppression. I&rsquo;m not very good at expressing my feelings but I&rsquo;m appalled with what is going on in this country and I&rsquo;m ashamed to be an American.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truth Bomb Dem 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reconstruction was the biggest mistake. They should have let the south rot for 50 years before they rebuilt. Maybe that would have gotten thru their thick skull that slavery is bad.  Amazing!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gary Chambers&hellip; Booom!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Powerful!

<p>He needs to be on TV a lot more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like, share, and spam vid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The confederacy was a group of traitors. Anyone who still embraces the ideals they held are also traitors and should be dealt with as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done, Mr Chambers.  We need a lot more people like you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the school boards defense I dont want my kids going to school with kids of this crazy fuckhead. Your kids are stupid because you are stupid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great video! Keep the spotlight on these situations. There’s nothing worth glorifying about that period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Powerful words my brother.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fuckin GET EM BROTHER! I&rsquo;m white as white can be, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter when someone speaks this passionately and accurately. Everybody shut the fuck up and listen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tubby is angry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t give Gary enough thumbs-up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second time I&rsquo;ve  watched this and i was cheering Mr.chambers well said</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a white male I wish I could have had this man as my history teacher. I was drawn in with his teachings and wish this would have been what they actually taught me. Respect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So when are we going to talk about Europeans coming over here, forcing the natives off of their ancestral &amp; sacred land, forcing them into reservation, attempted genocide, banned them from speaking their native tongue, banned them from ceremonial dances, banned them from wearing their native clothing, banned them from practicing their religious customs, forcing them into Christianity? And it&rsquo;s still going on in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sir you&rsquo;re hot, well spoken educated on the current topic. You appeared to be fearless and you drove the opposition to the corners, even the black folks. The black folks were shaking, wondering if they were naughty or nice. We need more folks like you in the public sphere. I envy you sir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems like he needs to run for some kind of government official job</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am gonna follow Gary Chambers. What an awesome guy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To this Black guy crying about his ancestors STFU Get a job and stop begging for reparations. People like me have carried  your &lsquo;&lsquo;woe is me&rsquo;&rsquo; a** for far too long&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connie needs to be removed; she is a danger to the peaceful governance of the school and has no concern for the community she is charged to serve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow! This guy really says it how it is.. He should run for office&hellip;

<p>Chambers for president in 2024!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like this man, he&rsquo;s got my vote Gary Chambers remember that name!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He should run for office in his area .  THIS will help him WIN and we NEEEEEEEEED people like him in office .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ouch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Chamber, you said it right. Keep saying it. We need to scrape through to the wound &amp; deep clean. All racist statues must go, starting w/Jackson, who violated supreme court ruling, pushed the Cherokee off their lands &amp; divided it among his white supporters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robert E. Lee: 51,000 citizens died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donald Trump: 100,000+ citizens died.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all he has done for blacks in America, and Louisiana especially, how about renaming this school &ldquo;Barack Obama High School&rdquo;!  I dont live in Lousiana, but I do know that President Obama tried his best to unite the races.  With all that is going on now, I know it does not seem like it, but what we have in the White House has done everything in his power to destroy the great legacy of Barack Obama!  I do think that naming any school after President Obama would be a wonderful tribute to him, and help make sure his impact on America is never forgotten!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gary, keep it going.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PERFECTION</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Became gov due to carpebagging groups in the the north. I went to college in La named FT Micholls a confed general and lost multi limbs yet was gov of the state.i did most of my studies in Geb PGBeaureaurd hall I&rsquo;d hate to see those change.my sons graduated from Rob E Lee HS I another state. Few years back we were changing school mascots. Nowm&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One great man 👍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IAM A WHITE GRANDMOTHER&hellip;HE IS RIGHT&hellip;.ROBERT E. LEE WAS A TRAITOR!!!&hellip;.THANK YOU FOR THE VIDEO!!!&hellip;.VOTE THE WOMEN OUT!!!!&hellip;.CONNIE  NEEDS TO GO BACK TO GRADE SCHOOL&hellip;I LEARNED ABOUT LEE IN GRADE SCHOOL!!!&hellip;.GARY&hellip;.YOU DESERVE  THE  FREEDOM MEDAL!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow he is speaking the truth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yep, if you remove statues and change names of facilities, you erase history. Everyone knows that.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I as a German don&rsquo;t know why the whole world calls me &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo;, because there are no corresponding statues in Germany and no institutions have been named accordingly - therefore this term is completely unknown to me 😜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is just astounding.  The incredible disregard shown by that woman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I see an issue with a Confederate museum only because if you put anyone who commiserates with the policies of the confederacy in charge ~ the ramifications of this will be a VERY skewed view of history .

<p>Let&rsquo;s hope Connie Bernard does the right thing and step down.  She is racist, lacks empathy, and is too entitled for that position. Mr. Gary Chambers Jr., thank you for your impassioned speech.  We can all gain knowledge by listening to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thing I hate about the “forgetting history/wanting to respect history” argument. It’s bullshit. Are you trying to say that the generations of people who lived in fear and hate so bad that literally got coded in DNA are going to forget how shitty their ancestors were treated when it’s literally still in DNA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BLESS THIS MAN AND YOU TOO, JOHN. Power never wants to hear the truth. &ldquo;It is our duty to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👏👏👏👏 ❤️💙</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People like him make history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people have, inadvertently, benefited from historical slavery. For some of them accepting that feels like confessing to being complicit and culpable for crimes. As a result they rebel to save their own pride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To them I say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t feel bad. Help others to feel better in future.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man hit the nail on the head!  He is right!  He knows his history that&rsquo;s for sure!!!!  It makes me fee good seeing blacks FINALLY speaking up and not taking it any more!!!!!  BTW, after reading about racist Connie defending Robert E. Lee, knowing that he owned slaves, and supported slavery.   This is not history.  This is allowing these monuments to racism, to Confederate racism!!!!  I am in tears saying, &ldquo;finally, blacks are fighting back&rdquo;!!!!  WOW!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The few people that thumbs down this video got to be racist and just plain dumb.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gary is the type of politician that Baton Rouge needs. Badly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Goddamn&hellip;gave me goosebumps&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For everyone making the &ldquo;if you want it in a museum that&rsquo;s fine&rdquo; argument you should know that these protesters have now gone after statues AT MUSEUMS to be taken down as well. They targeted Teddy Roosevelt in the National history Museum just cuz there&rsquo;s an indian and a black guy on each side of him. This shit needs to stop. Anyone who claims that going to school each day at Lee high or living on Grant St bothers them every day is full of it, no one has the time or luxury(especially these days)to sit around dwelling on how a school name hurts their feelings and if they do then there&rsquo;s something wrong with their life and the thickness of their skin. Half these people making these areguments didn&rsquo;t even know these schools and bases were named after confederate guys until someone pointed it out to them. Its not like 5 years ago people were demanding to change Fort Bragg and Fort Benning. And in respect to those two establishments, they have built a historic legacy having absolutely nothing to do with who they are named after. They are legendary for being the home of our nations most elite forces like the 75th Rangers, 5th &amp; 10th Special Forces Group, 101st &amp;, 82nd Airborne, PsyOPs, SOCOM, Military Intelligence and about 50 others.  I mean, this shit has no bounds and no end in site as I guarantee you people are sitting at home researching every possible link to racism in building names, statues, street names and so on, just feeding them to the masses so they keep going. And now its not just &ldquo;change the name&rdquo; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;name it after a black person&rdquo; Pretty soon they&rsquo;ll start suggesting naming things after people like Malcom X, Huey Newton or Eldridge Cleaver, smh.</p>

<p>The real question in reguards to Connie. Who keeps voting for her?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, only sheep are unclear about what the &ldquo;Again&rdquo; means in &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOW! I wish I could speak like that. Amazing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy reminds me of Kimberly Jones.  I thought it was great that woman walked out.  I wish him well in his endeavors!  PBS Pinchback sounds great, I agree with him!  I had never heard of this man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AMEN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh hell yeah! How fkn beautiful is this. Gary Chambers&rsquo; speech is the most powerful argument I&rsquo;ve heard recently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From a fellow Louisianan, I tip my hat to you Sir.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to hear more from Gary Chambers! Run for that school board and beyond!

<p>Gary,Gary,brother Gary. Bro you need to run for office in your area. I&rsquo;m in Cali. and I felt your frustration. If I lived there man I would be campaigning for you bro. Please keep your movement going, your people there need you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fk you connie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screw you Connie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you lose your photographs of your parents do you forget them?  That&rsquo;s what people who defend these statues are saying.  It&rsquo;s one of the dumbest defenses I&rsquo;ve ever heard.  Worse, it isn&rsquo;t history they are trying to defend, it&rsquo;s mythology - a whitewashed, sanitized for white supremacy, rose-colored glasses, one-sided version of history. It has no legitimacy or value except to promote and justify hatred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with the lady shopping, my question is why does she have a job.  The gentleman did have a good point and all she did was shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That guy is awesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excuse the criticism but you&rsquo;re title implies the entire school board is racist. Not cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought what he did was right and brave it’s hard to speak in front of people and I hope she resigns and is convicted for the assault?  I’d be interested to find out what happened in that case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was so powerful!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are other blacks so focused on the past? Just let it go and move on. Its as simple as that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow! I have chills. This is how you speak truth to power!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>History Hercules❗👏👏👏👏👏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lol at the lady shopping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn he was on 🔥 with names to replace with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yep they&rsquo;re nothing more than participation trophies for loser and traitors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damage Report pretty late on this one</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love him. He&rsquo;s so intelligent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you, sir, for being a Positive Informed *RESPONSIBLE Leader in Your Community!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy speaks true. This is sick ! Having a school named after a confederate, slave owner general is mental</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Margaret sanger the founder of planned parenthood was right about BLACK people

<p>OUTSTANDING SPEECH!!! And, yes, that building needs renamed. The TRAITOR Robert E Lee does NOT deserve this. Build a shithouse and hang the name on THAT!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow! Powerful!! Speak truth to power! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretty good speaker making some really good points.  Really knows his history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such respect for that man and his people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So&hellip; ROBERT E. LEE.  Said to. BRINE on EM TO SORT OF BURN EM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truth hurts &hellip; there will be a day of reckoning ‼️‼️‼️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MAN!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have statues of George Custer or Benedict Arnold&hellip;why insist keeping reminders of slave owners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dammm lady caught shopping while at a conference. 😞 how is she on committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope they heard him. WELL SAID !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great guest with a solid point and called out those that were being stupid.  I also like the name change!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a White guy, and I have been very irritated that virtually no one knows that Louisiana still held true to many French laws, one being that the offspring of a free person and a slave was a free person. There have been Blacks that fought in the War Of 1812, and that fought in the  Battle of New Orleans, not because they supported the C.S.A., but to keep their city free of any oppression. I am sure they can find a better name the that cruel oppressor. If I may add Mr. Chambers is a powerful orator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technology is a beautiful thing. It’s hard to hide from a cellphone these days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how he said Connie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still though, he was probably your best military tactician🤷‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👏🏾👏🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They never want to be called out. I hope embarrassment and guilt brought her to uncontrollable tears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve watched his speech over 6 times!  I love his passion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s right a bit of balance a historical black figure who is less well known is a great idea for balance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We love you, Gary 💕

<p>You GO, man!! Gary Chambers, you’re very well-spoken, concise, and passionate. That’s admirable, in my mind. I can feel your outrage and your heart in this video. Keep up your good works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep pushing them Confederates out of office!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiyaaa!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing young man. With people like him leading the move for change, things may finally happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Powerful, simply powerful&hellip;..It&rsquo;s easy to speak the truth, it&rsquo;s hard to hear it&hellip;bye Connie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s awesome!! Glad you had him on your show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John this was fantastic thanks so much . It’s great that TDR has people on that tell the whole story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people want to learn and remember history, go to a history museum or read some history books or even watch documentaries. There a number of ways to learn history. Taking a statue will not erase history. Those statues need to be taken down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nope they can keep their racist flags &amp; false idols I don&rsquo;t want 2 forgive and forget cause part of forgeting would mean removing flags and statues I want reparations  1 million for every sc African American over the age of 18❗</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tried to talk to my older Republican mother about this.  The sad fact is most older people dont wanna  know.  .  I love my mom with all my heart but maybe we need another generation.   The younger I know see much less color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank u for educating me more.  I need to talk to people who might listen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, straight up fire!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at this Black Supremacist on his soap box. I don&rsquo;t approve of his grandstanding, racism and seething hatred.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow this man. Bring the passion, bring the evidence, bring the humanity. Bless you Gary. Run for office, please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Chambers is speaking nothing but 100 perecent truth from the heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connie got read to absolute filth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The woman walked out because he pointed out the truth?? I&rsquo;m going to guess she&rsquo;s a trump supporter&hellip; that to childish and immoral to be anything else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man is powerful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was an amazing speech he gave. This guy needs to speak more because he has the power to move people to action.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I liked this speech even better than MLK Jr., he should run for county commissioner.

</li>

<p>FFS you want to erase history but only if it fits you&rsquo;re  narrative?? Hypocrites plain and simple nobody on this post was a slave and or slave owner nobody&rsquo;s mom or dad was either and chances are neither was your grand parents. Why is it taboo to say white power but its totally acceptable to say black power?? why is it you want me to feel guilty about??  because it will be a cold day in hell before I feel guilty about something  nor my ancestors had a hand in. I check the mail every day yet my white privilege has yet to show up. Why is it we only talk about white on black violence when it&rsquo;s been black on white  just the same. The hypocrisy is outstanding. You can&rsquo;t fight hate with hate and the hate won&rsquo;t stop until everyone releases there is only ONE RACE. And everyone in that race matters. To say black lives matter then you get upset when someone says all lives matter?? Just because you are black or white what makes you&rsquo;re  life matter and mine not? What makes you&rsquo;re life more significant than mine or Visa versa..this trying to re write history  has got to stop that&rsquo;s straight out of the nazi play book remove statues re write history books really????? Enough is enough.  I dont recall my grand father fight nazi&rsquo;s in Europe just for the white man but for EVERY man woman and child. Yet you want to take plays out of the nazi&rsquo;s  book?

<p>Let&rsquo;s just hope the name wil not be &lsquo;School&rsquo;y Mc Schoolface &lsquo;. His suggestion sounds perfect, somewhat should start voting for him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SAVAGE!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn, that black guy is intelligent. Also VERY articulate and all great points. He literally BURIED that white woman and made her look, I think permanently, like a racist, old fool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woop my brother go tell it like it is respect due</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bredren,  you brought me to tears!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You said EVERYTHING,  that needs to be Said-and needs to be Heard!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are Educated!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are Proud!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scrape these ignorant, racist barnacles from all public offices&hellip;VOTE BLUE!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools, streets and statues should be made/named for black Americans who came into power and influence during reconstruction. If white southerners feel the need to honor their ancestors why don&rsquo;t they pick the few abolitionist southerners who became lawyers and tried to fight to end slavery or sold their families plantations and freed their slaves and moved North to help the abolitionist movement. Their is not a huge amount but their are some. Why don&rsquo;t they focus on them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve watched this more than once. No one could have voiced it better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lee was a traitor, who violated his oath to the United States, preferring to act in his own self-interest and wealth as a slave-owning planter. In reality, it had nothing to do with the later myths of &ldquo;States&rsquo; Rights&rdquo;, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woooow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gary Chambers! You are superb. Eloquent and forceful. Good for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sure didn&rsquo;t know all that stuff about REL,&hellip;they don&rsquo;t teach that stuff in the classes do they? Especially when the school is named after him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standing ovation 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👍</p>
</li>

<p>Very very NICE&raquo;&raquo;&raquo;

<p>This was a powerful video and interview. This gentleman needs to run for office. I’m extremely impressed with Gary’s activism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>America, HOW COME this man (Mr. Chambers), ostensibly a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; member of the public, is SO clearly, more INTELLIGENT, more EMPATHETIC, more RESPONSIBLE, &amp; more MORALISTIC, than your f**%ing president?! HOW??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git down! Telling it like it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy rocks!  More!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to be a confederate statues on public lands go to a battlefield and only there just like having a nazi paraphernalia at a concentration camp where historical context is there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this guy! He just says all the things I want to say but in a much more concise and digestible way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOW!!!!! That was powerful!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fuck, that was bad ass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Bitch SLAP that Karen mmmmmmmm tasty. This is a competent man he may not really want to be in politics but hey he should be replacing that Karen^ Katty Banard bitch</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Bravo! That was absolutely amazing facts they needed to hear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, the speaker did his homework and knows the history.🙌🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man should run for office</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In UK we say annually..&lsquo;Lest we forget&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That do sound like a real American story.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You showed them tyrants!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol I fucking love this dude. Who is this haha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WTF? Trump ads? Skank ass skunk pussy bitch Laura Trump. Who is responsible for running this ad? Before and during your program. I got the feeling that you guys are anti-Trump. What&rsquo;s next?Hitler ads?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whew! Gary read them their rights!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bravo sir.  Bless your heart.  Tell it like it is&hellip;the right way, not the white way.
