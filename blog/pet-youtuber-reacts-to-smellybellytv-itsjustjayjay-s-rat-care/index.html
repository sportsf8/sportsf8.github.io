<li>
<p>Videos of people mistreating their pets or not being educated on proper pet care make me sick to my stomach&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people are ridiculous and think they can not look after them just because they are small and don‚Äôt live long. this is ridiculous! rats need the same amount of care as dogs and cats, which means if you don‚Äôt want to look after them with the right amount of care and giving them attention, DO NOT GET ONE! the same applies to mice, hamsters and any other animals you may wish to have. look after them! anyways, love you emi! thanks for telling everyone how to actually look  after their animals, i just wish people would listen more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughter: we did return him bc he was sick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mom: Well it&rsquo;s not our fault it happens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: NO it&rsquo;s entirely your fault it doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;just happen&rdquo; this is a living creature you guys seem financially stable just take him to the vet üôÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so bad for these poor babies, that was shocking tbh. Off-topic, I love the red tones in your hair Emi. Hope you are keeping well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>their videos are incredibly infuriating as someone who owns are cares about rats deeply. really wish their comments weren‚Äôt off üòë</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frankly, I think you were MUCH too kind to them. What they‚Äôre doing is horrifying, and although it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre just uneducated, the SHOULD be educated, and they need to be told what they need to do since they‚Äôre not going to find that info themselves. I appreciate what your doing (and I love your channel so much, don‚Äôt worry!) but you probably need to be more firm with the people it‚Äôs directed at, since I think this could just sound like a ‚Äòsuggestion‚Äô to them rather than a necessity of what they HAVE to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completely unrelated to the video but&hellip;. I can‚Äôt help but fall in love with the stickers that are on Orbit‚Äôs enclosure!! üíó‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know she felt guilty about the baby who passed away, but that&rsquo;s not a reason to buy more&hellip;.especially when they seem like they don&rsquo;t even really like them? Why would you get a pet you don&rsquo;t really want? I don&rsquo;t get it?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(on a more positive note..I love your content Emi :) thanks to your advice my ratties are so happy, thank you!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These are the kinds of people that should be effected by cancel culture. But instead we lost Jenna. The world is truly awful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really hate her reaction to the albino, like I get joking oh I have an ugly pet (I have a kinda gross looking dog and make those joke but I love her) but she actually sounded like she disliked it or was grossed out by it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes me so upset when people don‚Äôt research or look after their animals properly, animals are living creatures not toys or accessoriesüòî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What really made me mad about this is that she called her own pet discussing&hellip;&hellip;.. don‚Äôt do that! It‚Äôs so frustrating when people don‚Äôt take care of their animals properly, and don‚Äôt do the proper research&hellip;&hellip;..I don‚Äôt have a rat but I have a hamster and I did plenty of research before I decided to get her so I knew what to do!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don‚Äôt understand why people go out and get a new pet probably for ‚Äòviews‚Äô anyways every other video is a getting a new pet video I just find it a bit irresponsible ngl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fact that they gave the poor rat 3 baths absolutely shocked me. i couldn&rsquo;t even imagine being sick, and being stressed out at the same time. this just breaks my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you handled this very well, It gave me a vibe of non-aggressive, and wanting to help. I would love to see some collabs of you helping new rat owners would be cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you just go buy a pet and not do any research about them???

<p>This makes me want to banish everyone that treats animals like this. It‚Äôs so annoying and I hate it. Even if they are small, and don‚Äôt live long, doesn‚Äôt mean that they can live in horrible conditions. They deserve so much more, and people need to learn research.üòîü•∫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart broke throughout this entire video. I really hope they see this and make changes ASAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a idea you should post daily stories with all ur pets!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ohh these videos make me so angry and stressed out. I hate how they call the rat &ldquo;ugly and disgusting&rdquo;.. Like why the hell buy rats if you think that way?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw her fish videos and I got so mad because her fish care is not the best too üòî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are big channels buying animals without research!!?? It makes me so mad!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I clicked as fast as possible as I got the notification while watching one of her previous vids üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gosh, when she introduced them it made me so stressed! Poor babies! üò•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It annoys me so much to see people who have the money to care for their animals properly but then do no research on how to actually care for a living creature, I hope they see this vid and change EVERYTHING about their rat care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How could anyone call red eyed rats ugly? üò≠ If I can get rats in the future I want a white one with red eyes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Animals are not toys üòî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does no body research? üò©</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They also got ferrets and made them meet. the ferrets started biting the rats. Its just shocking that people think its okay. They&rsquo;re such big influencer&rsquo;s as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rats are not just disposable toys. It is not okay to return a new pet just because it has a slight health problem. You are the owner and now have the responsibility to care for it properly and give it the vet attention it needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rats are the kindest and most beautiful creatures that deserve so much more than these horrid people. Stay strong rats, one day everybody will love you just as much as I do (so A LOT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That poor little albino rat is so cute. I want to give him little bits of yogurt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy people are finally reacting to smellybellyTv pet care, I hope they see this and finally do research :) B/c it makes me sad to see parents buy kids pets and the parent or kid doesn&rsquo;t do any research and the pet lives a bad life. And I&rsquo;d never want that for any pet :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I havent watched this yet but im already scared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emi please give wispa and and Twix a cuddle from meü•∞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you see that they let there ferrets play with there RATS!

<p>The ferret bite the rat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love your vids as getting rats after lockdown</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this video is making me so anxious üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dislikes are the mom dad and the girl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to reserve my three boys today! I&rsquo;ll probably take them home in a week and a bit. luckily the Mainely Rat Rescue has fosters close to me so I can adopt instead of buying from a pet store or breeder. :) your channel has helped me a lot with research so thank you!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi emi,u make my day when u make a video,your rats are really cute and ive been watching for quite a while,i want to start  a small youtube channel but im not sure how,u have inspired me lots!‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re so calm, I was so nervous through the entire thing. Especially when she showed that hamster potty. That is not a proper litter pan for a rat&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know how one would even fit in and turn around with its tail.  Bless you for so kindly helping, I hope that family sees this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for reacting to this. I would have commented on their channel but you know, comments off. It makes me so annoyed as young children are watching this. Edit: how are all the pets and rats and when will you be introducing Twix and Wispa? And had to take a rat to the vet, is everything ok?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got a bit sad when they said they got  a different rat because the other 1 was sick :/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i have a albino rat named stuie and he‚Äôs the cutest little thing i‚Äôve ever seen and seeing them call their albino ugly makes me so upset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how did you stay so calmüòÇ i was literally screaming inside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for reviewing this! I requested it a few weeks ago! They are also mistreating their other animals (such as ferrets), and it‚Äôs really sad. I really appreciate you for doing this, they really need to correct their care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love your hair!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im getting my rats next friday!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my goodness this is just so worrisome.  Everything just feels soo stressful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate when people just go, &ldquo;Oh my gosh look how cute that rat/? is! They are so small, I bet they are really easy to take care of!!! Lets go get one we will just get the rat from the pet shop and ask what they need and buy it from them and we will have it!&rdquo; Its so annoying when people can&rsquo;t be bothered to do proper re-search because they think its easy. :/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i can&rsquo;t believe that there are parents out there who teach their children that it&rsquo;s okay to just get a random pet without doing research and that they can just return them?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pazuandfriends just reacted to this channel&rsquo;s ferret care. spoiler alert: they introduce the ferrets to the rats. It was hard to watch such a dangerous situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can u also react to paul cuffaro rat care? he recently got a rat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how did you stay so calm?

<p>It took me about 6 months to prepare for my mice. The fact that people go into the store not even knowing what the full name of the animal is just breaks my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the beginning, I had the same starter cage filled to the brim with toys and hammocks but I‚Äôm getting a dcn for my birthday soon.I love your channelüíïüíïüíï</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad more well known youtubers are reacting to smelly belly. The video where they introduce their rats to ferrets had my anxiety through the roof.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw this video and I was like omg! The entire time I was sat there so concerned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When are you going to do a vlog of your animals?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first rats I got were from pets at home and their names were henry and harold. Henry was an albino and he was the sweetest little thing, I really dont get the stereotype.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look like all the pet community is reacting to them  and its honestly important to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feeder rat babies are really difficult to raise. I&rsquo;ve had 2, and I literally had to feed them every 2-3 hours. Whenever I was awake, I would &ldquo;wear&rdquo; them in my hoodie or play with them. They are doing splendid now, but you can&rsquo;t put that kind of responsibility on a kid. Love your channel Emi-it&rsquo;s helped me so much in my ratties&rsquo; life quality!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watch this family and was a bit upset by this video, also all I can think of is the fact that, that bottle wasn&rsquo;t even releasing milk. Iv had to use that exact bottle to hand raise a kitten who is 3 now and all the nipples are closed and need to be punctured with a whole and it takes alot to make a good size whole and I didn&rsquo;t see any milk coming from it, I could be wrong but I wanted to see who else thought the same? Other than that I did see their new video on the daughters channel and they got a friend for their rat. Any way I do love their videos but it&rsquo;s always hard to watch videos like this when you know better what they are doing wrong, all we can do it make suggestions. Loved your video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They re likely to get a good that&rsquo;s very unhealthy food and bedding, I did research for months before I got rats. And if they bothered to do just a little bit of freaking research they would know to get 2!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This just broke my heart poor baby I just want to take them both and give them the care they deserveüò°üò•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you ever see this i‚Äôm planning on removing the levels in my ferret nation so what would you recommend to connect the floors? also how often should i feed them salad?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it‚Äôs so sad how people just buy pets for show and don‚Äôt  even do a single bit of research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YES! I seen they got rats, there care is horrible, i wish ppl could just take a few months to do some research instead of impulsively buying a living creature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i watched that video and called it a &ldquo;rat mansion&rdquo; nope it&rsquo;s the right size for a couple of rats and there is not enough bedding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>these people annoy me so much and I was so happy that you could see this emi and sort this out in a calm and respectful manner. you are just such a kind person :) thank you for being a part of this world xxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Itsjustjayjay did actually inspired me too get a rat, but I had already learned had to take care of them so I didnt take their advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a happier note: How are your baby rats?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They also made a video where they put their rats in the ferrets play pen with them and the ferret tried to chew the rats ear</p>

<li>
<p>They are narcissists with no ability to accept fault or criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have so much love for my rats, it was hard to watch this üò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i LOVE their channel and jayla, but i think she should take more cate of her rats. She was a main reason i got rats because of how cute they looked. I did a lot of research before i got one and i realized how bad she took care of them..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those EARS! Once I saw the look on the white rat&rsquo;s face and those &ldquo;I am terrified, I might die&rdquo; ears I was absolutely furious. These people have no place owning rats or any small mammal for that matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video makes me so mad. You are being way to nice by saying everything isn‚Äôt their fault but it completely is. It‚Äôs not that hard to do your own research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi! I‚Äôm a massive fan and recently I‚Äôve gotten four ratties and I love them so much ,your videos have been really helpful but in one of your previous videos I saw you put some vitamin stuff in their drink and I was wondering what it was called. I absolutely love your channel x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I SAW THAT VIDEO AND STARTED CRYING&hellip; ITS SO BADDD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the rat starter kit is fine just can&rsquo;t hold more than 2-3 rats. Love the video! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think you should do more videos like this! It could help more people who just impulse bought and are treating they‚Äôre rats similarly that what they‚Äôre doing is wrong. And the way you explain things isn‚Äôt aggressive so they‚Äôre more likely to listen instead of just being defensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who don‚Äôt research before getting an animal make me so mad&hellip; you are the sole provider for this animal you should want to give them the best life &amp; be educated on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16:43 Exactly how I felt!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s extremely disappointing to see this kind of care from such large and influential channel. If you didn&rsquo;t see the other video, they ended up putting their rats with their ferrets for a &ldquo;playdate.&rdquo; :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have both rats and ferrets, and I&rsquo;m also a small-scale breeder. Some of my rats are feeders for my ferrets. They&rsquo;re natural prey for them, so it&rsquo;s heartbreaking that they think it&rsquo;s okay to let them &ldquo;play&rdquo; together. üòì</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what they would have done with one rat I had that had a teeth problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its teeth didn&rsquo;t line up properly so the upper teeth did not wear down as they should have done, it was a trip to the vet every 2-3 weeks to have the them clipped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s when you find out how quickly their teeth grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi Emily, I love your videos sooo much! Have A GREAT day! :D :) &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>beyb,, all the footage of albino rat was so stressful!! like if i were that rat I&rsquo;d die on the spot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes me so mad when people just buy animals from a pet store without proper knowledge on their care. And just buying them from a pet store in general.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>emi can u please react to me getting my rats in posting the video soon I really want u to let me now how I do since I‚Äôm going to a rat mum for the first time if u don‚Äôt want to that‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôm just really nervous so if u could help me that would be great xx

<p>Are ratrations a good place to get rodent food ( rat/mice/hamster ) since I‚Äôm looking into getting a better quality food for my hamster and I was looking into getting rats in the future so would want to have a high quality food.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These videos stress me out so much uggh hurts my heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video made me cry, why are people so cruel and heartless. So sad to see people providing such poor care for these beautiful rattiesüò•üò•</p>

<li>
<p>Hi I‚Äôm getting pet baby rats in a few weeks! I‚Äôve been doing a lot of research but would love to know if anyone has anything I should know I would really appreciate it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video breaks my bloody heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>these vids make me so so uncomfortable, I can barely watch it, im too upset</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Need to calm down from this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i cant watch this :&lt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>these videos from Smellybellytv &amp; Its justjayjay  triggers me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>omg yess i was waiting for her to make a video on this because they need to know that this is wrong:(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really hope they see this! So they can do a couple of things! Love you and your vids!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have the starter cage for my rat and she loves her cage and she‚Äôs fine with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The worst part is I commented on there video saying ‚ÄúI feel sorry for your rats‚Äù and telling them how to take care of pet rats and they ignored me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in their newest video they introduce their rats to their ferrets. they horribly mistreat their ferrets &amp; did no research at all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emi, please contact them via mail or something, those rats really really need better care and you‚Äôre such a sweet person and respected YouTuber in the  pet and rat community. I think it would be better to make sure those people could receive adequate information. Or else let‚Äôs send someone to rescue those poor little babies. My heart is aching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Totally unrelated but where did you get that little rat with the mushroom decoration up on your shelf? It&rsquo;s so cute I want oneü•∫‚ú®</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got my girls sooner than expected and i have had them for almost 1 week! one of my girls comes up to the front when i open in the cage put my other rat is still very skittish if you have any advice for me that would be greatly appreciated. :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for doing this bc you r really helping people who watch there channel. Also I love your videos I dont have rats but I do know there care because I love all animals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am very sad to see some of the things in their video&hellip; though I admit when I first got into rats I probably wasn&rsquo;t the best owner either. There is a shocking lack of information for their care. I really do appreciate you making lots of content so people can avoid mistakes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for doing this. I made one for their ferret care and they responded absolutely refusing to change anything, which is incredibly disappointing. Thank you thank you thank you!

<p>Disgusting? Ew? WHAT?! He‚Äôs an adorable, innocent baby rat and she‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs a dog turd, even trying to pick him up like one. Literally, getting a paper towel and picking him up is the same way I clean after my dog when she‚Äôs had an accident. How can you see a cute little animal that way??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I adore your channel, but I really cannot finish watching this. It makes me SO upset. Bless you for being so calm and praising where they did good. I couldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their video infuriates me why go out out and get another pet especially out if the blue, uneducated? Very irresponsible üòí</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My male rats use their wheel as a bed or a shit box üòî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have that cage that the family bought, and I love it! Although I think its overpriced, I think it&rsquo;s a good cage beach the bar spacing is small enough for even young rats. I own 3 female rats and they can choose all day and night long, whether they want to be in the cage or just play outside. I made a big short of play pen out of plexiglas (not cardboard or bars) so they cant escape. I only use the wheel it came with and it&rsquo;s really quiet. The hammock is only in use when I run out of my other ones. Overall the cage is really crowded and full of climbing options (I learned from your channel not to use shelves to keep them busy and active, so thank u for that‚ù§).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even watch this video of you criticizing them because they stress me out too much. They are awful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you clock the essential oil device on the bookshelf when she was doing the&quot;mansion&rdquo; tour? Big yikes for their lil resp systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes! I love this video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i watch these YouTubers videos and I was kinda disappointed when I was the cages :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi!Is there a video on how to make a base for a dcn?I looked it up and I don‚Äôt know if you made a video but I couldn‚Äôt find one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love your channel!üíïüíïüíï</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was very stressful to watch. Poor animals üò±üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating a fun and enriching cage is one of my favourite thing about owning rats, it so fun to walk around the dollar store and imagining how you can use some random object in the cage and then watching them explore and have fun in when you put it in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you!! I commented on their video kindly telling them what they could do to make it more comfortable but I got attacked by their supporters saying I was hating and that it was non of my business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I get a reply? I love you!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just got my mice a detolf!! i decorate fit like yours!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant believe that people like this aren&rsquo;t doing research before getting an animal its absolutely irresponsible and cruel towards the animal‚òπ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üò≥üò≥ some people just shouldn‚Äòt have pets&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watch there channel but when she got rats I always try to comment to saying that she needs more in there cage. I like there channel but they need to do more research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am so sorry to let you know but you might want to watch smellybellytv video titled we try to have the ferrets swim. In that video they put the rats in a playpen with ferrets! Poor things are gonna be traumatized with this family or worse be killed by ferrets. They are already getting a lot of bad rep from the ferret community from the way they are caring for the ferrets. They ignore and delete friendly recommendations from their comments section. So sad.

<p>It‚Äôs so upsetting to watch let alone from a youtubber who have millions of subscribers! Like you mentioned fare enough when you do get a pet from the pet shop you are buying an animals they is supose to be healthy  if need be I would of gotten my money back and maybe we went to different shop cause who knows if the other rats the single rat was with are sick as well, unfortunately depending where you live you don‚Äôt find many rat breeders and you have to rely on pet shop and the poor rats are scared and not social. I am lucky enough to find a good breeder to which I got my 4 girls from but when I was living in a different city you could not find rats even as feeders. The only good thing was the cage size but like you mentioned take the level outs and decorate. Always a pleasure watching your video hopefully this family see your video and does more improvement ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>Hi! Can you react to my cage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry Emi, I couldn&rsquo;t finish your video. These people are so&hellip;uhg to put it nicely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please could you review my rat cage and my rats food and it‚Äôs environment X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gosh that&rsquo;s just awful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched her videos a few days ago and cringed so hard thank you for putting it out there that this is horrible rat care!  üêÄüêÅ‚ùå I think people just get rats as a joke because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;funny&rdquo; (the you&rsquo;re a rat joke) I&rsquo;m really happy that Emi stood up and told these people what they were doing wrong and what they can do better next time, not trying to be angry just trying to give them criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do not like this rat care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I personally think you should to TONS! Of research before getting a rat or any animal. I‚Äôve been watching Emiology for 2 years and after a BUT LOAD of research I decided rats weren‚Äôt for me! But I still love them and will get them one day!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg I saw this video it made me cry and they got one rat to begin with üòµüòµ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üö®PET RAT UPDATEüö®</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so since they got the rats, they decided to also get farrets&hellip; the ferrets aren&rsquo;t being properly housed and their care isn&rsquo;t the best. ALSO FOR SOME REASON THEYY PUT THE  RATS WITH THE FERRETS!?! THAT IS NOT OK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sorry but I can&rsquo;t fully watch the video, their behavior made me sick, as a rat owner I can&rsquo;t believe and understand how bad they are at taking care of them and the way they see animals as object&hellip; They literally  replace the dead baby!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love you and your videos so much but this is too much for me!

<p>i have a baby orphan rat and he seems to be good with how i am taking care of him i feed him goat milk do you have any advice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another youtuber made a video about them making their ferrets and rats play&hellip; If you don&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s like letting your cat play with rats, for ferrets they&rsquo;re food</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are serious issues with this family. I hate people who don‚Äôt do pet research before bringing a pet home. And shame on the parents for allowing this. It may be a rat but it is still a life. Treat it properly. Also, Petsmucks is a bad company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt understand how you can just not do research. Like I‚Äôve already done a whole bunch of research and I‚Äôm not even getting rats till mid fall. Plus what is she going to do when the rats get sick from the stress? Is she just going to return them too? If you don‚Äôt do your research and just decide to impulse buy you‚Äôre basically just being neglectful and cruel and it is your fault if they get stressed and sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please can anyone suggest some good pellet mixes? I have 2 older and 2 younger rats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:29 is it ok if I do it? My dog has never bitten me or anyone else. And she is also really friendly with my guinea pigs. So we were thinking of introducing them a few weeks after we get them. (She also can‚Äôt bark, so she probably wouldn‚Äôt scare them. Yes I know it‚Äôs weird but she is 4 and she has NEVER barkedüòÇ)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is really sad to watch. It‚Äôs so important to realize that any animal, especially a pocket pet, requires research before getting. That‚Äôs so unfortunate that they found the rat gross. Why get them in the first place? I hope they learn more and provide better care for these sweet pets. This was a very appropriate and mature way to address these concerns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi emi!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a mystery rat that might be a feeder and might be a fancy rat xd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your videos are great because you are honest and share your expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I currently live with a feline and no rodents but you give me memories of the Gerbil, Hamsters and Mice I used to care for. X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In their ferret video they put the rats with the ferrets so they could be &ldquo;friends&rdquo;. This is very dangerous considering that ferrets see rats and mice as prey animals. When they started biting the rats they put it off and just said that the pet store person had said that they have rats and ferrets that get along. This is possible if they were raised together, but in their case it is not a good idea. This video also led me to look at their other animal videos and it looks like they either return the animals, they pass away due to bad care, or they are re-homed after the &ldquo;New Animal&rdquo; video is made. For example, a few months ago they made a video on getting a bird for Jayla ( the one that &quot; takes care&rdquo; of the rats) named Ody. After making a video on the new bird that they also got from the pet store, it wasn&rsquo;t in any of their videos. I even looked in Jayla&rsquo;s room tour video that was in this video and there wasn&rsquo;t a bird or a cage. There is also no way that the bird passed away due to age because it was a quaker parrot and they usually live for a long time. It is really sad knowing that many people who watch these types of videos think that this is ok for animals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All I can say is y i k e s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg thise ppl needs to not own rats its horrible to watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>does someone mind telling me what a good food for rats is and also how to change their diet in a safe way because when i got mine, they were on a pellet diet and i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too good for them. ty :))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§¶üèº</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the first video of yours I just can&rsquo;t finish. Its awful, how can people treat their pets like that ?? imma go watch your other videos where the rats are actually loved and cared for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next can you please react to Paul Curaffos buying a pet rat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earlyyyyy

<p>I was watching your video and noticed you said the rlly big cage the girl had at the end was good for 2 rats and it gave me a bit of a fright cuz i was planning on having 3 female rats in my cage with the measurements of 81x54x89. I checked the cage calculator website and it said I could fit 6 rats, but I don‚Äôt want to cram too many in so I was wondering if I could get a second opinion which might be kinder for the rats. Rlly good video btw and I‚Äôm in love with all your animalsü•∞</p>

<p>Tell my rats hi petunia and Rosie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whalen she said it was ugly I was furious no rat is ugly they are all wonderful and most beautiful creatures and plus it doesn‚Äôt matter on how they look I think the most important thing with rats is the bond you have with them and the rats personality I didn‚Äôt choose my rats on how they looked I let them choose me over a period of time and aswell shaking the rat out of the box and grabbing it and squeezing it with a tissue the rat is only going to become angry and try to bite you have they not done any research I think they are really irasponsble for doing this and abusive. And then there it is there it is she RETURNED THE RAT WHAT KIND OF PERSON DOES THIS IF YOUR GOING TO DO THIS THEN DONT GET RATS AT ALL. I am genuinely really upset and angryüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏èüò°üò°üò°</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s unbelievable that they couldn&rsquo;t tell that the rat was stressed out from bathing. Like, it surprises me how bad people are at reading basic animal body language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanna get four rats and name them after the marauders. Yes, I own three cats, two of which have eaten both birds and mice before, the other one is lazy, fat, steals other cats food and lives with my grandparents. My mom also hates rodents. I really want rats though. I was debating his for a few months now and feel now confident enough, that rats might be an option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you make a video on how to make a healthy homemade rat food? Please?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss my babies. I realize that I could‚Äôve done better. But Jesus I was not as bad at this guy. I just didn‚Äôt give my baby enough toys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aw so sad seeing people who don‚Äôt adore their pets and want to do the best by them üòî I‚Äôve seen a few pet-tubers comment on kid‚Äôs pet channels and it‚Äôs so sad when the kids and the parents ignore or shut off comments. It‚Äôs okay to admit when you‚Äôre wrong! It‚Äôs not okay to keep making the same mistakes because you‚Äôre too proud to listen to advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should do a video on is it a good idea to buy rats online</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your animal is sick, you take it to the vet. There is NO excuse for this behavior. She&rsquo;s uneducated because she can&rsquo;t be bothered to do some research. This makes me so upset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t watch their video mainly because it&rsquo;s obvious they have absolutely no idea what there doing. Thank you Emi for making these types of videos to educate people what mistakes people make. But the last one you made about &ldquo;Funny&rdquo; rat and other animal videos genuinely made me cry. But I showed it to my friend and she was horrified even though she doesn&rsquo;t really like animals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ugh I already have their channel but serisouly!! They do not need rats they are very sensitive pets. I know dam well they don&rsquo;t know the hell what they&rsquo;re doing. Uhhhhh. This drives me crazy. They don&rsquo;t need anymore pets. And going to a pet store for advice, is stupid. They re most likely just going to recommend all the products they carry. Probably the most expensive ones too. This urks me so much.</p>

<p>God this care is so horrible, I&rsquo;m gutted. Not researching care beforehand can really traumatize an animal. :'(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For their rats sake and for their children&rsquo;s sake , I hope that the parents can take some of the advice from this video to heart and do what is needed to improve their care so they can have a happier relationship with their new pets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHY DID THE BLOW DRY THE POOR RAT?!?!? Not sticking a massive loud scary machine next to a delicate baby animal is just common sense!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish people would educate themselves before buying pets :/ as you said in your video, it‚Äôs so stressful watching someone go into a pet store not knowing which pet they‚Äôll come out with. So irresponsible. I‚Äôve dm‚Äôed both parents and their joined instagram recommending them to watch this video! I encourage others to do the same, but please please please be kind if you do it. We don‚Äôt want them becoming defensive if they suddenly feel attacked by a bunch of people. But since their yt comments are off, that‚Äôs probably the best place to get in contact with them ^_^</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do your research  people

<p>I just got a rat yesterday and she keeps sneezing is she sick?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember when I saw them just get a quaker parrot for their kid on a whim and parrots are a big commitment. Then I also saw them get a betta fish for their oldest kid and they put it in a bowl. It‚Äôs just so sad seeing parents letting their kids get whatever pets their little hearts desire, without making their kids research before getting any of those pets, like my mother did and taught me to research all animals I want to get.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You‚Äôre right, rats are good pets for kids with responsible adult supervision - thing is, their parents seem to be more focused on creating content and being ‚Äòcool‚Äô rather than actually caring for the many animals they have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi second</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand how people get pets, don&rsquo;t do ANY research and then complain about the pet smelling,being aggressive, biting and even dying. These people just anger me üòíüò§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8th yay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am so horrified by these clips. They act like he is a toy and not a living creature. I am very sensitive to animal care and it was all i could do to not throw up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am surprised to see rats in a wire cage . I once kept several rats in a wire cage who were handleable and docile out of the cage . I made the mistake of brushing my arm up against the wire one day and a couple of them ferociously bit me through the cage , lol  . It seemed like they were trying to pull my skin in . I couldn&rsquo;t believe it . Have you ever heard of rats doing this ? And yes they were well fed and taken care of . lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By far the worst rat owner I have seen&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great video love it so great</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt understand how people can just buy a pet and do no research what so ever and just get it as a ‚Äútoy‚Äù. Watching these people treat the rat so poorly and not even bother to look up how to treat these animals correctly. Rats are such social and intelligent animals that don‚Äôt deserve this kind of treatment, and need to be given so much more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate it when people do animal (care) videos then turn off the comments. Usually they do something SO wrong and I want to comment, letting them know that they&rsquo;re abusing the animal but I can&rsquo;t tell them!!! üò∞üò≠. I tried looking up SLICK SLIME SAM&rsquo;s email because there is this one video where they are &ldquo;caring&rdquo; for they&rsquo;re rat (notice this isn&rsquo;t plural) but I CAN&rsquo;T COMMENT!!! The agony!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My rats are from a pet store. I do agree that breeder rats are better, though if a pet store is the only available option someone has to get some rats I do not think it&rsquo;s wrong to get them there. Massive pet stores will always be a thing and not buying pets from them isn&rsquo;t going to change anything. If it&rsquo;s my only option and the animals are not being kept in a good condition, I would feel happy to adopt them and make their lives good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would people ever get a pet without doing proper research? Are you gonna get a dog without knowing what to get for it? No! Why would you do that for small animals? Size doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt matter</p>
</li>
