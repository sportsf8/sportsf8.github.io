<li>
<p>It is well known where the funding for their home, security &amp; luxuries come from. But the British Taxpayers are ALSO paying for their three PR Firms, the personal photographers she takes to her &ldquo;charity&rdquo; publicity stunts, Staff &amp; Servants and the setting up &amp; branding of her &ldquo;companies&rdquo;. The amounts of OTHER people&rsquo;s money &ldquo;this woman&rdquo; is spending,&hellip; is WAAY MORE than what is known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always said there would be a pay off for a divorce.Or it‚Äôs another tax evasion plot these two have conjured up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Princess‚Äôs Eugenie and Beatrice lost their security years ago and they manage just fine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s playing out as people knew it would. Dim Wit hasn&rsquo;t a CLUE about the real world and how much things ACTUALLY cost&hellip; and as for the Markle creature&hellip; Well! She thought she&rsquo;d married the goose that laid the golden egg! Lol üòé this is the universe playing its wonderful joke! Quite simply, the are living WAY above their means. In Montecito terms, these two are actually very poor&hellip; Same with Hollywood lol üòÅ in contrast to their potential friends, they don&rsquo;t have a pot to piss in, as we Brits say lol üòÅü§£ Will they learn from this? Well&hellip; that is the eternal question. I&rsquo;m not a betting man, but I&rsquo;d say the odds are stacked against them&hellip; Perhaps a nice little semi with an Intex swimming pool for little Archie?? For those in the states&hellip; Google semi detached&hellip; It will explain it to you&hellip; A tough lesson to learn for these two&hellip; But quite simply, they are batting WAY above their league and they need a good old reality check&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She called the paps for her dentist appointment because there is a IVF doctor in the office  The rumors ran rampart.  It would not been such  a big deal if that doctor wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they weren‚Äôt so busy insulting the world, perhaps they wouldn‚Äôt need security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MM will soon have that smirk smile knocked off her face me thinks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s common news now that Charlse stumped up the deposit on the new home. That&rsquo;s come from the Dutchy of  Cornwall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That means the Dutchy will own 90/ 95 % of it. Tax free of course. That&rsquo;s another blow for the WANNABE be mm.ü§≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There would be uproar if they tried to slither back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps they could move to North Sentinel Island. No paps, no perks, nothing fine or fancy. Just a stone age society waiting to be &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m really disgusted. The super rich are just tooo devious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was mentioned in our papers today saying that Harry and Megan have been heart broken by all the negative news about them o. The internet. What did they think it was going to be a big bed of roses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So is this the reason. They both look very ill lately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;ve hardly turned their backs to the dole they&rsquo;re milking from the UK taxpayers for absolutely nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What actually come off their zoom calls? Other than propaganda for them. It&rsquo;s not like there us a reason for them to talk to them, its not as if an action plan follow from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s like them. Just hot air fakery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where&rsquo;s the missing Charity money MeGain ????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There security bill has fell from  four million down to one million.So the money is not coming in as they thought it would

<li>
<p>This is another ploy to protect Harry‚Äôs assets so greedy megs. Can‚Äôt get her dirty mitts on it.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>And she buys a watch  for 5000 dollars then has it engraved To Megan Markle from Megan Markle and i love me too.ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish they would just move to Africa like Harry wanted too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a pair of pair   . Of freebies  cant you see  it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harry and Meghan Marble are trying to destroy the Monarchy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LONG LIVE THE QUEEN&hellip;THE MYSTIQUE IS GONE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SO SAD üò• FOR THE BRITS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps hapless got something up his sleeve and is planning to do the off and has put things in her name so she got nothing to whine and whinge about when he goes back to UK and leaves megalo behind in US because he fed up of being megalo&rsquo;s mug!&hellip;ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÜ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She  doesn&rsquo;t  want to  fit in,that wasn&rsquo;t  her plan just wants the  $$$$$$$$,so far  its  RAINING.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are not welcome by the people Of England or  Shetland are you kidding.we love our queen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re no longer royals, why the never ending security issues? And I&rsquo;m beginning to believe megan&rsquo;s hate of the media people is just pretensions! She wants attention!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IF HARRY &amp; MM come back to the UK, be sure that they will be BOOED publicly at every event they attend&hellip; personally I can&rsquo;t wait until they hear the UK&rsquo;s feelings towards them, they should be exiled/and titles removed for treason!!!  pure and simple</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>there is no money when Harry turns 40&hellip;.. this is fake information</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does prince Charles get in all this ? Besides getting insulted and humiliated ? Is he really toxic ? Should he be king if he is spending tax money on these two lazy , freeloaders . No Body is interested in them and don‚Äôt need security , except makes , difficult dutches make look important . Aspiring Oscar  , was she really joking ? The show was ending when she had her clutches into Harry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There STILL NOT  FINANCIALLY  INDEPENDENT, DOESN&rsquo;T  MATTER ,THEY DIDNT  PAY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nope Harry, sorry, it&rsquo;s totally Megs company&hellip;..She will have told him that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s a tax write off&hellip;you can claim part of the house as a tax deduction.  But that also means that Megs gets the whole house in a divorce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These two are vulgar. Bring on Republic in Australia. Royals are becoming irrelevant. Laughing StocksüòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did the Queen really hop the ditch to see Harry (and avoid Meghan as much as possible lol)???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop all allowances immediately.  They stepped away, no longer Royals.  Royal Family should cut them now.  No need to wait for the year they were given.  They are not keeping their side of the contract.  Cut them off ASAP!!! Money should be used to assist those who are hurting from pandemic and in need. Forget security.  No one cares about them.

<p>I was under the impression that MM owed the USA IRS for non payment of taxes&hellip; who will pay this, is this why she used a LLC to buy the mansion&hellip;.  WHERE IS THE CHARITY MONEY RAISED WHILE THEY WERE ROYAL?????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Golbe  mag is not  a Reputable  place to get your news.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They both have  shown how uneducated they are  in everything that they have attempted. Folks in Hollywood  workwd for what they are affording, unlike M,  marrying, suing, lie using men, on her way. Up the ladder.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>WRONG: FIRST: Meghan has taxproblems in the U.S&hellip;still&hellip;it is not in her name and even if the LTD would be in her name&hellip;she would have more tax problems&hellip;if Harry owns 80% she  is out anyway&hellip;.it is not her house&hellip;I know this kind of business</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SECOND: the dutchy money is still Charles money as he is the next king&hellip;when he becomes king it goes to William</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont think charles has the back bone to be king with wat hes allowing to keep these to ungratefull brats god help us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They never tried to live a private life. MM keeps doing public relations stunt. After all they have done, they better dig themselves a hole if they move back to England The tower of London could work real good for the Harkles. MM is the Queen of tacky</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sick  of these to   take everything away there traiters   if not end the royals  public pay for there wrongs so should they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes why should we pay there security real princesss eug and bea        havnt got it so why the brats get is   the royals are not fare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Alcatraz free?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is still being a grifter $$$$$$$$$$$$$ never enough$$$$$$</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly hope Prince William becomes the next king. Charles should step down or more money of the Tax payers money would go to Meghan and Harry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a older Brit and I wouldn&rsquo;t give them any thing other than help them both get  job&rsquo;s in a supermarket stacking shelves. Better make it night shifts. Because they won&rsquo;t get ANY SECURITY  . And if a member of the public sees them and verbally abuses them they can deal with it the same as anyone else. They did say they wanted to be  normal people and treated the same. Well I would let them have that. They can buy a small 3 bed house out of harry&rsquo;s money from his mother&rsquo;s will. The remaining money from the will would be taken to help pay for the money they were given. Or we  will buy them a small 2 bed flat at the top of a tower block in somewhere like Manchester or Leeds. NOT LONDON because they couldn&rsquo;t afford the rent or mortgage on minimum wage.   Hope they don&rsquo;t bump into me for their own sake as I have dog&rsquo;s and will  hold them personally responsible for that nice lady in America who rescues animals. Home being burned if proven. And unfortunately for markle I do believe men and women should be treated the same. I personally don&rsquo;t hit women but would be prepared to make an exception in her case but would happily do it to him.  So you living in America are hearing it from a Brit living in Britain WE DON&rsquo;T WANT THEM BACK.  AND PLEASE TAKE  PERVERT ANDREW AS WELL  stick him in a super max . He can become someone&rsquo;s bitch.  I have always found most Americans I&rsquo;ve meet to be very friendly and respectful people. It has been a pleasure over the years to have meet them. I don&rsquo;t include  the Clinton or Obama types.   Bye for now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They couldn&rsquo;t even afford the deposit and then had to take out a mortgage?Then they had the hide to say they didn&rsquo;t ask Charles for any money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Archie will be brought up by his devious parents and grow up to be a traitor like Harry, ? biological father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She will walk away with just what she has got during the marriage . Notjing more üòÇüëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if meagain  goes back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to UK.. people should welcome them..with ..pictures of Covid-19 ..&ldquo;go Back Meagain&rdquo; ! we already have here a deadly virus&rdquo;!

<li>
<p>Poor Harry he ain&rsquo;t the smartest tool in the shed..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those two are taking the UK for a ride. Maybe not having a monarchy a good idea. That money is more needed for the British people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excuse me, did you say the deposit came from the duchy of Cornwall? Disgraceful! Prince charles, I have list ALL respect for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am still not convinced it‚Äôs not mortgages leased or rented using Travalyst limited company! Where is Disney money! Where is speech money? If they had given it away we would have seen lavish photo shoot and pr show?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to only use reliable sources National Enquirer is not reliable. I keep hearing that this house is a divorce settlement;but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped them spending like mad. These two cons probably won&rsquo;t make it until Just Harry is 40.Charles is paying to assuage his guilt over Diana,so he feeds the Harkles financial dreams,despite getting screwed over it.These cons are universally disliked,here,and in Canada.England detests them,and they already angered Australia.  They are running out of countries to run to!This will end when Queen Elizabeth reads these ungrateful malignant narcissists the riot act: no titles,no English monies,only the &lsquo;independence &quot; they claim they wanted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bad Prince Charles donne de l&rsquo;argent  √† meghan and harry! It&rsquo;s bad thing to do STOP do that Prince Charles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax reasons.  Yhey also have a mortgage, unusual for Royals.  Their spending will catch up with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every body should pay tax</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No way out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charles is so damn soft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The divorce will only happen after Harry turns 40.  This way, Meghan will get the rest of Harry‚Äôs inheritance&hellip;. oops, I mean half.  No&hellip; I mean all, lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im not sure the Shetland people are going to want them there!! Also I dont think its the case that they wear COATS all year round</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the Info makes sense&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop being silly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope they over ride Charles for king.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If anyone were to be kidnapped it would be PH. Nobody wants meagain. Matter of fact how much would kidnappers charge to take her and keep her. I would start a gofundme to get her gone. Only soldiers of fortune need reply</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh n we have a no refunds or exchanges on people like her in the USA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>l agree with all you have said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the British Tax payer still paying for Harry and Meggs bills/   Since they do not hold any Royal titles they should not still be getting any Money from UK taxes. Are they every going to pay their own bills are they just going to expect other people to pay for them???They are the most rotton couple  that I have ever heard about ??? Are they not ashamed  of this fact or just do not care,I thought they did not want anything from the Royals at all only FREEDOM from them?????????The sooner they just go into the dust the better&laquo;&laquo;&laquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Americans are not fond of them either.

<p>Ils savent que de parler de cela divorce ils r√™vent s√©rieusement ses trolls et ses tablo√Øds v√©reux</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they&rsquo;re irrelevant why can&rsquo;t you stop talking about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meghan will wait patiently for Harry to turn 40</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harry isn‚Äôt a citizen ü§™ü§™ü§™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they move back meghan have to shut her mouth at all times n follow the rules n never ever be called Duchess anymore</p>

<p>it is tax deductible which means that the British taxpayer misses out!!&hellip;&hellip;please don‚Äôt even consider their coming back&hellip;.all that money when people in the uk are hungry or evicted after the virus!?!? Malcontent?? Maleficent, scheming, plotting, self gratifying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disgusting üò§üêõüï∑üêú</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So PC is a royal enabler.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>MM is establishing residential property  in California because she can get 1/2 of Harry&rsquo;s money and sue for custody of the baby and take the other half for child support. Harry  get out fast!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So they r getting out of paying taxes too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harry is not intelligent and I am sure Megan Markle or should I say Miss Piggy  hood wink him and she could end up with the loot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drone settlement. First I‚Äôve ever heard of that????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one of the reason Megs can&rsquo;t work is that Harry would be entitled to alimony&hellip;  I think they took a mortgage so they can have the Sussex Squad pay it off through charitable donations&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey cousins it&rsquo;s us over here in USA, you should Stay married and enjoy the good life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This couple should go back to UK for Security and forget the divorce  for the sake of Archie ,glad if they ask apologies for the Royal families</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And they make a big  drama  for none sense .like Covid 19 virus  hoping will go back to normal life ,divorce like a virus they all after the money
