<p>I just came out as a human being who breathes oxygen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG YASS QUEEN SO BRAVE FOR COMING OUT!!! üôèüôèüôèüôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referring to yourself as an &ldquo;influencer&rdquo; is about the most cringe thing you can do.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Barf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if she&rsquo;s conservative, why is she making this video and not in the kitchen üëÄ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the million dollar question: Does she have a WAP??ü§îü§îü§î</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her husband&rsquo;s a doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs like Ben did a Female Face Swap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She probably has a DAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&rsquo;t come out as a totally mainstream group with no history of oppression in this country, that&rsquo;s not what coming out is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry but I ain&rsquo;t buying her shtick. She&rsquo;s 1,000,000% grifting!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abigail Sha-P-word is trying to do her best &ldquo;valley girl&rdquo; impersonation while attempting to sound like a legitimate political/cultural &ldquo;influencer&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stand the way SJWs are always whining about being victims!&rdquo;</p>

<li>
<p>&ldquo;I came out as a Conservative&hellip;&rdquo; in America is about as brave as saying &ldquo;I came out as a Christian&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Came out as conservative&rdquo; - It&rsquo;s a coming out experience because they&rsquo;re clearly so oppressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I died when Paul said conservatives get together to do a ‚Äúhootenanny‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would be more interesting if she was coming out with her OnlyFans page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ego she has to have to label herself an influencer&hellip;yuck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I decided to come out as conservative because my brother gets fat checks from the Kochs and Sheldon Adelson to shill for fascism and israel and I want checks too&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn‚Äôt know Amazon sold knock off idiot conservatives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was dumb enough to click her ad by accident&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Felt reassuring how many downvotes her video had before I left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does this count as LGBTQ+ cultural appropriation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>23:57 ‚Äúto me that‚Äôs a lifestyle‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>That moment when being a conservative is your personality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for Mara Wilson. I can&rsquo;t imagine having 1 family member as crazy as a Shapiro let alone 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Influencer&rdquo; is such a liberal word for what she does. A more conservative word for her work is &ldquo;background noise for when I forget to skip an ad while doing work.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a bit long, but far more accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he forgot about being thrown in prison as a penalty for being gay, which was ruled unconstitutional just 15 years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have blocked and reported all the ads I see but it just keeps popping up. She definitely paid some big bucks to force those ads on us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;People are afraid to say they&rsquo;re conservative because they might lose their job or their friends.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What does that say about your ideology that people don&rsquo;t want to be around you?  Oh, no, it&rsquo;s everyone else who has the issue.  That&rsquo;s right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So in other words, she wants a safe space?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s trying to get some Victim points by trying to seem like a victim.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Victim of oppression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it even matter if any one &ldquo;comes out&rdquo; as anything if NO ONE even knows who they are anyway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am being absolutely bombarded with her ads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She also has a DAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHE CAME OUT AS AN INFLUENCER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shawdy got that giraffe neck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s dead behind the eyes and talks like a Girl defined sister. I cant believe they are related.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy christ! There&rsquo;s more than one Shapiro!? My day is ruined&hellip;thanks guys&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why does she look like the hotel trivago woman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmao she‚Äôs late to the fembot bandwagon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks like her brother in a wig with clearer skin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last time I was this early you were still, ‚ÄúThe Amazing Atheist‚Äù.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I came for TJ - Stayed for TJ and boob Jokes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservatives don&rsquo;t seem to understand that just because everyone hates you doesn&rsquo;t make you the scrappy underdog in the story. Everyone back in grade school may have hated on the nerdy kid, but you know who they also hated? The sniveling popular bullies. Guess which category the Shapiro family falls into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine coming out as being part of a political group that doesn&rsquo;t view you as someone deserving equality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never thought I would see in my life time conservatives turn into what they hate most. Sensitive snowflakes needing a safe space

<li>
<p>That‚Äôs right kids, with a little perseverance, gumption, a shit load of AstroTurfing, and a rich brother with big coattails, you too can be a ‚ÄúConservative Influencer‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder if she is taller than her brother. That would make me smile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For her:  Conservative = Religious + Right Wing + Traditional + No Homo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The unfortunate thing is, it will 100% work given the average IQ of her audience&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m an artist myself, I have many artist friends and know many well known artists. Believe me when I say all of them lean left/liberal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks just like him it&rsquo;s scary üò≥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not gonna lie, I legit thought this was some kind of gender swap app joke video from the thumbnail.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I wanted it to be that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to legally change my last name to Shapiro. Seems like the jackpot of investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;coming out as an influencer&rdquo; XD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless, she&rsquo;s a milk truck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If she&rsquo;s this afraid over losing friendships, she doesn&rsquo;t have real friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk Milk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs better conservatives have to be the ones to have to ‚Äúcome out‚Äù than people who are attracted to their same sex, or people who want to live as a gender that doesn‚Äôt correspond with their sex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WTF, I just came across her videos in the last few days, had no idea she was Shapiro&rsquo;s sis but definitely see the resemblance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The single attribute that all conservatives share is that they all punch down and believe that some other people are of less value than themselves&hellip;.which is how rich conservatives get dirt poor ones to vote Republican.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should just straight up have an onlyfans, thats the only way she will influence anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She really has that goose neck tho</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big milkers

<p>The less successful sibling decided to follow the grift</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There it is. The conservative persecution complex, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m persecuted too!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid to say I&rsquo;m conservative&rdquo; what you mean to say is that you&rsquo;re afraid of criticism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Coming out&rdquo; as a conservative?? What?? Is that a thing? Can you &ldquo;come over&rdquo; about anything now? So, can I come out as a &ldquo;I-like-dogs-too-noe&rdquo; person after years of a cat lover???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coming out as a conservative is like me coming out as disabled. I am a physically disabled person. Its not courageous its a part of my life. She just happens to be conservative lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fem Shapiro üò≥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ABBY SHAPIRO&rsquo;S BIG KHAZAR MILKERS AND BARE FEET</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What exactly is conservative or traditional about her?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Liking capitalism, being against abortion&hellip; that‚Äôs it?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol ‚ÄúSoros man, Sorros‚Äù hahaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is kinda hard to look at for an extended period of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One thing every single conservative have in common is that they&rsquo;re afraid, they&rsquo;re all constantly afraid and act like they&rsquo;re under attack from all directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious that even with the truckloads upon truckloads of flaming dark money they shoveled into her channel, she&rsquo;s still so irrelevant that most people aren&rsquo;t even aware she has a channel. If anyone should feel bad for her, we should feel badly that she&rsquo;s just so profoundly uninteresting that no amount of sponsorship can ever lift her out of obscurity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait for her next conservative album &ldquo;This things I believe&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey guys google &ldquo;milkers&rdquo;. Guess who comes up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs honestly obnoxious that she made a whole video about ‚Äú&hellip;coming out of the closet.‚Äù You‚Äôre not admitting anything profound, LGBTQ+ members are actually vulnerable for revealing themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you call it when TJ and Paul have a conversation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does she have a WAP tho&hellip;?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>. . . &ldquo;or even just a moderate&rdquo;. So not left? That&rsquo;s typical exclusionary conservative jargon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks so much like her brother that I can&rsquo;t stop seeing the resemblance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TJ, you should do more videos in the same format as ‚ÄùIt‚Äôs only sexist when men do it‚Äù. That style really fit you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22:35 there is a &ldquo;antisjw&rdquo; group on facebook that talks about the Jewish agenda at times so yeah, perfect place for her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome out‚Äù . She was pushed out into the spotlight and GIVEN this grift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking forward to her appearance on the Andrew Neil show üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abigail don&rsquo;t you think I know what you&rsquo;ve done, ABIGAIL!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sit on a jobsite almost everyday spinning my leftist narrative. Union strong üí™ baby!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you‚Äôre feel like you‚Äôre coming out as a conservative it probably means you know how screwed up your ideas are. Hasn‚Äôt she heard of Blaire White?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Top secret: her other name is lexi luna, search it up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She kinda looks like a  man wearing a wig and makeup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, &ldquo;classic&rdquo; British Conservative Monarchy, 2nd Temple Rabbinic- achem!1 I mean, American &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo;, pffffffft&hellip;&hellip;OOOOOOOOOOK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of a single attribute that is true of every single conservative.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uh, traditionalism?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As much as I do loathe the whole &ldquo;Influencer&rdquo; idea, it isn&rsquo;t one of those thing you &ldquo;decide on&rdquo; or choose to be. Who , precisely is Abby claiming to influence, here? Keerist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Benita Shapiro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeping politics and relationships out of work, is generally a good rule of thumb.</p>

<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s got like almost doppelganger on internet with nude pics but it&rsquo;s not her. Just compare their earlobes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What even is conservative? Politics is a mental illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come out? We already knew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a time when Liberal and Conservative were pretty black and white terms. The lines are much more blurred these days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im coming out of the closet guys. Here goes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&hellip;. Am&hellip; A human being!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Omg im such a hero!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro just watched this video like a week ago and couldn‚Äôt get through the first 3 minutes I‚Äôm glad I have them to make this video enjoyable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She talks about &lsquo;safe spaces&rsquo;, are you triggered conservative?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>her favorite place is her room when she is alone living by herself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tig biddies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These conservatives act like they&rsquo;re persecuted by &ldquo;the establishment&rdquo;, meanwhile they have a president who shares most of their political values. The left hasn&rsquo;t received a gift like that in a loooong ass time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abigail Shapiro  &ldquo;after years of receiving a pitiful viewership we&rsquo;re going to be talking about why I decided to come out as a conservative influencer &amp; Leech off my brother&rsquo;s billionaire funded success&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôd rather say ‚ÄúI came in conservative‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But she still look a lil manly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19:50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So in other words: The conservatives need their own safe space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12:10 I finally decided to do some research on Soros yesterday and I still don&rsquo;t understand why conservatives are so obsessed with him&hellip; What am I missing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yeah but she is pretty damn hot though. Must be that Levantine blood üòú

<li>
<p>The bit about Magic the Gathering made me laugh out loud üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine thinking telling people you‚Äôre a conservative is brave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19:17 when you said that, I just remembered how Blaire White got stomped on and had contents of drink thrown at her when she peacefully walked around hollywood blvd with a MAGA hat on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im coming out of the closet, like literally I was inside my closet and I am now in my bedroom there is just so much more room to breath out here. It was so hard for me to tell you all this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still watching those milkersüòî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs hilarious that the Nazis on 4chan made her famous and she loves it. Gib me KM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn‚Äôt know she was actually a Shapiro I thought she just was just Jewish and conservative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know that was his sister I was wondering why I keep getting her ads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probably as  big a Jewish princess as her brother. A bit more WAP though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking bets for who will &ldquo;come out as conservative&rdquo; next&hellip; Rubin?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dp was the shit this is cool but it&rsquo;s basically dp without the other guys. And now that you guys are gone dp is not as good anymore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>24:00 Well Abby, my lifestyle determines my death style</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like these videos you&rsquo;re doing with Paul, I&rsquo;d love to see more of that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its funny how much they look alike, definitely related.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservatives, in a nutshell</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;NOT TOUCHING, NOT TOUCHING! Nuh uh can&rsquo;t do anything, cause Im gonna tell!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her fatal flaw is marketing herself to women. She would blow up if she wasn‚Äôt trying to be Little Miss Purity Culture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad TJ went full left and didn&rsquo;t take the Sargon route :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shes so hot and I love watching her omg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has an only fans

<p>TBH? I never even heard of Her till now. lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn son, got whiplash at the end of the clip, it ended so suddenly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>man at 15:00 paul had me dying i almost choked on my own seamen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss the old-style videos of AA. this live shit is not doing it for me&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure she lives in NYC, it makes sense to &ldquo;come out&rdquo; conservative there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5:52: that accent&hellip; is your real-estate agent Bruce from Family Guy? üòâ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservative Influencer?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Is that what she said?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>What is that?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Okay I get fashion, makeup, and shoes, but what is she going to influence?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KHAZAR MILKERS</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also, that Paul grin after TJ comes back is absolutely priceless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how conservatives love to rail on about college safe spaces whilst advocating for safe spaces of their own</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this Tomi Lahren 2.0?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15:33  made me smile. Thanks, Paul</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rdquo; makes me ashamed of being straight and Jewish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg theres a girl version!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>with all of my heart for several years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woah im so early</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An art school in NYC isn‚Äôt exactly a right-wing bastion? What a shocker!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your choices:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>corporations or corporations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs a social experiment. Or hopefulüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surprise! Shapiro is secretly a cross-dresser!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed to be a conservative&rdquo; is the new &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed to be a Christian.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re so brave being such a persecuted minority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music in the background for that nice emotional appeal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you &ldquo;COME OUT&rdquo; as an influencer? &ldquo;I have decided to reveal that there&rsquo;s a lot of people following me and imitating me, IT WAS A SECRET BEFORE&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she has a pretty long neck.. I know.. important huh</p>

<p>TJ, you Paul and Scotty are super wholesome guys, I‚Äôm so glad that you all put out the content that you do, it‚Äôs great :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this video advertised everywhere on YouTube, but I&rsquo;ve never bothered to watch it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:12 - 2:20 Well at least we now know at least some of that bloodline wasn&rsquo;t totally poisoned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is so terrible it is even funny üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She wants a safe space. How ironic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Conservatives whine about &ldquo;free speech&rdquo;, they mean you disagree with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11:50 Idk what he means by sorosing. Can someone tell me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More masculine than her brother, lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn TJ back to smoking :( I beleived in you!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, she&rsquo;s Jewish&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Oh wait, the atheist channel doesn&rsquo;t touch that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro her knockers are üëåüèæ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7:00 &ndash; Answer to TJ: They are one thing: Pure Ethnos. Have fun with that. Remember that laughing sickness shit you guys covered not too long ago?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Yeah&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great video. Perfectly showcases the particular brand of tolerance and empathy on the left today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7:45 and after: more people rioting for blm and antifa are white so ever if what you&rsquo;re saying is true it&rsquo;s disingenuous as that population is more prone to be black anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>24:30 Chuck D once rapped &ldquo;Is it wrong to hate hate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s awesome üòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love TJ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The hot ones always are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait, she&rsquo;s his sister? I thought she was his daughter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She got the big middle tooth like tom cruise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15:39 -LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I appreciate the Magic The Gathering reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WTF comments getting deleted &hellip;and im not particularly offensive even!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm digging the contrast here. It‚Äôs like, one of these images doesn‚Äôt match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>feels like she&rsquo;s repeating the same thing over and over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She looks like Mona Lisa from Parks and Rec</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice to see Paul getting some non-entertainment chops!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6:56 lack of empathy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do have to say though, there are conservative out there who love constructive political discourse. Yeah, there are a lot of assholes. But I&rsquo;ve had lengthy conversations with conservative that end in friendships (somewhat shakey ones) almost because of how willing we were to discuss and listen to ideas. Some people really love political discussions and voicing their opinions. You just got to listen and have a sense of humor about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOOOOROOOOSSSS!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Democrats in that neighborhood lol</p>
</li>
