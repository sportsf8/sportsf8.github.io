<h3 id="comments">comments</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Just a reminder, having talent doesn‚Äôt give you the right to do terrible crimes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And Hollywood still celebrates Woody Allen whose been accused of molesting his own adopted daughter and married his stepdaughter. These men get away with it. The same people were celebrating Weinstein when they knew what he was like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adele haenel also shouted &ldquo;bravo la p√©dophilie!&rdquo; when she stormed out. he didnt deserve to be nominated, let alone win the award. truly the world we live in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Americans gave Polanski Oscar for The Pianist in 2003&hellip;. French gave him 5 Cesars. Let me just remind all the sociopaths in the comments: Polanski first drugged, then took a 13 year old child to a jacuzzi, ripped her underwear off, and raped a 13 year old child&hellip;. This is who the Americans gave Oscar to and to French Cesar to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs a shame of France</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He should NEVER have been nominated in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who say ‚Äúseparate the arts from the artist‚Äù have lost their moral compass. Like cmon guys. We should always honor justice more than the art. Polanski should serve his punishment first, only then he can continue make movies. No crimes should be forgiven unless punishment is served.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of men in the comments supporting rape and pedophilia. Wow. What a sad world when a &ldquo;good movie&rdquo; is more important to some than the victims of sexual abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disgusting. Be better men.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fact is, this guy should not be making movies, he should be in jail. He&rsquo;s an amazingly talented director, and his movies can still be enjoyed, but he should not be celebrated and honored like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thumbs up for Adele!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I support filmmakers in any form, artistic and personal, but let&rsquo;s be clear of one thing: Polanski should never be discussed or awarded ever again. His time is done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people cared, they wouldn&rsquo;t go see his movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Oscars have no right to also shame the C√©sars when they also continuously rewarded both Polanski and Weinstein knowing their history. Absolute hypocrites and he should be banned from being awarded!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>#kidstoo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speak up for those who can&rsquo;t speak for themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bravo ad√®le!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Academy awards are hypocrites. Snub James Franco but give Polanski the oscar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear everyone was a pedophile in the 70s. Sick era ü§¢

<li>
<p>Disgusting that he was nominated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celine Sciama not only made the best French film of the year but the best film of the year period.And she was snubbed in both regular and French Oscars,such a shame!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bravo Adeleüëçüëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How this men still gets to makes movies is still beyond me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I came here from watching interviews of &ldquo;Portrait of a Lady on Fire&rdquo; and I see Adele really did storm out without her purse üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would&rsquo;ve walked out too. Stop being silent about disgusting things.</p>

<p>What an ugly trophy.</p>

<p>CLAIRE DENIS WHY ARE YOU CLAPPING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disliked for calling it the French Oscar&rsquo;s just to get more views</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So poverty is the enemy huh..?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not a man drugging n taking a 12 or 13 yr old girl&hellip;? Wow</p>

<li>
<p>2020(G) ‚ÄúRespect and dignity.‚Äù  Furthermore:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it was up to me, he&rsquo;d be directing movies of his own torture in Hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And in America they gave him a standing ovation&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adele is a great actress, energy and more. Just love her in every vid I see

</li>
<li>
<p>I think the heads of any these movie studios in America that finance his films should be jailed for aiding and abetting a fugitive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t they send him back to the US</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here in the states we gave him a sanding ovation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Americans have more class than you, you&rsquo;ve reached a level of low that geologists can&rsquo;t calculate yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to see a english versus of the movie we are the guy said the enemy is not us</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you frenchies!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a disrespect for Celine Sciamma !!! :@@@</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs better than a standing ovation Hollyweird unanimously gave him. And it‚Äôs not as if the knowledge about his crime has increased between then and now. French cinema has shown a better moral fibre than Hollyweird.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too bad no one will remember most of these bc of covid19</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yet in America he gets a 5 minute standing ovation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To all of yall Americans defending Polanski in the comment section:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seriously, how did you guys see An Officer and A Spy? It&rsquo;s not even playing anywhere in the U.S. By The Grace of God was released on DvD literally a week or so before the Cesar and The Specialist and La Belle Epoque still aren&rsquo;t available anywhere in the U.S, how can you possibly know if Polanski deserve it or not when you haven&rsquo;t even watched half of the nominees yet, including Polanski&rsquo;s film itself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have French Oscars?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;#MoiAussi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I much prefer the &lsquo;French Oscars&rsquo; &ndash; they give out ingots of gold!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolutely sick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BRAVO!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>More like J&rsquo;Snooze&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Portrait of a lady on fire was the best french film that year IMO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why not just boycott the affair for nominating him instead of attending in the first place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The prize is a brick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adele is the only French that I respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are so many actors/directors that shouldn&rsquo;t still have careers, but for some reason or another do. At least we&rsquo;re finally recognizing that Polanski shouldn&rsquo;t be supported, but it&rsquo;s still only surface level if it doesn&rsquo;t include popular actors Sean Penn, Alec Baldwin, James Franco, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got to know about roman polanski one year ago his whole life is filled with tragedy and scandals like this one i won&rsquo;t lie but at some point i felt sympathy for him he suffered holocaust his mother died in auschwitz his pregnant wife and friends got killed by garbage cult called manson family some one said it right that the world is a strange place and human mind is more complex than maths and science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would you take away all of Michael Jackson&rsquo;s awards if he was proved to do all he was accused of? (I don&rsquo;t support either one by the way, this is just food for thought)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this recent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But they were ok with the nomination?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good in ad√®le. At least she has a backbone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why I hate the god-damn phony pictures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He may be able to evade the man made justice system but he will never be able to evade God&rsquo;s Justice. Your time is ticking Polanski.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utter disgusting!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No standing ovation as here in America by meryl streep? He had to do with manson killing his wife..he told his then girlfriend hed do to her what he had done to Sharon Tate!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s all a show.  They nominate him and have him win just so they can make the scene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adele is the best , I love her for doing that .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also they think Les miserables is better than Portrait Of A lady on fire? Lol

<li>
<p>Hes 86 years old? All the hate poured on him must be his lifeblood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shame !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any human with a healed trauma and soul would have no problem to give an ovation and love to any man with sins. I love this man more as a beautiful human being than an artist anyway. One day everyone learns that our own outrage at other people&rsquo;s sins creates more sins in the world, more trauma, more soul loss and fragmentation in human beings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Vick is getting honored this year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The biggest shame was Portrait of a lady on fire not getting Best Film, Director or Actress. One of the worst decisions ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welcome to the comment section where everyone is morally good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mark Wahlberg once blinded a guy and Matthew Broderick once killed two people in a car accident but you never hear anyone talking about that do you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No man or woman who hasn‚Äôt experienced the trauma of being abused by a pedophile can defend this man. If you do then you‚Äôre disgusting. Periodt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adele is number one üòçüòçüòçüòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good on them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so that means Parasite is the best movie in the world right now because it won best foreign film in two countries(Oscars).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polanski is a great director. But I support Adele for leaving she had to do it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Los premios est√°n para premiar el trabajo, no a las personas. Punto.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will never understand why he wasn‚Äôt extradited back to the USA to face his sentencing. It‚Äôs despicable. Glad some people are making a statement against this pervert rapist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone who remained seated in that auditorium is a disgrace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Samantha Gailey has forgiven RP, does anyone reckon this or not ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He should still be serving time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe Bryant was a accused rapist and he settled in court but did anyone walk off when he got honoured</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry but the Democrats killed off the #metoo movement by giving Joe Biden a pass on his sexual misconduct!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never knew there was such a thing as the French Oscars!

<p>One of the best comment section ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WAIT! Isn&rsquo;t this the country whose President met his wife when he was a teenager in high school and his wife was the TEACHER?! Now she&rsquo;s the First Lady. It seems kinda rich they would get upset about Roman Polanski. If anything, Bridgette Macron should be in prison!</p>
</li>

<p>how he&rsquo;s not behind bars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just saw the movie. It&rsquo;s fantastic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well&hellip; The movies were great though&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your age of consent is 15 years old in France why don‚Äôt you change that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Easily one of the greatest directors of all time&hellip; But he sure committed some disgraceful acts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate to say it but that man has made great film&rsquo;s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protest in france who would have thought.movies look good tho.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>talent is talent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that a person can redeem his mistakes after decades</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Off to crying someplace else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the USA&hellip;.the hypocritical METOO demons gave him a standing ovation at the Oscars&hellip;..And not ONE actor or actress even expressed outrage, or walked out. SOOOO happy I fled the USA 18 years ago. It is a cesspool and a horrible place to live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People will really do anything to defend a pedophile rapist. She was 13 there is no consent there no matter how you spin it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its the european civilization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The actress‚Äôs antics - however justified - has stolen the thunder from the more newsworthy event at les Cesars: the historic triumph of Ladj Ly‚Äôs LES MISERABLES - Best Film &amp; Audience Award among other awards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The question is not why he wins or why he keeps getting nominated? Whatever else that he might be, he is a great filmmaker. The real question is why is he allow to keep making movies? Who finances him? Why isn&rsquo;t this person being held accountable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly feel like this man has been a horrible human all his life. Sharon Tate&rsquo;s death was his karma, sad thing is that after her death he became more of a trash human. A coward in all sense of the word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was Polanski&rsquo;s, Woody&rsquo;s and Kinski&rsquo;s rape accusations actually proven??. What proof did they have?. Did Roman only plead guilty to sex with an underage girl?

<li>
<p>Separate artist from the art ? Early Polanski&rsquo;s work ? Probably. But his new movie is so generic and bland even without all of his problem doesn&rsquo;t deserve any awards and recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually loved his film FRANTIC starring Harrison Ford, but hearing that he was convicted of having sex with an innocent 13 year old child at the age of 43 and then fled to France makes me sick.  IF the story is true, he should have spent the rest of his life in bars instead of being celebrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YAWN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polanski&rsquo;s crime is horrendous, and it is appalling that he has escaped his punishment all these years. I do not condone his actions in any way. Period.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>That said, are we allowed to appreciate art for art&rsquo;s sake, or is art eternally linked to its creator(s)?  Convicted felons have written amazing literature that has won Pulitzer and Nobel prizes - including murderers, the most heinous crime of all.  Not every piece of art is Mein Kampf or the Communist Manifesto after all. Are we allowed to judge the art by itself, or when we judge art, are we also passing judgement on the art&rsquo;s creator(s)?  If a person did an evil thing, does that make everything that person did evil, from art or just balancing a checkbook?  If we say we like the art, are we inadvertently saying we approve of the creator&rsquo;s behavior?  Maybe Polanski&rsquo;s case is different cuz he hasn&rsquo;t done his punishment, but what about things we might consider social evils even if they are not legal crimes, like Mark Twain&rsquo;s use of the &ldquo;N&rdquo; word in his literature?  I am afraid of even trying to answer those questions cuz it is bound to anger people either way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still enjoy Kevin Spacey&rsquo;s work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And some of you still enjoy Glee after Mark Salling crimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Rosemary&rsquo;s Baby.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very good. I believe it is not right for Polanski to kidnap a little girl, then drug her, then rape her. Then be allowed to walk a free man and be given awards.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry if America is not sorry. I&rsquo;ll be sorry for them. If this man truly did that horrific act. I&rsquo;m glad these brave women walked out!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do I think he&rsquo;s guilty in my opinion yes!!do I think he should be ostracized because we say he is No! Because what if someone who didn&rsquo;t actually do it gets treated like that .You are not the Judge, Jury nor the Executioner leave it up to the courts and if it fails oh well justice system can&rsquo;t be 100% accurate.. karma always seems to catch up with people who do wrong</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it ever proven in court he did said crimes ??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great director Roman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If he made a good movie, he made a good movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go Polanski!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow France now your gonna burn wow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My question is how many years will it take for everyone to forgive him and not shun his work (as well as the other people who worked on it) even though its master class? Does he need to amend more? Or can he never be forgiven and should be condemned, put to death, and forgotten forever? I don&rsquo;t have an opinion on the matter I&rsquo;m just curious if you y&rsquo;all would ever forgive or is it more revenge than justice?

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And yet Trump is still President !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reportedly, Roman is still able to exercise his interest in young, sometimes very young &lsquo;people&rsquo; in more-forgiving countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polanski is a genius. Can‚Äôt disagree with that&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he is a great director love his movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say this, but as long as Polanski isn&rsquo;t convicted he is eligible for awards. This is about who they believe was the best director and if they believe it was Polanski, then he should win the award. Is he a vile human being who shouldn&rsquo;t be nominated in the first place because he should be behind bars? Yes. Is he behind bars and therefore an eligible and functional member of the French society? Yes. I believe that you shouldn&rsquo;t walk out tover the awards but over the fact that he isn&rsquo;t convicted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The black guy who is &lsquo;less controversial&rsquo; actually kidnapped a man, dragged him in the woods and tried to kill him before the guy escaped. He went to jail for it but I mean, he&rsquo;s not a mean old white cis man so I guess it&rsquo;s less controversial&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch as leftists do a complete 180 on as soon as one of their own gets called out. The comments on this video make me sick.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viva Roman!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If different opinions are allowed, here it is: &ldquo;political correctness&rdquo; in films or any kinds of art is a double-edged sword; I hope France don&rsquo;t become another America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People need to learn to separate a person from their art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So she wasnt upset he was nominated but upset he won. So she should have never came to the award show to begin with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These same morally supreme actors wouldn&rsquo;t have any problems acting in one of polanski&rsquo;s movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did no one walk out at all the Honorable Mentions of Kobe Bryant at stadiums after his death? He was an alleged rapist too. Settled out of court to end the issue. Hush Money as always!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who walked out are showing disrespect. The Academy should have not been elected the controversial personal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little torn with this. I guess I understand other people&rsquo;s sentiments. But, just because someone has committed despicable crimes, does that mean that we should pretend like their talents don&rsquo;t exist? Roman Polanski is an excellent director. He&rsquo;s getting an award for his direction in film. Not an award for being a good, decent person. It is possible to separate someone&rsquo;s despicable behavior from their accomplishments. And even Osama Bin Ladin believed in environmentalism and slowing climate change. I guess&hellip; I&rsquo;m just saying that people aren&rsquo;t 100% bad or 100% good. We should demonize them for the bad things they do, but we should also acknowledge the good things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I understand he did a not nice thing but Roman should atleast be allowed to direct ONE Marvel movie and ONE episode of The Mandalorian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RANGER VINDMAN//DREYFUS AFFAIR&rdquo; The movies is about a Jewish Officer who was an immigrant from a Slavic country accused of Spying to cover up a scandal in Military Funds. That&rsquo;s exaclty what Trump did  in UKRAINE &amp; Impeachment &amp; what the French Gov. did in 1893. The movie &ldquo;An OFFICER &amp; SPY&rdquo; is important in today&rsquo;s political/Military systems in NATO and the USA. Watch the movie and then decide if it should have been made. (USA Ranger Vet)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He videotaped his wife Sharon getting raped by two guys in their house. Seriously, how is it possible to watch his movies in good conscience? Every movie has a message. What good message can he give you? Any monster can create a pleasing aesthetic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talent does not discriminate. People need to accept this fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many people judging&hellip; i‚Äôm not approving his acts (which the victim did forgive him), but it‚Äôs pitiful to see all these people judging and insulting, putting themselves on a high throne and pretending to be superior than all (both the comment section and the video itself)

<p>One can be a terrible human being and still make a good movie. An oscar is awarded for cinematic achievements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol. This is all an act. True ‚Äúprotests‚Äù would‚Äôve been not showing up at all. And Even that is barely brave. These people are a joke. Hahaha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not mix the art with the artist, be objective!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone urdu here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the French cosmetic industry devoted to encouraging women to celebrate their age, their sorrows and wisdom , the laugh lines of their experience, their diversity in size and shape and looks or is it dedicated to trying to make them look like teenage porn stars? This outrage is an explosion of hypocrisy and a condemnation of the protesters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is pretty funny. We are ok with companies using children to produce our clothes, we are ok with so many men still sexualy abusing others, yet all we do is shout at a holocaust‚Äôs surviver who‚Äôs wife and unborn child were murdered because he once absured a child. Yes, what hes done was absolutely disgusting and wrong, yes he should have gone to prison for that, but now hes old and in some years he will die after having a terrible life. Should we really focus on screwing his life more just for the sake of it rather than try to punish people who are in power right now and are hurting others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Award is for making movies, not being a good person.  If anyone gave a shit, the theaters for his films would be empty.  But they don‚Äôt, so&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merde&hellip;Quit speaking for the Victim.. his Victim forgive him&hellip; Years AGO.. her right.. not yours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glad the festival is sticking to their guns than reason with the haters. They just want to hate the person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people want to leave, more power to them. He still won the award. Art is art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn to seperate art from other aspects. What he did was wrong and vile but his movies are extraordinary and he should be appreciated as an artist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow some people here are absolite animals, try to learn how to seperate a person and theire work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of frustrated misandrist playing make-believe half of them couldn&rsquo;t tell you a thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>about Polanski &hellip;&hellip; But the one talent they all seem to have is feigned moral outrage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calm down&hellip;&hellip;Consider his body of work&hellip;.the times and maybe most importantly&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get laid.  Although that may be asking too much. Good Luck and Goodnight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations Roman - genius for decades!!  I salute you, sir !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bottom line is, its only a movie.. None of  it is real..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Donot politicise art and filmmaking. Any wrongs, do try them legally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why go in the first place knowing he was nominated if you had such strong feelings?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

<p>Ridiculous demonstration by French actresses. They all seem to have conveniently forgotten about the trauma that he went through when his wife Sharon Tate was viciously stabbed to death at her home back in 1969 along with four of her friends. The murders were committed by 3 members of the Charles Manson family under the direction of Manson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you didn‚Äôt want him to win, y‚Äôall should‚Äôve made a better movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If she really wanted to make a great gesture of dissent, she could decide to withdraw from the race, once she knew of the Polanski nomination. She wanted to participate to try to win the prize? She wanted to decide to compete against Polanski? She decided to accept the rules of the competition? Yes, so then she must shut up and not make a show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are getting more stupid every day&hellip;If the film is worthwhile then it deseves the award&hellip;You&rsquo;re not hiring a babysitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No to Feminists No to leftists. Common sense prevail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guy has already served time in prison. This is all political and has nothing to do with justice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know he is not a great human but he is a great filmmaker. And we should respect him for that. And if we look ourselves at mirror, we aren&rsquo;t even saints too. This is bad thing to present someone as bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done to the Cesar organizers for having the gu ts to put artistic integrity before virtue signalling and inane positive discrimination efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roman was in Warsaw getto as a child, has seen and survived evil things. Add to that that he lost his mother in Auschwitz and had his 8,5 months pregnant wife (and child) taken from him in one of the worst slayings in history, from the hands of Charles Manson sect fanatics. This man has been traumatized and went to hell and back, yet still makes amazing movies. One of the best directors. Back in the 70&rsquo;s (and throughout history) there were different morals, especially in the wild 70&rsquo;s. He made a big mistake back then, but he wasn&rsquo;t the only one and there is an entire industry who misbehaved horribly in the past. These things also need to be seen within the context of the historic times in which they happened, you cannot blindly stamp your own 2020 cultural/morality view on a completely different era. Rape is wrong, but it is only very recently that this extreme puritanism has come over us, thanks to the social media morality mob police. And very recent also that people start to vilify everything that happened in the past, with our modern day (morality) goggles on.  Besides; artistic works should be judged on their own merit and not the personalities that produced them. It&rsquo;s not his first award nor will it be his last. Roman is a director and a da** good one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry she has no right to behave like that. Did he do what he did to HER? What rights does she have to treat one of the greatest directors alive? So, if a person commits a crime of sex, all of his talents and accomplishment become nothing? There are worse crime than sex. How about a murder? If a director commits a murder, he or she will not condemned so much as the crimes of sexual nature. Something&rsquo;s really not right here. There&rsquo;s no worse crime than murders, and Roman Polanski didn&rsquo;t commit a murder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get over it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Viva Polanski! Is there no such thing as repentance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give this 86 year old man a break&hellip;.. I can garante that non of these people in this comment section has gone through as much as Polanski has or have made something as genius as his work but still people are harassing him because of a mistake he made 43 years ago and in logical terms a man that have comited a mistake but than gets rehabilitated is just as innocent and if not more than the majority of people on this earth. And him being put in prison than or now doesn&rsquo;t have a usable effect because the prison system doesn&rsquo;t exist these days for ruin lifes of people that have made mistakes but to give them rehabilitation and it sure as f seems like Polanski has rehabilitated so he is innocent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just because someone&rsquo;s a bad person doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not a great director. Was the award for best person or best director?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not really for him but for the movie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shame? Girl, the award ain‚Äôt for you, it‚Äôs for him. Regardless of whether you think he‚Äôs a terrible person or not, have some dignity. Also, metoo movement died a few years ago</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are severely missing a point here. Personal facts should be of no relevance if you&rsquo;re to host a sincere award ceremony dedicated to film. In other words Polanski&rsquo;s work as a director should be the only point of consideration when he&rsquo;s nominated for an award for, well, directing! That should be obvious. If on the other hand his legal history and/or the public&rsquo;s possible response would be let to affect the outcome, the ceremony is no longer about filmmaking. Might as well be running a political campaign at that point. Only valid critizism for this award would be to judge the movie itself, not Polanski as a person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polanski is the living classic, one of the greatest film directors, whatever this deranged, ideologically obsessed righteous women will demand. They want constant punishment, forever and ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another feminist cry for attention. No, in democracy you cant have mob justice. If you don&rsquo;t like him then don&rsquo;t watch his films.
