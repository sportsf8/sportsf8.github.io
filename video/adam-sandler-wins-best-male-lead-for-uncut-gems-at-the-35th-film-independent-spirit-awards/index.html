<p>He deserved it. I still can&rsquo;t believe Uncut Gems received no oscar nominations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These 5 minutes alone are better than the entire Oscars of the past 5 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine an awards show that let&rsquo;s someone get through their entire acceptance speech!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you imagine such a speech at the Oscars? We won&rsquo;t be seeing that this year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, my name is Adam Sandler. Thank you. I stand before you trembling with thankful glee as I receive this this so-called best actor trophy, independently speaking, of course. First off, it‚Äôs great to see our host Aubrey Plaza again. Aubrey and I did a movie entitled Funny People 11 years ago. That was actually the last time critics pretended not to hate me for five fucking minutes. Catch you in another 11 years, Aubrey!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks happier and healthier than he has in years; I hope he has faith in his skills enough now to keep doing roles he loves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t homeless Rabbis those are the Sfdie brothers&rdquo; is literally theee most fitting description of Josh and Benny, I&rsquo;ve ever heard .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a big stupid grin on my face seeing this. He deserves it and he deserved an Oscar nomination too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm no Adam Sandler fan, but he was seriously good in Uncut Gems.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Richly deserved!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robert Pattinson&rsquo;s reaction doesn&rsquo;t even change&hellip; What a heart broken man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Adam gets snubbed at the Oscar&rsquo;s :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;It means nothing. It meant nothing.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means the world to Sandler and his speech reflects who he truly is. This is what the Oscars should be about. Congrats Billy Madison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncut gems was an actual gem of a film, so well deserved Adam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This and Adam&rsquo;s tribute song to Chris Farley are a tie for my favorite Sandler moment. Glad his luck has turned and people finally giving him some professinal respect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how self aware Adam Sandler is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All he needed was rob schneider to yell ‚ÄúYOU CAN DO IT‚Äù

<li>
<p>The Oscars don&rsquo;t realize how irrelevant they have  become.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay but this low key may be one of the best speeches ever given. Why aren‚Äôt more people talking about this??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s like he prepared his entire life for this speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THIS IS HOW HE WINS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you do an acceptance speech, as opposed to sanctimonious and ultimately self serving political sermons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like his fans limited him. When he made Punch-Drunk Love, it was his first box office flop in years. So, he just continued to do comedies. Jack &amp; Jill, despite being one of the worst films of all time, made a profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;to my wife&hellip; thanks for hanging out with me&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sandman I love you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the Sandman getting some well-deserved recognition on his acting skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Netflix has more films like uncut gems I won‚Äôt be stopping my subscription anytime soon!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This is Adam Sandler&rsquo;s first&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;..well&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BEST.  ACCEPTACE.  SPEECH.  EVER!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs much easier to try and look good and constantly obey the status quo and be politically correct and win the accolades of the Academy.  Much harder to actually BE a naturally funny hilarious person and deliver comedy with cleverness.  Much harder to have the guts to speak your truth and choose to be the outlaw.  Adam Sandler you ROCK!!!  Here‚Äôs to breaking down the door of the snobby academy and making room for genius comedians!! ü•Ç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This speech brought back nostalgia of when I was a kid and everything was ok thanks sandman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Those are not homeless Rabbis. Those are Safdie Brothers&rdquo; lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He conveyed the perfect level of madness, through his Character in that Movie&hellip;..üëå</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t smiled so much before man. We do not deserve Adam he&rsquo;s so great

<li>
<p>A truly deserved award. So glad he won after being snubbed at the Oscars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got more, I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; Lmaoooo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I immediately laughed when he said ‚ÄúHello my name is Adam Sandler‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm really satisfied he won. I hope Adam realizes we want him in more serious roles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sadly, I think this speech was funnier than most of Sandler&rsquo;s movies the past decade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Independent Spirit Awards AKA the REAL oscars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam sandler to his wife of many years, the mother of his children: thanks for hanging out with me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A truly deserved award. So glad he won after being snubbed at the Oscars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Academy can kick rocks, Adam made a damn good point in his speech and the fact that the new Star Wars got recognized by the Academy and not Uncut Gems just goes to show just how right he is. What Im referring to btw is the fact that the new star wars is LITERALLY eye candy, its so spectacular to watch but its SO hollow. Uncut Gems manages to tell a story while also sending the message that the story thats unfolding in front of us is just something thats occuring in a VAST seemingly NEVER ending universe. I dunno about you guys but that sounds like a challenging feat in itself and the Safdie brothers fucking KILLED it along with everyone else involved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:52 some dude‚Äôs scolding his escort for speaking on the job</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>o pessoal que est√° rindo, esperando o que diz algo engra√ßado, ou tentando entender o que estava dizendo, e como ningu√©m estava entendendo, ele continua a rir porque com certe era algo engra√ßado mesmo que ningu√©m visse nada engra√ßado no que estava dizendo , o que estava realmente dizendo e que uma academia desmerece e desprezam muita gente e privilegia apenas alguns da prefer√™ncia deles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I want to thank everyone who worked with me on my comedies&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Camera pans over to Jim Gaffigan&hellip;. from Hotel Transylvania&hellip;.. 3&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This is me. This is how I win.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>-Howard Ratner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL he&rsquo;s so cute, asks &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; to the presenter. Cannot believe this movie was not at the oscars in any capacity, truly puzzling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sandler seems like a really good guy, especially in interviews.  Very humble family man.

<p>Him and George Lucas have a lot in common. They both don&rsquo;t realize how much people actually love them and their so called &ldquo;bad&rdquo; films.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone was so happy for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No speech in the Oscars tomorrow will ever top this</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: Okay I take it back since Parasite won but this speech was still good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well deserved. Uncut gems was a masterpiece.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can tell everybody love him casue when he introduce himself in his speech the crown went crazy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sandler‚Äôs such a fkn class act and always has been. Good for him he deserves as much credit in Hollywood as possible. Good for him man!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s such a sweetheart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s always been one of my favorites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He deserves the best. ‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally people can stop using his movies as a basis for &lsquo;movies that wont win awards&rsquo; üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laura Dern in the audience laughing about the feather headed douchebag comments and then picks up the Oscar  the next night üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually they were all great but I am so glad especially after hearing this speech. Just think about how this gem of a speech we would have missed if he didn&rsquo;t win.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The film is the shit, it is the best film I&rsquo;ve seen in many years. You are an amazing actor, your portrayal was tip top, totally had me believe Howard was a living breathing person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give him more good dramatic roles. He‚Äôll knock ‚Äòem out of the park.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:24 hahaha that was a high pitched &ldquo;wOO&rdquo; from benny safdie on the right,, or it was just perfectly timed with a different woo and his wasnt even picked up by the mic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok off note I did not know Matthias was nominated for The Mustang. Underrated performance, but Adam deserved this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the actress at 3:43?  She looks so familiar I swear I just saw her in something but I can&rsquo;t remember what she was in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally getting there Adam a long long way from Pixel lol.

</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>This is the first I‚Äôve heard of this award</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So awesome! He SHOULD‚ÄôVE had the same chance to give this speech tonight, but whatever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A modern legend SPEAKS, as he should.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching the Oscars is going to be surreal since Adam Sandler has been completely ignored by the Academy.  It does not make sense at all!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BEST acceptance speech of ALL TIME. (You can dooo eeht!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need to start watching the spirit awards. Super entertaining and self aware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncut Gems got robbed at the Oscars, not even a nomination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really wanna see this movie, it looks fantastic!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love yah Adam ,you deserve that and more&hellip;.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I love this man lol. Grew up watching him</p>

<li>
<p>Just amazing, delighted for him!!.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>This marks the moment in time where aspiring artists are going to start dreaming of one day, winning an Independent Spirit Award.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ive never been prouder of an actor. Even his comedy, shit is brilliant with its undertone. He made movies where damn near every line was a punchline. So happy for him. About time the sand man got his shine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually like Adam Sandler and the movies he stars in&hellip;.from &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mess with the zohan&rdquo; to &ldquo;the longest yard&rdquo; and so on&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s versatile, talented and funny!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jack and Jill is my fave Sandler film! It is comedy GOLD!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gold Jerry Gold!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was great. Instant clasic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annoying baby voice</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Coooooooome onnnnn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sandman rock it again, he is simply the best  !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and the Oscar&hellip; oh sorry&hellip; Independent spirit award for best speech goes to .. Adam Sandler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn I love this guy ever since, Little Red Sweatshirt.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good family man too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So happy for him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone knows the name of the background music???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People love him so much&hellip; It speaks for itself üëç Happy for him, he deserved it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 times I wanted to leave the theater when watching uncut gems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought &quot; crap, this is as hard to watch as &lsquo;punch drunk love&rsquo;&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s ok with me if you liked this movie.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Especially if you decide to compare it to &lsquo;punch drunk love&rsquo;, which I  also almost walked out on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that Adam Sandler wearing a suit?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought he looked different. üòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how the stage looks so unique and futuristic and the audience full of a listers is sat in a fucking warehouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This should be viral ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler is an uncut gem - what a legend!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he won the award I thought it started playing that Twilight song I felt so bad for Robert for 4 seconds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what is the song while he walks up to the stage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For me it was either Robert Pattinson or him, so I&rsquo;m glad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This brings me happiness he deserved this. He made this along w everyone else a great movie . Perf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well Deserved man, congratulations. Hilarious speech.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncut Gems was a very Painful movie to watch, phenomenal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This speech literally made me laugh til I cried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly don‚Äôt mind long speeches as long as they‚Äôre funny and heartfelt (not reading off a list of names). It‚Äôs way more respectful than cutting someone off with an orchestra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truly he‚Äôs earned his place as one of the greatest actors of all time. Screw anyone who says otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some 30 second speeches feel eternal, this was over 4 minutes and i could have listened for another ten.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s how you know Sandler is a natural born entertainer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I simply love this guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like Alan sanders congrats</p>

<p>He makes us adult children feel comfortable about ourselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmaooo my speech is long and I&rsquo;ll go quick</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Hi my name is adam sandler&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best movie of 2019! Great movie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>oeeh the background music got my hips shakin&rsquo;, likey likey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmaooo he even the way he walked and wave to everyone just tells you that adam sandler was being himself in uncut gems. Howie was just adam sandler lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sandler is slowly turning into the caucasian Samuel L Jackson and I love it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That. Was. Awesome. This beats anything the Oscars will serve up tonight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This is me. This is how I win&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Oscar lost this uncut gem moment. yeah right&hellip; coz they dont deserve it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>spirit award for being adam sandler goes to&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>billy madison</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He should get a Oscar just for that speech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well its evident at the time of my watching this speech there has been precisely 313 dumba**es  who have also watched this speech. Im assuming they must all be the jean jacket wearing feather haired douchebags of their respective high schools.  How could someone not love this guy? He is truly a gem through and through (no pun intended).  One of the realest most down to earth people in Hollywood and deserves every accolade he has ever achieved and will ever achieve and then some. So congrats to the sandman, you are truly one of the good ones, dont ever change my guy! And thanks for all of your hard work and all the content you have given us over the years, one of a kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love him üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uncut Gems was üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•. Watch the Safdie Bros first film, Goodtime! Even better!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just watched the film. Adam Sandler almost unrecognizable. Especially in the club scenes. I initially wasn&rsquo;t sold on the film but the 2nd and 3rd acts were gripping. Bravo!

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People saying is his first dramatic role when he KILLED it in Punch Drunk Love. This guy can act!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Funny People. I like everything literally everything Adam has done since his Netflix special. I guess people used to ridicule him so much because they always knew he&rsquo;s capable of being great but loves easy money too much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was nostalgic. Adam used to do the same on the MTV Awards he always did a bit. He and Jim Carrey just stopped the show every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a good film! I need to watch it a 2nd time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Those aren&rsquo;t homeless Rabbis those are the Sfdie brothers&rdquo; is literally theee most fitting description of Josh and Benny, I&rsquo;ve ever heard .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most loveable guy in Hollywood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmao well deserved to da GOAT!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I smell a &ldquo;fix&rdquo; .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i&rsquo;v always loved this guy, i&rsquo;v always said he was a good actor when people laughed at me for saying that, i love you Adam, you&rsquo;re better than any of those oscar whiners (no, i dont mean winners)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you imagine him delivering this speech at the Oscars if he won? Good job spirit awards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reminds me of his VMA speech for &ldquo;Big Daddy&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:41 I‚Äôm sure Pattinson was laughing at home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m crying üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hilarious personality&lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deserved! Uncut Gems is absolutely insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOVE THIS GUY!!!! :D :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing. I choked up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He deserved it and he still is one of my favorite actors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm so lucky to be around during adam sandler era I‚Äôve watched 95% of his films and most of my quotes in every day life are off his films .. constantly funny and seems a genuinely honest and decent guy &hellip; he‚Äôs a role model to actors on how he presents himself even with his millions of dollers he is just one of the guys üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè keep up the great entertaining work mr sandler us here in the uk love ya</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs gonna pawn this award afterwards

</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: Also what a strong category for all the nominees. Schoenaerts and Pattinson also gave two of my favourite performances of the year!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler laughing at his own jokes will never not be hilarious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone know the music being played as Sandler walks to the stage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I seriously cannot believe no one yelled, &ldquo;YOU CAN DO IT!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yesss we‚Äôre getting the worst movie ever, can‚Äôt wait to watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firstly, I wish he&rsquo;d use his real voice cause I&rsquo;m struggling to understand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally a speech I could watch without wanting to smash my TV screen! Adam Sandler is a gem!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reminded me of Bobby Buche&hellip;lol&hellip;get it Adam we love u.,üíú‚ô•Ô∏è Well deserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My favorite part of the video is how happy everyone is to be witnessing this man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw the movie a few days ago and I still can&rsquo;t believe I was watching Adam Sandler, he reminded me of Al Pacino.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ok, but this speach is everything!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best speech EVER!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler Congratulations To You. Great To See You</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad we got to hear sandlers funny award speech but extremely relieved I didn&rsquo;t hear that speech at the Oscars as that would have robbed the world of the best Oscar speech ever from Joaquin Phoenix</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really hope he keeps doing high quality films like this because he is a great actor!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best speeches ever on movie history. Oscar should be more like Spirit Awards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Independent Spirit Awards is my Oscars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved his performance in Uncut Gems, but Robert Pattinson was SO GOOD in the Lighthouse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YAAAAAAAYYYY! And that laugh is so endearing.

<li>
<p>Totally snubbed for the oscar. Wow what a crazy performance (just saw it on netflix)&hellip; and best acceptance speech ever?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy for this dude his movie big daddy was  a big help with me when I got custody of my son at the age of four we went and seen that movie together when he was five and we got thru everything with prayer now my son is 25 and doin well thank u Adam Sandler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The real award aught to go to whoever had the balls to cast Adam Sandler in a role where he isn&rsquo;t just Adam Sandler.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I mean I love the guy, onesided as he is, I grew up with him in the 90&rsquo;s and whatnot. To see him outside of the usual is fascinating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not ganna lie I saw that movie and the ending was really Great and who ever wrote the movie deserves big recognition cox the movie was really good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler to Oscars :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THIS IS HOW I WIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Robert Pattinson literally stunned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love his works from the day 1. Finally, a recognition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joaquin should&rsquo;ve taken notes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He so freaking in his element and it&rsquo;s amazing üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can you not love the Sandman? Legend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was amazing. I had a smile on my face the entire time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i‚Äôm glad Adam won but i wish that Robert got some more recognition with his performance in The Lighthouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one of my childhood meditation is at 50&rsquo;s , I&rsquo;m 30 , time must go slowly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well deserved and an epic speech!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mickey Rourke&rsquo;s acceptance speech for The Wrestler was the best but man, this beats it

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love his speeches, memories!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man I&rsquo;ve never felt so much positive vibes in one speech before, everyone was feeding of his energy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always thought sandler would be good in a serious movie type after the little performance at the end of that remote movie where he was dying and being rained on and apologizing to his wife&hellip;I always thought he showed some acting skills on that movie too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He deserves another award for this speech, amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the best speech ever. He deserved a nomination for the Oscars though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That man deserves so many awards !! He been killing the Game since the stepped in !! Bekuz he not racist they don&rsquo;t wanna give him the extra push !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler doing an impression of Adam Sandler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good job Adam sandler üëè‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is probably my favorite acceptance speech of all time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler has been under appreciated on many of his films. He&rsquo;s also made some stinkers. But he&rsquo;s always come across as the guy you would most like to be friends with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An excellent actor when he really tries. Great work in this movie and I&rsquo;m glad that he&rsquo;s receiving recognition. He perfectly could&rsquo;ve been nominated for the Oscar but we all know how safe they are. The Lighthouse was totally snubbed too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only celebrity speech worth listening of the past 5 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to die without watching Adam Sandler win an oscar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not a fan. but kudos for the humility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So much self awareness. Plain lovely, wholesome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>best film of 2019&hellip;. just was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not gonna lie when I first saw uncut gems I felt a lot of anxiety then I came to realize bro that&rsquo;s the whole point his character completely made us shake our heads in worry and Adam Sandler did his job correctly and for that I must say he definitely deserved a Oscar nomination. If I had to replace one of the nominees for Sandler it&rsquo;d be Dicaprio no offense to him he did great he was hilarious in Once Upon a time in Hollywood but I thought Sandler did better. I also thought replacing Jonathan Pryce for Sandler but I watched the two popes and I&rsquo;m surprised I actually enjoyed it and his performance also considering he spoke different languages in some scenes. And Adam Driver well after that fight scene I think he definitely deserved his nomination but Sandler did fantastic. Hopefully he gets a nomination in a future role</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click, Reign over me, , punch drunk love and Spanglish, he&rsquo;s great dramatic actor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he truly deserves it, he was amazing as Howie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great for Adam totally deserved, he should do more dramatic roles he&rsquo;s pretty good at it, for instance Reign over me, Punch-drunk love

</li>
