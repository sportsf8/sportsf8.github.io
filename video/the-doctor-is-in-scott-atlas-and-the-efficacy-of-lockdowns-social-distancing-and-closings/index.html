<li>
<p>when governments take actions that make no sense it is because something else is at work influencing policy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to know how to get rid of this so-called COVID-19?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TURN OFF YOUR TV!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We spend billions and billions of dollars on healthcare science and the best we get during this pandemic is to stay six feet apart and wear a mask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another big mistake is listening to Dr. Bill Gates or his company the WHO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think listening to the media was the real problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has never been about the science.  This has always been about the politics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Netherlands a group of scientists, doctors and legal experts are suing the government demanding an immediate end to all Covid 19 restrictions and for the government to produce the scientific data they are using to justify unprecedented intrusion of legal rights. May I propose that Atlas finds a group of people to do the same in the US.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many people do you know that have the virus? During normal flu seasons I usually know several. This time, I know no one that has it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do not mince words. this was on purpose. for political reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of the 127,000 people that died, Id love to know how many of those actually died of covid. The two I’m aware of were in nursing home and they didn’t die from covid, yet it was reported that they were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let restaurants and stores set their own policies concerning social distancing and let their customers decide whether they would fell safe inside instead of having incompetent politicians and &ldquo;experts&rdquo; make such decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I highly advise homeschool instead of government indoctrination system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the science we are not hearing enough of. Lockdowns have done more harm than good. Yet mainstream media still continues to ignore these voices and repeat the hysteria narrative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amen!  let&rsquo;s get on with life, rather than hypothetical death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Considering what is being taught in schools these days, perhaps keeping them closed is not such a bad idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So refreshing seeing everyone finally opening their eyes about this plandemic in the comments&hellip; QUESTION EVERYTHING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closing playgrounds is not about health, it is about teaching children obedience to the government&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You said it - the impact of the policy is fear - That is exactly what they want!

<li>
<p>The lock-down is not about public health - it is about politics and control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resist any further lockdowns, they can protest at the thousands and Loot businesses but we can’t go to work or to the beach?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to get Dr. Atlas to a congrassional hearing and put him on the federal task force ASAP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A literal case of the cure being worse then the disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you speak up to the President?  We need people to speak up.  We know that Fauci is not with the people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just carry a BLM sign on the way to your barber shop. That way nobody will stop you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can never get enough Uncommon Knowledge. Unparalleled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quarantine The vulnerable (the sick) not the healthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So much pain and death from this unforgivable lockdown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unintended consequences of the lockdown. The doctor is 100% correct. Unwarranted panic in the pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They all knew the costs. The costs were the goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was done with the &lsquo;experts&rsquo; advice and silliness after they &ldquo;Flattened the Curve,&rdquo;   or &lsquo;bout week two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does President Trump not have this doctor on the podium with him !?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish Scott Morrison would listen to this and save Australia from the stupid consequences of his policies.  105 deaths in the continent and we still have lockdowns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;irrational response&rdquo; because we&rsquo;ve elected morons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vote out ALL politicians and elected officials that enforced lockdowns, masking, and any other tyrannical edicts.  We must get these tyrants out of office.  The fight for the future of America is happening and only we can save and ensure the freedoms and liberties for the generations to come</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nursing home thing is amazingly bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has everyone forgot, the government works for the general public not the other way around. Everyone who followed and were compliant with all this BS should have just refused to go along with it all. Furloughing was voluntary not mandatory. Why would the self employed close their own businesses. Who are the government to tell business owners to shut their shops, they work for us not the other way around xxxxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr Atlas seemed cautiously skeptical when this all started. Glad to see him standing up for truth and facts now that his initial predictions have proven true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The time of failed leadership must end, or we are committing national suicide.&rdquo;

<li>
<p>Herd Immunity is critical to all civilizations. Being isolated leaves you prone to all types of diseases not only the flu (which Covid 19 is).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As far as I understand we&rsquo;ve always dealt with an event like this by quarantining the sick, not the healthy, so what provoked this shift from practiced policy?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The results of lack of protection of the elderly vulnerable suggests to me that there was no interest in doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way nursing homes were handled almost made a non conspiracy person believe they was malevolence involved.  In my country it was pointed out that health care aides should not be working in multi different nursing homes    Governments did nothing about it yet could shut down everything in the economy.  It made no logical sense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The vaccines for kids are insane. 60+. No way anyone needs that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speakeasy culture. When you pass laws that stop people from doing what they wish to do and have no good reason not to do, you incentivize lawlessness and ruin respect of institutions; and the next thing you know radicals are taking advantage and trying to destroy society. This video was not eye opening, because I was already there in March, but this must be shared and spread nationally, globally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Better download this, it may be removed because it&rsquo;s true. Dr witkowski&rsquo;s was removed and he said much the same thing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop the madness! No one is scared of a virus that kills less than 1% of people infected!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s justifiable to shut down over an assumed mortality rate?? Lmao. What a joke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The US economy has been cratered less by the coronavirus than by the response to it&ndash;driven by the undemocratic idea that &lsquo;science&rsquo; should rule. There are not, and never will be, scientific answers to all public problems. Politics is how we exercise our free will, and that rather than reflexively deferring to experts, we should defer as much as possible to the principles of freedom and common sense.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have watched and learned so much from Mr Robinson&rsquo;s interviews over the decades.  This discussion is great as well.  Very thoughtful and absent the overwhelming fearmongering in all media outlets.  Evidence over modeling should be blatantly obvious. Thank you for all the years of excellent interviews. Please keep it up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appalling child abuse numbers wake up you F&rsquo;s, shame on you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Swede. When I heard that the Swedish government had decided NOT to lock down the country, I was first puzzled. This is not normal Swedish governmental behaviour, the present red/green regime would love to lock down and command with authority and the citizens are well trained after decades of social-democratic manipulation. So, what was going on? The answer is that the government had run down the famous social welfare system with hundreds of thousand refugees since 2015. There&rsquo;s a lack of money, that&rsquo;s the simple reason. Sweden did not lockdown because of the inability to take the costs, not because of rationality. As a Swede, this is elementary, so don&rsquo;t fool yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do a talk on the riots and the history of cultural marxism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank God for some common sense backed up by science. I am a retired physician and have said when this lockdown started it was a vast over reaction based on fear and bowing down to political expediency. The speaker is enjoyable and a breath of fresh air. Once again: Thank God for this man!! Keep up the great work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outstanding! Can you have Dr. Atlas reach out to the Trump administration?  He should also contact, Gavin Newsom, Bill di Blasio and ahem, Governor Cuomo, the grandma kicker. How refreshing was that? &ldquo;Use critical thinking.&rdquo; A tall order with the likes of Nancy Pelosi and the aforementioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let&rsquo;s replace Fauci with this guy already</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why I use the Hoover Institution as my main source of information. Always in depth and rational. I have a son who has been a respiratory therapist for 30yrs and he did mention that he was concerned with the people who were not showing up in his hospital like his asthma patients who need breathing treatment once in a while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have all the same ignorance in the Uk . Fear still reigns very much around me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I absolutely love your interviews! You are a fabulous host! The dialogue is always so insightful, so honest. This is sorely lacking in the conventional media outlets. I look forward to each and every one of your videos. Thank you and you must continue!

<li>
<p>There is a war on common sense in this country and perhaps worldwide. When people with good critical thinking skills are silenced by our cancerously sick media monopolies, how can we expect  anything but complete chaos and the ultimate breakdown of society. Perhaps this is the goal of the psychopaths in charge of the propaganda machine..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;and Fauchi advises the president? What a disaster? Other PhDs disagreed at the time so there is a lot of incompetence floating around on this horror issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish you would have delved into the efficacy of masks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gee&hellip;.models that suck! Who would have thought? Wonder how much better climate models are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This interview is so important a counterpoint, scientific update: a bigger than big report! Thank you, Drs. Atlas and Robinson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gov always create a crisis to cover up the that they stole all our money and it was somebody elses fault</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data was available in early March from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that showed the virus was not that contagious, not that harmful and really only dangerous to the elderly and ill.  It was obvious then and is still obvious.  We now need &ldquo;experts&rdquo; and politicians to admit they were wrong which sadly probably will never happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mother have been lock down in assisted living from the very beginning. All meals in her  little room. No leaving building. No physical contact with loved ones. It breaks my heart. I cant hold or touch my mother. I believe alot of this is law suits against these homes. Depression has set in. Lack of stimulation has fast tract memory loss. People of that age will die of flu or cold that moves into pneumonia. Are they to be locked down all the time? Now what she hears on tv makes her very scared. Calls every day to see if healthy. She never used to do that she was to busy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mayor Diblasio and Governor Cuomo along with Senator Schumer are the three  most incompetent officials oh yes there is also Obama,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You almost lost me when Dr. Atlas said he had tremendous respect for Fauci.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our public health officials were doing it for power and financial gain and corruption !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why open the schools when they are brainwashing the kid&rsquo;s from an early age?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copying the response of the communist Chinese was a big mistake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mention of the &ldquo;inflated&rdquo; COVID death numbers&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social distancing; a politician 6 ft under.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The time has come to END the lockdown&rdquo;. Wow when did you finally arrived at that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was all about social security checks, and vote by mail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quite encouraging to hear a solid dose of common sense backed with scientific data. Sadly we have been led by clueless politicians known to make policy decisions based on power mongering self-serving partisan stances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do you excuse the leadership that has ordered lockdowns, closings, masks and the whole nonsense, by saying they &ldquo;made a mistake.&rdquo;  Surely you know these leaders are intelligent and have as much information at their fingertips as do you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a blessing there are intellectuals and professionals that can discern the data and present it honestly for the layman to understand and come to his own conclusions of his world about him and so vote accordingly.

<p>Voices like this seem to not be part of the council.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Public health require a wholistic analysis.  Our technocrat experts are fools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is by far one of the BEST videos I have watched concerning the current situation with COVID, and how the decisions policymakers in the United States have been making are completely off-track of what is logical and sensible! I have seen the buffoonery multiply since day 1, and it seems to only be getting crazier and worse every day. When are our &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; going to start listening to ACTUAL&quot; experts, instead of these incompetent, power-hungry, ego-driven maniacs that are ruining our country?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall deaths since covid is down. Mostly because people are not going to butches who cause them to die at hospitals. I guess thats good since 250 thousand people die because bad medical care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;models&rdquo; are historically 100% incorrect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great interview!  We were duped. We are still being duped.  Civil liberties and economic freedom is curtailed without cost/benefit analysis, without proper science and without proper public policy debates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing interview! Wonderful Dr. Atlas! Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Two week lockdown!  With a slight over run&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such a reasonable argument</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a brilliant interview and everyone should hear it. Thank you guys!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cost of the lock down was not factored in because of the agenda to create chaos and sell vaccines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>~32:00 re: science and politics.  The problem is that common sense is no longer common.  Therefore, “the experts” are prone to mis-guide the rest of us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This conversation will go down in history as a bright light of knowledge, critical thinking and wisdom in a global time of darkness&hellip;.produced by a combination of media hysteria and intimidation and scienctists who abandoned real science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and often followed an equally intimidatory set of rules, regulations and instantaneous judgement of everyone  who dare to  ask questions or try to debate&hellip;.leave alone differ. The reason(s) for all of these will perhaps become clearer over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That feeling you get when you&rsquo;re listening to someone and you know instinctively that everything they are saying is right</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Atlas’s work is eye opening in a very good important way&hellip;points out that the lockdown has become another way to affect the election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a plan to destroy our countries. It&rsquo;s working beautifully. There&rsquo;s always going to be a virus out there. Never ending way for them to control us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had AFib surgery delayed until two weeks ago. I could have had a blood clot that killed me&hellip; Thank God I’m ok.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of your best interviews yet, Peter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All is simply cause and effect.  The societal effects appear planned.

<p>Doesn&rsquo;t that qualify falchi is a murderer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire Fauci!  Hire Atlas!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time for tribunals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which &ldquo;experts&rdquo; are we going to listen to? The ones politically or financially motivated&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justfacts.org says that the lost life years from the lockdown could ultimately be 7 times worse than the virus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, some rational evaluation of the science!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best overall analysis I’ve seen in 3 months. Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There seems to be a lot of common sense followers in this channel. Critical thinking faculties are switched on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So glad to finally pay attention in the margins to these interviews.  The interviewer is the Best ( I should know his name by now).  Interviewer appears honest and forthright, as well as most of his guests.  Nice to find something dependable to spend tie with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Peter Robinson I hope they never replace him as a host thank you for sharing this video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent Interview !! ,    by both of you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Truth, the Facts !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The good doctor builds his case with vast diplomacy and grace, leaving one to draw but one conclusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent information, thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Dr. does stray from his knowledge base when he discusses public schools.  Full disclosure: I was a homeschool mom.  However, it takes just a quick glance through thousands of years of history to confirm whether 13 years in a group classroom is a necessity for social skills or teamwork &ndash; it just isn&rsquo;t so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter, why do you always attribute good faith to these big govt operators?  Consider that CDC, et al intentionally executed their lock down strategy to derail Trumps limited govt revival.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree with basically all he says, but disagree that unless a child is in a public school he or she is living a deficient life. Our homeschooled kids did just fine thank you, and are doing well at their MA studies&hellip;.and we are low income.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also disagree that because you are lower income, you’re most likely to be a knuckle-dragger who becomes dangerous and unable to care for yourself if not gainfully employed. Rich people abuse and neglect their children also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please this doctor should speak at a rally (since the media will not let him speak!) He makes a all lot of sense! Thank you for the interview 👏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I needed this so badly. Here in San Francisco so many people are in the dark. It feels like they are zombies attached to the old narrative of covid being deadly for all. It’s kind of like The Twilight Zone. Thank you for a huge dose of sanity and hope!!!

<p>The Hoover Institution along with Stanford University has been the best source of information on &ldquo;our  plague&rdquo;.  This was a great interview.  If we had done almost nothing we would now be in far better condition.  That was my feeling after a short time, but I had and have no authority so kept what I perceived mostly to myself.  How many Americans had this intuition and had to remain silent?  We now know for a certainty just how incompetent the governors and mayors were with few exceptions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANK YOU. We can always count on Peter to bring us interesting topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr Atlas was fantastic and reassuring. Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dear Mr. President plz watch this post. Thank you Hoover guys. From a passionate Trump supporter in the Seattle area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay out of nursing homes and like places for retirement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This interview of Dr. Scott Atlas by the great journalist Peter Robinson should be a mandatory viewing by Governors and all political figures, as well as Fauci and the CDC group!  Yes, the doctor is only one giving his views, but his statements are not drawn from fear but rather proven research, logic and 39 years in the medical arena.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you both for a brilliant assessment of the current situation.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Can someone get this in the hands of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott? Gov. Abbott, whom I have supported in the past, appears to have lost all sense and perspective in dealing with the pandemic. (Sen. Cruz, are you listening?)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, give the decision to the owners themselves, and provide accurate information by researches to the public.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a total discrace  who gonna be our voice we need a leader and I mean now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much is saved when a sick incapacitated senior dies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;wolf crying&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the worst aspect of this.  I have now lost respect for 95% of the political class.  Zero public health justification for healthy people to wear masks, yet we are being forced to do it.  No push back from the media questioning this absurdity or from cowardly politicians.  Thank you, Dr. Atlas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control the population with fear! That is what is happening in this country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the UK the closing of the non-Covid National Health Service has produced a total excess deaths figure half of which might be a direct result of the lockdown, and not Covid. There&rsquo;s been a 50% fall in the number of people going to hospital with chest pains. The stupidity of all of this is truly staggering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The World Health Organization should have been doing there Job I&rsquo;m asking Who What Where how exactly did this Virus Come from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sadly the president cannot make his decision alone on any policy  politically and scientifically..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Left saw the CCP virus as a path to turbocharging the Cloward &amp; Piven strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have major depression and this has completely changed my life for the negative. It’s really frustrating to see that society continues to value people like me less than octogenarians with co-morbidities. Here in Hays County Texas we have new mask ordinances because of a doubling of cases from 500 to 1000. No mention of who is getting this and where. Just the raw numbers and a new mask law. It’s absurd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy makes too much sense. This will be remembered when the people&rsquo;s government takes power.

<li>
<p>So well done, easy to understand - grreat info</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to end the use of &ldquo;models&rdquo;&hellip;or overhaul the way they are made. All to often they are wrong, by a wide margin. This always ends in decisions based on them, being wrong, by a wide margin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it me, or does the Covid-crisis appear to be a fast-track analogy for the failure of our institutions in relying on &lsquo;experts&rsquo; utilizing faulty models to proscribe faulty solutions that have more to do with promoting agendas than addressing concerns,&hellip; Climate Change, anyone&hellip;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad to see and hear common sense and practically presented. Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incredible&hellip;just incredible how society in general is terrified of death and how the media and social media in general can control the emotions of millions&hellip;sad moment in history&hellip;hope we can overcome it&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s videos help keep me sane-God bless him!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>What if Kim Kardashian uses her twitter account to publish this?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>Am I crazy for not seeing other solution?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Distancing is a C.I.A. Torture Measure.  It’s equivalent to Smoking 🚬 a pack a day and being an alcoholic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Hoover Institute,  although discussions of this nature at this point would seem academic.  I  believe we can agree that there is a consensus of data that would  indicate the lockdown polices to be over-all reckless and irresponsible.  Furthermore in my view  (and many others) as to be intentional.    I would propose a more thorough conversation about WHY they are happening and to expose the actual entities behind the policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you! How reassuring to hear a sensible, sane narrative for a change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for your insights. I’ve been wanting the government in the Philippines to stop this moronic lockdown initiated by our Department of Health. Fear is the driver for this panic demic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This talk has been the best 50mins of commonsense i have listened to this year a big Thank You  to you both</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;If you shut down the schools you don&rsquo;t care about the children.&rdquo; Exactly. They don&rsquo;t care about the children. The media. The Democrat leaders of the blue states. They don&rsquo;t care. The CDC doesn&rsquo;t care. Fauci doesn&rsquo;t care. They have an agenda and the agenda is voting Trump out before they suffer the consequences they deserve. Prison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please mainstream media and incompetent journalists and governments listen to this common sense analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very very good information. Thank you. Although, since I am Swedish I can tell you that 75% of corona deaths have been in homes for the elderly. The majority of the rest have struck in areas with majority of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa. In wealthy, Swedish, areas almost 0 deaths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to a special Plague-time edition&rdquo;, LOL! Wonderful work, thank you!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;this is the last question&rsquo; (x4)

</li>
<li>
<p>this is the end&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boom!  (the sound of running feet )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you very much for inviting Dr. Atlas to your program, which I always enjoy, regardless of whom you interview.  Dr. Atlas has provided for me the most common sense approach to the pandemic that I have heard to this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the UK they want to prolong these effects and praise us all for our national efforts when it is done under duress ie threat of fines or even jail for non compliance.  What has changed this once great nation of freedom to one of the worst countries since the fall of communism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DOWNLOAD THIS TO YOUR COMPUTER NOW! YT will almost certainly make it &ldquo;disappear&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I HAVE TO TAKE PAIN MEDS AND THE MEDIA HAS MESSED UP MY LIFE , THE DOCTORS HAVE LOWERED ME AND NOW ALL I CAN DO IS SIT HERE 99 % OF THE TIME , THANKS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have to wonder if what the policy makers were thinking is not what everyone else things they are thinking. It is possible that some have figured out the real goal is to weaken us politically and economically is where we should be looking for answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great interview, level headed points of view. Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welcome to the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Dr. Atlas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deblasio and Cuomo both need to VACATE OFFICE IMMEDIATELY - total incompetence, hypocrisy and disrespect for the NY citizens.  They both need to be charged with crimes against humanity and political overreach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent, actual science-based and common-sense commentary.   Dr. Atlas’ message here needs to get out to everyone.  Please forward!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have emailed this interview to seven friends and will send it to.others as I learn their email address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Children do not transmit the disease !!!!&rdquo; WOW !!!   Could he be right ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank  you so much for this amazing medice against madness: the logical way of thinking! One Brazilian like for you guys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The age of technocracy. Governing or control of society or industry by an elite of technical experts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This whole virus is an outright lie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome Interview !!!

<p>Dr. Scott Atlas is a common sense thinking Doctor !!! He is AMAZING!!! GreaT questions too ❣️            🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 ThankU for inviting Dr. Scott Atlas! From: Marlene &amp; John in FLORIDA!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid-19 is the biggest scam of 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your medical epertise and Uncommon Knowledge about COVID-19.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>watch from 17:00 for rationale to reopen all the schools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very interesting interview! I don&rsquo;t think the &ldquo;number of years lost&rdquo; between covid vs. lockdown is a fair comparison, though. It might be better to compare predicted &ldquo;number of years lost&rdquo; for covid + lockdown vs. covid without lockdown. It would also be nice to see the error bars on these numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Robinson, you are the calm in the storm. Love your programs and your interview style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hello and thank You for the vid, it&rsquo;s funny that in all those videos, I hear talking about Sweden and Finland, who didn&rsquo;t lock down, but no one talks about Japan, because they didn&rsquo;t lock down and they didn&rsquo;t have a large number of death, even they are very close to South Korea and China and they also have an old medecine that did work fine for this flew. have a good day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Last question&hellip;&rdquo; x10 😂 I love this convo btw. Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you!  Finally. Someone articulates the child abuse component.  I&rsquo;ve been thinking on this often coming from an emotionally &amp; physically abusive &amp; insane home. School was my ONLY escape from the hell &amp; daily terror I lived in. The word sadness barely suffices ~ when all is said and done, someone needs to answer for all the harm that&rsquo;s been inflicted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s all bs this doctor is right and the schools need to be OPEN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;hyper theoretical projection&rdquo; agreed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Excellent exchange, Gentlemen&hellip;Thank you for sharing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Robinson any chance of you interviewing Dr Thomas Sowell again, my favorite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the hint at the evolving speak-easy culture at the end of the interview. That is rational and pragmatic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for getting this information out there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry, I have a hard time believing that you gentlemen don’t know why government is actually doing this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless you Peter I love that I can actually listen to a good interview of someone after hearing their name come out of our Presidents mouth without having tons of conjecture and media bias driving pointed answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What an incredible interview… Thank you! I hope that you continue to have all the conversation and expose the various agendas that are going to help influence a collective move forward.  Big hugs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;(SPEAKING OUT)&rdquo; AS YOU SEE IT??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AND YOU SAY IT!!&hellip;.

<p>Amazing interview !     Logic is beautiful !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for confirming what I already knew in my heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best recent Uncommon Knowledge programs I&rsquo;ve seen.  Thanks Hoover Institution and Peter!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you. You provided more truth than we will get from the mainstream media in twenty years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great interview from Both seats. Thank you for verifying my thoughts on the matter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>16:18 - &ldquo;Open all K-12 schools&hellip;&rdquo; article.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am going through something similar with my hair&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is still one of the best podcasts to help with sensemaking!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sanity at last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my god, they lied to us. Wow, I&rsquo;m so surprised, not. Dr Fauci is a jerk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VACCINES ARE A SCAM!   If this guy does Not Know that Vaccines are Scam, Unsafe, Un effective AND DEADLY  - THERE IS SOMETHING VERY WRONG !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Atlas what about the debate on masks-to wear or not to wear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we get an honest doctor.  Thank you Dr. Atlas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are missing the most important point of all! They weren&rsquo;t making mistakes these things were done on purpose and it was all democrat-led! How could you not notice the previous 35 hoaxes one after another for the last three and a half years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done</p>
</li>
