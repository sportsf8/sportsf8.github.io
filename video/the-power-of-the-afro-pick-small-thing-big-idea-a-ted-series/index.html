<p>Now do one about dreads so these poor kids stop getting into trouble with schools&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That girl in the video picking her hair is so beautiful btw! Something about afro + turtleneck is just soooo elegant üëåüèªüëåüèª</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never thought of the cultural significance. It&rsquo;s just the only thing that gets through my hair, without, pulling, or spraining my wrists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this&hellip;literally such a small thing to the world..means so much to us with natural thick kinky coily curly beautiful hair. ‚ù§ We are beautiful, even if it&rsquo;s deemed &ldquo;unruly &amp; unprofessional&rdquo; by many Americans.. it&rsquo;s US. We were made this way. Black is beautiful. Black hair is beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Ted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sudan‚ô•Ô∏è. I use an afro pick today just like my ancestors did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just asked Great Big Story for a video that included black hair and you guys made one about black hair. I love you 3000, but like Andre :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Japan, I rarely see an afro hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to see real one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I go out in Clubs they take my Afro Pick because they suppose I would use it as a weapon lawwwwwd. -_-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just took my braids out, so my scalp can breath for a few days before getting it re-braided&hellip;.So I‚Äôm literally watching this video picking my Afro with my Afro Pick‚úäüèæ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i love how he pronounces &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; &lt;3 very nice video! wish there had been more about how the afro pic is speciallly good for afros, how/why it&rsquo;s better compared to a standard comb etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power to the people ‚úåÔ∏è‚úä</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for this my wife and I were just talking about those picks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a young adult at the time of the &ldquo;Black is Beautiful&rdquo; movement or campaign, and I understood it to rest on an analysis of the mechanics of oppression: that the background hum of belittling remarks on appearance serves to undercut the self-confidence of the oppressed; &ldquo;Black is Beautiful&rdquo; was a defiant assertion, and a rejection of the oppressor&rsquo;s viewpoint.  It seems to me that this has been forgotten!!  A few years ago, when the radio host Don Imus made nasty remarks about some young women&rsquo;s hair, I was horrified at  the letters that were published, from women of stature, who testified to being cut to the quick by those remarks; remarks made by a person whose own appearance was extremely foolish!  I say it is time to revive the Black is Beautiful campaign.  It&rsquo;s good psychology, and, by the way, very true!  The grooming, and most especially the hairstyles, of Black men as well as women, is in a whole other category from anything White people have come up with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pride in who you are.  Nice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I am is already beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have always loved the look of afros üòç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never know that it is an Afro pick! My mom brought it by mistake and use it like an usual comb. Learn a new thing!

<p>More on subject, it is interesting to get a little history on the item; not just relevant to American culture, but the ancient roots as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The American culture aspect really shouldn&rsquo;t even exist; it&rsquo;s due to nothing more than people&rsquo;s ignorance. Neither a person&rsquo;s hair type or skin color have any relationship to one&rsquo;s personality or value as a human being, and it&rsquo;s a shame that such things continue to occur today</p>

<p>His voice is so soothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4 minutes of education - love it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just have to see Amber Ruffin a couple of times to understand how awesome African hair in its natural state is!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loved this</p>

<p>Hello friends, I only used an afro pick when my afro was very short</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I NEEDED THIS. THE FORMAT. THE EMPOWERMENT. THE BEAUTY. I NEEDED IT ALL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚úäüèø</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pick is one of the coolest objects that we don&rsquo;t think about</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s so daymn stylish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to think the afro pick was just a comb but now I know its importance :D imma start using mine with more pride</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Educational and with a sprinkling of ASMR?? I was hypnotized,  brilliant!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did this video remind anyone else of K.O. Joe by Chop  Socky Chooks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It must be amazing to be black</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like this&hellip; Blessed be.

<p>Incredible how ancient hair combs and Afro picks look exactly the same</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like that beautiful young lady. Very elegant&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an afro is too much for me to take care of so I&rsquo;ll just use the pick to hold it back Chinese style</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as an asian-american i always wondered why some people would wear it in their hair. really cool and enlightening stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a beautiful video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informative. I thought it was just a dense and long hair comb. Neither which I have. :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stainless steal for me just because they don&rsquo;t break every five seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use them to set my hair apart , combs didn‚Äôt work, the teeth would break. The brush are too much in pulling the hair ., since when using a pic become  a black history item ?  I use em everyday</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rock it!&lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love being Black. ‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üíö</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was a good, informative vid!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really interesting!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So that&rsquo;s how they do it !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dope , I don‚Äôt even need it and I want one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video is awesome!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a moment I thought chronixx cut his hair and put on a little weight</p>
</li>

<p>As a mixed guy, I&rsquo;m thinking while watching, &ldquo;UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMM!!&rdquo;</p>

<li>
<p>Well the perfect person to talk about an afro comb was someone who literally can&rsquo;t use it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the 70s our US Navy disallowed Black sailors to  carry a pick. Their excuse was it was unsafe, that when going up ladders the Pic might puncture the eyes on the sailor coming up the ladder behind, and so on and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I loved me some afro&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful culture!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really enjoyed this historical narrative. I grew up in an all-white rural area of the Midwest. My grandma was a retired beautician who still did hair for my mom and aunt, and her kitchen regularly smelled like the chemicals used in perms. It wasn&rsquo;t until college and my exposure to other cultures that I realized a hair pick was traditionally an African tool since all the white women I knew used one. I will always believe there is much more that unites us than divides us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power of the Barber is stronger. Your barber is a man who can either make or break your week. He controls the flow of your popularity and can embarrass you in a moment‚Äôs notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All lives matter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y‚Äôall say Egyptians ain‚Äôt black.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FistüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish I could walk around every day with a comb in my hair&hellip; jealous much üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to sound as if I&rsquo;m taking away from the struggle of black natural hair being accepted cuz I know the black community has had one fuckn hard time trying to just have white people accept their naturally curly hair. I just want to say as a white girl who has naturally curly hair even I have dealt with the lack of acceptance of my naturally curly hair it&rsquo;s just something that&rsquo;s not accepted and someone always has a novel idea of style for your hair to tame it and if only they had your hair they would do it so much better and they could achieve straightness with my kinks and waves. I didn&rsquo;t accept my hair until I moved to a black community and had to be shown by black people that my natural hair is beautiful!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazing, I‚Äôm brown but have an Afro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next: The wonder of the toothbrush</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for sharing this video..IAM white but when I was in my early twenties,it was my mom&rsquo;s idea that I get a permanent..I had anice size afro..the odd looks on other white And black people  faces was worth it..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was looking forward to learning about picks. Then it took a left turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire time I was watching this I couldn&rsquo;t help but to think about Spaceballs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you believe in the helpfulness of a Method or an Item it help you because of the Placebo effect. Interesting isn&rsquo;t it.

<p>a &ldquo;utilitarian tool&rdquo; is tautological tautology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So sounding uneducated is Black? C&rsquo;mon TED you could&rsquo;ve found so many other smart black people to do this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got Afro Natural Pick it supposed to Look So Natural we are Supposed to wear Afroisim our hair is made that way Naturally from the Earth üòÇüòØ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HAPPY BLACK HISTORY MONTH! ü§õüèø‚úäüèæüëåüèΩ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to see Afros worn with pride more often in the media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does one even grow an afro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Picks and pyramids=PRICELESS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They really let people talk about anything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>subtitles?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This vid have no CC button - YouTube AI can&rsquo;t detect human speech here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why am I not surprised there are so many dislikes? People lie like they want knowledge about black people, but it&rsquo;s not at all true. Black folks have been explaining ourselves for hundreds of years, but rather than learn, people would rather just act like everything is a mystery so they can keep dismissing the truth (and us). I wish this video was longer to cover how children are being suspended from school for their hair (even in Africa where there are non-black administrators) or people are losing job opportunities because of how our hair naturally grows. Again, knowledge is ignored, because there&rsquo;s your explanation for why our hair gets straightened and made to conform to a Eurocentric standard. People are still being controlled on some level. Now it&rsquo;s even internalized. But y&rsquo;all don&rsquo;t really care, so you?</p>

<p>Mikrofonsveis.</p>

<li>
<p>He said all that but has no afro?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comb the desert</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much love to my beautiful nappy haired brothers and sisters&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yea but whats more empowering? An afro, waves or a fade?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at all those dislikes for something that literally has no effect on someone else‚Äôs wellbeing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get the metal teeth, bad for you hair, go with plastic it irritates your scalp less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>afro picks are not utilitarian sir, do u know what that word means</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black is beautiful ‚ô•Ô∏è

<p>1 more of these woke lefty video&rsquo;s and I&rsquo;m done with TED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uhhh&hellip;&hellip; Pandering, much?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh I have to brush my hair too. My mums got crazy curly hair. Post shower her hair explodes outwards in a frizzy way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a black people problem, it&rsquo;s a people with curly hair problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now if they&rsquo;d focus on real African history instead of this mindless crap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TED BECOME VOX. TOO MUCH POLITICS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine a white person talking about being proud of being white and talking like this. It would be mass hysteria lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move these to a separate series</p>

<p>Proud of your comb??!!!? America is messed up in so many ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything that is based on race is racism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not that this is completely irrelevant, I can see how this trivia could  be the basis for a presentation for a high school (not AP though) social science project of some sort but why would this  come out of the TED channel?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would suggest TED sticks to its motto &ldquo;ideas WORTH spreading&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bur heads&hellip;it&rsquo;s like petting grandma&rsquo;s poodle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I look forward to the day when black people consider themselves American enough to consider their history American just like the rest of us, so far they seem to insist on this &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; black history of theirs, if only they knew the history separate but equal. :/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok. I&rsquo;m unsubscribing now, ty TED for this useless video see you never.

<p>Black technology month. Where everything can be summed up in 34 seconds back we have to drag it out anyway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This from a White man, IMO, the &lsquo;Afro&rsquo;, was the best and neatest, as in clean, and sharp that they ever looked!  That only lasted a couple years and look what they have now&hellip;filthy dreadlocks and NO shaving!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muh oppression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Woman mistreating their hair is not specific for black women. All white woman with straight hair desperate wanted to have curls and mistreated their hair with a permanent wave. On a festival with mainly black people I went to the ladies room and standing between only black women I suddenly realized that they all want my kind of hair. Liked I wanted their kind of hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YALL LIKE KFC AND WATERMELONS?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why every afro stuff is mixed with politics and whining ? Passive aggressive all along.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sad because instead of advertising how marvellous you think you are you can just be wholesome and people will look at you with envy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that African (American) hair is ludicrous and ridiculous.</p>
</li>
