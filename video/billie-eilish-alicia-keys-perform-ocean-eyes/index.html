<li>
<p>I feel like Alicia&rsquo;s voice doesn&rsquo;t suit Ocean Eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second Billie started singing i cried Like a Baby. Her voice is so unbelievable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie&rsquo;s head be like : Omg I&rsquo;m singing with Alicia Keys</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Alicia&rsquo;s head be like : Omg I&rsquo;m singing with Billie Eilish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we all just talk about how polite the crowd was?! They remained silent through the entire song!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie at age 18: * Sings with Alicia Keys*</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me at age 18: Google search ‘Can you die from eating too many chicken nuggets?’ 🥴</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This made me realize even more how unique and unmatched her voice is, like damn when billie starts singing my soul gets blessed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never realised how hard it is to sing as low with so much control like billie does until Alicia keys couldn&rsquo;t&hellip; She kept going high! Billies voice is so unique!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:13 When Billie says in a sneaky way &quot; shiiiiet..&quot; feeling the vibe of Alicia dragging the tempo of the lyrics perfectly in a authentic unexpected brilliant way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought that Billie put some effect on her voice&hellip; but no she sounds like that 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billies voice is softer than Alicia. Alicia has a powerful voice that she was trying to hold back .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s crazy&hellip; billie is just sitting there like “Alicia Keys is really singing the lyrics I wrote when I was 13&hellip;.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn I didn&rsquo;t know Alicia could sing like that holy crap her voice is beautiful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Absolutely love how neither of them tried to upstage or out-sing each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at 02:14 when Alicia sings &ldquo;no fair&rdquo;, Billie goes &quot; sh*t&quot; (the kind when you&rsquo;re like wow-ed )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has ultra control in those deep breathy notes, also she incorporates sounds made by her mouth (not notes) to her singing, making it richer and more personal, very mesmerizing to listen to her.

<li>
<p>siri show me perfection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want&hellip;No&hellip;.NEED this duet to be recorded in the studio and put on Spotify so I can listen to this like a billion times. Soooooooo Beautiful!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie at 15: famous singer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me at 15: Wondering if the demon under my bed is the same demon in my closet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpopular opinion but Alicia’s voice just doesn’t work as well in this song :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay but can we talk about how Alicia kept those high notes from one breath, kept them running, like daaaaaaaaamn. She is so good. They both killed big time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie at 17: Singing to millions of people and doing a duet with Alicia Keys.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me at 20: singing to my dog and watching him run away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Billie always sounds like she’s always not even trying. Although her voice is so perfect</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>billie is so impeccable she is outstanding her voice is so warm and heart felt with torrebt of emotions its so hard to hit low nots it require so much breath and lung control she is so incredible also her voice is so therapeutically,  God bless u billie no one is like you , only there is also amazing lady resemble same style her name ( billie Martin) check it out guys ❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it just me or did anyone notice alicia try hard to stay low? Sometime she sound like stressing the note.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn’t really like either,how is it after this I love both? 😳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t think people realize how difficult this song is, Billie was 13 YEARS OLD when it was recorded. The older you get the more your voice matures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can’t tell if Billie’s voice is so so much more mature or unique? But my opinion Billie’s voice out classes Alicia Keys’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia looks like she’s hosting a tea party with her besties. And they’re both 6 year olds. So cute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really underestimated Billie thinking she uses autotune but damn I felt blessed when she started singing 🌞🌞🌞🌞

<li>
<p>I loveeee how alicia hits the “no fair” and “I’m scared” but them TOGETHER 😩 I’m not crying you’re crying!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not a big Billie fan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But she’s got hell of a good voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i dont know how, this song just gave me a hug..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie is so effortless and sounds like an angel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has she got the most softest controlled voice I ever heard in 46 years? I think so</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie is so fcking talented girl , that was perfect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie sounds like her songs when she sings that’s TALLENT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie Eilish + Jhené Aiko + H.E.R needs to happen. Their voices will complement one another tremendously!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn’t grow up listening to Billie, I just found out about her not too long ago&hellip; And I absolutely love her. Alicia has always been my woman queen crush, but this duo is phenomenal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was soo beautiful 😭😩they shld make an aesthetic version of this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Btw I literally just realise how unique Billie&rsquo;s voice is😌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was the type of crowd we needed in the live performance at BRIT Awards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Billie is still fan girling while singing and being validated by her idol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way Billie is able to control her voice is mind blowing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>december feels like a billions years ago but this performance is still one in a million and I love it thank you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie&rsquo;s voice is different I can&rsquo;t explain what her music does to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alicia keys looks like superwoman here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia and Billie: THOSE OCEAN EYEEEESSS</p>

<li>
<p>Alicia&rsquo;s Vocal Power is unmatched by any &amp; everybody in the world. She held that No Fair note at 2:12 for 6-7 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie at 18: becomes worldwide famous</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me at 18: <em>trying to eat with my mouth closed and as quietly as I can so I don&rsquo;t wake anybody up at night</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at the way Billie looks at her while she’s singing like “damn Alicia keys really knows my song right now and she’s killing it!” 💙</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does anyone else get goosebumps when Billie starts singing?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>No just me:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insane how billie’s voice is like its own instrument. Definitely unique and like no other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bellas mujeres, bellas voces, únicas,especiales; geniales, voz de ángeles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally I got see my favorite artists singing together ❤❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so sad they didnt do the part of the song where billie sings ocean eyes backwards :/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meanwhile me (same aga as billie): trying to make squeaking sounds stepping on my bed😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both Are a Really Good Singers&hellip; But The Only Full Voice What I Can Hear is Alicia Keys &hellip;..The rest is a Whisper s&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the PERFECT definition of fire and ice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you can really tell how much Billie loves Alicia in this lol her face when Alicia was singing was like &ldquo;HOLY CRAP IM SINGING WITH THE ALICIA KEYS&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They look so cute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie’s way of singing is actually difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if they were to write and sing a song together I&rsquo;d get Billie to sing the verses and more relaxed parts and Alicia keys to sing louder and more powerful parts.

<li>
<p>Interesting thing about billies songs is its actually a different singing style than other artists, so not many of them can approache this song in a well practiced way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn&hellip;That was so beautiful. They both have such an amazing voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love what Billie does with her deep voice. She is definitely not a static artist. As she matures physically and emotionally, her vocal highs and lows are gonna reach amazing multitudes of low lows and high highs! I love watching her &ldquo;emerge&rdquo; as she grows! She definitely knows how to use her voice as a very complex instrument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how billie always sounds like she is not even trying to sing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>every time billie opens her mouth i’m amazed by what comes out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie needs to work in her breathing&hellip; Alicia is perfect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s simply perfection, how they both sound so differently yet their voices are in such sync and totally blows my mind&hellip;. I am in love with this duet ❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the performance we dont ASK for but we DESERVE. 😇</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like people be sleeping on how much control Billie actually has in her voice. Holding long notes in that breathy tone is hard. Like damn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love billies voice here my ears have been blessed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is singing without open her mouth.. wow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love how the audience is quiet through out the performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know when you’re at church and when you actually can relate to something that the pastor is saying?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s how I feel with this song</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m actually proud of the audience they finally shut up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t sing with Billie, I&rsquo;d cry as soon as she started to sing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen &amp; heard</p>
</li>

<p>Billie looking at her like she getting married lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y is no talking about how they r harmonizing  like that!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got goose bumps👌❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia keys can’t sing in this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crazy emotion in her voice on that from Billie,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia just there to be her champion ! Dang this new generation is crazy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia&rsquo;s voice is perfect and she sounds amazing, but it&rsquo;s commendable how Billie singing just gives it a different vibe all together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie Ellish is one of those rare singers whereby she can be defined as an ORIGINAL artiste. As in nobody can sing her songs better than she does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia has such a power full voice that she cant hold it she wanted to break it so bad and billie has such a control over her voicee love billie fir lifeeeeeeee</p>

<p>This is a fantastic example of keeping songs in you powerhouse as far and range and key. This is a relatively awkward key for Alicia Keys, so it lacks the power Billie can give to this song in its normal key. I’d kill to hear them both in a comfortable key!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is simply beautiful every time when Billie is watching Alicia being out of tune, but she is just smiling :) Apart of 2:12, than Alicia saved it and Billie with that &ldquo;oh shit&rdquo; :)))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:13 Billie curses when Alicia kills those high notes. Love this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you realize how vocally restricting this song is even for someone that has lots of experience. Billie has such a unique voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie sounds so good even without auto be. She doesn’t even need it! Also, Alicia and Billie have really good harmonies!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t stop staring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At those oceans eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the critics here: it&rsquo;s not about the voice, it&rsquo;s about expression. Alicia might have the better voice (she has more experience), but Billy in this performance has more expression. You can hear that Billy made the song that her brother wrote for his own band her own. And it&rsquo;s clearly not Alicia&rsquo;s song. The harmony between both is great in this performance. They obviously both love the song and have mutual respect and adoration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember then Alicia Keys  came on the scene, a Rare beauty, came out of nowhere, a fresh voice. It seems Eilish did the same. The irony of these two together will be missed by many.

<li>
<p>Billie has been smiling a lot more. It’s refreshing to see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im obsessed. with james corden i watch him every day thats all i watch and and with this song</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will never fault anyone or an audience for being excited/screaming/cheering, but I really have to commend this audience for letting these two sing so gently without cheering after each verse or anything. It was so quiet, gentle and beautiful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie&rsquo;s my crush. I really love her voice. So damn amazing 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how Billie&rsquo;s hair glow in the dark 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These people complaining about Alicia&rsquo;s vocals can&rsquo;t even appreciate the beauty of contrast between these two amazing artists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really gorgeous, these two together are heaven sent 💙💙</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be honest Billie did much better than Alicia in this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was Beautiful 😍😍😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This song is so beautiful and they both killed it. Love them so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Makes u realise how easily high notes come to billie eilish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May Jesus bless y&rsquo;all and may He fill each one of you with His life and presence. May He opens up your eyes to see that the only real life we could get from this world is with Him. All those who repent on their sins and go after Him asking for mercy and salvation, will receive it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others:Billie,alicia bla..bla..bla..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me:I love Billie Eilish ..thats it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billy is really special. She got an angelic voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we talk about how UNIQUE there voices are them mix them together !!!!FIRE 🔥🔥🔥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you actually realize how high the song is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I hear this song I feel like I&rsquo;m flying in the sky and swimming in the ocean at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, You searched for this.

<li>
<p>boar the voice of Billie is so incredibly beautiful and perfect &hellip; I always get goose bumps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are absolutely AMAZING DIFFERENT GENRE 😍😍😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lets just say this is way better than Justin Bieber and Billie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when they start harmonising&hellip; 🤩🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:13 I want some in my life that looks at me the same way Billie looks at Alicia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For all of those who think Billie is just whispering, she is not signing, sadly lots of people think that here in canada and many other places , im a french Quebec Canadian, and this girl is saving thousands of young lifes through her songs.. who else here can whisper notes and sound like an Angel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is mind blowing. Whenever I listen to the song it makes me wanna cry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how everyone is just silent and listening to their performance!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No hate whatsoever but I didn’t like alicias singing with this song</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia I admire with your smile,, Very cutest ❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Hey siri, make me sob”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So awesome of Alicia to sing a song so out of her confort zone. She has such a strong and powerful voice, wouldn&rsquo;t ever imagine her singing in that low and soft of a tone. But she did it, tried her best and killed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Billie Elish she my life omg so graceful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Billie Eilish I just want to meet her 🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s just a angelic voice I can’t stand it :p</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie you blessed my ears</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serious question, im a 23 year old man, just eating his cup noodles while randomly clicking on this video and all of a sudden midway through the video, a tear came out of my eyes, is that normal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s song makes me chill so much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QUE ISSO BRASIL?! QUE ISSSOOOO BRASIL!?!? Que eu não tinha visto ainda! Aaaahhh paraaaaaaaa PARAAAAAA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ACTUALLY HAVE CHILLS THAT NEARLY MADE ME CRY AND I DOMT CRY FROM SONGS

<li>
<p>Billie Ellish deserve everything ❤️🦋 she so talent 💃🏾🌊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i love how Alicia just reveals a piano out of a desk&hellip;reminds me of when finneas just whipped out a keyboard and just started playing in that beats ad for eiw</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When true talent comes from the heart, compettion and recognition goes out of the window its pure beauty ♥️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how at 2:15 Billie said sh*t when Alicia was so singing, so funny 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching you for some time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t stop staring at those ocean eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burning cities and napalm skies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This just made me cry because it’s so beautiful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia&rsquo;s fingers kinda have their own eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An intimate moment of a beautiful duet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia keys is literal vocal goals BUT BILLIE OMG!!! Unmatched</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The captions:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:10 watch Billie&rsquo;s reaction to Alicia KILLING IT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think billie eillish deserves her own genre. Her voice is just a diamond</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie has 100% mega talent. I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone sing so perfectly irl. Her live performances are even better than the studio recording 😭❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful, beautiful, thousand times beautiful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some time

</li>
<li>
<p>At those oceans eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just love how they both clearly respect each other as an artist, no competition, just a mutual love for music; giving the song justice with their voices ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie can’t hide her eyes of  how she proud next to alicia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie is such an amazing talent 💯🔥🔥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>noone mumbling is actually a great great singer. you&rsquo;re great if you can hold these high notes live. the rest might be good and originsl, but not great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maio 2020 ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vai ser afinada la na bahia ..toma no cu.. as duas dão um espetáculo de falsete, a keys segura mas a eilish mostra q timbre é timbre e o dela é muiiiito melhor.. que video tmnc.. cadê os BRAZUKAAAA ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hearing this i now feel the absolute warmth in the voice of Billy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we’re just fangirling over billie fangirling over her idol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This definitely wasn’t the song for Alicia you can tell it’s too soft for her she sings so beautiful in her own songs I think. Not hating I really love Alicia’s own style that’s all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>around 2:16 when Alicia starts vocalizing, billie&rsquo;s like &ldquo;oh shit..?&rdquo; LMFAO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What me and my friends thought we were doing when we hosted &lsquo;musicals&rsquo; and &lsquo;tea parties&rsquo; when we were five or six lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hehehehe the comment I wrote they just pulled. I ❤️ ❤️ these two women too much is all. And good foresight removing my raunchy comment. I’ll explain it in emoji form: 🧞‍♂️🧚🏻🧚🏽😛😜😯❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🏃🏿🎼🎶🎼🎶🎵🎵🎶🎼🎶🎼👃🏾🍑👌👌👃🏾👃🏾👃🏾🤪❤️❤️👍🏾👍🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think what really impresses me about Billie is how beautiful her voice is even when singing softly and delicately. It&rsquo;s one thing to be able to belt out notes, but you can really appreciate her tone and control in a stripped back performance like this. Gorgeous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magic happens when women unite ✨✨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alicia keys has a beautiful voice.. The other girl haven&rsquo;t heard her before, then both blended so well.. Nice🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those oceans eyes. I love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such power and subtlety to break and mold a mood. Billie And Ms. keys 🤩

<p>The collaboration no one asked for, but the one we&rsquo;re officially grateful for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 mill views are probably just from me i love this song there voices compliment each other so well&hellip;.truly amazing beautiful ❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:14 shet. AAAAA CUTEE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for alicia to go easy and gentle on her notes is also an achievement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Billie sings!  She&rsquo;s very articulate when singing!  You can actually understand what&rsquo;s she&rsquo;s saying.  Thank goodness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>alicia has a powerful voice so this really isn’t her style, don’t come for her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love that song I love you Alicia Keys and you too Billie Eilish!!! :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biliie’s  voice is like angles 😍✨she’s fantastic 🤩</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo wtf this made me realize how amazing billie’s voice is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way they both hop in and out of harmonising with one another so easily just shows how bright both talents shine, the way they reply and compliment each other’s vocals! Like Heavenly sighs! Truly blown away every time I watch this 😁Like hand to glove, such a good fit! Well done Billie&amp;Alicia 🙌🏽 thanks girls!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was live in the audience. This sounded so angelic and it was everything I hoped it would be. So happy they sang this together 🥰😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THIS SONG IS SO HARD TO SING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alecia keys voice is to deep for this song</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6.3k people out there with no taste 😱. This rendition gave me goosebumps from head to toe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everybody&rsquo;s talking &lsquo;bout Billie, please appreciate the way Alicia sang it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Alicia having a huge career in the industry give Billie her space to bright . So much respect for both of them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie eilish sounds just the same as in the studio it awesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is so pretty and talented i love him❤</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>I Love how Bilie goes &ldquo;shit&rdquo; when Alicia sings at 2:15</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will sound so amazing in 8D AUDIO!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pleaaaase someone turn this into something you can listen to on Spotify</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally brought me to tears. So beautifully executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie has CRAZY control over her voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:23 omg Billie is soooo gorgeous !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie&rsquo;s voice is as thin as my patience. 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a tutorial on Alicia Keys’ piano arrangement here!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, this is boring. I don&rsquo;t know what I was expecting, but this really disappointed me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie is singing like she doesn’t know what’s autotune 😭❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>goosebumps literally all over my body.. this was beautiful. love this. ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL! 💚</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can someone dislike it&hellip;🥺🥺🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omgosh ladies 😍 that waa beautiful 💗</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>billies little “oh shiii” made me smile so hard. this was beautiful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not gonna lie never knew Billie was like that Alicia might have found a worthy successor to her throne 😭😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i actually really enjoy the contrast between their voices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the perfect example of two different genres, styles, eras, voices and artists who cross the bridge right into the middle to meet and create moments in music never to be forgotten, by respecting, praising and complementing one another and the audience which, in the end, is the ones consuming art. ART. NEVER FORGET! ART, not trash and insults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>every time i watch this video billies voice amazes me more and more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Billie&rsquo;s vocal control is out of this world
