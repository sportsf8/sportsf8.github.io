<h3 id="comments">comments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jin seriously CANNOT be bothered when he&rsquo;s eating. It&rsquo;s just him and the food.</li>
<li>Everyone talking about BigHit family.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Meanwhile</li>
<li>Need more interaction between bight labels idols but here u go childish fans out there</li>
<li>ARMY.Seeing how BTS didn&rsquo;t edit out the Gfriend part means that they trusted you that you won&rsquo;t cause controversy so don&rsquo;t disapoint them.They are working under one company.Don&rsquo;t cross the boundaries.It&rsquo;s normal.Mention ones name doesn&rsquo;t mean anything deep.We don&rsquo;t need to care wether they are friends or not because it&rsquo;s personal.Give them personal spaces like normal person have.</li>
<li>Unfortunately for y’all GFriend and BTS have always been friends and now are officially part of the Big Hit family</li>
<li>So say what you will they’ll be friends regardless of what your delusional selves want or say</li>
<li>All my ARMYBUDDY mutuals are loving this family</li>
<li>Ustedes como fans están para apoyar no para limitar sus amistades y lo que puedan decir de ellas.</li>
<li>Entiendanlo SOMOS FANS, NO SUS DUEÑAS.</li>
<li>J-hope dijo llevemos comida para Gfriend  realmente  veo q se llevan realmente  bien</li>
<li>Can we please drown the immature comments by talking about the fact that they are gonna drop a self produced music video for a song about how life goes on to comfort us?? The boys are amazing. Stan BigHit Family</li>
<li>Bts and Gfriend friends😀</li>
<li>Nice</li>
<li>stop being like your BIAS IS MINE!! They have normal life to so stop being a drama, they deserve close with anyone even is gfriend or another kpop idol, and remember GFRIEND, TXT,  NUEST, SEVENTEEN, in same management BIGHIT oke, ARMY PLISSS STOP LIKE THAT and WE MUST TO ALWAYS SUPPORT THEM NO MATTER HAPPEN 💜</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s sad how armys are taking too much of BTS' freedom&hellip; Sadly sometimes they thought they own BTS. Wake up people BTS have their own lives.</li>
<li>Is it just just me who noticed the subs. ?</li>
<li></li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Before: &lsquo;Gfriend members can take some of them&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After: &ldquo;Please take some for the protocol  team&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALL OF THEM ARE JUST FRIENDS WHATS WRONG WITH YOU ALL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Normalize bts saying a girl&rsquo;s name (idol, friends,etc.)and being friends with them I AM AN ARMY I KNOW THE FEELING but still they have their own lives we can&rsquo;t control them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BIGHIT: Do you want to see the boys eating while discussing about their new MV</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>ARMYS: YESS PLEASEEE💜💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Srsly to immatured fans out there&hellip; LET YOUR IDOL INTERACT WITH THEIR FRIENDS OR OTHER KPOP GIRL GROUP FREELY THEY ARE NOT OURS TO KEEP THEY ARE JUST OUR IDOL&hellip; Im an armybuddy but idc if they want to mention any of the opposite gender group.. like grow up guys.. this is why many idols do not give any reaction at the award show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jin and jungkook just came there for eating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg but BTS do not realize that we want to see when they work and for them doing the simple things BECAUSE WE DO NOT SEE IT NORMALLY. They do it every day so it might be boring for THEM but not for us. 😉😉😉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;STOP BEING SO SENSITIVE&rdquo; you&rsquo;re all making such a commotion, we dont own them, let them do what they want&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;re just MENTIONED the name. Not dating or something. What&rsquo;s the problem? Even the subtitle was changed. I –</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Them chewing their food is so “SATISFYING”. Is that weird???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way tae s lips puff up when he chews his food..y it’s so cute as if I’m watching a cute animated character..it happens in all the videos where he was shown having food&hellip;how can anybody be so cute tae baby</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ya, no feeling, no shipping, just under same label, feel like family, friendship, just thats all guys&hellip; Please stop making them uncomfortable&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why all of the haters of bts watching this if they hate bts also they are disliking the vid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They literally changed the subtitles because of some childish fans shipping them. I mean,  they are the part of Bighit so what&rsquo;s wrong if they mentioned Gfriend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two hours later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jin: &mdash;&ndash; What?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How hardworking and loving to their fans is BTS?

<li>
<p>Bighit: yes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s just sad that some ARMY&rsquo;s are complaining about Jhope said &ldquo;YEOJACHINGU&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN BTS AND BIGHIT LABELS ARTIST. PLEASE GUYS DON&rsquo;T BE CHILDISH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tae&rsquo;s way of talking is so cute:(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realised while watching this video that I could not give a straight answer if I&rsquo;ll be asked who is my ultimate bias is. I&rsquo;m an OT7 and I find it really hard to say that there is one that I love the most. I always get bias-wrecked by everybody. Their beauty, talent, and personality are already overwhelming for me to choose only one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bro what happened to the fandom, how has this fandom become so toxic again? damn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lmao the subs changed real quick, from gfriend members to the staff to the protocol team 🤦🏻‍♀️ (im so sorry, i do not mean to offend anyone but the fact that they changed the subs 3x says something alrdy lmao why are fans so salty? they&rsquo;re labelmates— what&rsquo;s wrong if gfriend was mentioned? why do ppl have to insist that it wasn&rsquo;t gfriend? i just dont understand how y&rsquo;alls mind works but oh well, its gf so yea. CORNDOGS FOR THE WIN)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you became an ARMY, BTS and Gfriend is already friend with each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>suga just sitting there eating and barely contributing is like me in group projects at school</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I so sorry but not matter how many times i repeat that part i keep hearing gfriend&rsquo;s korean name yojachingu, i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad thing tho, no one is shipping them we just think it&rsquo;s a cute interaction of them ♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gfriend they are so beautiful 💜💜💜💜💜💜💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope Jungkook won’t do all the filming.  I want to see him in the videos too.  I watched his GCF videos and he’s hardly in them.  🙏🙏🙏. Like I can’t even see Jungkook??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our fandom may be not that big &hellip;but you all really cannot throw any hates to my girls !!! But from what i heard yes hobi really mentioned their protocol staff- yeojachingudeuldo(women staff) &hellip;if hobi mentioned gfriend it will go like this (yeojachingu memboedeul) ..this thing made us worried what if bts really mentioned gfriend in the future ..im really afraid what the childish fans will act like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so tired to TOXIC fans and IMMATURE fans😩 come on guys!! Thay are FAMILY remember BTS, TXT, ENHYPEN, SEVENTEEN, NUEST, GFRIEND they are FAMILY so y&rsquo;all should stop MANAGE them they are HUMANS too!! They can MENTIONED and INTERACT to EACH OTHER so stop being POSSESSIVE to your FAVES.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You really went from &ldquo;gfriend&rdquo; to &ldquo;protocol team&rdquo;. The person who changed the subtitle is the biggest loser lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what&rsquo;s wrong if they mentioned gfriend they can be friends people&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;stop being so toxic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO THEY CHANGED GFRIEND TO PROTOCOL TEAM&hellip;WTF WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ALL?? WHATS THE PROBLEM?? NORMALIZED BOYGROUP AND GIRLGROUP INTERCATION :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess they changed the subs probably bc of the comments being passive aggressive lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Others: our world is Earth 🌎

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>ARMY repeat with me: &ldquo;BTS is not my boyfriend they just my idol&rdquo;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Ok, thank you, bye!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jungook&rsquo;s face when Jimin ate the cheese he was vying for from Yoongi&hellip;😆😆😆</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking news Jhope has friends outside of bts LMFAOO some of you are so dramatic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I felt like all of the comments section were fight over each other. Dude, as we all know BTS and GFRIEND were friends. And it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether BTS mentioned GFRIEND or not. We know that they were friends so why did we fight with each other like a dumber?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jin is totally like focused on food 😂😂😂💜💜</p>
</li>

<p>When yoongi offer the corndog that he bitten to hoseok first but he didn&rsquo;t accept it then jungkook asking for it but jimin take it and eat it first instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HEY! MY SOPE AND YOONMIN HEART Y&rsquo;ALL IS BEATING!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suga: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like cheese&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: &quot; me tooo&hellip;..&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:16 when siga took a bite of the corn dog then jimin and lastly kookie. This reminds me when they all shared the water bottle at the awards show</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly I think they are gonna come out with a completely different concept from what they are talking about and all of this is just an act to confuse us. The only thing that is gonna stay same is that they are self producing this album.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From Gfriend to staffs to protocol team</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Gfriend be like:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I personally think that mentioning gfriend name would not be anything great  to be made of &hellip;.. they are in the same company and mention of their name doesn&rsquo;t have to matter for some army&rsquo;s (I&rsquo;m not telling all but some of them who think weirdly)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>some immature people be hating on gfriend just because of a corndog. lmao get a life. dont be sad that your oppars dont give you food. normalize bts mentioning gfriend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am Indian but I am learning Korean only because of BTS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love you all 7 Members of BTS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9:30 ystrday when i watched this vdo the subtitles were gfriend members now it is protocol members&hellip;ahh armys just grow up..imagine being in the same class but not being able to talk to girls being afraid of shipping&hellip;they are humans too😤🤯i guess if there was not shipping we could have get a chance to see them interacting with other girl grps as besties or frnds😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love jungkook love baby</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it ironic that other hate it when they mentioned gfriend while army and buddy just keep it cool because they consider them as &lsquo;SIBLINGS&rsquo;?</p>
</li>

<p>jhope:no</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Army&rsquo;s stop being inmature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And please remember that kpop are family they all live like a beautiful family. And TBH they can mention anyone they want and that&rsquo;s none of your business you are just a fan and always appreciate what they all are doing for us because they always do best for army&rsquo;s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They eating a lot : perfect body</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me:breath &hellip;gains 2kg</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GET OUT CHILDISH FANS!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>y’all are a bunch of weirdos that need to grow up and realize they interact w women??? they aren’t gonna date any of you anyways 😭 BIG HIT stop giving into weirdo obsessed ARMYS and leave the subtitles how they were</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like if bighit didn’t stop producing girl groups just bc of one incident in the past. Them talking to other groups wouldn’t be a problem</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By their outfit, I assume this video was shot on their dynamite release day&hellip; Remember their vlive???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>okay, thankyou bighit for protecting our girls. its okay if the subtitle was change. maybe its better for both groups. we are fans just SUPPORT THEM guys. STOP TO BEING MANAGE THEM. let them freely reactions each other because theyre on the same label. YES. SAME LABEL. so do what you should do. loveyou guys! i purple you💜💜💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Army doesn&rsquo;t own BTS&hellip; we&rsquo;re here to support them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop being inmature, please.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GFRIEND = PROTOCOL TEAM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope you all realize that probably this is how the BIG album concepts they give us&hellip; how the duality of HYYH was proposed, the ideas for the wings era, how they divided the LY trilogy and came up with MotS&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video is a clue into their creative insight, enjoy it!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sinb and Eunha would be happy if bts sunbaenim really give them some corndogs. Oh no, sorry, I mean sinb and Eunha from protocol team not GFRIEND. 👀👀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been dying to get a BTSxGifriend interaction for years after their collab a few years ago. Now that they are under the same Label, we finally got to have this small interaction but immature and toxic kpop fans are making a big drama out of it. How can you support the boys when just with a small interactions with girl groups, you&rsquo;re out here being hysterical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love how they’re talking about how they can add some sentimental parts to this video while filming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>some of y’all really made this whole vid on why Hobi mentioned gfriend when REALLY  WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THEIR HARD WORK THEY PUT IN MAKING ALBUMS AND THAT THE WHOLE ALBUM WILL BE SELF-PRODUCED!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did anyone notice Jimin dropping his food..Oh Maannn his actions were priceless&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>omgg seokjin is allergic to potatoes!!! he&rsquo;s allergic to potatoes and garlic, two korean staple foods!!! noooo :( im goignt o go fight garlic and potatoes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are u guys srsly changing &lsquo;Gfriend&rsquo; word to &lsquo;protocol team&rsquo; LMAO Doesnt change the fact hobi said yeojachingu..its obvious they are friendssss whats wrong with you people 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ we love bighit fam💙💜 9:31</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s kinda crazy how some of you guys still care about their privacy life. it&rsquo;s their life and stop acting like they&rsquo;re your boyfriends&hellip; we get it&hellip;. if you&rsquo;re the real one fan here then, you have to support them and their hard work with music, helping us with the problems we got. please, they are humans too, just like us. please! thanks for ur understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally NO one is hating on gfriend who tf are all these people whining here on gfriend getting hate?!! You sure are not armys AT ALL!!  Where is the hate can somebody show me ANYwhere???</p>

<p>Because of the toxic fans being jealous They had to take off the captions saying Gfriend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>El Jin calladito come y come, es hermoso 🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmao namjoon blocking the camera and bts scolding him got me cackling ,🤣🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have an ARMY cousin and she smiled when she read the subs so I ask what video and I went here. 3rd Gen KPop interactions are rare and you know the reason why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guy if BTS mention about GF I’m very happy but the fact that there’s wrong translation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They aren’t letting V to finish his sentence 😅

<li>
<p>At 9:31 I’m pretty sure the “protocol team”  they are talking about is Gfriend idk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comen hermoso todos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new mv will be a bop😁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just had a feeling &ldquo;is this live is all scripted&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its not soo them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way they share food towards the end while still discussing serious stuff shows the quintessential BTS &lt;3  It is more intimate and loving than 90%(?) of married couples ^-^</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for the outcome of the MV and the song that they are discussing about. I think we will need A LOT of tissues while watching the MV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let&rsquo;s say, hobi mentioned 여자친구, and I think yes, he said so. but he said 여자-친구-들-도 in the sentence, that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s referring to their women staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if he&rsquo;d mentioned gfriend, the way he call them might be different</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I get it now, why it is pre-recorded, because they are talking about the upcoming album, they could really give out big spoilers 😆😆. The way Namjoon forgot this is being shooted and blocked the camera 🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in conclusion we can say that bangtan is a group with seven guys who loves art. Really apassionate with their work and trying to get involved to it. Love you guys, i&rsquo;m so proud of u. I only stan professional gentlemen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything is fine do whatever you want as we know you guys are so Talented and we  definetely gonna have a nice video but a small request PLEASE DON&rsquo;T CRY &hellip;&hellip;as I would not be able to bear THAT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m very curious over what they&rsquo;re gonna do&hellip;..</p>

<p>I used to be an anti of BTS and now I’m a newbie Army but I know clearly that BTS really hate someone who said Army are mad, crazy blah blah. And wow fans of another group did that a lot in the comments just because the wrong translation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am always waiting for Another GCF..</p>

<li>
<p>why did the subs change when we can clearly hear gfriends name lmfaoo they were friends in their trainee days and theyre label mates. i dont see what the big deal is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quiero probar el Hotdog coreano 😋💜💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lowkey sad that after I watched the video with subs and wanted to look through the comments to see peoples thoughts on the boys ideas for the MV&hellip; the comments are just filled with people being dramatic and mentioning other things -.- can we focus on the album??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:06 Jimin deixando a comida cair KKKK</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love that they’re looking out for ARMY and how we would feel about their music video. Felt like we were sitting at the table with them. 🤗💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why can&rsquo;t BTS mention GFRIEND? They met each other and have been friends for many years before you did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love them so much you can see how genuine they are and how much they love us. They put so much thought into their videos and music! 🥺✌🏼 i can’t for their comeback soon although I still feel as if MOTS:7 didn’t get the spotlight it deserved because of COVID-19:(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This must be confirm already because big hit will not post this if they didn&rsquo;t. This video taken a month ago. Who&rsquo;s ready???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can see that they are fixing the wrong subtitles just how they did with the Gfriend one. At 5:02 it said Gym ball , now it got corrected to gimbal

<p>From almost all the video’s comment I saw where there were no english (or other languages) captions, I do underatand how foreigners feel like not knowing what BTS is saying, but I hate when they spam the comment section saying that they need english caption or people thinking that english captions are always a mandatory expectation they look forward to see. Let’s understand them too :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way they’re so used to being with each other that they eat after each other without even flinching. That corn dog went through 3 people 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Hobi: we can zoom in and zoom out like junggkook does😅</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y&rsquo;all really made this whole video about a mistranslation when it should have been about their hardwork &amp; about their new album</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You guys are mad just because they mentioned gfriend n then how will u guys react when they actually date. Y can&rsquo;t they be friends with girls one day they r ganna have their own family n no one can change this fact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really love this People💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are all so natural</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And theyre Friendship it&rsquo;s so Real 💕&hellip;.</p>

<p>I love you guyyysss ❤️</p>

<p>Me: 😂😂😂😂. Aww my poor boy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really neded to say that. How can Taehyung-ssi looks so cute while eating? I mean he´s the cutest person I know. Oh man I´m crying!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guys, could you stop criticizing BTS? Can&rsquo;t you see the effort they make to bring joy to the public and how much they struggled to get here?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>They are sharing their ideas and thinking about it for everyone, because they want to have a relationship or a bond with the public. I support their idea to broadcast their shows online and share their daily lives live, or, on recording. Take a moment and think before you criticize someone.

<p>Do you know the Bourne Supremacy movie? Jason Bourne made many people worry and fear</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Maybe now I can say, GFriend Beauty Supremacy that make many people worry and fear if GFriend communicating and interacting with male idols because of the girls are too beautiful? 🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this is possible, so please have a tour in India</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even TXT calls the other groups family. It&rsquo;s high time such a small thing should get registered in everyone&rsquo;s head</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it on JK&rsquo;S birthday? Because that&rsquo;s when they got to know that dynamite is #1 on billboards. And wanted to give one more video to the army.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t care if they mentioned gfriend or not but the fact that there are negative reaction about this is so disappointing.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>maybe try watching svt, astro, btob or even txt mentioning gfriend. see how we party and enjoy things. let the boys breathe please, it&rsquo;s just corn dogs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>jimin is the best BTS memeber for me &hellip; his voice is just too beautiful and he himself is also very BEAUTIFUL&hellip;!!!</p>

<li>
<p>wow! watching their process of brainstorming a music video idea was fascinating, I love how much thought and meaning they put behind everything they do! 💜and i love that they took into consideration army when thinking about making the video realistic since everyone is stuck at home!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guys if u don&rsquo;t understand them turn on captions, english</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i could watch them eat for hours and hours and wouldn&rsquo;t be bored at all.

</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t know what they are saying but let’s just laugh 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally they never mentioned gfriend and even if they did this was such a sincere video and I love them so much more for how much they care 💜 y’all need to stop being dumb jeezus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how J hope is the only one that&rsquo;s actually loyal to Samsung lolzzz</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk something nice about Bangtan instead of trying to make all the comments about negativity &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ending was funny.. Namjoon kept blocking the camera &amp; eating so peacefully but then WWH said you are blocking the camera :v</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>I dont like how the staff changed the subs. Bighit is enabling the delusional fans. They shouldve ignored it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BTS Fighting💪</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U all are serious if subs are wrong it&rsquo;s our duty to tell them but some of u are oversmart here and thinks that we know korean better then korean native speakers and who seen that armies are hating gfriend stop thinking and making assumptions on your own</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love watching them eat I love watching them sleep I love watching them do everything 💜💜💜💜😆😆😆</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They changed it to protect them. I never even heard &ldquo;protocol team&rdquo; at all.🥴</p>

<p>Yay, subs! I can’t wait for their project to come out. They’re really collaborative. If only my meetings would be like this. Oh and RM at the end lol. “You’re blocking the camera, Kim Namjoon”. We appreciate seeing your back, we need to see 2Seok.</p>
</li>

<p>I feel like jk does more in the art portion of their music instead of the ideas with the rest of them. It&rsquo;s just my observation, but I kinda see that bcs his musical artistry is there in their songs and singing, and I kinda relate to him in the sense of being more artistic than coming up with ideas more often. Just an observation..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: You can just mix the two ideas&hellip; Film outside and Inside and put them together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suga: 5:45 you can just mix together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: That’s what I was saying all along, why are you stealing my ideas? Why can’t you hear me?!? 😂🥺🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the last minutes of that video 😂. Actually they don&rsquo;t know that they are filming except jin. He&rsquo;s laughing.😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m just staring at yoongi&rsquo;s phone then hobi&rsquo;s in the beginning. The difference—</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>This album is going to be so special; one legendary masterpiece with a lot emotional depth in the lyrics and MV/s.💜💜💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how they eat together, discuss together and decide together. they&rsquo;re the happy family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Los chicos estan trabajando duro, y si de algo me he dado cuenta es que quieren que quede claro que ellos estan trabajando interminablemente y con todo su corazón  y que no estan de ociosos como en algunas entrevistas han querido hacer creer; sin embargo ARMY sabemos que ellos se esfuerzan, que el álbum que están creando tiene toda su sangre, sudor y lágrimas, sus alegrías, e historia, el reconfort parq ARMY, y los amamos y agradecemos por eso; psdta: me dio hambre&hellip;😄💜💜💜💜💜💜💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really love seeing them like this. We somehow get a glimpse of how much hard work is put into their craft. We will always be supporting and loving you, BTS.</p>

<p>Is it sad that I have been sitting here working late and have alternated between this and the night time dynamite versions as background music and sound. Something about just listening to them talk is so soothing sometimes to me. I love these men! They are so talented, creative, uplifting, caring, thoughtful and inclusive! They really set a great example for all of us to follow!</p>
