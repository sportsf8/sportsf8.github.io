<p>We have become aware that in our rush to share this video we overlooked a couple of typos in the captions. Here are the correct spellings: Pittsburgh (at 2:31) and Robert Mapplethorpe (at 6:02).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for watching!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you üôåüèª‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a student in New York during mid to late 70s and saw Andy at parties. He was the nicest person I met in NYC. Always asked how I my studies were going. Great guy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As an art lover I like to visit museums, galleries and art studios. However, this is not possible now because of the corona crisis. Many thanks for showing me my daily portion of art (history) videos. It is always a pleasure to watch a video on this youtube channel. Very informative and entertaining in the days when we are more staying into our homes and cannot visit a museum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow thank you Tate for bringing some art into our lives when we&rsquo;re unable to experience it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Tate Modern for giving us this little look at what we are missing out on - Stay safe! - we are looking forward to come over to London to see you all soon again!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, I so much look forward to Tate Modern opening again. What a show!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idea of identity, music, silver clouds, gunshots, portraits, recording life, death and religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the walk through, Tate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counting down the days until we can return &hellip; in the meantime, this is a glorious taster of the exhibition. Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brilliant. I saw it before the closure, loved it. To see those iconic paintings in the flesh, and the video installation with a young Velvet Underground - how young is Lou Reed there, 19, 20?&hellip;. Can&rsquo;t wait to come back - so missing you, Tate. Thanks for this - fantastic!..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warhol&rsquo;s work changed dramatically, after meeting Joseph Beuys, additionally, A to B and back again is an interesting airport novelette.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Man The Artist was a Genius .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Art and music are the two things that makes me think that we may one day embrace our differences. In what other arena might these two very different gentlemen share a chat?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A wonderful opportunity for those of us not living in the UK to enjoy a taste of the Tate. Thank you so much - excellent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intriguing. Thank you.  I sincerely hope I am able to see the exhibition when the Tate reopens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best YouTube algorithm can recommend me</p>
</li>

<p>Fun Fact: The 1982 commercial of Burger King depicting Andy Warhol eating a Whopper is the first ever Mukbang challenge in history.

<p>What influences Art is confusing to me.What distinguishes a masterpiece from a portrait is determined by someone who knows  what they&rsquo;re  looking  at and why it represents  something  special. Not me.I more  likely  to look like a fool cuz i think  all paintings offer something special just cuz somebody took the time  to paint  it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We were coming up to London on the 27th March, so disappointed!  We will get there though.  Thank you for this snippet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fantastic treat, thank you for cheering us up. T think all these paintings are so close but unattainable for now. Can&rsquo;t wait to get to the Tate Modern after it re-opens. Stay safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks Tate for putting this out!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like a really great and interesting exhibition!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thankyou for the tour, excellent ! A future wish would be&hellip;. could it be a lot longer and more in depth, it was really good !. But thankyou for the insight, really appreciate it ! I will be walking through the turbine hall again very soon I hope !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for this, I had tickets for this exhibition but due to Covid 19 the gallery closed.  I am hoping that it is still on when the restrictions are lifted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait, you mean to say that Warhol was gay!?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you so much for this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This exhibit was just here in Chicago at the Art Institute. Breathtaking. I absolutely loved it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best summary of Warhol and his change through life and only in 7 min. Amazing job!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you ! what a great taster for the exhibition&hellip;I hope it will be extended and after the covidian interlude we can come and see the paintings themselves&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there currently a virtual tour of this exhibition?   There should be!!  Also,  I truly appreciate how this video was done.  There is a wonderful blanket of calm and silence, even between the gallerists. Very much like entering a museum and being the first handful to enter,  roam and engulf an exhibition in almost solitude. No crowds, no flash and pomp&mdash;which, the lack thereof,  is also what makes the gentleman in the clip more pleasing to watch.  It&rsquo;s a delight to see and hear two people just provide information, insight in a focused manner. Fantastic exhibition&hellip;and you were right, there are pieces here I&rsquo;ve never seen exhibited. They should be!!  Thank you for posting. Absolutely marvelous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks Tate really looking forward to seeing this exhibition by the looks of the taster well worth waiting for.</p>
</li>

<p>I LOVE Andy Warhol&rsquo;s work and aesthetic to the point of taking up screen printing myself, but my deeper scrutiny of and reflection on his body of work has led me to believe that his signature works, such as the soup cans, Brillo boxes, Marilyns, Liz Taylors and the parade of other celebrity portraits, won&rsquo;t have the kind of staying power that other modern revolutionary artists' will. The works of Cezanne, Matisse, Van Gogh, Picasso, etc, all emerged from their respective specific eras, of course, but almost uniformly (Guernica aside) their works don&rsquo;t overtly reference the cultural context of their times, or rely on &ldquo;getting&rdquo; an ironic joke about either elevating the mundane (soup cans, etc) to &ldquo;icons&rdquo; or reducing the already iconic (Marilyn, Liz, Elvis, Mao, etc) to the mundane. Time marches on inexorably, and it won&rsquo;t be long before no one but art or culture historians remember who Marilyn or Liz were, and the works will have to stand completely on their own, stripped of irony or in-crowd &ldquo;hipness,&rdquo; like the long-dead but now completely anonymous sitters of earlier portraitists. Will just one more Mao variation, its underlying screen print identical underneath the surface embellishments of the one just before and just after it in the run (remind me - just who was this &ldquo;Mao&rdquo; fellow anyway?) still be considered a &ldquo;major&rdquo; or &ldquo;important&rdquo; work of art? I&rsquo;m beginning to doubt it. If one pays millions for a Liz or Elvis, there is an inherent expectation that the owner and viewers of the piece will know exactly who the subjects are, and why they inspired the piece. If a now-unknown silent film starlet was given the same treatment - same size, same composition, same colors - would the piece command millions? I think we all know the answer. Is Warhol&rsquo;s work &ldquo;important?&rdquo; Undoubtably, and I believe it will remain highly regarded, if perhaps not venerated as it is now. Was Duchamp&rsquo;s? Of course - but when was the last time anyone went to an elegant home and found a urinal displayed prominently on a table in the living room?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish Andy Warhol controlled MY life! Sigh&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Warhol has been named as Ruthinian and Ukrainian also? First time i&rsquo;ve heard Slovak? But then again muscovy/russian trolls  influence is always present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6:00 it&rsquo;s spelled MAPPLETHORPE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;his LGBTQI identity&rdquo;&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure someone can have an identity that comprises all of those things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANKS SO MUCH FOR THAT!

<p>I saw a very similar exhibit at the Whitney a few years ago. Amazing collection, amazing artist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like Warhol but I don‚Äôt see the point of doing the same exhibition again in 2020. I see nothing new or any new approach to his work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man I really wanted to go and see this!!!! üòï</p>

<p>Went to a rare Warhol exhibition - held at Nottingham castle in 2002. Self portrait from 1986 was the exhibition poster. A copy of which i have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was a genius, but he also used people, sucked the soul out of them and didn&rsquo;t look back when they weren&rsquo;t interesting to him anymore.</p>

<li>
<p>Is there any chance of a virtual reality tour or a video tour which shows us what the exhibition is like in the space? It seems a shame to let it sit empty without an audience to visit and experience it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to appropriate historically-bound artefacts to bolster flimsy contemporary phenomena. Engage with thought and behaviour from the immediate context of these works  - as they happened - and then the dialogue between that and contemporary lived lives - not as a direct correlate. The latter&rsquo;s very lazy&hellip;. and potentially dangerous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s magic!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With all respect to Tate Modern and Andy Warhol‚Äôs body of work; I feel that AWarhol‚Äôs Work have been over exposed and very much talked about for many years now.   Having so many valuable artists, artists less exposed or still to be investigated with an amazing body of work, I feel that having another AWarhol show is repetitive, it shows what we already know.  It does not surprise us.  It also feels suspicious that they decide that it‚Äôs time to talk about his work again.   So many artists to talk about, but somehow it‚Äôs time to talk about Warhol again and again.   I hope everyone is fine in their home.  All the best.

<p>I had not really thought Warhol‚Äôs art was beautiful before, but the colour here is so life affirming. It has actually made me cry. Thank you for this breath of art air Tate.</p>

<p>Celebrity worship continues to be a Warhol epidemic for so many american people to this day. It&rsquo;s why I fully expect Mr. Peach will be re-elected for another 4 years. Apart from his blotted ink techniques and his dedication into the exploration into the question - what is art ? &hellip; there&rsquo;s very little respect or inspiration that I can muster for this guy because he was so &hellip; well &hellip;. how can I say &hellip;. EVIL  ! ! ! ! !</p>

<p>Overrated</p>

<p>Dude was a druggy ego driven loser. His art is boring as fuck. You wouldn&rsquo;t give two shits about his art if it were done by someone else.. a blown up silver pillow aint art..</p>
