</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>He is disrespecting curry, my guy is trash, flight was going to beat him anyway</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:28 heres the ankle breaker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fakeeee look at this dude he is wearing Jordan 1s with a curry jersey</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ball is life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each like is a three flight hits during june.       Edit: get flight to reply u wont</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first half must’ve been at like 11:56 p.m on may 31 bc once that shirt came off it officially became June</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else here on the last day of June to re live the greatest month of 2020</p>
</li>
<li>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Flight took off his shirt he showed a glimpse of his final form</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s time for that rematch on June 30 flight vs cash nasty (like for him to see this!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idk why but for some reason i actually expected flight to magically becoming good once it became June 🤦‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>U literally broke his ankle and air balled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight has redeemed himself by ending theflightmikes career and his ankles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FTC!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kid : can we watch Stephen curry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mom : we have Stephen curry at home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephen curry :</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all have to understand that this was probably filmed before June, thus the missed shots. The real footage in June is coming&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact is Flight needs to gain weight his a small fry with a good height so that makes his strength weak or some shit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro bro found someone as terrible as he is and wanna try to expose em</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine if Stephen curry watches flight in June, he gonna be sayin look at flight man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pov: you’re watching your 2 60 ovr friends play each other in my court</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its June and flight #1 on trending that has to say something right there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When they played disingenuous flight got spot up shooter takeover</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight  playing some worst than him, that man don’t play ball 🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ayyyye practice makes perfect. You just gotta be more loose when you play. Your playing to stiff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hit flight’s mom from the back it just wasn’t on camera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man flight really trending over a whole revolution 😂😂😂

<p>U know someone’s bad when they have to look at the ground the entire time to keep a dribble😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:30 is what you’re here for&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1v1 with JJones from kickgenius, they have a reaction and jjones agreed if flight reaches out to him about a 1v1.Like if you wanna see that 😈😈</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cant break someone when you lose the bal yourself</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He already signed a pro contract it’s just that the cameras weren’t on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everybody: clowning flight because of all the shots he’s missed                                 Me: proud af that he actually has a jumpshot and can drive now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo when I saw it I was like yo that was staged then you pulled the true basketball player move and said I didn’t finish I am proud of you have come a long way FTC flight crew stand up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this june be like</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>curry: look at flight man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:21 idc if he&rsquo;s never played basket ball that&rsquo;s a tough shot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These dudes had so many bricked I could build me a house w all them bricks lol 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:15 that mood swing gets me everytime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh I just realized something this could be an act cause remember Mikey he didn’t act like this but when flight knows that flight mike is some ass he took it but flight has gotten better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When I saw the Golden State Jersey I thought the guy would be good&hellip; 🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is playing with dwarfs with zero sport talent part of you mental challenge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is how many replays there gonna be in june</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>This is one of the worst 1 v 1&rsquo;s I have ever seen.  I thought Mike would at least come close on some of these shots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine if Stephen curry watches flight in June, he gonna be sayin look at flight man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost brain cells watching this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason why flight missed so many shots was because this was filmed may 31st</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally he’s playing against someone who is actually below his skill or at his skill. Smart plays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanna see if he can go against Mikey now since he “ transformed” 🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can’t be going to the nba lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your playing your friend who just bought 2k with your 99 ovr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only person I know airballs after a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ankle breaker🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:04 that’s what time I could watch till</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guy u faced wasn’t even good this is a set up game</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flight surrounded by yes men smh they not helping him better him self</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When flight takes off his shirt or/Steph curry jersey it’s over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight got absolutely no spin on his shot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>POV: You are waiting for flight to upload the brawadis 1v1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo everyone like this who thinks that we need that CASHNASTY VS FLIGHT REMATCH since it’s June 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight this video made me in a positive mood to stay motivated I just sat back and watched you be so determined to become great in June and boom look at this taking nothing but W’s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:36 OMG !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is that guy 🤦‍

<li>
<p>I’ve seen in my life man.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Just didn&rsquo;t have the cameras on&rdquo; 😭💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He really wasn&rsquo;t lying about June he #1 on trending page</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Why is Mike the best player I’ve ever seen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6:02 the way he dribbles this whole time is a carry straight up lol</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>4:55, what am I watching?? My 8 year old brother vs my 9 year old cousin would be more intense. And the shooting percentage would be much higher than them</p>
</li>
<li>
