<li>
<p>imagine ur dad being adam sandler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler is the exact definition of a dad. He’s sweet, caring, and the dad jokes are unreal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler has been an actor since before I can remember and he still gets awkward during interviews. Cute 😊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler is VERY humble. He doesn’t really wear expensive suits for something really special, like Ellen’s show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who remembers bedtime stories?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does not make it public, but Sandler regularly visits very sick children staying in hospitals. He does a lot of amazing things for people - fame and fortune did not corrupt him in the slightest. Truly an amazing human being.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you&rsquo;re filthy rich you can wear mustard pants, a purple un-ironed shirt, but be sorry about the beard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Not a soul:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like a grown up Dora with the pink shirt and orange pants 😂😂 still rocks it though</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam seems so down to earth and a cool guy if you were to meet him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that we are gonna lose Adam Sandler, Kevin Hart, the rock, some day scares me 😖</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy feels like my uncle. I pretty much grew up with him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😂😂😂. He seems to struggle with anxiety forreal. I noticed it first a couple years ago when he was doing another interview. He’s just out here in life being a genuine kind person so I wish him the best!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s so uncomfortable in interviews, but so genuine at the same time. He seems like a great guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam is such a nice person irl, my grandparents were in an elevator a few years ago at the Eaton centre in Canada and Adam and his wife walked in with them, my grandparents knew who they were but didn’t say anything as they didn’t want to make them seem uncomfortable, as Adam and his wife were leaving the elevator, Adam said to them “Thanks so much, we really appreciate it” and gave them both a hug before completely exiting the elevator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who thinks Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler should be in a movie together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All I want to know is  when is another grownups coming up  🤔

</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being her friends and having Adam Sandler driving y’all around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler ,will Ferrell and Jim Carrey should be in a movie together 👌</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Adam Sandler because he is nit like other famous people he wears what ever he wants and don’t have to dress up fancy like at the KCA he wore a sweater with basketball shorts!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok, I’m 3 seconds in. Let’s see how rude she is to him 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just realised the Ellen show is just about two or more people having a conversation and the “third wheeler “ is watching it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who remembers the OG movies, Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison where we act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn’t know he had a daughter🤦🏽‍♀️. That’s how you know I live under a rock . WHERE HAVE I BEEN😭😭😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True story I grew up in the Atlantic City area and one of my first jobs was a black jack dealer and one day A man sat at my table sunglasses and a hat very awkward and if we thought for any reason something wasn&rsquo;t right we had to flag a pit boss&hellip; Well he saw me start to get uneasy and lowered his sunglasses it was Adam Sandler! I almost blew it lol but he basically begged me to deal him a few normal games of black jack without anyone clocking him and I did so he took a walk to the employee lounge with me and introduced himself as the new matinence man and my new boyfriend! 🤣 Really laid back guy just wanted to gamble a bit without being noticed!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam is the kind of guy who go to formal event in basketball shorts haha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being Adams Sandler’s daughter :’)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awwww I love him&hellip;.. he’s one of my favorite comedian actors ever!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m waiting for the day that Adam Sandler, Dwayne Johnson and will feral are all in a movie together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ellen is just rude. The more interviews of hers I watch, I like her less. Adam Sandler would be a fun dad!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s got the color vibes, of Dora.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You lock eyes with daddy sunny boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The funny thing about Adam Sandler is he is the same in real life as in his movies like character- and actingwise</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who thinks adam Sandler and jonah hill should do a movie together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ellen you was rude to my dawg Adam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“The kisses aren’t good, it hurts her”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol

<li>
<p>I literally love Adam Sandler, he’s hilarious! He’s also a great person and father, I’m glad he’s apart of the movies and shows!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG I SWEAR I WENT TO PRE SCHOOL WITH HIS DAUGHTER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam: it hurts her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ellen: let me feel how rough it is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: i thought she was gonna kiss him lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw Adam at chick filet down the street from where I live in Florida 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy is so humble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close your eyes while playing the video and you’ll hear Drac talking about Mavis and Johnny</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phone wallet keys lol I just get that stuck in my head when i see him lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always love Jennifer Anniston with Adam.. they have great team up 😍😍😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Adam sandler God bless him and his family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There&rsquo;s not a single Adam Sandler movie that I don&rsquo;t like. I ❤ them all!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Adam he puts all of his friends in his movies that pure loyalty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember when I worked at the galleria a mall in Houston, Tx. I was walking in and my key manager hold my hand and takes me outside because Adam Sandler and his family were in our store and had just left and we wanted to take pictures but we saw him walking with his family unbothered so we decided to not ask him and let him have some good time. He’s a great guy from what I heard when he was in the store (: sad I wasn’t able to say hi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear he is so humble</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always loved him. Specially after 50 first dates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love him . Such a down to earth guy. Love to hang with him he&rsquo;s so funny..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I expected him to be more Adam Sandler like 🤨 lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy made my childhood 100x better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he&rsquo;s got a very comforting voice

<li>
<p>or I just miss my dad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Adam he’s such Ana amazing actor and to be honest he seems just as awkward in real life as he is in his movies. Every interview I watch him do he always seems nervous and awkward even if he knows the person. It’s cute and funny.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My husband is like him. There’s nothing like a man that makes you laugh, sweet, humble and charming. ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I skipped accidentally to when they were talking about getting “slimed” after he talked abt his daughters and boys, I was a bit confused 😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just imagine being related to a celebrity, the life!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I do remember being young and happy.&rdquo; - That&rsquo;s deep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Childhood- Teenagehood  favourite actor ♥️♥️ best memories ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to see Clueless the Musical the day after Xmas. When I get to my seat I see him, his wife, and two daughters are a few rows in front of me!!! At intermission, me and the people I saw the show with were looking around for him. Stupidly, I walked forwards while looking to the side and step on his SHOE!!! And HE said sorry. I meekly when “ahhahh” like that scared uncomfortable noise you make when you’re embarrassed. He said “ok gimme a minute” as his family STANDS IN FRONT OF US in line for snacks. I’m like dying if embarrassment repeatedly whispering “THATS ADAM FRICKIN SANDLER” to the ppl I’m with. His daughters (who look just like him) seemed like really cool kids. The younger one kept dancing around in the line almost like she was practicing ballet. After I buy some m and ms I asked him for a pic. He said yeah and now I have that heck of a picture story. Gonna remember that as the most scary 5 minutes ever😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think this is the most well dressed I&rsquo;ve ever seen Adam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;It was fun except the blind&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Adam Sandler. I miss seeing him in movies like when I was a kid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to one of Adam’s live shows last summer. He’s such an awesome and funny guy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry about everything, my beard&rdquo; 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever I see Adam Sandler I think about he guinea pig from Bedtime Stories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought when she said &ldquo;here let me feel&rdquo; and leaned in to feel his moustache she was leaning in to kiss him LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Adam Sandler and Ellen did a movie together life would be wonderful 😭😭♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I do remember being young and happy” dont we all Adam..dont we all 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler&rsquo;s outfit is straight up Vegeta when he wore the badman shirt and those yellow pants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he is just such a wholesome and wonderful being, i’m just so grateful he was able to come to my great grandfather’s funeral

<p>0:18 &ldquo;it hurts&rdquo; Relatable for when I kiss my dad goodnight on the cheek, oh GOD that hurts 😣😣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“What&rsquo;s for dinner?&rdquo; &ldquo;well we got some purple pills, green ones and I got some lovely yellow bombers that I just took out of the oven&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lots of pictures of him with his mustache and sunglasses, he looks like Freddie Mercury! Just me? Ok&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“WAHAH that was a good one Ellen!”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we just appreciate him?? He’s the best actor out there! הזוהן׳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks just like Freddie Mercury in that photo of him and Aniston in sunglasses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally love him so much he’s so pure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he said “tiny little mustaches” I felt that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“They asked me if I wanted to get slimed. I said&hellip;noo” 😹</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He actually sounds really down to earth, I have never seen him on anything other than his movies so I thought he just acts dumb all the time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His SNL was amazing!!!!!!!! I laughed and then I cried</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adams Sandler makes me want to clear my throat everytime he speaks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only way I know him is through the movie “Waterboy” were Footballs for the devil.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guy like Adam shouldn’t be on the Ellen show. He’s way too pure and genuine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam outfit look&rsquo;s like vegeta&rsquo;s outfit when they wait for goku to return 🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam: Jennifer Looks very Good &hellip;.I&hellip;I..I&hellip;We&hellip;We..We&hellip;Do&hellip;Do I&hellip;Should I talk about the movie at all ?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Ellen: Yeah&hellip; Not yet&hellip;No</p>

<li></li>
<li>
<p>In that picture he was wearing the same hoodie he wore when him and KG were interviewed by Jimmy Kimmel about their movie &lsquo;Uncut Gems&rsquo;, a month or something ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This Adam Sandler guy is pretty funny, he should become an actor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>0:40 Freddy Mercury is that you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grew up watching Adam Sandler! Owned most of his movies. Such an amazing guy 🙌🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love Adam Sandlers, he is naturally funny and down to earth 😍🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love all of his movies and he seems like a very nice man I don&rsquo;t know how he is so nice and funny at the same time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Ellen but she kinda ruined the daddy/daughter story 😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how he loves his family. Wonderful to see!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>He seems a bit nervous to me??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit: I&rsquo;m not criticizing him for being nervous. He made us laugh for years, just don&rsquo;t wanna see him nervous. He&rsquo;s more nervous than other interviews. And yeah I&rsquo;d be hundred times worse. 😅</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Adam Sandler would be great in Ghostbusters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;They slimed me&rdquo;</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler is hella humble bro😂 love him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loved adam Sandler since I was 10. When happy gilmore came out i seen it twice in theatres . I even choose the name Madison for my daughter after Billy Madison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler is amazing, I loved his movies and I still do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have always had a crush on this man such a regular guy those are the best🥰🥰🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is such a funny guy and a naturally kind human being. You can tell he&rsquo;s a good person as he&rsquo;s got gentle eyes and loves his family as he&rsquo;s always taking about his wife and children. Great guy!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam looks like he lost a little weight. He&rsquo;s looking healthy. I love his laugh too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They hit me deep in the eyeballs 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Adam Sandler trying to look like Vegeta?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does no one else realize hes wearing the same outfit as &ldquo;badman&rdquo; Vegeta? He even has a moustache!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He sounds like he had two concussions the same day.

</li>
<li>
<p>Growing up my dad loved Adam Sandler so much and they looked alike so I genuinely though he was Adam. lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like he’s stuttering a lot what happened to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the first Hotel Transylvania came out, that’s when I found that he played Drac. Once you hear it, you can’t unhear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Big Daddy would have Encouraged Flirting!</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Watch it again and realize how much they stutter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So glad he’s back. I loveeeeeeee himmmmm</p>
