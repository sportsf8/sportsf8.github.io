<p>We took care of the hospitals and medical staff. Now we need to take care of workers who need a pay check for bills: food, medicine, rent/mortgage, car payments, loans. These people can not wait. Kids need to get back to school. Old people like myself and those with health issues should take whatever precautions we want. But we have to OPEN AMERICA so people can get back to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can someone be brave and tell the public the Gross number of viruses, we know Exist In ourselves and in the Living population of creatures. That these viruses are All Of The Time Mutating. Those that cannot bear the thought, can live in a plastic bag, and let the rest of us get on with it. Yes, I am worried about this incredible ability for our internationally connected media to create Panic, and not much else. Thank you for discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost all deaths are being counted ad COVID in order for the hospital to get paid. This increases the fed funding. Sister works at Hospital in Detroit as respiratory therapist. She has 2 patients in ICU one has COVID. The rest of the beds in the hospital are almost all empty. Hospitals are losing money very badly, no surgery and this is economic disaster for the hospital. We never needed to do this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone else notice that the media and politicians are both blatantly guilty of lying with stats in order to gain viewers and compliance with lockdown. The antibody studies results range from .2 to .7, but the media and pols are purposely emphasizing the raw count and treating us like infants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It says a lot about the calibre of the scientific advice givers that government around the world went to for advice. I wish that I thought that some good policy guidance would come out of this fiasco to prevent a repeat in the future but I don&rsquo;t. This response was entirely appropriate if we had been facing a zombie apocalypse but it was catastrophically disproportionate for a bit of a pig of a cold!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any news on the Stanford docs/Major League Baseball study?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discussion begins at around 3:00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there any way to get access to Scott&rsquo;s sources to the data and claims he makes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gentlemen, thank you for a great empirical, data driven analysis of the Covid pandemic. I hope that your discussion will be widely viewed and  that reason based on the facts we have gathered at such great cost can become the basis for our policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Dr. Atlas for speaking the truth. Shame on the medical doctors who stay silent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sounds like a reasonable plan to get the economy recovered.  What sort of mechanisms does Hoover use to get their ideas implemented?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you both. Excellent discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The effects on the economy must include the unveiling of the economic warfare being waged by CCP ;  Australia woke up to find CCP spies in government and key universities and land and businesses bought clandestinely, &ldquo;students&rdquo; stealing research secrets and rioting in support of Chinese atrocities, bullying Taiwanese and Hong Kong Chinese .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace Fauchi with Dr. Atlas #</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for this briefing! I am a recent subscriber to the channel, and I&rsquo;ve been so appreciative of the balanced and logical discussions here. I don&rsquo;t watch any of the mainstream, network &ldquo;news&rdquo; programs. I prefer to get my information from more trusted sources, and this channel has proven to be one of those for me. Even after the Covid-19 situation has worked itself out (though that might not be for a while!), I will continue to keep the Hoover Institution as a regular part of my viewing. Thank you so much!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah good luck with that⤵</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for your intellectual platform. The solution to opening up our economies is home testing. Have everyone test at home  with simple cheap disposable paper strips. Its not the number of positive cases that we should be tracking it’s the number of contagious people that we should worry about. You are only contagious for a small period. This truly is a breakthrough in thinking and science backs this up. This physician explains it better and the young man from Harvard who is both an MD and a PhD came up with this brilliant idea. His name is Michael Mina. Please watch this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does social order distance work for ai trafficking,  for at&amp;t global IBM Oracle systems,  in town city an state  by the police force,  as well as drones,?</p>
</li>

<p>😎☕🤨🙄😮🙂

<p>Government normally depends on taxes, right now the government is converting money from thin air how can the government debt they are creating possibly be reduced?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As in industries with specific risks such as nuclear power or aviation, we have learned to manage the unique risks and achieve productivity in a competitive environment. Can not we do the same with Covid 19? Additionally, to target the protection, do we not need the resources for testing as the starting point?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common sense, I miss the days people used to have it. Now I see young people running with mask on. I really like to know what they are thinking or perhaps not thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A decent grab bag of conventional and unconventional covid narrative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scott Atlas is correct about testing.  Also keep in mind that &ldquo;acquired immunity&rdquo; to COVID 19 may last only 3-6 months to a 1-2 years.   This &ldquo;immunity&rdquo; is not a life long immunity.  The three stages he identified are correct.  Thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Fear replaced logic” - very well said.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon uses strong arm tactics that are illegal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will add a 6 month trial period of prime or prime student to your purchase order and not permit you to delete that trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the risk to the younger population low?  What about recent cases of inflammation syndrome being reported; do we know enough?  Support challenging and eliminating structural bureaucracy to facilitate recovery and growth but not at the cost of essential safeguards and resource stewardship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wuhan virus has only changed my life in that I have searched other news sources as I am completely fed up with ABC/CBS/NBC etc. They keep doing the fear mongering. &ldquo;Cases continue to rise even as cities reopen&rdquo; WEll yes as we are testing far more people. But these positive tests mean nothing as many people had no symptoms. If you are fragile, stay home. I head something great the other day, &ldquo;My Rights Don&rsquo;t End Where Your Fear Begins&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to spend my money on products that are made anywhere except CHINA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump and Newsome should open up based on age and underlying health of an individual. Schools should open up college age through elementary in phases. All business and government should open up by age groups; twenties and thirties should return to work first, then forties, and then the fifties. Sixties and older should be last group of people returning to physical work space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any strategy/policy is only successful if strong leadership, communication, and the myriad of details are in place. The execution of those details critical. What are the details we need to make sure are in place reguarding the supply chain, training, personell, etc and the leadership messaging?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one should be content until the incompetent head of WHO is in prison. And China pays $$$ dearly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>funny they talk about drugs and vaccines, but they don&rsquo;t talk about hydroxcloriquine,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is right , parents won&quot;t be able to work with kids K thru 6th grade. They aren&rsquo;t allowed to be home along. SCHOOLS should be opened for those that want to go and make up what they have missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heard about Dr. Atlas from John and Ken KFI am 640. I&rsquo;m glad I heard this. Really interesting.  Thank you. I will pass on, knowledge should be shared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interdependency causing good behavior has obviously failed.. it&rsquo;s a sweet fantasy, but not realistic when you are depending on completely different government philosophy getting along, or even baser, different sets of rules. The USA should manufacture all pharmaceuticals, electronics and weapons here, trade food, clothing and gadgets with whomever has decent human rights policies only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are we trying to make a deal and promising to do all these special things? This kills as much or less than the flu, we never shutdown for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The one big difference that makes the shutdown open fraud in reporting the distinction between drying from COVID-19 and having COVID-19, while  dying from other complications.

<p>Remember government’s reason for closing businesses, schools and shelter-in-place; to slow the spread of Covid&hellip;so the hospitals are not overwhelmed and they have time to get enough PPE’s and ventilators. “Flatten the Curve” was the goal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, that’s been done over two months. Hospitals are not overwhelmed and are struggling to keep staff without furloughs and layoffs due to low patients. Ventilators proved less than useful for many Covid patients as 9 of ten in NY were actually dying after being put on a ventilator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I attempted to spend my stimulus yesterday at Costco, but was refused entry because I choose not to wear a mask&hellip;how is that contributing to growth.  My not wearing a mask does not endanger the folks who to choose that.  Confused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well done fellows. Critical thinking, common sense and observational/functional medicine must prevail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not going away. We will unfortunately reach more than 100k. But in a country of 320 million and 50 states, 40/50 people in each state although undesirable is probably going to be common. For the foreseeable future. It’s sad but reality usually isn’t rose colored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our &ldquo;leaders&rdquo; understand and communicate the logic &hellip; that is laughable seeing as how Trunk is completely incapable of grasping reality.  Thanks for your informative presentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think how much different this would be if each family had a parent that could stay home with the kids.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instead of raising taxes on the internet, try lowering taxes on brick and mortar stores. We&rsquo;re already paying sales tax for online purchases. Shows how little John Taylor knows about economics. Let people keep more of their own money and the economy with sort itself, not this central planning quasi-Socialist BS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With kids there has to be a concern for the people they&rsquo;ll be bringing germs home to. Some have grandparents at home, some have parents with diabetes/hypertension/obesity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry economist guy, parks and hiking trails aren’t part of the economy.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
