</li>
<li>
<p>me: I hate fish</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Ian: fish is my main time meal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>his cheat meal&hellip;. is gluten free pancakes and fruit. thats my healthy meal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian Somerhalder just slapped me across the face yelling:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'&rsquo; the first thing i eat when i wake up is 2 puppies&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me: yep&hellip;Stefan&rsquo;s diet</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I love how he talks about food although he is really the snack 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have never felt so unhealthy and fat in my life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian just called me unhealthy in 96 languages</p>

<p>Ok I’m sorry I have to say this “ it’s not bourbon it’s TEA”- Bonnie Bennett</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elena would be proud of how he turned out this is her dream guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: it&rsquo;s always good to be healthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damon: someone hold my blood bag and bourbon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cant believe how environmentally conscious he is as if he couldn&rsquo;t get hotter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all that sounds delicious and healthy, but sooooooo tiring</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m starting to believe that the whole Vampire Diaries cast are actually vampire they’ve aged like fine wine!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Him: two breakfasts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything I eat in a day:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he literally just eats veggies, fish and salt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never thought someone could be so sexy when they talk about salt and quinoa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: eats healthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damon: where’s the bourbon?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is so conscious about the environment.  We all should be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Istg this man doesn&rsquo;t age, I bet that ring is his daylight ring and he is actually a vampire😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correction:Ian Somerhalder calling you unhealthy for 6 minutes and 41 seconds straight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>him: talking about nutrients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>me: why is he so hot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL when people comment that they wish he weren’t married, I’m like, I get you, but honey, we weren’t gonna get him anyways!! 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When ever someone talks about pancakes I only remember Damon’s pancakes that Bonnie was so sick of eating😂

<li>
<p>He made me feel like an animal just rolling in the mud not caring abt my body in 6:41 minutes💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: Sugar is the Devil</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: Drinks coffee with 5 spoonfuls of sugar 🙃</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is He trying to make every girl from age 12 and over fall in love with him because it worked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He eats healthy food all day long. No wonder why he looks like he doesn&rsquo;t age at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i thought he was done with everything he ate and then he goes “ and then the baby wakes up” and explains that was all in two hours WTF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was waiting for him to make a joke saying something like “and then 2 large glasses of blood” 🤓</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He doesn’t eat, he gobbles 😂❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I lived in his house, I&rsquo;d probably be good looking too because of all the healthy food he eats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never thought i would find what someone eats in a day SO interesting!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me writing what he eats to start my diet meanwhile eating my Dominos pizza like : 👁️👄👁️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he said “wife” and “baby” the fan girl in my started bawling🤧</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“It’s not bourbon, it’s TEA”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And we can only think about the time he had pancakes for breakfast for 4 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What Ian eats in a day:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Fish, salt, vegetables, salt, coffee, salt, lemon water w salt, salt, tea, salt, nuts, salt, something about dish soap, salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is this dude acting like he isn’t Damon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is he eating gluten free? Is he or his wife intollerant because not eating gluten when you can is not very healthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine how his daughter feels to say the hottest man on earth is her father

<p>When he said that he ate two breakfast I was like &lsquo;Same dude. First some toast and Nutella and then chocolate cereal&rsquo;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Welp&hellip; Nevermind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like Ian would be the type of guy to give kids apples on Halloween</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“I always do the what the rock says”</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: &ldquo;A little bit of salt&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>💀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other celebrities: “I eat about 2 cups of kale during the day&hellip;”                         Him: “ 2 HANDFULS OF KALE&hellip;” ✋✋</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He should write a cookbook</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For eg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian Somerhalder&rsquo;s Guide To Healthy Eating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to eat with him just because, I mean he is so healthy and handsome and hot and perfect and so smart and didn&rsquo;t say hot well is SO HOT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I fell more in love with him when he started talking about reducing waste 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Half of the comments are teen girls talking about how hot he is&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but what about bourbon &amp; blood&hellip; have I been lied to my whole life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me thinking he was done</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Ian: so that was the breakfast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He literally salts and gobbles everything 😂

<li>
<p>ok i am suddenly super attracted to him after seeing how environmentally conscious he is 🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man stefan was right this guy looks almost exactly like me man he even sounds like me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve found my doppelganger</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just love how educated he is😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to wonder why he looked like he was 25 even though he&rsquo;s 41&hellip;.now i know why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he literally has dinner for breakfast, like fish and veggies?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: “I didn’t know how hard it is to get maple syrup”</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>me living in canada uhhh&hellip;. yea so&hellip;. difficult</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me (a very normal teenager):</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breakfast: Cereal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lunch: Curry, salad or sushi.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dinner: Fried fish and rice 🍚</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realise how interesting this was going to be. Good for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no wonder he doesn&rsquo;t age. his diet is perfect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of times I’ve watched this is unhealthy😭🤚🏻😂😩</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me realizing he’s not my soulmate:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👁💧👄💧👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh no, is Stefan feeling sensitive abt his relationship with Caroline? She rly liked him and he broke her heart! See Stefan, even the bear knew. I saw that coming from a mile away and my brains made of cotton! Gimme that. kicks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the amount of people that flirt with him &amp; probably thinking “he could eat me if he wants” when reading the title&hellip; wait maybe that was just me. Anyways.

<p>He can literally homeschool his daughter and she&rsquo;ll be a scholar. Take care Harvard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i love how 99.99% of the comments are reference to the vampire diaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who fell in love with damon after watching the vampire diaries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;First thing I do when i wake up is eat two puppies&hellip;I&rsquo;m joking&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Thank god I got scared for a second there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought the ring on his right hand was a daylight ring😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His awareness to the environment makes him even hotter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guys just called me fat in SOO many different ways but idc finna get some chocolate now 😗</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when he said “i eat two puppies” i was like</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>I was really waiting to hear Bourbon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg he’s so healthy so organic and is environmental and hot OMG my perfect mannn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish he and his wife came up with a YouTube channel where they share healthy meal ideas. The world could use a more positive and healthy view on what we consume. And I bet they just know loads of yummy recipes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: The first thing I eat is two small puppies!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me: But that&rsquo;s Stefan&rsquo;s diet</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>If he were to watch Grimes food diary I’m pretty sure he would die</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God his meals sound depressing

</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Sugar is the devil&rdquo; puts down jaffa cake..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ofcourse he doesn’t age he’s a vampire remember</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never really had a celebrity crush on him but he&rsquo;s honestly so impressive. Smart, environment friendly and attractive&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikki really is a lucky woman!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna end up being single all my life..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because Ian is married🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this video just called me unhealthy and fat and told me i’m gonna die of cholesterol by 30</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being Ian somehalder&rsquo;s child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My pfp is my reaction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: talks healthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: huh?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“ First thing I do when I wake up is I eat 2 small puppies “ 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how informed he is about things he cares about! I’m taking my time making smarter and cleaner purchases and decision with my food and such. One thing to always keep in mind is when you don’t live in a city being 100% clean is extremely hard so just do what you can!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fact that he&rsquo;s so smart just makes him even more sexy i cannot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>drinking game: take a shot every time Ian says &ldquo;gobble(s)&rdquo; or &ldquo;salt&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pancakes &ldquo;He made for Bonnie in 10 may 1994&rdquo; 😃 one of my favorite episodes😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am watching it third time! Yes, third time I am trying to convince my husband to watch  this video! 😁🤦🏼‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s so weird seeing him like this Bc I’m so used to seeing him as Damon 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ik he’s an actor but he should be a nutritionist on the side

<li>
<p>Jesus how does he eat so much and still look like that-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so sad he diesn’t drink a glass of blood when he wakes up 😞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian-no I’m kidding I would never eat puppies I’m not a monster.                                                                           Damon-eats puppies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can see him wearing his day ring,and yet he is lying about his diet🤒</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reasons Ian is so busy:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-Baby</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-Eating healthy food</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The baby is so lucky to have Damon Salvatore as her dad :-)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me trying to understand what he’s eating for breakfast: * doesn’t understand so just focus on him *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss Damon but srsly Ian is everything 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone remembers him as the guy from The Vampire Diaries, but I remember him as Boone from Lost lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The perfect human doesn’t exi-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>imagine being educated anddddd hot 👀.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just fell in love with him even more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The way he said lettuce&hellip;. IM DEAD 5:54  watch his mouth when he says it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet any money Ian’s daughter is going to be gorgeous when she grows up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video was actually just about how Ian’s secretly a nutritionist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This actually is GOOD food advice😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian:  &lsquo;That&rsquo;s everything I eat in a day which should probably be 5 days'😂💖</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian: I eat two small puppies.

</li>
<li>
<p>Me: Same!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Him: I&rsquo;m kidding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me:  &ndash; &ndash; welp&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything he eats in a day: me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t eat a lot of meat because he&rsquo;s sucked so much blood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I adore that he is this waste conscious, I would’ve never thought.. we need more celebrities like him ❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has rambled quiet a lot in this video but some how he’s actually entertaining me!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love that he&rsquo;s environmentally conscious ❤️✨🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a sad state we live in when eating healthy and caring for the environment costs 20 times more than junk and plastic :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He looks like he’s wondering why people want to know what he eats everyday</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food goals! This just made me like him as a person even more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His skin is clearer than my future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me watching this while eating deep fried chips feels like sin .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His knowledge makes him even more attractive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe he loves eating pancakes cause that&rsquo;s all he could eat when he was stuck in the prison world with Bonnie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noone:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Ian: “Cacaooooo”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Him: talking about snacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: We all know who the real snack is 😏🤤

<li>
<p>What’s wrong with me 🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This makes me feel better about knowing irrelevant facts about food lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he literally eats salt everyday omg 😹😹😹 i love him am</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He and his wife should make a youtube channel and share all their knowledge on healthy eating and lifestyle, i’d love to see that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t understand why people are saying that Ian aged bad, he’s still hot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like he can relate to the actual Damon Salvatore and this is inspiring me to eat healthy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i just seen the lil yatchy version of this lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to go to their house to eat! Everything he talked about my oldest daughter and I have tried making or want to try to make it. We especially want to try making the homemade yogurt but we’re afraid we would mess it up and end up with food poisoning. Lol yes, we are that accident-prone. We grew winter spaghetti squash last year and had tons. This year they didn&rsquo;t do well😢. But at least my cherry tomatoes and all my herbs are growing great!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that’s why he haven’t became a old man he’s EATS SO HEALTHY with 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑡</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I- I’m in love and his intelligence just makes me fall even more in love 🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, I have two breakfasts&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: K, Hobbit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This dudes planning on living forever!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I thought he couldn&rsquo;t be more perfect❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His cheat meal is dark chocolate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My diet is dark chocolate 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing that he is trying to reduce his waste. He is a terrific role model!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His healthiness is putting my diet to shame I&rsquo;ll get as much healthiness he does in a day in a month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>omg he is so hot handsome

<li>
<p>the man of my dreams dosnt exi-</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he talks about pancakes 🥞 the only the thing that comes in my mind is 1994</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he says he eats “clean food” I double take for a moment l thought l was the only person who said that whoo hoo! Go Ian!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this man literally eats all that i eat in a day within two hours and before i wake up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does he even know this stuff like the oxygen levels in the brain and salt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take a shot everytime he says “I gobble that up”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this what it’s like to not have depression &amp; anxiety</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am so lost. He is so healthy and environment friendly like I don’t even know what he’s saying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, he looks so different than I remember him looking on Lost.  Boone???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he got even more attractive now, no kidding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He just called me unhealthy in so many ways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Men take note. This man looks like he hasn’t aged a day. Eat like Ian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After watching your description, don&rsquo;t know why I feel like laughing 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄so hard on me as well on you&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg the Family is sooo sweet 😍🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ian called me unhealthy and unproductive in every way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So how can we make clean food, and conscious products accessible to low income families?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But lets not forget he makes great pancakes, especially for Bonnie</p>
</li>
<li>
