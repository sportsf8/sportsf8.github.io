<p>Do all of the smartest doctors work at Stanford? Seems so (Ioannides, Bhattacharya, this fellow).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary..&rdquo;</p>

<p>I keep hearing that the masks don&rsquo;t do anything for the average citizen so we shouldn&rsquo;t wear them. And then also we shouldn&rsquo;t wear them because that makes fewer masks available to medical personnel. So why do the masks do nothing for us but are needed by medical professionals? I don&rsquo;t mind the idea of prioritizing who should get the masks I would certainly give up a mask if it could be better used by a doctor or nurse, but I don&rsquo;t like false information being used to accomplish that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was very informative and helpful. Thank you for posting it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice explanation ! I hope our authorities here in France listen to common sense too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice Doctor and makes sense thank you Hoover Institute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m curious what you think about how the death numbers measured  for covid 19 are being measured by all  deaths WITH covid19 infection rather than deaths FROM the virus as the seasonal flu is? This seems to make even the death rate not a very clear measure .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you for this. Very informative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This discussion won’t age well when he mentions only 1,000 in the US have died&hellip;  two weeks later (ie now) it’s over 26,000</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is how Congress gets control over $2T</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing experts to us</p>

<p>Excellent!! Thank you</p>

<p>Did you know Rodney Kennedy Minot?</p>

<li>
<p>health care professionals need them, they work in confined spaces with sick people, they also have to do direct patient care.  Their exposure radius cannot be avoided because of their profession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My only complaint is that more people will listen to fear mongering cnn, nbc, and fox news, rather than an actually level headed doctor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to know if these people are sending their family members without any protection, actually looking to get infected so they can develop emunity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think most would agree that you were incorrect. You should base your conclusions on careful examination of the facts, not doctrine. Not doing so is dangerous to public health&ndash;one of Herbert Hoovers greatest concerns.</p>

<p>Scott W. Atlas shrugged.</p>

<p>interesting, that the world dominating cabbalists called this virus coved 19</p>

<p>19 is the nr of the SUN ! also in tarot. 1 plus 9 = 10, the highest nr in the desert religion&hellip;.. so it’s their sun ?  their aim to reach ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A story out about a nurse in NYC says a few people died of pneumonia and severe bronchitis &hellip;.then came in the next day and saw the death certificates were changed to Coronavirus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Key lesson here is &ldquo;Be Prepared.&rdquo;  What if this virus is followed by a mutated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>corona virus as a one-two punch?  Or a different virus?  Also our supply chain is in the hands of the Chinese CCP.  Chinese companies are extensions of the CCP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Autonomous Private ownership doesn&rsquo;t exist in China.  Why are we trading with them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So much fantastic information. China does import cancer drugs from the US - but they can do without them. Those that are Elite will get what they need. China does not care how many old people die.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expert asserted the US gets the best medical outcomes for a range of severe conditions. This seems at odds with the US ranking 11th amongst 11 countries. Among the 11 nations studied in this report – Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, France, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States—the U.S. ranks last, as it did in 2010, 2007, 2006, and 2014″ Australia had the No 1 spot on outcomes. Based on a broad range of indicators, the U.S. health system is an outlier, spending far more but falling short of the performance achieved by other high-income countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So when was the last tine the flu caused Italian hospitals to become overwhelmed and turn people away to die at home?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Or Spanish. Or even threaten to overwhelm the Hospitals in NYC?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The suggestion that the important metric is number of new deaths per day must be looked at in the context of where we are in this pandemic.  At this time essentially all deaths have occurred after patients have received intensive care.  At a later stage in the pandemic hospitals may be overwhelmed.  When that occurs some or many people will not receive intensive care.  There’s little doubt that without appropriate care the death rate will increase.  Therefore, it’s important to also know the difference in death rates with care vs without care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Could be overwhelmed, but won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Except NYC is currently going the way of Italy and Spain&hellip;</p>

<p>I disagree with most of his ideas.  Here&rsquo;s why.  1.4% of infected Diamond Princess passengers (10 people) have already died and 15 people are still in serious condition.  These people are getting world class care from an unburdened healthcare system.  If they all die the CFR is 3%.  Moreover, studies of the original SARS patients showed that 36% of ICU patients died within 12 months after recovery due to disease related complications.  A recent study out of Hong Kong suggests we will likely see similar outcomes for this disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems to me this guy is a straight advocate for herd  immunity  , i cant relate to his risky and unpredictable strategy . Just look at the prime minister from UK just test positive , i would not leave the fate of a country to pure luck &quot; yeah just get infected you&rsquo;ll beat it if not you get really sick and maybe permanent lung damage or die but yeah is just luck &quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People coming in to do drive-by dislikes - big lul.  So many brainwashed by mainstream media right now.  Independent media like this isn&rsquo;t much better, but Hoover has consistently been the most measured and all-encompassing resource I&rsquo;ve seen so far regarding this topic - other than medical experts themselves.</p>
