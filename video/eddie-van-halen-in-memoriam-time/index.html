<li>
<p>Eddie Van Halen, the greatest rock guitarist ever, died today.  For his unmatched chops, originality, inventions for the guitar and amp, he was the best.  His influence on lead guitarists for years to come was like an atomic bomb going off when Van Halen I came out in 1978. RIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this year hadn&rsquo;t sucked enough already. RIP EVH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a dry eye in the house tonight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy truly changed the way guitar players played back in the 80s.  Everyone copied his style.  Possibly the most influential player since Jimi Hendrix.  An incredible loss to rock music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Putting EVH at 8 is disrespectful and false. RIP to the goat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more I play his songs, the more I realize the musical genius he was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a 16 year old guitarist who first heard Van Halen 1 in a friends basement in 1978, his death today marks the passing of the most influential guitar player in history. There were guitarists I liked more, but Eddie was a force of musical nature, like Mozart. You can’t know what it was like in 1978 unless you were there. The world was already full of hot shot guitar players as guitar solos were still popular and necessary in songs, if you can believe it. We were surrounded by solos. Out of an already elite atmosphere comes someone who reinvented the guitar, by borrowing, stealing and adding his own personality. This was no Berkeley grad snob with an ‘education’, but a natural innovator who could not even read music. We heard ‘eruption’ and could not even understand what we were hearing. Was it a guitar, a keyboard, voodoo magic? And this was right in the middle of disco!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask any rock guitarist who the greatest ever was, they’ll say Jimi and Eddie. Unequivocally. Rest In Peace king. You changed everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Screw Rolling Stone, who obviously never paid attention to reality. They ranked EVH at #8, behind Prince? Idiots.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>RIP King. EVH 1955-2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had the honor of being a roadie on the Monsters of Rock Tour in the 80s&hellip;met him many times..always cool as hell, respectful&hellip;and a badass to see live&hellip;sad day for all&hellip;keep on rockin&hellip;always&hellip;RIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eddie may be gone but his ghost lives on&hellip;.in my ringing ears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Eddie. You will be missed, by your loved ones, your friends and your fans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are a guitar man, the pain is double! RIP MASTER!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in Peace Eddie Van Halen. First  Chadwick Boseman and now Eddie? Can this year get any worse?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP brother. The world has lost a great artist and a musical genius.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Eddie the best there ever was and will be</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best guitarist possiblity ever, rip eddy 😩😢

</li>
<li>
<p>Rip Eddie 😭 😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Eddie&hellip; your music got to me as a preteen and rocked me into adulthood. RIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am STUNNED and saddened by the news of this loss. My heart goes out to his closest loved ones, and his millions of adoring fans, present company included. 💔😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rock ‘n’ Roll is truly dead! Put on your Van Halen music 🎸🥁 🎶 and turn it up freaking LOUD 🔊!!! 🤟🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was the best guitar player I have ever heard, I i always wanted to play like Eddie but never could and I was fine with that because I knew that made him that much more special&hellip; rest easy EVH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP EVH. Among the greatest guitarist in the world. Rest OUT LOUD🤘</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP, one of the greatest guitar players that changed my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so done with 2020.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few weeks back I was searching around the internet, looking to see what Eddie had been doing lately, and of course, how he was doing with his cancer.  Probably had a lot to do with losing my 12 year-younger brother to cancer at a way-too-young, week before his 43rd birthday.  When I could find hardly any news, except for a grim comment from DLR, I wondered how much longer it would be before the world got the terrible news, because when you have someone close to you die from cancer, you know it&rsquo;s a death sentence, and time is not on your side, even if you seem to be making good progress.  So even though I was somewhat prepared to hear this news, even realizing that I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if it happened this year, I&rsquo;m still in utter disbelief and denial that he&rsquo;s gone.  I truly wish I could pay my respects in person.  Eddie, I&rsquo;ll always remember that infectious smile that you always had when I saw you play.  That&rsquo;s the memory I&rsquo;ll keep.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really glad that I got to see them in 2004 when they reunited with Sammy.  I know things weren’t good behind the scenes but you would’ve never known it from the way they played that night. And just seeing Eddie play “Eruption” live was well worth the price of admission alone. RIP to one of the greatest guitar gods of all time 🎸</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May Eddie’s memory be for a blessing 🎸🎶🕊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a priviledge to have lived at the same time as Eddie Van Halen.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Thank you EVF for all the years of happiness.  RIP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP EDDIE. You changed my life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one of the best !  :(&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P. Eddie !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so grateful Wolfie and I were able to hold you in your last moments. I will see you in our next life my love.&rdquo;        - Valerie Bertinelli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A few weeks back I rediscovered the joy of playing electric guitar and bought myself a new instrument - an EVH Wolfgang Standard. For only $650, it&rsquo;s really a fantastic instrument - worth every penny. It plays and sounds great, it&rsquo;s solid, and it looks awesome, with a beautiful quilted purple color and dark &ldquo;baked maple&rdquo; neck. All of which is to say that not only was Eddie the greatest and most inventive rock guitarist ever to walk the earth, he was also a damn good maker of guitar gear.

<p>RIP Eddie. I was fortunate enough to watch VH perform 3 times. You will be missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was so shocked.  first I saw Ted Nugent posting a pic with Eddie.  I thought, how sweet.  NO time to read FB.  Then I saw something else and thought, his birthday is in February, hmmmm.  Then Neal Schon posted with Eddie and I caught RIP.  My heart stopped.  What??????  after googling and realizing he was gone, I had to find my husband, who was at Home Depot and is always listening to his MP3 player so figured he wouldn&rsquo;t realize it, but might overhear someone saying it at Home Depot.  I called he was already in the driveway and still hadn&rsquo;t heard.  I said I don&rsquo;t know how to tell you this but Eddie Van Halen just died today.  He is still walking around in silence.  His favorite guitar player since a teenager.  We&rsquo;ve gone through Van Halen with DLR and Sammy Hagar through dates, engagement, marriage and ever since.  We are reading all the posts out there but still cannot play his music.  This will take some time to get through.  It&rsquo;s like when Elvis died!</p>

I am 50 and still play it over and over and over, thank you EVH you were one of the best axe players I have ever heard in my lifetime and will always be part of my life as a child an a man RIP brother .</p>

<p>The guy rewrote Rock guitar in the late 70&rsquo;s- 80&rsquo;s. He was What Hendrix was in the 60&rsquo;s but lasted a bit longer. RIP EVH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was the reason I started playing guitar. Whenever I heard Eruption for the first time, I knew that’s what I wanted to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>second concert i ever saw was the 1984 tour in phx..it blew my little 14yr old brain, thank you Eddie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really wish he personally would have put out a video guitar course on how he achieved His Magic with that Fretboard. Looking at a Van Halens Tablature Fret books, the underlying theme is -This is how Eddie did it, but your a mere Mortal and dont even try&hellip;.RIP EVH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace our hero . You were and always will be the best to many of us in the world !</p>

<p>RIP Master Eddie Van Halen 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This one cuts really deep. He influenced me and a million others. You will never be forgotten, Eddie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for everything man. Condolences to everyone who was close to him. I made a replica of Ed&rsquo;s franken-strat outta cardboard when I was 10. It was one of my most prized possessions I had. But also shows just how important of a guitar player he really was! Rip Ed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP, Eddie. You had an amazing gift, sleep well now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest now eddie, this cut me to the bone another icon gone, but one thing eddie, your passion and devotion will live on&hellip;&hellip;thank you for the riffs and licks r.i.p 😥😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip Eddie, besides Jimmy Page he was my biggest influence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the greatest!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess I&rsquo;m never selling my EVH 5150 iii 50w he wasn&rsquo;t just a guitar God but knew his gear like a swordsmith knows swords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t cry because it&rsquo;s over, smile because it happened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P Eddie! You’ve done so much for the rock industry! 🤘🏻😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s top guitar players are subjective. But even non Van Halen fans would have to admit objectively that EVH has to been on the Mount Rushmore of rock guitar gods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thumbs down are from my neighbors that don&rsquo;t appreciate my EVH tribute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love ❤️ you brother R.I.P</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re the greatest guitar player in the whole world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have seen VH in 2007 and 2008!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Edward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you&rsquo;re playing with Hendrix!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>once again, someone we wish lived, died, while someone we wish dead still lives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hes the one responsible for that great guitar solo in Beat It.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace Eddie!

<p>This really hits hard. He was my guitar hero. Jeff Beck mentioned his unique riffing. Do glad I saw him live. Might&rsquo;ve been VHlll but Eddie was right in front of me and man was on fire</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace legend. You&rsquo;ve touched us all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love you Eddie, You are one of the very few guitarists worthy of there legendary status after death. We will miss you. You will always be on my playlist!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember an article in rolling stone, it may have been in the early 2000s.  In it the 100 greatest guitar solos of all time. Rock, blues, jazz etc. all the great guitar soloists. Anyway I remember that Stevie Ray Vaughn, Jimi Hendrix, and Eddie Van Halen were listed more times than other artists for they all had  lots of great solos. Now 3 of the best guitarists that ever lived have passed on. Rest in piece Eddie. Take your place along with Jimi and Stevie up there u deserve it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in Paradise Eddie. 🙏</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>My best friend and I used to listen to Van Halen and oogle over how cute Eddie was in the late 80&rsquo;s. Tomorrow will be the two year anniversary of her passing from cancer. Music is like a time warp, takes you back to those memories.

How many people are going to jam out on Van Halen now?  Know I will!!!  Got Greatest Hits in as always&hellip;&hellip;just a little louder tomorrow&hellip;.RIP🥺😢😭🤧🤟</p>

<p>Eddie was my guitar hero as a young man. I met him when they were an unknown band playing small gigs. They played the Tarrant County Convention Center in my hometown of Ft. Worth, Texas. After the show band members mingled with the audience. I mentioned to Eddie I was an aspiring rock guitarist as well. To my delight he took me on stage and showed me a few licks to practice. How many massive talents are that gracious? I remember telling my buddies afterward that Van Halen was destined for greatness. One year later they were playing sold out arenas. I&rsquo;ve never been in the presence of a more talented guitarist since. Rest In Peace, Eddie. And thanks for the guitar lesson, brother. I never forgot it. ❤❤❤</p>

<p>Rock In Peace EVH

<p>We&rsquo;ll see you soon, Guitar God, but not yet. RIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how do you have slow piano music behind a Eddie Van Halen memoriam</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They might have put him at number 8 but to me, he was number 1. He slide over those strings and produced the greatest music we were blessed to hear. He had class when class wasn&rsquo;t in. hahaha  Peace out Eddie and thanks for the tapes we can watch and be thankful that you were here.</p>

<p>May the Gods guide your journey home to Valhalla&hellip;Thor is waiting. So if you happen to see and hear thunder and lightning in the next couple of days you know Eddie and Thor are Rockin on!</p>

<li>
<p>I cannot believe that Van Halen and Rush both officially came to an end in the same year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was the last great guitar player</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eddie meant more than my words could come close to describing. You would have had to lived through 80&rsquo;s to fully understand the true impact of his music for which we shall forever remember, cherish and celebrate. Rest in Peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could have left out that last bit about Rolling Stone putting him at number 8. There has been no one including Jimi Hendrix that did what Eddie did for rock guitar. I love Hendrix but in the 3 1/2 years Jimi had Eddie in the same amount of time had gone way past him. R.I.P. NUMBER ONE Rock guitarist EVER Edward Van Halen !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Trump can leave the hospital after getting covid but Eddie can&rsquo;t??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in Paradise Eddie!</p>
