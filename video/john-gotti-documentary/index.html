<li>
<p>They sure messed up the newest travolta Gotti movie. The old one starring Armande Asante is a gem among gangster flicks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember the story when he drove Tony Soprano home after he outbid him on some old ice cream truck. Rang that bell all the way to Tony&rsquo;s home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You guys and Giuliani should be in church” lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We find him not guilty-</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Person: AAAAAYYYE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was 13 when big Paul got whacked and first heard the word MAFIA so I got Joe Bononos book and still not bored of mafia news new or old over 30 yrs later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FBI has technology that can hear a snake fart in Egypt 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paul Should&rsquo;ve never got his &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; position period&hellip; Neal Dellacroce deserved the Godfather status! That was the downfall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony quinn was taking notes he was neil in the  best gotti movie the hbo its here on youtube i recommend who haven&rsquo;t watched it too watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti Should&rsquo;ve sued the FBI after being cleared for the 3rd time..  Harrassment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to live 2 blocks away from “The Bergin Hunt and Fish Club” aka Gotti’s headquarters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course the &ldquo;Rico Law&rdquo; is a perfect remedy!!!&hellip; Feds wrote the law</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A real street guy a real street boss would have sensed something bad was about to happen but Gotti knew that Paul wasnt street smart at all but someone like Carlo Gambino would definitely have sensed something was about to happen and would have never ever went to no meeting like that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is dude from Law and Order tellin me about John Gotti</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never listened to my own advice never trust anyone who hasn’t done time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Travolta, playing John Gotti, was like Mickey Mouse playing Terry Molloy in on the Water Front.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DB was not a gambino associate DB was actually a Caporegime in the gambino family and had been a captain since the early 70s put in power by Don Carlo Gambino himself the real boss of bosses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>27:12  - So that was a illegal bug.. Like I thought&hellip;

</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti really had the style and the &ldquo;X factor&rdquo;, that&rsquo;s for sure!</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>There has been no-one like him since the days of Al Capone (who was similarly flamboyant and loved the &ldquo;public eye&rdquo;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Mr. Gotti . Rip Mr Gotti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two of the best lines ever: you resign feet first and I Forgotti!😂😂😂👏👏👏👏👏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we get the rico law against the president for the money laundring with the union</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guiliani is now a fraud 🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assantes film&hellip;..nailed it &hellip;travoltas film&hellip;.suck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never understood why Gotti didn&rsquo;t get scanners and have his meeting places swept on a regular basis, if he knew about the bugs already. That&rsquo;s what Pesci did in Casino.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol I was always a big fan of Anthony Quinn but I&rsquo;m even more of a fan now since he went to Mr Gottis trials to support him&hellip;.He was great as Aniello Dellacroce in that HBO Gotti film</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dear eternally awesome &amp; good Class, &ldquo;Saint&rdquo; John Ghotti&rsquo; Jr. became a real Saint years ago, though it may be news to some. He focussed on &ldquo;life&rdquo; and peoples&rsquo; life &amp; existence, and ensuring, preserving, Defending, &amp; protecting all peoples&rsquo; life &amp; existence, including working diligently and around the clock for much of his life on global health &amp; life on Earth, and global food &amp; shelter for all on Earth, and of course as a GRADUATE at our good School 1 &ldquo;Count to ten&rdquo; - Martial Art School (c)1, Patented(1) and a 10th Degree - Whitebelt Angel a long timespace ago, always, regardless of all always&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.he works/worked at School in and regarding Eternal Universal Defense including providing, ensuring, Defending, &amp; protecting &ldquo;all&rdquo; peoples&rsquo; life &amp; existence, including providing, &amp; ensuring food &amp; shelter for/re &ldquo;all only&rdquo; always, regardless of all always, Class. And he did great at it,..it&rsquo;s a long story the true story of John&rsquo;s attaining Sainthood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28:03 he communicated with just a pinky</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lutienent in charge im proud of him I look forward to a lifetime of family love and ecomical loot lol&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Brother Gene Joey and the Mic, They doing a thousand years, They dont roll, They dont rat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dont care to see the movie, heard Travolta stuffed his pants in SAT NITE FEVER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone catch the most recent Gotti book “Gotti’s Boys”? Many books on him over years &amp; some r overkill w/ the same information we’ve all got, but this one I do recommend. It’s well researched and focuses more on his crew and the events that lead Castellano hit as well as Gotti’s demise etc etc. Great read for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine living next door to him! You&rsquo;d never ask to borrow his weed whacker that&rsquo;s for sure!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When was this document filmed&mdash;1997 98</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh shoot I thought I was watching SVU when Munch showed up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awesome Documentary&hellip;&hellip;.

<li>
<p>At least Gotti had nothing to do with 9/11, Rudolph Giuliani did though</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why in the hell did you watermark a documentary that&rsquo;s not even yours to begin with? 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just seen the movie, and read some articles, funny thing is, being objective, that the accusations of the state ( the government) are all about what they do themselves too. For example, extortion, ( you are forced to pay taxes, or be prosecuted), illigal gambling, ( gambling only allowed by the state, by their own gambling systems), and so on. If you got brain enough, its clear to see who the real &ldquo;criminals&quot;are&hellip;.Like they say, the goverment doesnt accept competition&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>La cosa nostra till the end of him.. Just like he said whether its ten minutes from now a hour from now or 100 years from now when hes in jail it was gonna be la cosa nostra and thats that&hellip;. R.I.P.  to a true gangster tough guy R.I.P.  the teflon don John Gotti</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti was so smooth I wouldn’t be surprised if he represented hisself and still got off. Especially since they was buying jurors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THEY MADE A DEAL WITH THE DEVIL !!!! What a joke&hellip; rip John 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The judy was bought lol by the muscle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I could ever go back in time , I would warn John about the bug in the upstairs apartment &hellip;.. R.I.P. To the Legend John Gotti !!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>29.54 what else is he going 2 say? Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Theres never gonna be a last kingpin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They picked a gay sciencetology John Travolta as gotti the movie was ok but they could have done a better actor than Travolta did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John alite is always clowning JR I love it. He tells the truth about JR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great upload! Thank you</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>The thing about John gotti is that he stood tall he didn&rsquo;t hide who he was he didn&rsquo;t rat anyone out thats a true gangster loyal to the family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti&rsquo;s lawyer even tried to sound like a wise guy, fuchsia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jerry Capeci From NY Daily News Looks Like A Fat Jimmy Fallen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>john gotti is my UNCLE!!! :OOO  wow the more you know</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mysterious Yugoslavian they are talking about is a Serbian guy named Bosko Radonjic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Breaking the law can be sin free too if you have conviction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is that him having a huddle/pow wow out in the open with his guys at 22:18?  SMH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember in Brooklyn when i was 16 seeing a guy shot in the head in sheepsheadbay. Those were the days !</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I only started checking out gotti recently. His is an interesting story. He certainly had swagger and attitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armande Asante dans le rôle de john GOTTI est beaucoup mieux que celui de Travolta. Des grands acteurs ces italos-americains, des acteurs comme, Franck Vincent, Vincent Pastore, on aimerait aimé les voir toujours au grand, mais ils ont fait leurs temps.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of those Black Folk picketing outside the court building. They was probably paid by the crime family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John goty rip t recordaremos 100n pre capich</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He never stopped to talk to reporters and you&rsquo;re saying he liked the spot light?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>33:21 for all you Gotti fans that think John Gotti didn’t snitch. It’s amazes me how Sammy the bull is the poster boy of snitching, but he was just retaliating. The feds wanted Gotti more than Sammy. If the feds wanted Sammy more history would be different and Gotti would have been the biggest 🐀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gari o gotti?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy wz 2 pretty 2 b boss I bet u if he had one strand of hair going  back and walked feebily with a cane prosecutor s wouldn&rsquo;t HV hated him so much</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sammy Gravano wrote in his book about how John Gotti was self worshipping and his was right.</p>
</li>
<li></li>

<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s worshiped for nothing, feds weren&rsquo;t just blowing smoke when they said those unflattering things about him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thats not Albert Anastasia in the film,it&rsquo;s his brother Tough Tony..!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti was not walking with his bodyguards they were his brother and captain of the family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old John gotti is the best !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sammy should have been the boss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John gave me a ride home&hellip;  you know he rang that bell&hellip;   the whole way home&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:08 13 children? Jesus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah they sure did a hell of a job the streets are so much safer now. Look at all of the lives they saved we can all sleep better now that we don&rsquo;t have to be afraid that John Gotti and Sammy are going to get us lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems that Richard Belzer has recovered from his traumatic 1984 head injury and fall, which was caused by a sudden loss of oxygen to the brain&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who&rsquo;s driving the car anyone know is that Ruggerio??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any one know the year on this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this dude with the terrible beard is a huge buzzkill lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanna see this 2 on one fight? Did John get skinny?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dude with the nasely ass voice is so but hurt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care what anyone says he was a handsome man. It is just a fact, LOL!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gravano was right about Gotti, he was right about everything. John was just as selfish as Castelanno if not more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that Gotti was a very smart guy,but he made a big mistake w Sammy,plus gotti  had a big mouth and hi knowing that thi FBI was allways behind him he should of been more carefull</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sammy the bull bum banger</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surly the last don that everyone still knows these days, it&rsquo;s a modern tale, not back in the old dayz, 50/60s. Defo the last famous one. He had connections will those Good fellas, guys, Billy batts etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great job from the FBI. Thank.

<p>Theyre corrupt as well. Also the IRS the true mafia</p>

<p>RIP John Gotti</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whats funny is Chin Gigante didnt have permission to kill Frank Costello but tried and failed and Carlo Gambino disnt have permission to kill Albert Anastasia thwres a thing called a mercy kill meaning if its you or him and it was act first so why is a big deal cause ppl hatw on John Gotti and he disnt do nothing different everyone went to restraunts and night clubs its jus the media was so focus on him and he was a 1 of a kind Boss of Bosses and was the most powerful when he was Boss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Paulie should have followed his paisan The Chin,not metal schtick, and moved in background. That house enraged FBI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government played dirty to nail John Gotti in 1992 also not allowed Bruce Cutler to defend him then Sammy the rat gravano turned state witness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be are the company you keep bullets don’t always hit the intended target. You can be in the wrong place, but also with the wrong person, at the wrong time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Johnny Nine Toes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I alone when I say John Gotti was attractive?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to ask Gottis kids this question, if I meet you in a bar or a restaurant, will I be in a dangerous situation? Are you dangerous people? And if it is so, I want to know WHY!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to think that I saw it all on Mulberry Street&hellip;Dr. Seuss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those days are long gone! Now you just left with 2 tiny crossings inside Chinatown, with Tommy &ldquo;The Nose&rdquo; on the sidewalk ripping off tourists from Nebraska with cheap canned mini-clams, with the worst linguini packet, soaked in bad olive oil to pass it off as linguini alle vongole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👍👍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of people say gotta was dumb but u don’t make boss of the biggest crime family in the world by being dumb a lot of people don’t realize gotta was in the media a lot cuz he kept having trials an the media was shoving there cameras in his face plus the chin Vincent the chin walked around acting crazy an they got him so it doesn’t matter when you get to a certain point the feds just want let you win in court he knew he was going to prison just a matter of when and he didn’t tell on kno one an people say he couldn’t they wanted him do you realize how much time the feds would’ve cut off his time if gotta the Teflon don told it would look great on the feds all they care about is head lines my point is I’m not glorifying gotti but he was a gangster until the end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Little Gotti got the shotty to your body, so don’t resist, or you might miss Christmas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti got it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who’s a bigger rat? That 69 kid or Sammy the bull?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not many people like that

<p>True gandster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was one of a kind that&rsquo;s for sure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thats when gulianni was the man.today hes trump little goblin&hellip;.sad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Kimberly albanese still alive ? If not then how did she die?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder how many times Gotti &amp; Trumps paths crossed back I those days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti broke three rules &hellip;one he went public&hellip;. two he ordered the killing of the boss without approval&hellip; and three he backdoor his underboss..in my opinion Sammy gets a pass that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s still around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great Doc bro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The toto riina of newyork</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump and gambino had the same lawyer lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fav Gangsta 💪🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They illegally bugged him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28:28 Why did Fredo become a prosecutor?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lol thats my quote on the thumbnail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rudy went from being against them to being for them, what a fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God bless Trump and John Gotti</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s still bothers me to this day that our government let Sammy, the man who actually did the murders walk.Only to put John Gotti away for life.If your best friend told you to go kill someone would you do it ??? They let a murderer walk.A freaking hit man out of prison back in society in exchange for someone who didn&rsquo;t kill anyone.SMH that&rsquo;s pretty crooked if you ask me&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ask Pat Cotter at 3:08 why criminal mass murderers are only brought to justice if they don&rsquo;t work for the US Federal Government? Why is the US attorney in the southern district of NY not giving a grand jury the chance to look at the mountain of proof which shows the 3 WTC towers were brought down by controlled demolitions, a feat Bin laden had no chance of doing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti a true American badass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John made 12 million a year, Vito Rizzuto controlled the N.Y mafia from Montreal Forbes magazine estimated his net worth at $10 billion. He was one of the largest donors in the 2012 presidential election, giving more than $26.9 million to super PACs opposing President Barack Obama, he was the boss you never heard about.</p>
</li>

<p>nice

</li>
<li>
<p>He wasn’t boss material, not mention he was a big mouth idiot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was my grandpas uncle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I Dont Blame Sammy The Bull&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John gotti was my great great great grandfather I forgot how many greats😂 but he&rsquo;s a family member 😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the way he was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti = True Gangster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti Gotti - 6IX9INE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti brought the entire cosa nostra down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti was an total idiot when you in power you stand in the shadows and fly under the radar and no be in the SPOT LIGHT😫THE LOUDEST ONE IN ROOM IS THE WEAKEST ONE IN THE ROOM😤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just a street thug, nothing like the bosses of old</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mafia, mob, gangs are just the middle men, the real bosses are the government, biggest gang on earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti: Is as the head</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Sammie: The muscle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carrying out all Gotti hits, so why did Gotti think he could intimidate a man like Sammy by starring at him. Also baffled that Gotti is reported as Castalanno hits man, all he did was order the hit and sat in the car while the shooting took place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti Jr was a victim of being his fathers son. I’m glad he got out and gained some new morals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LAST DON</p>
