<p>I can just enjoy this Friday, the last kit I was freaking all day 😂😂 now I&rsquo;m broke so I&rsquo;m just gonna sit back n enjoy the experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time she says they have a new bag, James Brown pops up in my head and it’s “Mama’s got a brand new bag.” 🎵</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yess I am pretty eggcited!! Thank you ❤️🙂</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Hope everyone is staying safe during this time!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s brilliant that you’re getting the brands competitive!👏👏👏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That bag reveal was like the mystery guest on Question of Sport!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time I see you airing yourself I laugh. Im 52 menoposing, AC is at 65F and Im still hot. My husband walks around the house in a sweater and bathrobe&hellip; 😋</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will there be enough for everyone? Please&hellip;&hellip;.🙏🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot wait for the kit! Love this beauty backed stuff to help out but really hope those in the beauty industry can get back to work soon, so they can start earning again, especially those that are just the single income and rely solely on their trade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I take a break from social media and I miss everything 😆</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can someone please tell me where I go to order this? In the U.S.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oooooh I can&rsquo;t wait!  Well done Caroline!  You made such a huge difference in 2020.❤❤❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You tube ffs 20 adverts 😂. Outside of that, bloody amazing work guys for fundraising. Truely amazing. ❤️❤️❤️ so proud of everyone especially those with little giving during such an awful time! X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me clicking on this video and seeing the number of ads:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👁👄👁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey Caroline! Did you ever post the insta live Q&amp;A Sunscreen? I missed out watching it and it was something I really wanted to watch? Thanks!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hey Caroline, I&rsquo;m out of the loop, may I ask what  you are discussing here in regards to donations? Are your kits available to Canadians?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That bag sneak peak! It&rsquo;s stunning, congrats  and well done to the whole team in getting another kit together!

<p>What you and these companies have done for charity is just miraculous! You are just amazing! I want a kit so bad, I&rsquo;ve tried to get one every time but have not been able to get one! I was able to order your signed copy book and I was so excited but I have not received yet?? I&rsquo;m in the US so not sure what the delay is!! Watching you fan yourself makes me even hotter lol.. I&rsquo;m menopausal and I have other health issues so I&rsquo;m a total mess!! ❤❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pleeease do the same style bags in autumn. I can’t afford one right now and would love a bright yellow with camouflage inside. They‘re GORGEOUS!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PLEASE tell me we’ve got some Allies of Skin in there 😍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi Caroline! I finished reading your book within just 2 days after purchasing it! I loved it very much!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carolina, plz keep for some bags of us in USA. The difference in time is killing us. They all sold always😢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ok. C, which one has the C?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still seems to be an issue signing up for the newsletter unfortunately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the kit suitable for breastfeeding mums x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Caroline. Your video uploaded to you tube without any of the stretching video, as seen on IG 💋💋💋</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi, I understand in order to buy the new kit I have to sign for the newsletter. I have done that under three different email addresses, but still haven&rsquo;t received anything. Am I doing something wrong? Thank you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OMG IM SO READY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>19 add breaks?! Not Carolines fault - obvs. But seriously youtube?🤦🏻‍♀️🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colorscience Sunforgettable total protection Face shield is a great mineral sunscreen - tinted bronze for black skin.  It is a US brand but you can get it in the UK without extra cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last kits were UK priority,  and we in us had no chance, sold out immediately 😫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like Clearpay in the UK is the sister company of Afterpay here in the US - has anyone else had any experience with this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m far too excited 😁</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just love your videos. They are better than any tv show. An absolute natural on camera. And very witty 😀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would VB not donate? I’m disappointed 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like clear pay is only for UK or Australia. Hopefully credit card works on the day for a Singapore fan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hi Caroline&hellip;I deleted the comment. I’m so sorry&hellip;I was grossly misinformed by a representative of Afterpay. Please be safe+happy+healthy!!!xoxoxo

<p>I&rsquo;m bummed Clear Pay is UK only! It looks like After Pay is the sister company of Clear Pay, but I don&rsquo;t think we can use After Pay on the kits. Has anyone else seen this? I&rsquo;m sorry if I missed it in the comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is your book at barnes noble yet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lmao who disliked this video????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m in the US, is there an approx time of launch so I can make sure I wake up?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m about to ask a question that might be naive, or ignorant depending on your standpoint, BUT I&rsquo;ll ask it anyway. Could a person of darker skin add a dark pigment foundation to a zinc/mineral white-cast sunscreen to create a bespoke tinted sunscreen?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a recent sephora purchase I got a sample strip of NARS Sheer Glow Foundation - the shades I was gifted are among their darkest - colours are New Caledonia, Iguaçu, Namibia and Zambie. Since they are dark shades and I&rsquo;m pretty much a Fitzpatrick 1.5, I&rsquo;ve been using these samples as eyelid tint / bronzer / lip pigment (I add a coloured gloss over the foundation on my lips to alter the colour). So I wonder if a darker skinned person could use such a sample strip to add to mineral sunscreen to see if they could create something workable&hellip;.?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope you have the OSKIA vitamin c capsules again. I’m hooked!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to mobilize your freaks to do your bidding ummm &hellip;. hi we&rsquo;re here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yayyyy ..great xxxx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you buy the bags from Australia?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❤️💃🏻🌈🍷💫⭐️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🥳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could the kit be shipped to Russia? The previous one did not ship to Russia citing COVID as a reason, yet all other shops did it just fine (including Cult Beauty and Look Fantastic). I can only hope your delivery partner managed to fix it by now&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something does not sit right when people who give money to charity need praise or a &ldquo;shout out&rdquo; Just give and leave your egos at the door!!!</p>
</li>
