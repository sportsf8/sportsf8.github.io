<li>
<p>this might be the coolest thing Sandler has ever done</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôd told him slow down, you‚Äôll end up like Belushi and Candy, he said those guys are my heroes, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy‚Äù.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laying here in quarantine ‚Äújust thinkin about my boy Chris Farley.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine if Chris Farley was still alive, he would be Kevin James character on Grown ups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farley&rsquo;s gf was going to sell photos of his death. Sandler bought them so they wouldn&rsquo;t be released</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s a friend: 25 years later he still makes sure to talk about his buddy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing was harder than saying goodbye except watching chris&rsquo;s father have his turn to cry&rdquo; that line still gets me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I worked with Sandler and Farley on &lsquo;Airheads&rsquo; and man, those guys loved Farley. Such a kind soul. When Farley died everyone who knew him or worked with him was wounded. I do think about him a lot, not like we were best friends or anything, Farley just had the level of impact and influence. Watching this made me cry. My kids watch his films and ask me questions about him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the words of Dr. Hiriluk: A man only dies when he is forgotten. By that metric, you shall live forever Chris</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That guitar solo is by no means a technical masterpiece, it&rsquo;s an emotional masterpiece. I really needed this in 2020. Thank you Adam, &amp; thank you Chris Farley!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This and Uncut Gems. The man is clearly more than just a washed up comedian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I truly believe Sandler‚Äôs career was stunted prematurely due to his grief about Chris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam don‚Äôt even care, Gibson strap with a fender üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To me this most haunting visual of this clip is seeing Adam playing alone on an empty stage talking about Lunch Lady and having the shot of Adam on stage with Chris beside him at SNL - his body language as a musician hadn‚Äôt changed hardly at all between that clip and his live performance, and the feeling of emptiness, that there s a piece missing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love him or hate him, Adam Sandler doing this was the greatest thing. RIP Chris Farley.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôve always wondered if Chris Farley had lived longer if he would‚Äôve done more dramatic and serious roles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The line&quot;watching his dad have his turn to cry&rdquo;&hellip; I felt that one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God take us back to the 90s this new era sucks and it‚Äôs depressing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God Bless Sandman an R.I.P our  friend Chris Farley.. I miss him so much, Sandler did the best tribute, I love this 100%, an I tear up every time I watch this, I seen you in concert, it was the best I&rsquo;ll never forget, Thanks again Sandman, much love always brother !!

<p>#If we make enough noise maybe he will hear us !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine how many times sandler had to have performed this song alone in his basement before he could get through the whole song without stopping to cry. I bet 30-50 times. I&rsquo;m sure he had to have practiced it a lot before he could perform it and hold himself together at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aspire to be the friend someone sings about this way one day&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Hey buddy, life&rsquo;s moved on but you still bring us so much joy&rdquo;. My heart swells with that one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like at 4:46 he was supposed to come back in with ‚ÄúThats the truth about my boy Chris Farley‚Äù but he just couldn‚Äôt build up the strength to do it. You could see it in his face, so sad to see him like that for someone so loved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought I was gonna laugh, ended up crying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A friendship so strong that 25 years later he still thinks about him and tells his kids how great he was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler is that friend who makes you a sandwich right out of the blue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine how many times it took him to sing this song without breaking down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for the kids from this generation who don&rsquo;t even know who Chris Farley is. So sad&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thinkin about Chris Farley&rsquo;s dad crying made me tear up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farley&rsquo;s not dead, Hes living in a van down by the river in our hearts.üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After seeing this, Adam Sandler may go down as one of the most underrated multi talented people to exist in Show Business Music or Show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only word that exists that can describe this is admirable!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I drive past Adam Sandler‚Äôs house pretty much everyday to see my girlfriend. I‚Äôm used to it now, but seeing him perform in front of a crowd is kind of surreal. It‚Äôs crazy to think he‚Äôs just a normal guy at heart and he‚Äôs grieving over the loss of a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sandler killed this entire special he‚Äôs truly back he finally gets the respect he deserves one of the best to do it and this special just proves my point</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The saddest thing about Farely is that he never really knew how much he meant to people. I remember hearing a story about someone telling him he was one of the funniest comedians they had ever seen and he replied with something along the lines of &ldquo;in the end they just wanna see the fat guy fall down.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You meant the world to a lot of people Mr.Farley, I hope you get to see that now wherever you are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not gonna lie, this made me cry river despite not knowing Chris Farley till now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can only imagine the goosebumps he got when the crowd cheered after the name drop. Check in on your friends who always make everyone laugh. You reaching out could save someone.

<p>He said Chris&rsquo;d end up like Belushi and Candy&hellip;now he gets to party with them for all eternity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keano Reeves was asked what happens after you die. He said &ldquo;I know the people who loved them will miss them dearly.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was really something special, Chris Farley was a big part of my childhood no matter what movie or skit on snl he would always make me laugh. Even though I didn&rsquo;t personally know Chris at all  the impact he had in my life makes me feel as though I had. What Sandler did here was a wonderful thing for his friend and after so many years Chris is still making everyone laugh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a legend like you wanted but I still wish you were here with me&rdquo; I really felt that shit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With everything that came out that year this was still the best thing in all of 2018! The true definitive masterpiece of that year!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Probably watched this 50x now. Gets more emotional every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine how much of an imprint Chris Farley had to have left on Sandler. They&rsquo;re friendship was cut so short, but you can tell he still even now misses his friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When i listening to this i want cry, cause i wish had friends, that once i passed away still remember me ü•∫ü•∫ this quarantine make you think a lot negative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never thought Adam Sandler would bring tears to my eyes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He‚Äôs come a long way from the billy goat in the back of the pickup truck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the beginning when he says &ldquo;It means a lot to us.&rdquo; Sandler expresses that Farley wasn&rsquo;t just his family friend even though Adam is performing the song. He&rsquo;s including all thee friends&rsquo;, family, the fans&rsquo;, etc. He&rsquo;s so humble. Mr. Sandler changed money, money didn&rsquo;t change him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never watched Farley. I&rsquo;m a 20 year old brazilian who got into american comedy about 5 years ago. I&rsquo;ve seen this video around 10 times, now. Yet I can&rsquo;t help but cry heavily every single time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was the standing ovation Chris Farley deserved ! Here‚Äôs to you Chris üç∫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope Chris Farley knows how many people still think of him and love him üò≠ü¶ãüíò</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apparently 1.2K dislikes have no idea what having friends is all about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guitar solo is actually insane. High level skill. I enjoy every bit of this, a true tribute to a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We lost some legends Farley William&rsquo;s gone before their time that cant ever be replaced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not crying, You&rsquo;re Crying!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, what a gem. Sandler is a true friend, 100 percent all the way. Hell, even his guitar licks are spot on. He found peace, may everyone else to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúAnd we were getting on a plane to go shoot Grown Ups 3‚Äù

<li>
<p>Gets me everytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Greatest f‚Äôing tribute to a buddy EVER!  Thanks Adam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never thought I would see the day where Adam Sandler would sing a song that would bring me to tears!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give it up for a friend, our brother, Chris Farley. Rest in peace Tommy boy‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP to the GOAT. You‚Äôll always be remembered&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surprisingly perfect heartfelt guitar solo and everything: best tribute ‚Äúbit‚Äù I‚Äôve ever seen by a comedian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s amazing how sandler, spade, rock and farley stayed friends after snl and supported each other on the big screen. that was true friendship especially in hollyweird where everybody backstabs each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it‚Äôs amazing to see that he still thinks of Chris Farley and misses him truly. Really showing they had a true friendship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got goosebumps when Farleys face came out on the screen. That‚Äôs how you know he‚Äôs still with us in spirit. Miss him and his movies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you Adam, and thank you Chris, for everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gibson stral and Strat guitar, thats really bother me&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Slow down, you&rsquo;ll end up like Belushi and Candy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those guys are my heroes, that&rsquo;s all fine and dandy.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine how much cooler the grown ups movies woulda been if chris Farley was in em instead of Kevin James. Gaah. I love me some Doug heffernan but Tommy boy. Geez</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a beautiful song, idc what anyone has to say about if he‚Äôs off beat, the shit he‚Äôs saying he really means and really feels to this day. Nothing compares to the raw emotion in those lyrics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we just take a moment and admit that Adam Sandler is a very underrated guitar player</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We should all be so lucky to have a friend do something this special for us if we passed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even while killin it during his solo you can tell Adam is still feeling every chord and on the verge of tears. That&rsquo;s a real friendship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With everyone that has been taken far too early from us, icons in such a short time, I really really hope Sandler lives to be 110 so i can die before him. I don‚Äôt want to live in a world without Sandler.

<p>This is July 2020, I&rsquo;m still bawling to this song! even harder than the previous times..  Adam, thank you for being the best comedian, a beautiful soul and a comfort place for many of us!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he talked about Chris crying over his dad. You knew he had depression. His masked life have given everyone laughter. Made sure everyone was happy. He like Robin Williams etc. We&rsquo;re deep down very sad people&hellip; Hurts the heart</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:42 damn that line really messed me up like I legit balled like a baby thinking about how his father had to bury his son smh. The saying always rings true ‚Äúa parent isn‚Äôt suppose to bury their child‚Äù and for his son to go out this way had to be excruciatingly painful. I remember seeing Farleys death photo and thinking to myself man it‚Äôs going to really hurt his family and real friends to see his final moments a lone like this, dead without a real friend near üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did I really just cry from an Adam Sandler song, man I&rsquo;m getting soft.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R.I.P. Big Man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you lost a close friend that you consider your brother you know how he feels. Loyalty and friendship never ends in death if your a real one you carry on protect and honor the memories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This song makes me want to be a better person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I get confused between Chris Farley &amp; John Candy ü•¥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idk why I watch this everytime I see it. Cry every damn time lol. R.I.P. Farley</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much better would Paul Blart have been if Chris Farley was cast in the lead role?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sandler loved that guy. Great to have that once in a lifetime friend. The kind your write songs about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I miss chris farley!!! He was the shit!!! My favorite movie is Tommy Boy!!!! üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler nailed it!! I love this song! I cried so hard when I heard of Chris s passing! All the great ones go way too soon!üôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôve seen this numerous times but every time he says it was his dads turn to cry I roll tears for the rest of the song.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a great song and tribute to a friend. I seen his live show and like this video still draws the same amount of emotion and cheer from everyone in the crowd..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great friend to do something like that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We said, ‚Äúslow down, you‚Äôll end up like Belushi and Candy‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>He said, ‚Äúthose guys are my heroes, that‚Äôs all fine and dandy‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg I literally cried so hard listening to this. Like damn he had and well has such a profound impression left in us who grew up watch him and sandler. My heart goes out to him and his family. Just know he&rsquo;s left a great impact on my generation.

<p>Wow that was amazing and watching Adam play and sing along to a song he made fucken blew me away well done mate big respect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Chris was the oneü§òWe all miss him a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can have your opinion and perspective of Adam Sandler, but he is a humble and grounded person with many talents and always a good heart. More from him and less from other &ldquo;trumps&rdquo; üé∏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chris: hey Adam,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam:yeah?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chris: re-remeber when u made the tribute for me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam: yeah</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More like Adam Shredler&hellip;. He can still rip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;except watching Chris&rsquo; father have his turn to cry&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>gets me every time..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The expression of grief on his face at 3:03 is absolutely heartrending&hellip;   üò¢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching this while having breakfast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My fried rice got very salty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ADAM SANDLER HAS IT ALL.HIS HUMBLE HUMMAN BEING.100% KEEPING IT REAL.PEACE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i wish so badly that he was still here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:37 Chris&rsquo;s gorgeous Victorias Secret model girlfriend. Remember the chick at the pool in Tommy Boy who dives in naked? Yeah, that was his real life chick. Surprised? I&rsquo;m not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be honest contrary to mr sandlers words this was ‚Äúveyi neice‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Except watching Chris&rsquo;s father have his turn to cry&rdquo; hits me so hard. Everytime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They need to do a tribute for him in grown-ups three at the end. Have them all go to his cemetery and stand around his actual grave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grew up watching Chris&rsquo; films and on SNL. Loved him so much, Tommy Boy and Black Sheep will always be my favorite comedies and overall movies in general. RIP Chris, you are loved and missed. If he were still here he would of had so many more hits. Havin one in your memory tonight.

<p>Not even death could break the deep bonds of love and friendship they both shared. RIP, Chris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes I feel like theres something wrong with me like I cant cry, I lost one of my best friends 2 years ago and it took me 2 days to finally break down, But this made me choke up, The part of Farleys dad having his turn to cry made it more so</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im crying for missing a man that died before i was even born, thats how awesome Chris was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like Adam Sandler but I decided to try harder after this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tommy Boy was my favorite Chris Farley movie R.I.P to the legend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epic&hellip;..just epic&hellip;&hellip;like a great marital artist once said, &ldquo;finding an opponent as equal as you, is as rare as finding a best friend&rdquo; Ip Man from The Grandmaster. Thanks again chris you surely continue to make peoples day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This guy was a legend around Madison even when he was &ldquo;hollywood&rdquo;.  Madison misses you Chris.  I remember seeing him at church in Westport when I was a little kid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Sandler&rsquo;s performance is about a man missing the shit out of his brother. This is one of the handful of heartbreaks that makes a grown man cry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was and still am a big Chris Farley fan. I can remember where I was when I heard he died :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just awesome what a great tribute thinking about this kinda goes hand in hand with how we should just be lucky that for the most part in this life we should just be more happier in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No phones out just everyone taking in one of the most versatile celebrities ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man, I grew up watching Sandler and Farley.. I remember not even knowing how Chris Farley died.. over 20 years ago..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes a good comedian to make you laugh but it takes a greater one to make you cry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he says we watched as his dad had his turn to cry&hellip;&hellip;I&rsquo;m cutting onions</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly, if you can afford to see Sandlers show live, one of the greatest shows of my life. This song gives chills live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Chris&rsquo;s face fades in and you see that big smile of his and just wonder what could have been and you bawl your eyes out thinking you could have done something to help him

<p>I live in Madison wi and i every now and again i visit his grave and i i just have a beer thank you chris  for your presents on earth man ‚ù§Ô∏è you made my childhood worth living</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chris: Re-re-remember when you sang that tribute to me?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Adam: yes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sandler is legit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll never forget the day the news said chris passed&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I was 11 n my dad just got our first computer so I was in the dining room messing around with it and heard &ldquo;actor, comedian Chris Farley passed away sometime ba ba ba ba&rdquo; it was like losing a brother I&rsquo;ll never forget that moment in time. Rest in peace bro&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This whole special is a masterpiece. Adam Sandler is awesome. Glad to have grown up with him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every day I think of Chris Farley. I couldn&rsquo;t even imagine what it was like to be his actual friend. I wish he was still here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He says the funniest person he ever knew &ldquo;is you,&rdquo; and not &ldquo;was you.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how you know how much he misses him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He may have been Belushi‚Äôs lovely spawn in a way, but I think guys like Kevin James and Jack Black owe their fame and style to Chris more than Belushi. He was a box of dynamite contained inside a lovable fluffy guy who can light up a room and make everything a party just by showing up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That bit about his father crying hit hard, man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro everytime I hear this I shed tears R.I.P fat man in a little coat. Taken way to soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how Sandler made it through this song without crying.  I&rsquo;m crying.

<li>
<p>Legends never die. They live forever in our minds, in our hearts, and in a van down by the river.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man is worth $400,000,000 yet we can still see his true emotion and love for what he does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man this gets me everytime. Adam, you are such a sweet sweet man and I&rsquo;ve always loved you for that. Chris was too funny to even try to describe in a way that does him any justice (Adam did a wonderful job trying with this tribute), but beyond that, Chris was as friendly and deeply caring as anyone you&rsquo;d ever meet. He truly loved his family and friends so much so that he would often talk about them when he was on talk shows, because that was what he really cared about and what he had on his mind. He started crying listening to KC and the Sunshine Band because it reminded him how much he loved his old man. It&rsquo;s so beautiful, but ultimately heart breaking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the best thing Adam Sandler has ever done. Almost bring a tear to my eye.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can remember 2 or 3 times in life where I‚Äôve laughed so hard I‚Äôve fallen out of the couch, and one of those times were in Blacksheep when Chris Farley fell down that hill. üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say whatever hell you want about adam sandler but he is loyal to his friends and a great guy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This just goes to show that Adam Sandler gave up a successful music career as sacrifice to entertain our ingrate ƒÅsses&hellip; ‚ù§Ô∏è I&rsquo;ve ALWAYS had a deep appreciation for these two great comedians. RIP Chris Farley! And Adam, Don&rsquo;t you dare leave us anytime soon! We need miracle workers like you!‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saddest part ‚Äú His dads turn to cry‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Sandler you have to do a Tommy Boy 2. You have to be the child of.. everyone&rsquo;s favourite comedian Chris Farley</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandlers not just a comedian, he got love, heart, soul &amp; can sing. Favorite actor besides Paul Walker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m 56. I&rsquo;ve listened to this song 100 times and I still get emotional. Wisdom always brings clarity.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>On a side note, who knew Sandler could shred like that???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing was harder than saying goodbye except for watching Chris&rsquo;s father have his turn to cry.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I burst into tears every time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam sandler has, and forever will be a legend. Just so wholesome and down to earth and the fact he is still shouting out to his boy so many years later shows it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúGrown ups threeeeeeee&hellip;&hellip;.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the dopest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard period</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d tell him slow down or you&rsquo;ll end up like Belushi and Candy. He said those guys are my heroes. That&rsquo;s all fine and dandy.&rdquo;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Chills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How that place didn&rsquo;t become a swimming pool that night I&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is probably the sweetest tribute I&rsquo;ve ever seen for a friend! We all miss him!! He was a legend!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching this makes me realize that the older I get the more I realize I always pictured myself as Chris Farley but I&rsquo;m slowly turning into Adam Sandler</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs sad because you can see how much he really misses his friend üíî</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can‚Äôt imagine the pain Adam went through losing Chris. He still loves and misses his friend dearly and was robbed of the privilege of growing old with him. You never get over the death of your best friend. You just get better at dealing with the pain over the years. God bless Sandler. He‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but he‚Äôs a man that loves and loves hard with all of his heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dem guys r my heroes, that shit brought a tear to my eye!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That needed to be sung for a long time ,great job by Sandler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the f*** do you follow this, YouTube?  &gt;April, 2020 - still heard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;A few months later the party came to an end, we flew down to Madison to bury our friend&rdquo; Saddest line in the entire song.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes I forget that Adam Sandler is a legitimately good guitar player.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>That was a fantastic tribute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Man&hellip;Even a year and a half later this song still gets me.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>It really runs that gambit. I&rsquo;d put it up against any song. I don&rsquo;t know of many songs that could make you feel all of the emotions in the book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tenacious D is epitome of songs like this., Look up &ldquo;Dude I Really Miss You&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>black sheep and tommy boy were my all time favs as a kid, same with all of Sandlers early work.  These guys are awesome and value friendship.  RIP tommy boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dam anyone else get a little bit choked up listening to this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I used to work for a flower shop, Choles Flowers, in Madison, WI where I went to school 5 years ago. His mom would still order flowers for him all the time to put on his grave.

<p>I think Adam died inside seeing his best friends die all around him..I watch Farley movie&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m around family and someone always cries because he&rsquo;s gone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who just watched Uncut Gems in 2020?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Farley would be so proud of his friend Adam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an alternative universe, Farley, Belushi and Candy are all alive and well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can hate Sandler and his movies all you want, but you can&rsquo;t deny this man has talent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could you imagine if Farley was in grown ups with the rest of those guys?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this in my cue for a long time, avoiding it because I knew it would be tough, but keeping it because I knew it would be great.  Great tribute, Mr. Sandler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who would have thought one of the most cathartic guitar solos ever recorded would come from Adam Sandler?  You can feel that in your soul&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I lost my best friend 2 days ago and I am turning to music to help me during this time.  This song is just great and as a musician it inspires me to right a song for my friend.  Thank you Adam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instant tears. RIP Chris Farley. Hope the other side is treating you well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a chris. Farley fan but my parents are.  He would make them laugh every time they watched SNL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Grown Ups 3 line always kills my heart üò©üò©üò©</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm sure Chris had a big smile looking down at Adam playing the song. RIP Farley üôèüèºüôèüèº</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Chris Farley was alive today we wouldn&rsquo;t have this awesome song! Thank you Chris for making that great sacrifice&hellip;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m proud to admit I was birthed the day he died, it&rsquo;s the only reason I ever gave reincarnation a second thought.</p>

<p>I was there for it live in Charlotte&hellip;very funny and moving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly one of the best tributes ever given to anyone. Such heartfelt. You could see the pain he was feeling. Some wounds time can never heal&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adam Sandler just made me cry.. I didn&rsquo;t think I would ever say those words</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm a huge fan of Adam Sandler and Chris Farley has been my hero since I saw tommy boy with dad when I was a kid. I didn‚Äôt find out Chris Farley passed until I was 10 years old (2004). Went to my room and cried</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storytelling of this is really great! üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;TOUGH TIMES DON&rsquo;T LAST, BUT TOUGH PEOPLE DO&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to feel hopeful after a games flex&hellip; I&rsquo;ll take it :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The line ‚ÄúHey Buddy, Life‚Äôs moved on but you still bring us so much joy‚Äù  is so beautiful.  What a tribute to a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:30 Hit with ‚ÄúFeeeeels‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The part when he says Belushi and candy i teared up its weird candy Belushi fat died of drugs in his prime john candy idol was belushi was over weight and died the same way then Farley idolized both and died the same way as both did drugs and in his prime so sad those stars light went out to soon rip to all 3 of my favorite comedians</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hear this song at work every now and again.  Always makes me a little sad. We‚Äôve all lost someone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine Chris Farley in the Grown Ups series as Kevin James‚Äô character. No shame to Kevin James, he is a good actor and he‚Äôs pretty funny, but let‚Äôs all be honest: Chris Farley would‚Äôve made those movies 100x‚Äôs funnier (and they were pretty funny themselves)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace Chris Farley</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The great white ninja</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tommy boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And our childhood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By far the coolest thing sandler has ever done. Rip mr farley.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every ones in a while, amidst all of the random noise and cannon fodder, there‚Äôs a special thing that makes a dent in the fabric of time - Elvis, The Beatles, Muhammad Ali&hellip;  This moment in time is one of those dents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Chris Farley he was so amazing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no affence to kevin james but it would have been really good with chris farley in grown ups three
