<p>RBG was a true trailblazer and such an amazing woman and human being üíú</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Ruth Bader Ginsberg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in grace &hellip;. Queen Justice ‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m taking my 16 year old daughter to see her movie. She&rsquo;s a super hero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBG is amazing and inspiring! People can write all the misinformed hate messages they want but it will not change the truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GOD BLESS JUSTICE GINSBURG!!!!! We Can Only Hope To Get Someone Equally AS QUALIFIED And Equally AS EMPATHETIC!!! Not To Mention As DIGNIFIED And PROFESSIONAL!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She will make it.  She has made every goal and will go out on top.  Amazing woman who destroyed the glass ceiling in a decadent manor.  She will show what a determined human can accomplish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She will be missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love RBG! I didn&rsquo;t know much about her until about a month ago, but she has become a role model for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought she would have moved to NZ when President Trump won the elections&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just want the chance of a one on one conversation with Justice RBG. THANK YOU! And that is not even enough. Whole bunch of idiots who‚Äôs opinions are baseless, please go do some reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBG, a. Gracious lady, we would do well with a lot more women just like you on the Supreme Court!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I appreciated the wise words of your Mother.  My Mother told me the same thing. so I would not be  dependent on a man.  I went to secretarial school and learned skills that I would use for many years working for lawyers, doctors, ect.  Both my parents were Polish.  When  the Nazi&rsquo;s marched into Poland, Mom was 11 and her education ended.  After the war, Mom worked in orphanages in Germany.  She learned English.  Canada wanted people with certain qualifications.  Mom was a nurses&rsquo; aid.  She worked at a Catholic hospital.  A year later, she met and married my Dad and produced my brother and me.  After that, my father proceeded to move us to a very small community in the mountains.  It  was 10 miles out of town and Mom didn&rsquo;t drive.  Mom was a city girl and this move made her feel trapped.  She was uneducated and no possibility of changing that.  Dad was a country boy and thought the move was perfect.  My Mom really instilled in me the importance of an education.  My Dad expected me to marry after high school and  produce grand children, but not my Mom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>she is such an intelectually and emotionally highly intelligent women - I love her!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a mind &amp; scrappy personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My favorite Justice &amp; an inspiration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go RBG!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My first encounter with this redoubtable person.  Inspiring.  The interviewer and audience were worthy of her too, which of course is good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alllllright. Who are the people that have the thumbs down?? Are you all jailbirds? Geesh. This was a wonderful interview. RBG truly is a woman to admire!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Funny that at 85 she is much more coherent and emotionally intelligent than the negative commenters here.

<p>RIP Ruth&hellip;Here comes Mccain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the only cnn video ive ever liked</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in Peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Madam Justice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP and thank you we have some dark days ahead&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBG inspire me everyday &hellip;.</p>

<li>
<p>Giving a practice exam always means ‚Äúyou have to sleep with me now‚Äù&hellip;&hellip; could it not mean ‚ÄúI have faith in you outside of your ignorance of chemistry labs‚Äù???? I fear her assumptions in uncertain meanings hamper her ability to interpret the constitution. I am a big RBG fan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBG was great. The interviewer wasn&rsquo;t. &ldquo;The Constitution doesn&rsquo;t speak to equality between women and men.&rdquo; Has she literally read any of RBG&rsquo;s opinions or dissents? Equal Protection has worked leaps and bounds for women&rsquo;s rights&hellip; and even Justice Kennedy read E.P. as protecting gay rights (Obergefell? What method of Constitutional interpretation is this interviewer using?). CAN YOU PLEASE UNDERSTAND POST SLAUGHTER-HOUSE SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS&hellip; gosh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rest in power rbg‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rip</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I LOVE RBG</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of us are happy  she is no longer with us because she did just the opposite then what this talking head is reading from a script. She gave her only softball questions. She knows nothing of what Ginsburg did on the bench. To start, should have been impeached long ago and removed from the bench for violating her oath of office when she said &ldquo;we should look to other countries constitutions for guidance.&rdquo; She forgot long ago that she was supposed to &ldquo;defend the Constitution of the United States.&rdquo; Not of China, Soviet Union or how about Cuba. Her ruling demonstrated a TOTAL disregard for the our Constitution and the form of government our founding fathers had created. She should have retired herself years abo when her brains started to fail her. For all we know her assistants wrote her decisions. At least God finally got ride of her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the song &ldquo;Notorious&rdquo;.It fits Justice Ginsburg perfectly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you, RBG. üñ§</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with her politically but I give her props for how long she&rsquo;s served on the court.If Trump gets another term I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll be replaced by another Gorsuch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest in peace justice. Rest in peace</p>

<p>From Justice Ginsburg&rsquo;s statements, the beginning was tough for female lawyers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General John Archer Lejeune / luh jern   (CMC XIII )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would be proud of this fine lady.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>President Clint in my opinion  did Make the best choice of his life electing Ginsburg for the SCOTUS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loved this!  I cant wait to see the CNN movie and the film her son made!  By the way the song at the beginning is by Duran Duran.

<p>Please listen to  what Justice Ginsberg  states beginning at 52:00</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is the real OG!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôll donate both my kidneys to her</p>

<p>RIP superwoman</p>

<p>Socorro, alguem legenda pro portugues isso&hellip;</p>

<p>One incredible woman.  üòä. While the Russian bots have obviously raided these comments with gusto;  know this incredible Supreme Court Judge has more intelligence, compassion and common sense than all of the derogatory commenters multiplied exponentially.  #RESPECT This woman will be fighting for justice and equality for ALL,  while your petty trolls scream ‚Äúretire‚Äù and ‚ÄúJew‚Äù.  One of my closest friends, a Christian Conservative, proudly displays a large portrait and signed book by Justice Ginsberg on her mantel.  Sorry trolls;  you‚Äôre outnumbered!  (Which will be easily proven this Nov. üòÅ)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facebook, Google and next will be CNN. You dig your own hole dudes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like her a lot, she seems like pop culture figure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A woman to be reckoned with. Brilliant, strong, brave, persistent, beautiful, compassionate, humorous, distinguished and memorable warrior. There&rsquo;s a special place in Heaven for people like her. Bless you Ruth. May you stay with us for many more years ‚ô•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hats off to Poppy Harlow too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please don‚Äôt retire anytime soon. We love you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have always adored this woman! She has paved the way for many of us, when I was in Law school I patterned myself after her. She is a true model for women who wish to be seen as strong, intelligent and courageous like her!! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t age well &hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caution:  Vultures below, spreading toxins and looking for morsels to feed their black souls!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incredible and inspiring woman‚ù§</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBG. GOOD FOR YOU&hellip;.. Now get off the Supreme Court and give that seat up to someone who is not politically biased!!!

</li>
<li>
<p>Putting faith in the millennials speaks volumes about her intellect and instinct. She is dead wrong about that on a multitude of levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the woman who wants the age of consent to be 12 years old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sad, the Supreme Court has never been more partisan or more politicized than it is right now.  weaponized intelligence services and a partisan court system.  we&rsquo;re doomed.</p>
</li>

<p>RIP. 1933 -2019.</p>

<li>
<p>She was good, now she is in need of Obama‚Äôs healthcare‚Äî- Barry elevated hospice‚Äî- barry loved hospice for people like her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please note, when RBG makes the comment on kneeling players she later stated in her 92nd Street Y interview with Charlie Rose she has no idea there were actual players taking a knee. She thought this was a hypothetical question. She told Charlie Rose she never would have said what she said had she known of Colin Kapernick and/or of the fact players were taking a knee during the national anthem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RBG is incredibly inspiring! I truly enjoyed watching this interview!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An amazing and inspiring woman that was so instrumental in helping women to achieve equality and fair wages. She is very thoughtful and measured in her responses to questions.  I highly recommend the movie RBG about her life to truly understand her achievements. The haters and anti-semites in this thread are ignorant trolls with no historical perspective and live by Trumps sound bite tweets. Neanderthals with pea brains and no substance.</p>

<p>The tide is turning folks. You can fight it if you want but it won&rsquo;t do you any good. In the words of Gil Scott-Heron, the revolution will be live. The world has changed this much already, why should we have any reason to believe that we&rsquo;re going to somehow regress? There&rsquo;s only one way for our society to go, and that&rsquo;s forward. I&rsquo;m sorry the future ain&rsquo;t going to be what you want it to be.</p>

<li>
<p>nice.</p>

<p>She stated, @ 11:28, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been very hard even to keep the government going lately.&rdquo; And the idiots in the audience laughed. It&rsquo;s not a comedy performance. Ugh!</p>

<p>RIP!! Best Supreme court justice EVER!!!  WHAT AN AMAZING WOMEN!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We often hear people compliment how smart she is and I agree.  I think equally important is her patience. She did some essential work at the beginning of her career that laid the foundation for equality. We have the Justices on the right who would like to interpret The Consitution based of what they meant when they wrote it 200 years ago, and you have the Justices on the left who believe we should interpret The Consitution based on the world as it is today.</p>

<p>It is disturbing to see so many anti-Semitic comments in this thread. Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Muslim - it really doesn&rsquo;t matter how you define your invisible friend so long as you don&rsquo;t use it to claim a right to hurt anyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The interviewer is excellent - pointed and intelligent questions and time allowed to answer tem. Most of your other cable anchors should learn from her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the court is politically involved in statements about a political race, hmmmm interesting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank you to your mother teaching you how to be independent, and don&rsquo;t let emotions&mdash;anger overtake you. Women need to hear this! We all can think independently, some of us are liberal and some are conservative. Why if we are conservative are we not allowed to think independently?</p>

<p>so just where did Justice Ginsberg come up with the idea that the US should bow it international law and that it should override the US Constitution?  was this country founded so it could follow international law?</p>

<p>I respect Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but the interviewer sounds too forced and brutish in the way she is asking questions to Ms. Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The interviewer sounds so intent on getting her message and prepared message spread through the answers from Ms. Ruth Bader Ginsburg - it would have been nicer if the interviewer had simply let Justice tell her story without making it sound like an interrogation and a performance. Don&rsquo;t like the interviewer&rsquo;s style at all.</p>
</li>

<p>Time to go.just saw her last interview she done</p>

<p>In the German Constitution (Basic Law, GG), Article 3 in its first ¬ß says that all humans are equal before the law and then goes on in ¬ß 2 that men and women have equal rights and that the government has the duty to ensure that this is enforced. Then ¬ß 3 prohibits discrimination based on gender, birth, race, language, home, religious faith, political views and disability.</p>

<p>Buzzfeed reporting RBG in medically induced coma. It&rsquo;s Buzzfeed, so it must be true.  Dems in high gear to speed up impeachment.  Goal is to get both President Trump and Vice President Pence, install Pelosi as President, she will then pick Hillary as new Vice President, and will then step aside making Hillary President.  Hillary will then chose Schumer as Vice Predident.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>More of an idealogue than a true justice. She tries to impose her world view on the public rather than let the legislature do their job by amending the constitution. She thinks she decides what the constitution means to her emotional state at that moment. Seems a bit authoritarian to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LET GOD TAKE HER OUT. KENNEDY RETIRING. Trump 2 in 2 years, Obama zero (0) in 8, Right On!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when I first seen this video the title was missing other than her name so at first I thought she passed away and thought Oh I guess Trump gets another Supreme Court nominee which since I&rsquo;m a Libertarian really depends whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or not. If it&rsquo;s a really good thing would be to try to pull up a case to have the Supreme Court rule that the National Firearms Act is unconstitutional and get rid of it that would be awesome but there&rsquo;s other bad things that could be done with a overwhelming conservative Supreme Court. Anybody remember when it didn&rsquo;t really matter what their political leanings were, back in the day the Supreme Court would rule if something was constitutional or not based on the Constitution and what the founders thought, not what they thank and what they believe in political wise. I&rsquo;ve seen some things come up to the Supreme Court in the last eight years that should have been unanimous one way or the other that it was as bright as day that it was unconstitutional or constitutional yet instead of upholding the Constitution the way they and our members of Congress are supposed to do they just vote on party lines.

<p>Should have retired during Obama&rsquo;s Term but U were selfish! No longer will they have to do Weekend At Gingsburg!! She was against women&rsquo;s rights to choose!!</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Q:  Why is she named &ldquo;Ruth Bader Ginsburg&rdquo;?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A:  Because &ldquo;Death Warmed Over&rdquo; was already taken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope she stay 8 years more&hellip;. she is brilliant!!!!! I hope next one will be afroamerican woman ‚úäüèø</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was worth every second of watching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how all the below comments center on bi-partisan, races and calling each other  names.  As Justice Ginsburg mentioned @ 20.15 about her earlier experience with discrimination : first , she was Jewish, second, she was a woman but biggest obstacle of all, is that she had a 4 years old daughter, then.  Who, as a human, doesn&rsquo;t have any relational experience  with having offspring, yourself or your loved ones?  Either your own, your spouse, your siblings?  We&rsquo;re humans first, then all the gender, race, ethnic, religious boxes we arbitrarily put on ourselves.  Wake up to the luminous 21 century, especially on this   platform!  T4P.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ginsburg loves Mexico more than America. Democrats have greater loyalty to Mexico and want give Mexico California and New Mexico.  That is why they want illegals counted in census.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hillary‚Äôs secret deal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love her &hellip;recognized notorious BIG hahaha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t like the interviewer. sorry</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Ruth and Hillary are past there prime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long live RBG!‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° Thank you for all you do!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why does the court allow presidents to pass laws that are unconstitutional? example: the patriot act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell me what kind of a supreme court judge publicly calls for a president too recuse himself of all of his duties and responsibilities. Is she a judge or an activist?Obviously not fit for office..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder who she&rsquo;ll soon be replaced with?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Chris Cuomo is the only lover she had in her life</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>

<p>Pleas tell me she&rsquo;s ready to retire?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the life of me, I dom&rsquo;t understand how someone would go through all the extremely difficult efforts studying law and rising to become a judge, only to back-paddle into becoming a member of the deep state and their globalist agenda. It&rsquo;s a terrible thing to see justice bent to the will of the enemy, knowing there will be no fair ruling in this judge&rsquo;s court.</p>
</li>

<p>Look how they all worship her! It is so ironic. She recommends the consensual age be 12 years old. I can&rsquo;t imagine my little girl being 12 years old and being hurt by an adult and not being able to prosecute the adult. This is pedophilia Ruth Bader Ginsburg supports this please investigate these facts for yourself and be careful who you support politically.</p>
