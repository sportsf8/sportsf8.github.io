<p>This is just a tip of the iceberg. Many charity organisations are failing the people they claim to support through funds misappropriation, exploitation and abuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most charities are fake.. they are set up to make money without paying taxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is horrible and really painful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s a hard pill to swallow, but we must firmly hold these people accountable for endangering children. I&rsquo;m especially upset because the organization takes funds from the Muslim community only to turn around and do this evil to vulnerable and innocent children. Astafarallah, may Allah be swift in punishment against these sick individuals. Once a charity has been exposed more than once, never again trust them brothers and sisters. Demand justice even if it is against yourselves, that is our way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone wants easy MONEY!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t even know why these folks are even allowed into the African nations, like why are they so trusting of foreigners.</p>
</li>

<p>Who have been watching TRT World for more than a year?😀❤️</p>

<p>mafia officials involved - corrupt system of perverts 😭👀</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AT LEAST SOME ONE IS DOING SOMETHING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor kids. It is immoral to reproduce kids since there are already millions of orphan kids available for adoption worldwide. Also since you can&rsquo;t get the consent of a child to be born in this cruel world. Nobody chose to come into existence. Rather, we were all forced into the unfortunate state of existence without our consent to have to endure all the pain and suffering that comes with it. Had we never existed we’d have never suffered.~</p>

<p>Those who are being unjust in any way to the orphans&hellip;. Mighty wrath is destined upon you both in this world and in the hereafter&hellip; Never ever deal with orphan matters unless you are just in yor dealing.</p>

<p>ya şu insanları bir rahat bıraksın İngiltere  işiniz mi yok anlamıyorum yani bari çocuklara dokunmayın.</p>

<li>
<p>Nasty story. And charity as Penny Appeal have been nasty in the charity sector many many times&hellip;. is it time to challenge the appalling conduct of Penny Appeal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart is breaking for the children. Never heard of this charity. Children back with their guardians and are safe, why take them in the first place. Give them a school and food and let them go back home with a food package for their family. This is sad to hear 😢</p>

<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad..</p>
</li>

<p>SubhanAllah SubhanAllah Astaghfirullah this is so devastating. May Allah give justice and ease and good health, treatment and living homes to these children 💔🤲🏼 and May Allah bring the full weight of justice down on the heads of anyone responsible for hurting them

<p>Thank you for exposing this.  Countries need to be judged on how it treats it&rsquo;s most vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>02:31 why are so little girls already wearing the hijab? These are children. That is wrong and has nothing to do with religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of this appeal founded by Christians is not for charity at all they are used to spread Christianity amongst the poor people who are not Christians using money and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to be a parent then the only moral thing to do would be to adopt a child from an orphanage. Don&rsquo;t reproduce biological children. There are millions of orphan children around the world available for adoption.</p>

<p>I hope people don’t hate penny appeal as these folks do a great job. Many charity organisations fall in this issues. They were one of many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Penny appeal just like Al Jazeera is a fake Muslim organization run by Hindu nationalists pretending to be Muslims.  Notice they both use the color orange extensively in their branding.</p>
