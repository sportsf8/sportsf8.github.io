<p>Good commentary, when this woman was being given the job, a past DPP said  she wasn&rsquo;t suitable and he was so right!!  Bias , but they have to reappoint her because it suit dem cause. Brilliant people are there to fill the post, what sort of brilliance she have so?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>same suh lonesome. she is a wicked woman.her brother was the one that bignol put the thousand  dollars in the ticket book and vaz and james forbes was in court  along with bignol. well you know forbs lost his high ranking police job. possible commish</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Straight talk Mr Lonesome too much corruption in the government system &hellip;&hellip; People need to be held accountable  Jamaica needs a change too much of the same scrip different cast thing üî•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayne the one piece a pineapple me have in a the fridge,  u mek me spit out.  Weh u seh the soldier dem waaant,  lampile ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ian&rsquo;s daughter is now a Parish judge since 2016; üòÅ She&rsquo;s been DPP since 2008üòÅüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just tell her pack up its time to &ldquo;Go&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My brother Wayne.. I wonder if these ppl really listening to you.  We need to join hands and put more pressure on them.. I voted for Andrew Holness and thought he would be new and different he&rsquo;s in for the same foolishness&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who made the recommendation to the governor General in 2008 for her to become DPP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wayne, tell the people to create a petition to get a referendum added to the next general election to have the Public Prosecutor elected on a ballot. Requirements are just like a candidacy except no party affiliation.  Let the people decide. Everything you said was absolutely true and correct. Analysis and all. Keep up the good work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leave under investigation straight to truth &amp; rightz results&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk you talk stand up for Jamaica we need a change&hellip;.not from p n p  to j l p or visa versa  change in the system  &hellip;The system don&rsquo;t work for the masses of the people&hellip;..nuff strength to you mr lonesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem also  in the tourist industry at certain age needs to go old men still driving juta and other transport need to go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree with you 100% but it comes towhat would be the effect if Andrew is booted out or want to extend his stay when it&rsquo;s time is OpenOffice how does work. They need to go in the pasture and eat grass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree totally I believe she should be elected by the people are any DPP should be elected by voting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50 years in prison for criminal police</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pore people no have no talk in a Jamaica</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Different dpp rightnow!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yea she need to go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jamaica justice system need  checking out. How can you convict an accuse base upon the testimony of one convicted criminal.  That&rsquo;s. not credible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a resident of the UK and left Jamaica 44 years ago age 16. Wayne we need more people with your passion for change in Jamaica. I live in a foreign land and Jamaica my native country has become even more foreign and alienating  from the wickedness and wrong doings of its professionals like the politicians and justice systems, that continuously fail in their purpose by complimenting the criminal mastermind of so called politicians and professionals appointed to serve, protect the cultures,  values of Jamaica and its citizens. Truth, rights and Justice must come. Keep going Wayne, no compromise until the weeding out of those referred to here out is finally accomplished.
