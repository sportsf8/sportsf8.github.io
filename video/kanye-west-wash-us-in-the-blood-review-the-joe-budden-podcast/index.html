<ul>
<li>
<p>Joe just hatin cause Kanye got the courage to be 100% crazy.  Joe only willing to go 53% crazy. 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and yall try to act like joe aint a kanye hater lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I almost always disagree with Joe&rsquo;s opinion on Ye but I like that he admits Ye is a creative genius</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can’t lie this song bangs hard. Can pass on Jesus is King but this feels like old Kanye back on his bullshit sort of stuff. Beat is absolutely outrageous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol Mal acting like this but wasn&rsquo;t he at Sunday Service a few months back?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mal can’t even hate lowkey like the rest of em 🥱</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Kanye is 🔥🔥🔥 give it another spin yall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah these guys hating they know exactly what the lyrics mean, they just don&rsquo;t want to except it. LMAO 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mal comes off hating right off the bat when the video starts lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If anything’s whack about this it’s Travis Scott’s verse. These dudes are critiquing the music instead of FEELING IT. In the club this shit gon go CRAZY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus is King is honestly an interesting album when you dig deep into it. The loose concept really makes you look at it differently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont know why they keep reviewing Kanye if they know they&rsquo;ll just hate on it lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strongly disagreed with their opinion on this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We were waiting for the Dr Dre and Timbaland album</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just realized they all got the same type of facial hair, lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>anyone else notice the dog at 4:45 giving a standing ovation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The video is about current events and how chaotic the world is in these times. There are things in this video that are over people&rsquo;s heads because they&rsquo;re not mainstream media/news. You&rsquo;d have to be a truth seeker to really know what&rsquo;s going on in this video. He&rsquo;s trying to open you&rsquo;re eyes to things that are not surface level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Way over there heads&hellip; smh. If it was Drake they would&rsquo;ve been on his nuts💯%. Damn then had the nerve to speak about J.Cole not supporting another POC. Make it make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really going to just casually downplay this work of art, Kanye Is about to change music again

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when kanye thought it was a good idea to use the confederate flag on his clothing line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go look at my reaction to the video it’s better than Joes 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like Yeezus Gospel&rdquo; that sounds dope asf, shit was fire 2nd listen too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do they even let mal speak he’s so detrimental smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Ain’t nobody perfect&hellip;.. but that back stroke  I’m trying to perfect”. Aka, I don’t know, I don’t know, I just don’t know 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guess when God is involved&hellip; no one excepts the music.. but I think its a great holy song&hellip; something needed in the gospel world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought everyone was done with Kanye West including Joe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The video made me feel like it was trying to manipulate my mind so I never got through the video or song. Love Kanye but ima have to passs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah I’m not feeling their views on this. It sounds like they went in with walls up and didn’t give it a chance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this and his ty dolla signe single are great, ion know what they talking bout&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After listening to their reviews of music for a while, they really just sound like they like whatever shit comes up on their Spotify. I’m glad they acknowledge they don’t understand, and I’m not saying JIK was good, it wasn’t, but at least Kanye is bringing new shit to the table. Also WUITB has a 80/100 overall on aoty website, so it’s clearly very well received off the bat, unlike JIK. Mal and Rory can’t help themselves to say “yep back to drake” and actually digest anything, Christ. The video and song wasn’t even hard to understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“To the gap”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*Parks voice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤣🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why y&rsquo;all hating on the video it&rsquo;s quarantine time, unless we get some type of sexual content in these music videos like the Kelani x Teyana Taylor vids, we have all agreed that they have been trash bc they are limited due to the pandemic. don&rsquo;t move the goal post joe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had to go check if I believe them or you’s “they hating” and&hellip;. kanye dropped some trash. Straight ass!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Y’all keep calling it a joint project it’s a solo album by Kanye it’s not an album with dre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Been having this on repeat since it dropped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe you better be careful He gonna cast his magick spell on you 🧙🏿‍♀️🧹</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are they not intellectual enough to discuss Kanye, yet they’re music commentators ?

<p>4:48 Dog walking on 2&rsquo;s is the goat move of the night</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arthur Jafa did the video and it was everything it needed to be.  The fact they are talking about editing makes it clear that they completely missed the point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Song of the year, video is whatever it&rsquo;s not orginal content, he used one frame from Kendrick&rsquo;s &ldquo;Element&rdquo; video. Irroncly the cocnpet is similar to that kendrick video.</p>

<li>
<p>Mal ready to burst into tears at the mere mention of ye</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>He need to give us some more “Jesus Walks” type music</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>This whole panel is corny ✌🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe the FBA, Ados family needs you too help with the reperations conversation on your platform .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did they get a pet?😏😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the beat&hellip;.but I need kanye bars back!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To the gap 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Parks God bless you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe im praying for him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That song is video was super meh&hellip;.. Y&rsquo;all are capping saying the song is fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo real shit, y’all think that song is fire? I got a pretty decent palette for music but the word that comes to mind when I hear it is MID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its hard for them to accept Kanye as the G.O.A.T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe says Em is trash but says kayne is up with all these geniuses lmao w.e</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O THE BLOOD OF JESUS!!!!.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So who&rsquo;s voting for Kanye? 🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objectively speaking , the song was trash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe get rid of these fools you are with. Flaunting their ignorance with arrogance.  WTF!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m but yes the record has replay value. You’re insane if you’re not listening to this again and again. At this point it’s pure hate. If not the music then the message and if not the message then appreciate the fact the two GOATS got something together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love the track. Kanyes back stop the hate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe, you need some better cohorts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I heard the song its garbage just like the rest of kanye&rsquo;s gospel music</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cmon&hellip;That Kanye bangs..

<li>
<p>😂🤣 why they hate Kanye ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning to appreciate this one. Put Jesus is King in constant repeat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bizzle: The Messenger 4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a leak though</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanye 2020😁✊🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matthew 10 (NABRE)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>12 As you enter a house, wish it peace. 13 If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; if not, let your peace return to you. 14 Whoever will not receive you or listen to your words—go outside that house or town and shake the dust from your feet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ima agree with Mal on this one. I get the message but the song was kinda Eh and the visual was honest but disturbing. And Rory is also right, how can you side with Trump but then drop this video. Ye is sending mixed messages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Kanye wins the 2020 election&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These fools have no idea what kanye is capable of.. they try mocking the editing but what they not seeing is the message and the rawness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow it&rsquo;s funny that these guys critic music when they couldn&rsquo;t listen to the song past one play, that they cant understand what the song is about.  It&rsquo;s literally an anthem for this moment in time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus Is King!&hellip;&hellip; Period!&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please fire budden. I&rsquo;m not asking for much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this song slaps&hellip;.they just gotta hate cuz its Ye lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It wasn’t good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is the comment section saying JB is hating? The other two are hating from what I hear</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imma explain the video&hellip;&hellip;.the video is displaying chaos and the pain that is in the world. Specifically that which is felt by the black comunity. He is then pleading to God to &ldquo;wash us in the blood&rdquo; and saying that only God can be the solution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This song was a dud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanye spit fire on that track and knowledge. Only way out of misery and violence is through acceptance of Jesus. Without Jesus we stay in the mud and violence and drugs.

<li>
<p>I didn’t like Travis part</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Song to me was so-so can&rsquo;t take him seriously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IG @anaegian.ali 🦋🌸🌼🌻💕</p>

<li>
<p>Smh that track was fire these people just lame lol Jesus was King was lame and using God for sales This tracks had religious and political undertones its talking about Black culture how do u not get it smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mal is sitting there with a Jesus chain on&hellip;made popular by Kanye and hating trying to act cool? Sorry I can’t even take him seriously. You don’t understand the culture but you are clearly influenced by it  lol smh 🤦🏾‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe was surprisingly ok with the Kanye talk. I was expecting him to blindly trash it. But he seemed to be the most fair out of all of them. Parks and Mal immediately have an attitude at the mere mention of Kanye. I liked the song, the only criticism I have is that I wanted another verse from Kanye. His verse at the end of the song was fire. Put another one of those at the beginning when the beat first drops and it’s perfect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanye hella overrated hasn&rsquo;t been good in years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idk but that song satanic af</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Song was trash. He needs to stop trying to force his religion on people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not monumental</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terrible takes entire episode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kanye in 2020 just ain’t it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanye a dope producer, but he hasn’t had a dope album in years l. So I want believe it until I  hear it. JMO, but he needs to bring back his old writers or get some better ones than he has had of late.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ye isnt to be Understood just..Behold Creativity and Chaos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did mal just lie to the audience. Mans said how do you feel about him having police brutality in the video when standing with someone who is for police brutality? Whattt since when trump say he stands with police brutality? Wtf mal you a dummy for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate the way mal acts stupid, they lowkey mad Kanye can’t be cancelled and he’s richer and doper than Hov now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can someone explain what’s so insane about this new song and video? It’s not superb lyricism, the video looks as though someone just learned how to edit, (and yes I know the significance of the clips), the feature wasn’t that good. I just don’t get what all the hype is about? It feels as though the weirder people get with their creativity, the more people like it because it goes against what’s so called “normal”. But that doesn’t mean it’s good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F&amp;#! Kanye West. Hard pass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanye ain’t for simple minded people!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanye aint that great.  Yall just hype him up

<li>
<p>The Kanye hate is old &hellip; just give the man his props</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only nice thing I can honestly say about the record is the beat is dope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Song is ok&hellip; 🤷🏽‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤦🏿‍♂️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That new Kanye is..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>💩</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nah it&rsquo;s fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>98% of comments disagree with the JBP perspective. Rory tried divide politically. It’s easier &amp; easier to realize an agenda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m done with listening to Kanye. I don’t care what it sounds like.🤷🏽‍♀️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These niggas wildin&rsquo;!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idgaf who the artist is. If it&rsquo;s trash, it&rsquo;s trash!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Joe is the biggest Kanye hater</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hated it. Did not like the song at all. How did we go from College Dropout to this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mal is irritating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hope he standing up for our people after huggn it up with Trump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanye is 100% washed.</p>
</li>
