<li>
<p>He celebrates every score bc he’s not used to scoring a lot of points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight has the stamina of a 2k character😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone is loud when he makes a shot but when he air balls they pretend they dont see it 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight in 5 years: “Who is this dude? Jay, zarr Jackson. He’s definitely on a 10 day contract. “</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear when flight ever makes a shot the next is a air ball</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When flight did that i got out my chair hyped a mf !😂😂 18:45</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my opinion this is the BEST L flight has ever taken. this a whole lowercase w.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight would wear shorts with curry on his ass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s no ways Flight is still this bad in 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight dunked on brawadis, it’s just that the cameras weren’t on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight after every shot he makes: “instant replay “ 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Flight U gotta Stop smoking U cant even breathe like that or if ur gonna go in the nba u cant be Stoping like that for a breathe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guys he meant July he just didn’t have the cameras on when he said it</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Y&rsquo;all put here expecting him to play like curry he improved and I love it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:38 Flight was looking at god</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:31 this is why June flight is the best lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight necesities for July:</p>

<p>1-better sleep schedule</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2-stay off the weeeeeeeeed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3-watch curry highlights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight plays like there’s a 5 second shot clock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight celebrations after every basket he gets do be annoying tho 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol Brawadis called him out for celebrating after every score</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight need to get back in the gym with Cash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HAD EVERYONE WAITING ON JUNE LIKE ETERNAL ATAKE AND TOOK A L 🥺🥺GRANTED MY MANS FLIGHT COULDNT TRAIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight actually improved a lot but when you were as bad as he is, it’s gone take much more time to start actually catching these Ws😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he yelled &ldquo;SCREEN&rdquo; in a 1v1 got me dying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who&rsquo;s here when June flight lost against faze rug 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight should just stick with reacting to videos dawg 😭🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I dont even care that he lost. Flights actually putting up points now</p>
</li>

<p>Flight reacts know he got bullied by Mikey now he wants to act tuff 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When flight said he didn’t get his ankles broke lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7:43 when your mom stops at McDonald’s before going home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this man really said “before you guys say anything” 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And there’s me trying to win a one v one in minecraft🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When people said “flight in June” I was expecting him to go to a gym and put actual work in but instead we just get to watch him get clapped by other you tubers or clap complete random garbage bins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:25 saving his knee 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most funniest excuse I’ve seen yet ik this was comin bruh 2:21</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when you realize it’s June and flight has more fans watching him play than the nba is allowed 🤯🤯🤔🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Flight plays in a 1v1 it’s all luck because he definitely got no skill😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s so overly hype after making one shot😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry but it be getting me annoyed when Flight makes his calls. Like “nah it was off u” and “wym no take-backs.” That stuff gets me tight 😤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NNNNNNNOOOOOOOIIIIIIICCCCCCCEEEEEEE ‼️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight actually getting better lowkey. Gotta work on that stamina tho mans had a gatorade symbol the whole game lmao</p>

<li>
<p>19:18 where is the instant replay at 😂🤣</p>
</li>

<p>This dude flight is so trash the normal mediocre plays and shots he makes are hyped up by everyone😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was like come on flight don’t let us down in my head the whole game 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like the mentality of this flight, taking every challenge and never giving up. He really is getting better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry but I don’t think you were saving your knee I’m pretty sure that was a ankle breaker jk btw

</li>
<li>
<p>HAD EVERYONE WAITING ON JUNE LIKE ETERNAL ATAKE AND TOOK A L 🥺🥺GRANTED MY MANS FLIGHT COULDNT TRAIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like how flight only puts up the score only when he scores</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh flight needs to get his stamina up and once that happens he’ll be able to slow his play style down and then he can be more consistent and stop rushing so many shots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how flight does barely any editing on his video 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude built like a stick figure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I JUST STARTED WATCHING FLIGHT AND THIS MANS ACTUALLY IMPOVING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When u come across hackers on 2K with there 10ft arms. That dude was huge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight: look at curry man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curry: look at flight man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JUNE FLIGHT THE FIRST TIME HE EVER SCORED DOUBLE DIGITS IN A 1 v 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you merely made the second point and pull up the “ back board “ Card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fligth I know you stand out for a reason . great game every time you score your excitement is everything be your own cheerleader yo char is that you in back lmaooo. Two great guys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:23 “You’re probably wondering how I got here. Well, it’s a long story&hellip;”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18:43 &ldquo;Look at curry MAN!!!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight got the gym sideline crowded like he playing 2k or some shit.😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time flights scores he act like never scored a basket before 😭</p>
</li>

<p>Honestly I’m proud of flight he improved his game</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I been waiting all year to see flight play in “June” 👀💪🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the real flight if you don’t celebrate after every score you’d save energy and would help you score consecutively but mad respect bro you getting better fr!! Stand Up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Look at flight man, so inspirational man”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell me why these Flight in June vids are more entertaining than the 2019-2020 nba season😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Flight gotta stop smoking all that weed so he can get his cardio up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He needa work on his cardio. My guy was winded at 1-1</p>

<li>
<p>Imagine NEXT June Flight 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight need to stop smoking if he doing all these one vs ones, that’s why his stamina is so bad</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Flight not even in his final form 😤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight gets broken down within the first 3 minutes 🤣 lawd have mercy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flight got the Gatorade symbol by his name after every 3 mins 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s alright flight u won in our hearts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that flight only lost to him by 3 points is amazing to me.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>B really thinks he&rsquo;s a nba player I&rsquo;m so dead  😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d still drop u off send me the addy g</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I love about fight is that he doesn’t care what everyone else says. The other people watching are laughing and flight doesn’t care. (Which is good). He has so much confidence, and never lets anyone judge him. Good job my man!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than anything, Flight just need to use a treadmill often. Tired of seeing him get so tired early in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re literally witnessing history right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight doesnt even have a jumpshot he just chest passes it to the backboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man takes a lot of L&rsquo;s but never quits, he got me motivated to get in the gym. Good shit Flight you got better but keep going 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love from brawadis ❤❤❤ you really did everything fair you are great man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how the number of shots are only put on the top left corner for when he makes a shot and now brawadis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight (my type of woman) reacts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitely was an angle breaker🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo flight improved that training really did wonders for my boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ayo Flight, just a defensive tip: to stop Mikey from dunking you can keep being physical at the top of his drive or you can swipe at his hands when he gathers the ball to dunk. If you keep letting him drive with no resistance and levitate, hes gonna keep dunking 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lets get flight in the celebrity game!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never thought I&rsquo;d see the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight really meant wait till June 2021. The cameras just weren’t on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro brawadis didn’t win he just took layups and like 2 fades lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was an ankle breaker😂 he tricked him so bad!! Brawadis has that win in the bag</p>
</li>
<li>
