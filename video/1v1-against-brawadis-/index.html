</li>
<li>
<p>Flight has the stamina of a 2k character😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone is loud when he makes a shot but when he air balls they pretend they dont see it 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nobody:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight in 5 years: “Who is this dude? Jay, zarr Jackson. He’s definitely on a 10 day contract. “</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I swear when flight ever makes a shot the next is a air ball</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>this man really said “before you guys say anything” 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And there’s me trying to win a one v one in minecraft🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When people said “flight in June” I was expecting him to go to a gym and put actual work in but instead we just get to watch him get clapped by other you tubers or clap complete random garbage bins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:25 saving his knee 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most funniest excuse I’ve seen yet ik this was comin bruh 2:21</p>
</li>

<p>when you realize it’s June and flight has more fans watching him play than the nba is allowed 🤯🤯🤔🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Flight plays in a 1v1 it’s all luck because he definitely got no skill😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s so overly hype after making one shot😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry but it be getting me annoyed when Flight makes his calls. Like “nah it was off u” and “wym no take-backs.” That stuff gets me tight 😤</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>HAD EVERYONE WAITING ON JUNE LIKE ETERNAL ATAKE AND TOOK A L 🥺🥺GRANTED MY MANS FLIGHT COULDNT TRAIN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like how flight only puts up the score only when he scores</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bruh flight needs to get his stamina up and once that happens he’ll be able to slow his play style down and then he can be more consistent and stop rushing so many shots</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how flight does barely any editing on his video 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude built like a stick figure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I JUST STARTED WATCHING FLIGHT AND THIS MANS ACTUALLY IMPOVING</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When u come across hackers on 2K with there 10ft arms. That dude was huge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight: look at curry man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curry: look at flight man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JUNE FLIGHT THE FIRST TIME HE EVER SCORED DOUBLE DIGITS IN A 1 v 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you merely made the second point and pull up the “ back board “ Card</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fligth I know you stand out for a reason . great game every time you score your excitement is everything be your own cheerleader yo char is that you in back lmaooo. Two great guys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:23 “You’re probably wondering how I got here. Well, it’s a long story&hellip;”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18:43 &ldquo;Look at curry MAN!!!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight got the gym sideline crowded like he playing 2k or some shit.😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every time flights scores he act like never scored a basket before 😭</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Flight please react to “Dont hug me I’m scared 1-6”😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly I’m proud of flight he improved his game</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I been waiting all year to see flight play in “June” 👀💪🏾</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the real flight if you don’t celebrate after every score you’d save energy and would help you score consecutively but mad respect bro you getting better fr!! Stand Up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Look at flight man, so inspirational man”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell me why these Flight in June vids are more entertaining than the 2019-2020 nba season😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn Flight gotta stop smoking all that weed so he can get his cardio up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He needa work on his cardio. My guy was winded at 1-1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine NEXT June Flight 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight need to stop smoking if he doing all these one vs ones, that’s why his stamina is so bad</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4:08 tell me im the not the only one that caught a beat going on the room 😅</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>FLIGHT BEST ONE V ONE EVER🔥🔥🔥</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>THAT WAS AN  INKELE  BREAKE EXPOSED.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight plays paint defense like he’s using the intimidator badge in 2k</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>i love how everybody be smilin just because of flights playstyle and him thinking he has a chance..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight not even in his final form 😤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight gets broken down within the first 3 minutes 🤣 lawd have mercy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flight got the Gatorade symbol by his name after every 3 mins 😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s alright flight u won in our hearts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that flight only lost to him by 3 points is amazing to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo what the hell did I miss, when did flight get so poppin? 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was intense!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one:</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Flight after every score: InStAnT rEpLaY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The walking L mane 🤦🏽‍♂️😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight is improving a lot. I love it 👀!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How happy Flight gets making a single shot is a level of happiness I&rsquo;ve never experienced</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I got 20 bands on my 1v1 💯💪🏾 Y’all ain’t got it for me 🤫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just found out his real name is Clarence javelli 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at flight man so inspirational!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good shit Flight, you had some high percentage shot selections, you gotta get some cardio my man you too damn tall not to be steps ahead of him driving to the cup and getting gassed.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>B really thinks he&rsquo;s a nba player I&rsquo;m so dead  😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’d still drop u off send me the addy g</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What I love about fight is that he doesn’t care what everyone else says. The other people watching are laughing and flight doesn’t care. (Which is good). He has so much confidence, and never lets anyone judge him. Good job my man!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than anything, Flight just need to use a treadmill often. Tired of seeing him get so tired early in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’re literally witnessing history right now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight doesnt even have a jumpshot he just chest passes it to the backboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This man takes a lot of L&rsquo;s but never quits, he got me motivated to get in the gym. Good shit Flight you got better but keep going 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love from brawadis ❤❤❤ you really did everything fair you are great man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how the number of shots are only put on the top left corner for when he makes a shot and now brawadis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight (my type of woman) reacts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definitely was an angle breaker🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yo flight improved that training really did wonders for my boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ayo Flight, just a defensive tip: to stop Mikey from dunking you can keep being physical at the top of his drive or you can swipe at his hands when he gathers the ball to dunk. If you keep letting him drive with no resistance and levitate, hes gonna keep dunking 💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lets get flight in the celebrity game!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never thought I&rsquo;d see the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight really meant wait till June 2021. The cameras just weren’t on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro brawadis didn’t win he just took layups and like 2 fades lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was an ankle breaker😂 he tricked him so bad!! Brawadis has that win in the bag</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18:44 This is what you came for</p>
