<li>
<p>FunFact: If you need to bribe someone to get your kid into USC, your kid isn’t fit for college.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total Joke.   Someone got paid off.   Should of been 1 yr in Jail.  And 4 million dollar fine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give them years and make them pay the tuition of the students their daughters took the spots of</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow 2 whole months that&rsquo;s a tough judge. Made an example out of her. I&rsquo;m sure they will never do anything illegal again. She has more time to surrender than she does in prison lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MAKE AN EXAMPLE!? 2 Months!? Yeah sure. Give them YEARS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More proof the justice system works differently for the affluent and powerful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SMH they should get years &hellip;. I saw woman getting seven years for putting her kids in a better school system.. so the rich get off and the poor Serve time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is an actor&hellip;.. If it were you or I they would throw away the key.  She is liar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acting out of love? It is an act of love to show your children it is ok to cheat and lie to get what you want?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a prime example of money buys you privilege, 2 months in jail to get my kids into harvard? seems like a good deal to me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh boy 2 months, or even 5 months. If it had been one of us regular people we would have gotten years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She’s gonna get a five star cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should&rsquo;ve got more Thru it all she acted like she was better than anyone else I don&rsquo;t know why some celebs feel they  are entitled</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should have been given at least a year each  you did the crime you do the time. Arrogant people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two months aren&rsquo;t rational for such a sin, it is still not clear whether there was a biased judgement in the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this a joke?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s it 2 months.  A guy went to jail for 2 years because he took a candy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seems a bit light to me, there&rsquo;s people who do less that go away for longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wondering what she did quid pro quo for such a light sentence

</li>
<li>
<p>The look&hellip; Of Guilt&hellip; Is On&hellip;. Your Face..🙄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good! She thought she was Miss Something on Full House! Now her situation has been changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice to be rich. They had her convicted easily but she gets two months which they will probably let her out early because of the plandemic. And yes the judge will let her be close to home and she can report to prison in three months. How many commoners get to report to prison NONE we go from court in cuffs to prison no saying bye to loved ones for the little people who can&rsquo;t bribe a judge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Lori is basically a nice person that made a mistake. Hopefully she can serve her sentence and close this chapter of her life. We all make mistakes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude Id get more time for shop lifting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are non violent first offenders being sentenced to prison?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You forgot to say Lori got 2 years probation after her prison time. The sentence is a joke. People get 3-5 years for small crimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These celebs got off easy&hellip;Rich n powerful you get away with murder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I sure that they had their PR firm, legal strategists try to both limited their sentence along with fixing their image at the same time.  That image enhancement is to tell the world what their will be doing to correct their error, usually it some PR stunt!  They are not sorry, at all; they are sorry that they got caught!  The couple make $ 12 million a year!  $400K+ is like paying a parking fine($35-$50) for the average family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two months in a gilded cage. Awww&hellip;..poor, poor celebrity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not sure how she was convicted on &ldquo;mail and wire fraud&rdquo;, as the statute clearly states this is a crime based on the theft of property. Only in the &ldquo;Soviet States Amerika&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They got off easy..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me know when she gets out 3 days. I can’t believe their the only ones doing this. What fines do the schools get?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s just like trump they all get away with IT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rich have money and Politicians and the Media.  The poor have health insurance and brutality.  In America if you are NOT famous, or have a lot of money.  Then you are NOTHING.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a huge problem how rich people get special treatment. This happens way too often. Something needs to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shouldn&rsquo;t the consultant get the brunt of the criminal charge?  or whoever was in charge of admittance to the university?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They’re gonna get the jefferey Epstein jail experience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aunt Becky will be sharing a &ldquo;Full House&rdquo; with other women who may be &ldquo;fans&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never mind Lori, how&rsquo;s the &quot; fashion designer&rdquo; gonna fare in the clink? Cherry -bye-bye.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should they let this go Aunt Becky doesn’t seem like a bad Person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So&hellip; they essentially get off for doing a crime while someone can get 5-10+ years for petty crimes&hellip;.. thanks justice system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>USC isn&rsquo;t hard to get into. Knowing this happened is sad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sick of the rich getting such low jail time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also her daughter&rsquo;s complacent in it with on consequences. Are Justice system sucks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And this is now becoming news. 🤦🏼‍♂️ I&rsquo;m sure this has been going on for hundreds of year&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s why only the rich keep getting richer. People should be tested before going to a major University.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They.of got years a six figure fine a drop in the bucket for these two and make them go to a real prison not a5 Star hotel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But IT&rsquo;S OKAY FOR OBAMA&rsquo;S DAUGHTER TO GO TO YALE!!!  LOL 😆 LOL 😆 YEAH SHE&rsquo;S  GOT ADMITTED BECAUSE SHE&rsquo;S SOOOO SMART RIGHT!!!  YOU PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ARE BACKWARDS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they will never do actual jail time, in brazil it is totally normal to get your kid in a school if you pay up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The courtroom sketch artist did her dirty making her look like the beldam from Coraline 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So Lori will be out on October 21th and her husband would be out in January 21 next year I think?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think they should be required to pay private tutoring for poor and disadvantaged kids to the tune of $10M and pay for the tuition of 200 children for their university education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a pathetic sentence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s not smiling anymore. Awe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 2 months in prison is going to bring a lifetime of hate in public opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE  LAWLESS GHOULS IN HOLLYWEIRD GET TO PAY OUT THE BANKSTERS OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM ?HMMM?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fun fact: celebs don´t ever actually serve time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, she being handled like an entitled Faberge Egg, and she&rsquo;s given the Privilege synonymous with Hollywood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total joke.  She probably will serve a day or maybe none.🤬</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Judge makes an example by giving them 2 months and 5 months?

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should be 2 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just think of all the Hallmark &ldquo;Prison&rdquo; movies, that will come out of this.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Oh, and the Christian, Christmas Specials!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acting out of love for their kids? I&rsquo;m sure Brock Turner&rsquo;s parent think the same thing about their son.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Circus. Check all politicians. They do same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What a joke.  I can do two months in solitary standing on my head eating Nutraloaf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mossimo, better learn how to wash socks and men&rsquo;s underwear; it will be expected of him, by his prison lover&hellip; lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should be for a min of one year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THAT&rsquo;S NOTHING ! THESE TWO THOUGHT THEY DID NOTHING WRONG? WELCOME TO  RICH WHITE AMERICA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in hindsight, what could the judge do? The Giannulli&rsquo;s agreed to a prison deal, without having to go to trial. The judge just kept the integrity of the prosecution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their daughters should serve time too. They knew exactly what they were doing when they posed on those damned machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If USC is such a lousy college, then why do people attend from all over the country?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Should be longer. But likely wont serve the actual time. And the daughters should be penaluzed as well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think they should just get a small house get there child into a community collage and Maybe make her work for her money ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold up ✋ Who in the heck gets 2 months in prison? 🤣 Isn&rsquo;t prison sentences like 6 months or a year minimum 🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always thought this was an odd case. What about the college personal that perpetrated the process? &hellip;not mention the consultant they hired in apparent good faith. I think a lot of this was prosecution of celebrities. I must admit I am a little envious of their lifestyle but I am also a little lazy and have never really devoted myself to our society&rsquo;s version of success.  I think the public reaction was shameful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ok and what about allison mack?when is she going to be sentenced next year ,celebraty court its the best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That hardcore criminal should have gotten life. Can&rsquo;t have vicious people walk free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;ll probably get house arrest and be let out after one week of good behavior. 🙄

</li>
<li>
<p>The Government steals education from its people by allowing them to pay for it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope they serves every SECOND of that sentence. They won’t, because of their privilege. And I agree with anyone commenting that if they had to pay that much money to get their daughters in, they weren’t fit for college</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ms. Loughlin and husband, you have set a terrible example for your children.  They might despise you for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone with even a sliver of interest in this case should go check out the podcast Gangster Capitalism&rsquo;s deep dive into it. Excellent reporting on this scandal and a big picture with a lot of different perspectives and voices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is what&rsquo;s wrong with our society that people like Lori Laughlin and Mossimo Gianulli think they are above the law.They both should have received more time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The judge wanted to use them as an example for other parents thinking about doing the same, yet he gave them a few months in jail?  WTF?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That will teach them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheating on education for their lil precious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months wow really!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can do their full time and avoid covid-19 if you put them in isolation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will learm their lesson; YOU BETCHA !!! 😵😫👍👍👍👍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is so fortunate. I will pray for her. She will learn plenty. She was facing decades in jail. Give thanks with a grateful heart. Bless the judge. Two months is not a life sentence—.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allison mack ?when is she going to be sentenced 2021 july talk about putting it offf.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hahah good they should have put there daughters in the slammer too they were totally in on it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh, well I hope that knowing you got money and throwing it around to get what you want doesn&rsquo;t always turn out that you end up losing money and freedom for a while hope it was all worth it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She thought she was acting out of love!? Paying somebody to get your daughters into college is not acting out of love. You can’t fix stupid! 🙄 1 month in jail is absolutely nothing should have gotten more!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months in prison how could they such an privileged person lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s it!  All this time and that&rsquo;s it?  They more than likely won&rsquo;t even serve more than 2 weeks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She gets 2 months in prison for this, but  Killary, Nobama, and Gang get nothing for High Treason. Go Team, LOL!

<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s gonna be a full house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not enough jail time,  money will buy your way out of anything. Wrong!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why isn&rsquo;t there video footage from the courtoom?  I want to see the live clip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did her husband get more time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are people rotting in jail for pot possession and these clowns get a month or two, probably reduced to nothing.   The USA justice system is working fine for PUTIN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure her kids would have made in on their own. 2 stupid parents for wasting money like that. Btw, are her and her husband related? They look like identical twin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They got away with murder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it.were yoi or.i we eood.get yrars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet they drive BMW’s 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We love you Lori ♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oooo 2 months in jail</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahahaha, you call that a sentence.🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These parents are disgusting people , no excuses , hope they do have to spend every minuet in Jail sentence .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am usually mild mannered however I was outraged by this coverup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mary Canada 🇨🇦</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months only in jail should be at least 25 yrs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s not act of love&hellip;.. what if one or both of your daughters did something, will you still pay to cover up a crime? that&rsquo;s money can do. but you failed&hellip;.. INTEGRITY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:25 wondrous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re in big trouble mister!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lori will most likely bounce back in time, I mean just look at Robert Downey Jr, he was in a huge mess back in the 90&rsquo;s and now he&rsquo;s a character in one of the most successful movies of all time. The thing about humanity is we quickly forget about things and move onto the next scandal.

<p>What a joke!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hard to receive justice when the people and judges that are In power are making all the laws</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are felons that will never go away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put her in general,  she will be a target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine if she was black</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months is good, I don&rsquo;t get why a lot of People want to see Lori rot in jail. What she did was wrong, but it wasn&rsquo;t the biggest crime ever. But I&rsquo;m from Europe maybe I look at it differently. What I want to say is that everybody deserves a second chance.</p>

<p>They were willing to bribe their kids way into college and now you can tell they paid their bribe for their sentence. The US justice system is a joke. US colleges should ban their kids from EVER attending.</p>

<li>
<p>2 months is a joke.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of whatever Lori has done I&rsquo;m still a huge fan and this will humble her.   Just shows that money and fame can get to a person&rsquo;s head and then they just feel like they can do whatever they want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone makes mistakes in life, stay strong Lori.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whatever happened to predictability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charge her adult children

</li>
<li>
<p>smh</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THATS ALL??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her wrist must be red.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free Aunt Becky ! Jeeeessseeeeeeeee!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The daughters have NO place to hide their faces now hahaha. And their parents have burnt $500k on their idiotic daughters. Should have paid tutors that money instead LMAO family honor is taken from them forever now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All that for two months? Should’ve just fined her and moved on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to think people say white privilege isn’t a thing&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of prison? Country club prison? What a poor example she set for her already overprivileged children. Wealthy people buy their way in and buy their way out. What does she care? She&rsquo;s still wealthy. She&rsquo;s just shameless!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This felon is only receiving 2 months?? Disgusting!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seriously 2 months what a waste of a cell and tax payers money. Im sure there are other people out there who have bribeb worst what sort of judge was this she could have done community service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The judge wanted to make an example out of them by giving her 2 months and her husband 5 months?? What a complete joke. She will be out in a few weeks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8 weeks for bribery?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about trump who scammed American students with his Fraudulent trump University? The man can&rsquo;t talk in complete sentences yet he started a Fake University.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not one mask in this video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is the crime here? Always been that way, if you’re rich you get perks, big deal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So many excuses!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should have tried it by caring about their kids&rsquo; education. Imagine having the money to pay for the best education available and your kids can&rsquo;t even pass a test to get into USC. That&rsquo;s acting out of love alright.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Little white girl got 2 months</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Served them right. 2 months and 5 months are basically nothing for these celebrities. it&rsquo;s basically going for a 2-month and a 5-month lousy vacation, respectively; just no face make-up, no good food, no nice dress to put on etc. these people should be punished heavily, my opinion

<p>We knew she would get two minutes in prison anyway, we’re not shocked at all. This is how it works for rich white people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the recent law breaking from rioters getting away with murder basically with no jail time whatsoever she didn&rsquo;t assault anybody she didn&rsquo;t hurt anybody she must be Republican they love to make examples of a Republican</p>
</li>

<p>People have been conditioned to think college is more important than it is. They&rsquo;re too desperate to get in. Obviously, college makes sense for those seeking certain degrees, but for far too many it&rsquo;s a waste. Especially when what we need is more apprenticeship &amp; trade skills. Sure Lori did something shady, but it&rsquo;s NOTHING compared to Killary Clinton &amp; so many others. When are they going to get their sentences???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They only get a few months this is the problem of the justice system  imagine they were black I bet they all got life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months is not enough. They should not only serve at least a year for this fraud, but have to pay fines to help pay for students who actually WANTED to go to this college tuitions. A homeless mother was sentenced to five years in prison for lying about where her child lived to get her into a better school. Years in prison for the homeless, two months for the rich. Your fame nor your wealth should ever give you the advantage in court that poorer people are deprived of. Not fair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lol 2 months and 5 months is that enough?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not Rad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beautiful woman&hellip;.then she marries a guy with no teeth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BumboClatt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laughlin gets 2 months in &ldquo;Jail&rdquo; on August 21st 2020. That actually means she&rsquo;ll be out in a couple weeks at the most because of &ldquo;Good Behavior&rdquo;. This whole court thing was a joke.I&rsquo;d love to see what she gets for &ldquo;Jail Food&rdquo;. Lobster? King Crab? Filet Mignon? Certainly no bologna or Kraft mac n&rsquo; cheese.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So why didn&rsquo;t the two girls get charged with anything? They both knew what their parents were doing and faked the rowing pictures. And one of them is a Youtube influencer? Really? I wouldn&rsquo;t want my child influenced by someone like her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is she famous enough to only serve 8 hours because of &ldquo;overcrowding&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is nothing but bullying.  I am sure the judge is living a charmed cushy life himself.  Who is he to judge them on having a nice life which he said  he hopes to ruin?  What an arrogant awful petty person he is.  He is the greedy one, who is paying him off for this awful sentence?  I think the other inmates might think she is soft for going in for such a noncrime.  She isn&rsquo;t a criminal minded person, you can see it all over her, and I don&rsquo;t think her husband is either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW And that includes Rich people Hollywood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s only &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; because she was caught. 2 months in prison is an interesting outcome for such a crime</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will see, if they truly learned a lesson and sorry for what they did, they would opt to spend the time in jail, not use the pandemic excuse&hellip; will see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People understand this&hellip;.she will only spend maybe a week in  JAIL&hellip;not PRISON. NO ONE GOES STRAIGHT TO PRISON.  There is a process to get there and it takes much longer than 2 months to get there. She will only spend a very small % of her time anywhere near a jail cell&hellip;.not a prison cell. That&rsquo;s if she sees the inside of a jail at all. All this hype about her going to prison is just for paperwork, not reality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lori Lockland and her husband should have got more time and what I don&rsquo;t like about it is Candace Cameron Bure stuck up for her she&rsquo;s supposed to be religious and believe in God how can she stick up for somebody that cheats and takes College to college spots away from college kids that really try and that their parents don&rsquo;t have money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should have been severely punished!!!!! They both should do  a lot more prison time!!!! Their daughters should never be allowed to go to any college!!! They knew what was happening!!! They are liars and cheaters!!!
