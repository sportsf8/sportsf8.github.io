<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m here getting ready for Mob Movie Monday. who else? üëÅüëÅ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here I am in 2019 watching this again for like the 100th time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God I wish HBO still made movies like this. Imagine a movie on Chin Gigante.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>armand asante would&rsquo;ve been great in the sopranos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This movie blows away Travolta‚Äôs!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travolta played Gotti like a shmuck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His worst performance in his life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asante should have won an academy award for this .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this movie is so underrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP Frank Vincent a mans man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti never followed the rules, another reason he didn&rsquo;t last long</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I never seen paulie so quiet before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let‚Äôs see how many people come here after watching the Gravano interview..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good movie but looking thru the comments i see a lack of props for William Forsythe he bodies all his roles. He a great underrated actor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He squeezes the quarter till the eagle screams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back when HBO made movies doper than the ones that actually dropped in theatres&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gotti never had the makings of a varsity athlete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carlo Gambino, one of the few to live a full life as a G.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante was great as Gotti though William Forsythe was phenomenal as Sammy ‚ÄúThe Bull‚Äù Gravano

<p>I‚Äôm not thinkin. You‚Äôre thinkin. I‚Äôm eatin‚Äô.  And he‚Äôs goin‚Äô.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seen this over 100 times already and I wondered when the new one would come out back many years ago. That travoltra one is trash compare to 1996 gotti jut too real then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony Quinn, the guy who plays Neil Dellacroce, is an awesome actor, as is Armand Assante. This is one of my favorite movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marc Lawrence &quot; guy who played Carlo gambino&rdquo; was good friend to lucky Lucciano in real life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually like this movie before Michael franzese said it was accurate depiction  of that life he said</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bunch of the actors in this film ended up starring in &ldquo;The Sopranos&rdquo; including Frank Vincent, Tony Sirico, Vincent Pastore and Dominic Chianese!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr neil was a true gangster   respect to u mr Neil  R.I.P mr Neil holds ur casket tight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot; I&rsquo;m a member of the Gotti family, my wife Vickys the boss&rdquo;  lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travolta portrayal of Ghotti is a joke. They forgot a small trivial scene, the old lady that owned the building had a Huge German shephard that prevented FBI from making a clean entry on the first try to bug the place. It took them a few tries and i think they wound up tranquilizing the dog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RICO ACT DESTROYED THESE GUYS WHEN THEY FEARED THE GOVERNMENT MORE THAN THEIR OWN IT WAS THE END</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most realistic mob depiction ever. This was as real as it gets&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is better than the john Travolta film</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You know why this movie is so good.  It‚Äôs got parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHO ELSE CAME FROM THE MICHAEL FRANZESE INTERVIEW ON VLAD?!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how Gotti eats a meal after killing the Irishman, so cool and collected while quack quack is losing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saw this when it premiered on HBO. Armand Assante played John Gotti better than Gotti himself. Great movie with good actors and music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opening scene in this movie sends chills down my spine. Armand Assante killed this role. Nailed it to a T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante is terrific actor &ndash; deserves a bit more respect</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movie is straight gangster.  Best Gotti movie.  Dude played the shit of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante did for &ldquo;Gotti&rdquo; what Ving Rhames did for &ldquo;Don King: Only in America&rdquo;!

</li>
<li>
<p>33 minutes in, I&rsquo;ve already counted 6 actors that landed roles in The Sopranos&hellip; I&rsquo;m expecting even more üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you see most of the cast is from sopranos, u know its going to be good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guy that killed gottis son was actually cut up with a chainsaw and Sammy the bull didn‚Äôt even have anything to do with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When it comes to that Mafia acting Stuffs ,Mr. Armand should be right up there with Brando, DeNiro &amp; Pacino!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The man is a living legend&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2019 and still no better acting then this guy playing Gotti</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;they don&rsquo;t have to bug you&hellip;anyone in new York dials seven digits they get you.&rdquo; üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony Quinn was a great great actor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder if John Gotti did actually watch this movie while doing time. Idk what were the circumstances</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>inside,  if he even had a tv or something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was right though: &ldquo;Five, ten years from now they going to wish there was an American Cosa Nostra&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why is armand assante not in everything ever, very underated actor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aniello Dellacroce was a gangsters gangster &hellip;he was a real dangerous individual to have as your enemy &hellip;.Dellacroce was most definitely the real deal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are people NOW seeing this??? This is a great movie. Many of these cats went to the sopranos. Ahhhh the 90s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love this movie so much . So Gangster. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going back, yeah back to some real in your face CosaNostra.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand was good in Hoffa and American gamgster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand assante did a great epic fantastic job as John gotti in this movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>F B I =  Forever Bother Italians</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When John killed Paul Castelano he had no choice because it was me or him but the heat he brought upon himself because of such a public execution was eventually to lead to his downfall.

<li>
<p>The authorities would not rest until he was incarcerated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HOW IS THIS NOT RUN ON NETFLIX. NETFLIX BUY THIS. ITS AN INCREDIBLE AND REALISTIC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who‚Äôs here because the mike Tyson interview with Michael franzese</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quinn has never gotten the respect and credit he deserves ,  man this guy could act,  one of the last great ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New film is joke compare to this. This here is a masterpiece</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante should have got an Oscar for this performance.. absolutely brilliant!! John Travolta can not touch Assante.. not by a long shot!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young joe Diaz.  So good.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Also, scene John is walking thru the ‚Äòyard, note the telephone books under his shirt&hellip;.shiv armor.  This movie is amazing, word Franzese.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20:00 is my favorite part&hellip; where he tells john gotti how close he came to being killed by somebody that loved him like a son&hellip; it was a powerful moment, nel loved Gotti but he was the ultimate soldier, followed the rules to the T and went thru with orders even if he didnt agree because &ldquo;this thing of ours&rdquo; is what he signed up for&hellip; not too many men like him out here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best mafia movies. So underrated tho&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You dress nicer than them and they take it as a personal vendetta&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sammy ‚ÄúThe Bull‚Äù Gravano actor was spot on in my opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great casting this movie has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone else notice how this whole movie takes place during winter? Lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You break the rules and this thing of ours cracks and crumbles, you never break the rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe you muts never seen this before I been watching it the last 20 years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony guinn what a great actor he was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixed feelings about this movies perspective after watching Sammy Gravano  interview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The whole sopranos crew ova heeeeeeere

<p>1 key difference in the way Carlo Gambino conducted family business vs. the way John Gotti conducted family business is the reason why the Mob was severely weakened under Gotti&rsquo;s leadership. Whenever Gambino conducted family business he always &ldquo;suspected&rdquo; that the location where they were talking was bugged. So what he would do when it came time to talk about &ldquo;hits&rdquo; and who was going or who should be given a pass, an associate would call out somebody&rsquo;s name&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&ldquo;Fat Tony??&quot;&hellip;&hellip;and Gambino would either nod his head Yes or No&hellip;&hellip;..&ldquo;Louie the Hammer??&quot;&hellip;&hellip;.He&rsquo;d nod Yes or No&hellip;&hellip;&ldquo;Mickey Gigante??&quot;&hellip;&hellip;.Again he&rsquo;d nod Yes or No. Never would say anything out-loud for the feds to get on tape. And by using that method he was able to avoid ever going to prison for anything &ldquo;major&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The acting and the look. Omfg. Armand. He actually does look like John Gotti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Underestimated film.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only real minus is making Gotti look &ldquo;sharp&rdquo; when in reality he was kinda blunt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I get goosebumps everytime that intro theme song starts playing. I&rsquo;ve seen this movie 7 times already and I love everything abouy it. The gritty 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s NYC feeling, the storyline, the acting, the actors, the whole atmosphere. Brilliant movie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember watching this when it first came out in 96. My dad introduced this to me as well as A Bronx Tale. This was before everyone knew about it. Both are great films.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At 1:39:04, they should&rsquo;ve added Gotti saying to the cop what the real Gotti said when he got arrested.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you 3-to-1 I beat this!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That opening monologue though!! Some truth to that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would never want to be in the MOB, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be an FBI sneak either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was great seeing the Soprano crew together again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best mob movies ever john Gotti would be proud</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish I could have had Neil delacroix in my life as a mentor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THE BEST Mob movie EVA MADE Armand Assante should&rsquo;ve got an Oscar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These characters look exactly like the real people!!! This is a masterpeice next to the likes of The Godfather and Goodfellas. Bravo!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;34:12 everybody at this table should be proud to be sitting here in front of a mans man&hellip;.&rdquo; phil leotardo incoming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched this when it came out.   Still watching it till this day. Prob literally 85 times.  That being said.  I respect Travolta.  But I never even  watched that one.  The fact that this movie was so good. I dont know what else anyone else had to offer on gotti&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;that being said I saw the trailer with Travolta and swore under oath ID NEVER DISREPSECT ARMAND BY WATCHING TRAVOLTA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Very Beginning Was The Best Part &amp; So True.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travolta candy ass messed up the remake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also did Armand Asante also play the mobster  in Denzel Washington‚Äôs movie ‚Äú AMERICAN GANGSTER ‚Äú ?

</li>
<li>
<p>Assante is one of the greatest actors of the last 50 years. This movie is absolutely perfect; what a cast!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the most accurate portrayal of the mob and Gotti</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one else can ever play Gotti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti never had the makings of a varsity athlete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched this movie before Michael Franzese mentioned it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>57:40-59:20 is the best scene/moment! True loyalty, it‚Äôs a shame it didn‚Äôt stay that way!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll wind up in a cell because you are who you are&hellip;.and you&rsquo;ll take a lot of good people with you&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Man Dominic chianese delivered that speech to Gotti so damn perfectly üòÇ guy is such a craftsman in his work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did this tell the future or what in the opening scene. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no feelings, there‚Äôs no feelings for this Country&hellip;.you got anarchy‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is much better and far more accurate than Travelta‚Äôs version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My cousin put me on to this movie in 97 still to this day one of my favorite movies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>can anyone tell me what was the italian said in the club bathroom? looked like it bothered gotti</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s interview with VLAD re brought me back here seen this movie years ago but after watching the new gotti movie it does not beat this original classic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante played John Gotti better than John Gotti played John Gotti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can see why people love Gotti and say long live John and boss of bosses, yeah he had charisma but anyone who actually knows about the mob and knows what they are talking about would say that John becoming boss was probably the worst thing to happen to not only the gambino family but the mob in general. I could name probably 20 things off the top of my head that makes him a utter moron. And boss of bosses? If that position actually existed it would of been the chin , John was scared stiff of Gigante and was no where close to becoming the gangster he was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the sopranos in this love it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legends in this movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is 24 years from &ldquo;now.&rdquo; No one misses John Gotti.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh so we‚Äôre like United Nations now is that right ?

<p>Johnny sack was at that table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Francese sent me here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How many are here after watching Sammie The Bull interview</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante nailed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What&rsquo;s it all about what&rsquo;s life about if you don&rsquo;t go through it as a man&rsquo;s man- Aniello Dellacroce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember watching this on HBO in 1996 or 1997, I was 11 or 12 then. Such a good movie. HBO made a lot of good movies in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Don Carlo said you gotta go</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neil- I would‚Äôve came here with these two zips, then you gotta go lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m here after watching Travolta parody the Gotti story with something recorded on a Scientologist&rsquo;s iPhone and edited on Windows Movie Maker.  Where is Shelly Miscavige?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Came from the Michael Franzese video he uploaded today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This movie was so good the executives gave the green light for the sopranos pilot a year later in 97. Both masterpieces. Anything HBO touches turns to gold like 95%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>29:53 damn 6 oz of coke for 18 grand of cash that‚Äôs hell of a deal John gotti hook them up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love John Travolta,  but Armand Assante blew him away in this character portrayal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sammy &lsquo;The Rat&rsquo; Gravano</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love this damn movie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is one of the best mob movies for sure. Hugely underrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mobsters who came after Al Capone learned from the mistakes that he made with his flashy, high profile lifestyle. That attracted the attention of the Feds like a month to a flame. The more successful mobsters who came after Capone kept a low profile doing business from the shadows, never flashed expensive suits, cars and seeked public attention.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>31:01 lol! That guy was trying to tell Gotti that he was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love Tony Quinn as Dellacroce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I found this on a VHS tape in my uncle&rsquo;s stuff, watched it and loved it.

<p>I was always in love with the Mafia both the real life&amp;movie versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recently I found a copy on DVD at the local pawn shop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony Quinn is an Amazing Actor!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;why a guy born with money, choose our life&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony Quinn fit perfect as a mafioso.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well I can see where David Chase discovered his cast for the sopranos lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think ive watched this about 500 times , such a classic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lol Gotti thought Neil was gonna whack him at 56:43</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>56:45 best part of any mob movie for me the music&hellip;the tension everything is so perfect especially the actors it‚Äôs just honestly a terrifying conversation to me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1:40:27 Wow that FBI Agent had to smirk really bro? you go after these dudes yet you do not go after politicians that commit acts against the Law smh what a douche.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Travolta‚Äôs Gotti was so shit I turned it of 30 minutes in. It‚Äôs all over the place.. just crap. I was looking forward to watching it. It had such s good trailer .. but it was the biggest waste of time and money.. this 1996 movie is the greatest Gotti movie made about him.. they need to stop making remakes when there is pure movie gold here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>69 need to watch this SMH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember this movie&hellip; this was/is  awesome,  wayyy better than Travolta&rsquo;s version</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the casting alone of this movie to the Travolta Gotti movie üòÇ Half the cast made it to the Sopranos. Travolta wouldn‚Äôt last an episode on the Sopranos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need a movie like this for the philly mob. But I would love to see Martin Scorsese last film to be about the philly mob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was always interested in John Gotti and his life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else came here after Michael franzese review on the Irishman üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thiss world would of be different if gotti was around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante was excellent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This movie makes you wish that the real Gotti would&rsquo;ve had the looks and character of Assante!

<p>Armand Assante would have been perfect as Tony Soprano</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else is here because Michael Franzese recommended it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rest In Paradise John Gotti Sr. Did his bids always kept it solid,salute to a mans man&hellip;.!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante completely hit a grand slam on this movie. Practically flawless. I believe he won a Golden Globe for his performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Michael Franzese approved this flick as true to the life and authentic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great movie despite the many inaccuracies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im sure John was no saint but when the government would not allow him the legal representation of his choice the government lost all credibility . The government got rid of his lawyer and then convicted him ..Wow . America isnt what we are told it is ..the Government are the biggest gangsters .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guy who played Neil Delacroce great actor</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was one of the most accurate mafia movies ever. If not the most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony Quinn is a legend. This is one of the best mob movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lots of Sopranos stars in this movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúWell, the Jews wacked-out Jesus!‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti: You know, maybe he had it coming?‚Äù Priceless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the greatest movies. John Gotti was a great man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best intro to a flick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>interesting fact you dont hear that much ,but has been proven: After Carlo Gambino and the Gambino Family the next most powerful was The Genovese Family run by Vincent &ldquo;the chin&rdquo; Gigante.  Carlos death left  &ldquo;The Chin&rdquo;  with the most power. Yes Gotti had balls but Gigante was old school went back to when the commision was formed; was schooled by Vito Genovese himself and was a thinking man.I say all this to say: after the hit on Costellano the only reason Gotti wasnt killed the one thing that saved his life was the fact that Costellano allowed the feds to use his house to do survelliance on Frank Mathews (who lived next door to Costellano), and that Costellano was a COnfidential Informant. This all came to light in court during Frank Mathews trial.This and only this is the reason The Commision let Gotti live and keep his rank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel a little heartbroken for Neil, he always looked out for those close to him and stayed true to the code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classic movie üçø Godfather Goodfella Level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>35:33. The Shah of Iran sitting at the table???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is what i call a Good mafia Movie.

<p>ARMANDO ASSANTE IS A VERY GIFTED THESPIAN BLESS HIS HEART MY WIFE AND DAUGHTERS LOVE HIS PORTRAYALS IN ANYTHING HE ENDEAVORS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Assante was great in HOFFA (1992) also, although he played a composite character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John Gotti inspired me to do well in school so I could afford Brioni suits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony Quinn is terrific,and terrifying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This absolutely destroys travoltas üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony quin LEGEND RIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most underrated mobster movie ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John &ldquo;Teflon Don&rdquo; Gotti is the single most popular mob figure in American history and probably the one most responsible for the complete unraveling of the mafias dominance and invisibility in America. Even though he stuck to Omerta and didnt turn rat.I know its alot of mafioso wish they wouldve wacked him early on wouldve saved the other families alot of trouble later on down the road.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great film, great musical score too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Five-ten years there going to miss John Gotti!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The smoothest portrayal of John Gotti ever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feel like I‚Äôve watched a 2 hour long episode of The Sopranos&hellip;. that‚Äôs a good thing üëç</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assante was one of the most handsome dudes ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armande assante deserves an oscar for this performance. Truly amazing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;The feds Smell a guy with no parameters and they move in&rdquo; üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just started watching it&hellip; I&rsquo;m watching the intro right now and I can tell its gonna be a badass movie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anthony Quin, epic performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Johny Sac was at Johny Boy&rsquo;s inauguration ceremony at 01:03:51 :)))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ralph never had the makings of a varsity athlete&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>32:58 he says the same thing in the Sopranos. Tony laughs at him.

</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúHe don‚Äôt ask where it comes from, but he knows!‚Äù Like the future was talking to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best mob movies ever.  I know Jr was involved in the Travolta movie, but Travolta sucked so bad I couldn&rsquo;t watch   Armand Assante plays a phenomenal role.   so underrated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assante is one of the most underrated  actor ever&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is my outlook on the life back then Mike was a capo so was Sammy Mike should have been made boss. With Sammy as concielry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That intro is so heart felt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First time I&rsquo;ve seen this film and god damn it how have I not seen this before its best Gotti film I&rsquo;ve seen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fun fact, John Gotti killed Tommy Dessimone, the guy Joe Pesci played in Goodfellas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still one of the greats movies ever made</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and here iam one year later 2020 still watching again üòÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a great movie that no one talks about. I can watch over and over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third guy on the hit&hellip; legit looked strung out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you guys like Armand Assante in this movie then you should definitely see the movie, Hoffa. It was made in the early 90s and is so damn good!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You no armand assante had to get gotti&rsquo;s approval to play him, armand said he wouldn&rsquo;t do it unless gotti ok&rsquo;d it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why am I just now discovering this movie? My mom told me the other night she was watching this &amp; it was super good so I wanted to watch it as well.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I thought the new Gotti movie was good but I kept falling asleep on the second half because I was exhausted but it looks like everyone hated it even when I looked it up on google the reviews were bad. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How come no one liked the new Gotti movie was the acting really that bad??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>53:02 Sammy turns into a GHOST!! (when Don Carlo was alive, they were lucky to get 10%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched this movie a year ago this month and I enjoyed it even more this time than the first, especially seen as how I know better what they are all talking about. Just like last year, I watched The Godfather Of New York first which is the one told from Paul Castellano&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fantastic movie but I just keep expecting the main guy to start singing Born in the USA at any second.

</li>
<li>
<p>Movie&rsquo;s definitely a mob classic and also paved the way for HBO to roll out The Sopranos. This is history here!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minute 02:58</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Man, many of the actors look scarier than the real life mafiosos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The real Michael Franzese, when he was younger, could easily have been mistaken for a member of that Pop music group Frankie Goes To Hollywood, or Duran Duran.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching this for the first time. What a class film this is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the best mob movie ever made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>11:20 I love how the movie opens with John making Angelo put his cigarette out, while moments later he doesn&rsquo;t seemed bother when his mentor is smoking next to him in a car lol. It&rsquo;s a subtle detail of showing his respect for not only his mentor, but his respect for the hierarchy of the mob.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armand Asante, one of the worlds great actors! BRAVO!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That turnaround Armand Assante nailed after Paul didnt come 2 pay his respect 2 Neil is EPIC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the road to Shambala&hellip;&rdquo; Any movie that plays Three Dog Night within the 1st 15 minutes gets my thumbs up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 Still watching this great movie!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have just finished watching this Movie, and i never get tired of watching this movie. This is a very good movie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>John, I love you like a son .. but don&rsquo;t ever put me on the spot and don&rsquo;t ever force my hand ..  such a strong sentiment in just a few words, well with people like &ldquo;Neil&rdquo; Dellacroce every word mattered .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masterpiece all I can say.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The man who singlehandedly destroyed Rome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I came back to watch this after Michael Franzese stated on Vlad that this was one of the most accurate depictions of real mob activites he&rsquo;s ever seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I call this the learning tool. Anyone specializing in sidewalk university? Oh, yeah!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the best movies ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best mafia movie of all time
