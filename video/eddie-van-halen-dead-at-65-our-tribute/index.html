<p>Just when you thought 2020 couldn&rsquo;t get any worse&hellip;. Eddie was a true innovator of his craft. The music he helped create are classic rock staples that will always inspire, be admired and never forgotten. My heart goes out to his family and can&rsquo;t begin to imagine their loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>June 30, 1980 Market Square Arena Women &amp; Children First World Tour - warm up band was The Catz and I don&rsquo;t think they lasted three songs; Van Halen came out to thunderous cheers and didn&rsquo;t disappoint at all, in fact exceeded expectations.  There will NEVER be another band like that because there will NEVER be another guitarist like Eddie.  You&rsquo;re absolutely right, from man Dave or Sammy, Eddie was always THE STAR.  Rest in Peace KING EVH!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This ole 62 year old guy ain&rsquo;t liking this one little bit man. This is shades of 2017 when a few other rockers I am close to in age pass on to that big recording studio in the sky. I will get over it, maybe, but it still opens the old eyes to the fact that these famous and great people pass on too. RIP Eddie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I took some students during OU812 tour&hellip;one of those students posted this</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closest I came in meeting Eddie Van Halen was in 10th Grade. Went to see the ou812 tour. Phil Carlin, Lee Dodds, Chad Mackey, and myself. After the show we saw Zeke Eddie&rsquo;s guitar tech tearing down his rig and yelled at him. He told us to meet him outside by the bus. We were waiting outside and a large garage door opened. Up the ramp came two limousines. One Stopped with Eddie and Sammy in it. The window rolled down and Eddie said hey you the guys waiting for Zeke? He&rsquo;ll be out in a minute. Then they drove off. He took us on the bus, red white and black striped guitars everywhere. Then gave us a bunch of pics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have his Fender Strat and even his signature Frankenstein Pick to honor him. RIP (Rest in Power) Eddie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>never met him, but i started getting into rock music when i was 12, but  mainly the classics. I was an odd ball through out grade school and junior high for listening to van halen, ufo and ac/dc. but the music always made me feel safe and at as i belonged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today we have lost a legendary rock musician in Eddie van Halen he is one of the best 2 ever played guitar ever he is one of my favorite guitar players of all time in my opinion my he rest in peace</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will never forget the epic shows in Pasadena and six flags magic mountain rip EVH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eddie, you saved rock and roll in and with 84. Culture had gone the way of DEVO and KISS  and a hundred other acts of gimmicks and smoke and mirrors. You didn&rsquo;t come my way much down in SC and I never had the honor of seeing you perform live but you will always be in my mids eye right there with Jimmy, Stevie and Eddie. In everyone&rsquo;s on order of course. However, I wonder could they play your stuff????? Peace bro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THANX YOU EDDIE VAN HALEN / R.I.P.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, this man was the band, and yes let&rsquo;s not forget.  Eddie was a legend as the fastest guitar 🎸 player in the world 🌎</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First Neil Peart. Now EVH. God this year sucks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP, Eddie; he will be missed! My favorites include &ldquo;Runnin' with the Devil&rdquo; and their cover of &ldquo;Oh, Pretty Woman&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heartbreaking.  My heart goes out to Wolfgang, Valerie and the family &hellip;. one of the greatest guitarists in rock history.  Everything he played came to life in a way no others ever played.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May he Rest In Peace&hellip;&hellip;..💔🙏🏼🌟</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eddie, Stevie, and Jimmy H are tearing it up on Heavens biggest stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That sucks rip Eddie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May he rest in peace.!?!?

<p>Present day guitar God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s gone. I can&rsquo;t believe it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a shocked to me! 3 days after my 38th birthday&hellip;RIP Eddie! My first time hearing Eddie was &ldquo;Beat It&rdquo; by Michael Jackson on the Thriller album. The way he was shredding amazed me. Then a year later when MTV premiered the &ldquo;Jump&rdquo; video in late &lsquo;83, I was stunned that not only he had his own band but the way he tapped on the guitar and playing the keyboards. Ever since then, I&rsquo;ve always admired Eddie&rsquo;s guitar work on all of the band&rsquo;s material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I recall seeing them open for Black Sabbath in NY in late 70’s. RIP Eddie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😢🎸🎶  R.I.P. Eddie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saw them in 95 on the Balance tour, it was when Eddie debuted his new short hair. Saw them again in 2015 Eddie had the short hair and now it had some gray. Both times he was on point and put on a great show. Like MJ, Prince, and Bowie, another great icon of the 1980s has left us. RIP EVH 😥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart is so broken the music industry lost the Best guitarist in the industry EDDIE VAN HALEN may he rest in peace and my prayers go out to his family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am shocked and gutted! He was an amazing musician. RIP Eddie!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just feel like a house fell on me&hellip; Eddie was and will remain THE Guitar God for my generation. I just turned 60. He got me bad when I heard Panama the first time. Saw them in Montreal in 2007 for the first time. RIP Eddie !!! 😭😭😭🤟🤟🤟</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw them October 16, 1981, still have the ticket stub. Absolutely great concert - my 2nd concert ever. What a sad day today is! My Facebook blew up when it was announced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gosh we lost another great legend Eddie Van Helen RIP you may be gone but you will be remembered 😢❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eddie Van Halen was such a great guitarist. May he rest in peace. Cheers!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today the world of the electric guitar will forever mourn! What a great loss that words cannot describe!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To many great musicians we have lost this year I will be glad to see the back of 2020 its been such a crappy year rip Eddie van halen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!! I guess prayers don&rsquo;t always help the way we hope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought Van Halen was one of the best party bands around. So many cool music videos. Roth may have been front and center, but Eddie was the one I watched. I was so hoping he would beat the odds. RIP, Eddie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Awful, awful awful - RIP Eddie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just feel Sick. :o( R.I.P Eddie.</p>

<li>
<p>So Sad To Hear This. Van Halen Was One Of My Favorite Groups. Luv All Their songs. R.I.P. Eddie Van Halen..Keep Rocking In Heaven 🙏</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🎸🎸🎸🙏🙏🎸🎸🎸</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the most influential guitar players of all time, probably only behind Hendrix himself. Eddie had an impact on every guitar player that will last forever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another legend gone too soon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wow holy shit!!!he&rsquo;s dead dammm!! i seen them once, man my ears rang for 2 days haha. wow thanks eddie for all the great music!! bless ur fam in this time of loss rest in peace my man god speed.!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow, my heart is sad,.  I was 18 just moving to Oregon that summer when first album came on the radio</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so sad, especially for his family. 💔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sad about this too, but to look at the bright side, I can remember being in high school, almost 20 years ago, and hearing about his cancer on the radio, and them making it sound like he didn&rsquo;t have much time left. He had all sorts of health issues between then and now, but he managed to keep pulling through, watch his son grow up, reunite the classic Van Halen (well mostly) and end on a high note. It&rsquo;s better than many a rockstar gets and if you&rsquo;re a fan you can take solace in that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Such an innovator. Always enjoyed his playing. I am so glad I had the opportunity to see him evolve from the first time I saw them at a local Van Club Rally. A year later at the Whiskey you could already see something was special about him. Then the album came out and grabbed you from the very beginning. Saw them 3 times after that along with a one time shot with Sammy. Even with his issues, I NEVER saw a bad performance from him. R.I.P. Eddie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m pissed I thought one more go around with Sammy and Mikey?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😭😭😭 RIP EVH Rock in Paradise🎸🎸🎸</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eddie Van Halen  R.I.P.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My heart just fell out of my chest. Rest In Peace, Eddie. ⚘🕊</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best guitar player in America. The Best of the Best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rock guitar was never the same after him. Eruption at 1:42 changed everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will always remember my 80s and growing up with hair bands and eddie was in that time in my life and ill always listen to his music 🎶 and reflect.  God be with you forever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well now my day’s ruined!! 😭

<li>
<p>I was in the tenth grade when the debut album came out. Everyone was talking about Van Halen. Saw them in concert four times. Great shows all. RIP Eddie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOW, Thank you EDDIE for your presence, talent, and commitment in creating some of the best music in history.  Your fellow band members were fortunate to express their talents with you in your legacy.  Prayers and HEALTHY VIBES go our to the family&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gargantuan hole is correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In every guitar players heart.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a teen in 81 just picking up the guitar, I saw the Fair Warning and Diver Down tours. I think my jaw is still on the floor of the Nassau Coliseum. This man was a beast. I&rsquo;m crushed as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a teen when first 2 came out.Every party you went to had them on.Noty satriani or dimebag ,steve vai the list goes on.They were not around yet.Dimebag and Zakk didnt call him King Edward for nothing.They gave credit where credit was due.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was blasted with Eruption and You Really Got Me in 1979! I never listened anything like that before! You right SAD DAY!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll miss you Eddie! You were one of the greats! R.I.P.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VH backed Black Sabbath Portland Maine Civic Center 78&rsquo; AWESOME !!! RIP EDDIE !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>May 6th 1980 - 1980 Invasion Tour for Women and Children First , Rochester N.Y. my first time seeing Van Halen I was right upfront on Eddies side of the stage that was the first of many Van Halen show&rsquo;s , I&rsquo;ve seen them 12 times if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, this is a huge loss R.I.P. Eddie Van Halen thank you for all the great music and memories 🤘</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sad day said they are graduated in 1982 so I guess I&rsquo;ve been around Van Halen seen him three times in concert I didn&rsquo;t see him with Sammy but I seen him with David Lee way way back and then come on all right hey yeah you know David least said a while back that you know he wasn&rsquo;t doing well and I didn&rsquo;t think David Lee would lie about that but I didn&rsquo;t want to believe it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw Van Halen in 1979 or 80.  It was like watching young gods at play.  I don&rsquo;t think they played an entire hour, but no one felt cheated.  EVH was maybe the last true guitar god to surface, but gone too soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw EVH play After they released OU812, even though I had been a fan for years, probably the greatest moment of my life, and today the worst, saying goodbye to a legend, a friend I never met, but who unknowingly helped me learn the guitar! Goodbye Eddie, one day we&rsquo;ll rock in heaven together!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have any idea he was sick. Taken too soon. Greatest guitarist of my 80s youth. RIP EVH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP EDDIE!!!!!Thank you for ALL the GREAT music!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow. Was awestruck by this band enough to see their first nyc show at the old Palladium and they were sandwiched in between Photomaker and Horselips.  Great loss in Rock and Roll.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Van Halen I is always in my vehicle on road trips&hellip;ALWAYS.  I still get chills listening to Eruption&hellip; every time.  Thank You Eddie and Happy Trails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In an interview with Zakk Wylde I read years ago, he referred to him as King Edward. Made sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP, EVH.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RIP EDDIE Van Halen..😥🎸😥🎸🔊😥🎵🎵

<p>RIP :(</p>

<li>
<p>EVH RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>😪</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also a fact most don&rsquo;t remember is that Eddie Van Halen played the guitar solo in Michael Jackson&rsquo;s Beat It song. Great Guitar solo!! R.I.P. EDDIE VAN HALEN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😰😓😓😓😓</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rush needs a drummer. Alex Van Halen needs a job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legend! Rest easy boss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running with the Devil played often when the LP came out on the rock radio FM station outside NYC where I grew up. It did not grab then.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>VH seemed to be meh until Unchained. Fair Warning is what turned me into a fan. Of course, I went back into the older catalog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ugh, the 1984 album was when they sold out.  Terrible sounds, cheesy keyboards and Roth&rsquo;s vocal style was less bluesy.  Their earlier stuff was SO much better.</p>
</li>
