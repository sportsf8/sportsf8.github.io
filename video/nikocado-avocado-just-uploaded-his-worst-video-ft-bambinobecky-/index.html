<p>Poor girl doesn&rsquo;t know what she&rsquo;s in for&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahhh yes&hellip; The best series on YouTube: &ldquo;The Orlin is leaving me series&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Omg Becky had no idea what she was getting herself into</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NikocadoAvocado is a true mess honestly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hasn&rsquo;t Becky been through enough this week? Nobody needs to see Nikocado on top of it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>becky is the sweetest, poor becky for having to witness nik,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish he really would leave him so they can stop this stupid continuity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t you show Becky the ones where he pooped himself?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I predict an earthquake&rdquo; was so funny</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Callum mate you&rsquo;re such a gentleman to share this DELIGHTFULL source of intertainment with sweet Becky 😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy everytime you post, your videos really help me get out of my head, thanks !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lemme just pause the video to pray for her poor un expecting soul real quick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why did i think that nicocado avocado made a video with becky after reading the title</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ugh those guys are like children who spits on each other as an adult honestly? Almost as bad as the video when he pooped in the bed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atlest you guys didn&rsquo;t watch the one where he shits the bed and shows it on camera. 🙃 he also sits there and dances and sings &ldquo;Popeyes chicken sandwich!&rdquo; While showing the poop stain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It really honestly torture, I tried watching one of his videos without someone reacting to it, i was traumatised 😳😬😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i’m subscribing to her now just because you told me not to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlin&hellip; If he has herpes, you  have herpes&hellip;

</li>
<li>
<p>Them hitting each other is like two kids fighting over a toy or who can sit in the front seat of a car.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pretty much watching Mario and Luigi slap each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10:03 Orlin is sad and Bambino looks sad plus they are wearing the same top so I have came to the conclusion that Becky is related to Orlin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There like fricking children shove them in time out for the rest of there life’s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>name a better duo i’ll wait</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A gentleman enough to not show Becky what he &ldquo;did on the chair&rdquo; 🤢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlin and Avocado boi need to just set up a ring and dress as wrestlers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nick: I&rsquo;m gonna have zaxbys chicken</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me: worried since I like zaxbys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Callum and Becky are the best duo hands down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is no1 going to talk about how Nick &amp; Orlin are looking like Mario &amp; Luigi in their coloured tops 🤣😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guy already disgusted me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This has the same energy as when you&rsquo;re watching a movie or going looking at a textbook, pointing at the most random thing going &ldquo;this is you&rdquo; to your friends 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah no wonder Orlin left him, their relationship is abusive af</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ik this is irrelevant but why would u do Cheesecake Factory like that come on dude it’s the equivalent as a national bird</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nick and orlin are friends to lovers to enemies to lovers to enemies supremacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>praying for Becky now&hellip;..she was blessed of not seeing a nickocado video until now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wanna see a 200 dollar fish and chip mukbang from Markie. I&rsquo;d sponsor that if he was interested. ;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You took my innocence also. I ddnt know about Nikocado until I subbed to this channel. -_-

<li>
<p>The commentary golden so I stayed 😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markie&rsquo;s shirt said trans rights 💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the views. Its all because everyone loves a train wreck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I must be dead 💀 inside because I did not smile ,laugh or grin at one moment watching nicks video. He’s so childish and stupid, I just can’t . As it is I feel like I lost a few brain 🧠 cells just watching this lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You look like&hellip; gender reveal.” 5:07</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That made me laugh out loud! 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The key to being pissed off and looking like nikacado is that you have to look straight up when you&rsquo;re angry like a Peanuts character (Charlie Brown/Snoopy) it&rsquo;s so freaking stupid how he does that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i feel like someone needs to call the police</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please do more of these! So entertainment and I can’t bring myself to give Nikacado any views</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mate sent me a video of Nickocado from his only fans&hellip;never been the same since</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you guys live together? Is that why you don&rsquo;t have to social distance?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t know who this girl is but she’s cracks me up haha</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>just what I&rsquo;m looking for on a Saturday afternoon, a nikocado avocado video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EARLY-SQUAD! Another train-wreck king video : )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>please stop talking about nick he&rsquo;s only relevant because y&rsquo;all keep him that way and it&rsquo;s disgusting, cut it out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love bambinoBecky, need to see more of her, a lot more!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bruh&hellip;. my arm looks like orlin&rsquo;s, i know im harry and idc!!</p>

<li>
<p>&hellip; This guy is so abusive to his boyfriend. I just want to wrap the boyfriend up in a blanket and drop him off at a shelter, so he could be safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These two are the duo on YouTube tbh 😳🖐🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we’ve lost him to the dark side&hellip; reddit videos</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like I want to puke up after watching the end of them snogging. 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I use the reddit website would it count? I have no space for the app but I could really use the money for food and clothes so I&rsquo;d really like to 1.) Support you obviously but 2.) Hopefully try to win because covid killed my art business and itd be a huge help :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So in the beginning, I was thinking “thank god that’s not me”. Then as it continued I was thinking “mankind is doomed”.  Just like Jersey Shore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikocado the tomato red, round and disliked by many</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay imagine this: You stop watching nik in 2016, you come back 4 years later and you see&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becky&rsquo;s a savage with that intro damn lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh thank Christ for that, I thought you were showing her one of the scat videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>don&rsquo;t worry Markie, I care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not sure what I care about, but I care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really did not need to see those inflated beasts making out&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The grinches that ate Christmas 🎄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pelino and Nik are LITERALLY tweedle dee and tweedle dum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this is awful omg those guys need help asap it made me so sad 😔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This had me in fits of laughter !!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is this avocado guy and why is he getting views? He’s unbelievably irritating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These two have slept together</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ngl this was absolutely disgusting to watch but i enjoyed becky&rsquo;s presence i stan her

</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re a great duo, love when you two collab🔥🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Personally I think it&rsquo;s probaly better to spit om someone when they&rsquo;re asleep as they would be blissfully ignorant aboiut it.  Plus there&rsquo;s  the added adnatage if you take a video of the alleged spitting, and you could just have it in a loop on your phone.  Just think of the satisfaction that would bring, all the while your significant other will always wake uo wit your spit on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you done a reaction video to James Charles backing on Lauren Conrad&rsquo;s makeup or that while his PR box he got from Lauren Conrad like I guess it&rsquo;s a big deal on Twitter and shit right now but I thought it was really funny cuz he spoke out of turn and at a place and come to find out it was just an accident that she sent him the pr box with empty stuff in it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>never been so grossed out to see two dudes kiss - a gay man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not familiar with this low-budget soap opera, but my first impression is like watching slow death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Haha can you imagine Nik doing a reaction video to this haha watch out Markie he might want you next haha 😂 haha you should do he’s only fans with Becky haha and not say what it is until she clicks the tab open haha xx</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video has given me some new respect for Orlin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RUN BECKY RUN!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t watch this guy at all. Not even on your channel.  To support your channel I watched an Ad then 30 seconds of your video then had to leave.  Nick = 🤢</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally early 🥺🖐🏼</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love it when you bring Becky on she is so funny the both of you together just bounce off of each other really nicely I&rsquo;ve always found you hilarious anyway Callum but Becky she&rsquo;s brilliant X X  this dude that all he ever does is eat he literally grosses me out I don&rsquo;t like that Nick avocado find him weird and strange but I always find it entertaining when you talk about him😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s all put on, but it&rsquo;s promoting domestic violence. Why does YT not allow certain phrases but allows this NA videos?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video took my avocado-virginity too, and I regret it like crazy 😦😦😦😦😦</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh lord good luck markie mate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wasn’t she on sidemen tinder?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They spend the whole video saying they act the same way on ocassion&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end; Becky: &ldquo;i like watching this coz it makes me feel better about myself coz I&rsquo;m not like them&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think it’s an act and most of us either know or suspect it’s an act and that’s why he’s getting away with a lot of the verbal and physical abuse and now this alleged “boyfriend”. I just watch him sometimes for fun and I’m obsessed with Orlin’s comebacks and burns lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Markie mate&hellip;a hat or something&hellip;youre givin around salaries wtf&hellip;

<p>I have the same cheap Jokkmokk IKEA chairs(and table)😄</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get demonetised for not censoring the swear words?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WOW!! I can&rsquo;t believe how much healthier he looked in the violin clip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Really enjoyed this video #MARKIE. Your girlfriend/friend (sorry, I&rsquo;ve not seen her in a  vid before so wasn&rsquo;t sure) Becky is so lovely, you should collab more, you guys really made me laugh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Your herpies infested saliva&rdquo; omg hahaha.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love you Callum. Heading over to Reddit now.. you&rsquo;re going to get very sick of me. 🤗❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any person&rsquo;s story would inspire me enough to go vegan it&rsquo;s the story of Nikocado Avocado. The immense difference, both physically and mentally, between Nikocado as a vegan and then after he quit is staggering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>love becky and markie&rsquo;s interactions lmaoo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becky’s highlight is POPPIN!! I absolutely adore her, her video was so funny. I love Becky and Callum’s dynamic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love it when you film together, so funny😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you go from a violin to a cello&hellip;&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is this even allowed on youtubeeeeee I wish I never saw a video of him aaaaaaaah calluuuum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She needs to be in more videos 😂 I love her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EY up Markie, some of us subscribers are knocking on a bit. You want me to go to Reddit now??? 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this was entertaining as hell lmfao</p>
</li>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to tell how much of this is real and how much is fake. At first it seems like they&rsquo;re not even in an actual relationship, it&rsquo;s just acting for views.. but idk bc like Nikocado is such a staggeringly horrendous actor, but then Orlin will seem like genuinely depressed a lot of the time and it&rsquo;s like is HE just better at acting or is it somewhat real and Nikocado really is that nuts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wow, I&rsquo;m so early too. Much love. 💗</p>

<p>I want a video of just Orlin’s reactions. Cut the rest out please. 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does Callum&rsquo;s hat say?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😂😂😂 poor Orlin. I love beckys reactions 😂😂😂 👌❤️💯</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If its making money, it aint stupid.</p>

<p>Hey Becky, im glad you were able to keep your teeth. I have a rare disease that causes my body to not absorb Calcium or vit D. So because of that i cant have anything with Calcium, so no milk, no yogurt, etc. so because of this, my teeth are decalcifying and so are my bones. Theres nothing we can do to reverse the effect and ive lost all but two of my back teeth, but the other two will be coming out soon. So, im glad they were able to save your teeth after your fall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wow that was uncomfortable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becky&hellip;.it&rsquo;s time to put your face mask over your eyes 🥴🥴🥴🥴😭🤮 good luck, sis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yikes, I love Markie&rsquo;s videos but can&rsquo;t watch this. My stomach hurts from watching this bad behavior. :(</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>You guys look cute together.</p>
</li>
