<li>
<p>They definitely would‚Äôve lost if they didn‚Äôt cheat, they don‚Äôt diserve the prize</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not mad about Charli winning, I&rsquo;m just confused that wtf will a 10 year old Charli fan do with $300k lmfao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs so pathetic to see TikTokers coming at Keem üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So how u gonna pic the winners surely u can‚Äôt see who has post notifications on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine cheating</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>This post was made by the the people who don&rsquo;t cheat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The D&rsquo;amelios cheat</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Me: What is your monthly incomeÔºü</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No one cares about the ace family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro I love how Jimmy(Mr Beast) said content creators never have I seen a daddy dmaelio or a mommy dmaelio channel so basically that‚Äôs already cheating oh yeah they aren‚Äôt smart either. Also Zhc should‚Äôve won that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember back when Keem was just a memer only cared about by the COD sniping community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:30 is where you see the Damelio‚Äôs cheating! Thank me later :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loud isn‚Äôt funny keem I turned my volume to the lowest and still heard your screams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I hit the bell, selected all notifications.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best of luck to everyone.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Mrbeast: after hearing all the backlash of charli cheating ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna pretend I didn‚Äôt see that‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like austin but why he gotta swear infront of his kids. But then again every youtube is fake LoL!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Honestly this is the only time I will ever watch drama alert</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúI hit the bell and selected all notifications‚Äù  Good luck everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sounds like someone might have caught a case of the &lsquo;rona.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Actually appreciate Addison and her lack of knowledge she tried alone and thats what matters and not having your parents play the game for you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to odu with Rahat I could prob. Get you in touch with him if you need help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the damelios were acting so sus the whole time. it was so uncomfortable to watch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not gonna lie, I like  Charli and Dixie, but this is really messed up. They shouldn&rsquo;t have used their phones. That really isn&rsquo;t fair to everyone else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúI hit the bell and selected all notifications‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being literally the biggest tiktokker and having to cheat in a money tournament</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr Beast should have said NO PARENTS!! wtf were they even there for? they are nothing lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is why you don‚Äôt trust those pesky sneaky TikToker‚Äôs I say we put them in the back of the box</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proves that tik tokers are as brain dead as the little children in their audience</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I subscribed and hit all notifications&rdquo; good luck everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Idc what anyone saids they shouldn‚Äôt have had their phones out like they cheated no cap</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I hit the bell, selected all notifications.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Best of luck to everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love how excited keem gets when he has the scoop üòÇüòÇüíÄ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yikes! Everyone in the comments are pressed should I be too?

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I would like to point out that it‚Äôs a game for fun and they cheated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MrBeast better not give ANY money to them, he is such a nice guy, and for him to invite them onto the competition was already kindhearted of him. YouTube is a very long grind and I‚Äôm so glad it doesn‚Äôt support underage girls dancing in their bikinis like tiktok. Pewdiepie deserves to be where he‚Äôs at, the D‚Äôamelios don‚Äôt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would they do that Mr beast you should take that away from them and they&rsquo;re probably not going to give it to anyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keem: Somebody fight slim</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Deji: i just did that&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This deserves to be 1 on trending because it shows proof of this allegation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parents weren‚Äôt even asked to join.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lmao I knew it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how Mr Beast calls giving away 300k a &ldquo;Game for fun&rdquo; what sum of money will it take for Mr. Beast to consider one of these a serious game LOL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like how keem talks about IQ when his entire career is built in talking about other people and never accomplishing anything for himself but riding successful people‚Äôs coat tails üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I the only one who came to read comments about Damelios cheating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it really doesn‚Äôt matter who won, they‚Äôre not getting the money, it goes to their subscribers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay I‚Äôm officially not a simp for Addison anymoreüò≠üò≠üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kwebbelkop should have won. He was the real MVP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was there when they cheated&hellip;.tik tok IQ be terrible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they should not of won charlie didn‚Äôt even know what state kentucky was that‚Äôs 4th or 3rd grade stuff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how were the damelios cheating if the ‚ÄúDamelio Family‚Äù were the ones in the contest. its a team effort but yea i can agree to them looking away for answers and help from potential spectators in their house</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can we just like get rid of TikTok stars, they‚Äôre like 15 and living in 3 mansions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder what its  called when a plane shhakes as a result of the air pressureü§î

<li>
<p>Also there was one where they asked what country it was and one girl said Asia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SteveWillDoIt doesn&rsquo;t make any money off ads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I hit the bell, selected all notifications&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>im finna get that Xbox and play some halo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keemstar with tim hortons only canadians will understand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so we gon act like we don&rsquo;t see the tim hortons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hEy dOnT aTtAcK mY fAvOurIte TiktOkErs! (does some dance)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I hit the BELL button and selected the all NOTIFICATIONS&rdquo;. Good luck to ALL of us!. :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Am I the only one that came here for everything else but the tiktok news? Honestly don‚Äôt care bout them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is everyone barely putting notifications on I&rsquo;ve had them since last year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be fair I‚Äôm sure they were tired of getting cheated on..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don‚Äôt want to be a simp or anything but Mr.Beast let all 4 of them compete and Mr.beast tweeted that he just did it for fun and there gonna give the money to fans anyways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that evreone Was playing of the damelios so they din t cheat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teacher: No cheating!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kids in the back: d&rsquo;amelio&rsquo;s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They weren‚Äôt cheating if other contestants also had help from their partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the cheating matters a bit but they are giving the money to fans so who cares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nobody cares if the damelios cheated it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre taking the money&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine being that spoiled rich without doing a damn thing to earn it, and still cheating to get more</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs not cheating? They competed as 4 and mr beast made that clear multiple times!?!?!

<li>
<p>Keem i don‚Äôt believe you i hit the bell 6 years ago and follow you everywhere I deserve this ps4 or xbox series X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The money doesn‚Äôt even go to Dixie Mrbeast said the winner has to give it to their fans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They just cheated on a 300,000 tourney and nothing is being done .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least Addison didn‚Äôt think Asia was a country like that Lexi girl did</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also Joes new background is literally just cringe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>About time they get some backfire, they are all so annoying and dont deserve they fame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was son funny even chandler was ‚Äú4v1‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was a disappointment to the YouTube community when the TikTokers won</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Today&rsquo;s fact: Every second, Americans collectively eat one hundred pounds of chocolate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yea idk there still isn&rsquo;t legit proof they cheated</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm so annoyed they cheated and feel that they shouldn‚Äôt have gotten the money, however, they have to give it all to their fans so I think there‚Äôs a little good in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Guys as soon as I get the scoop I&rsquo;m gonna keep you in the loo&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHO EVER READ THIS AND COMMENT, I HOPE U WILL BE SUCCESSFUL SOMEDAY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate that family, they&rsquo;re aren&rsquo;t even good &ldquo;creators.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>since the entire d&rsquo;amelio family was there, dream should have brought dteam and techno or schlatt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I need that ps5 I need and escape from my divorcing parents üò™</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yay, I did all of the steps :DDD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>why don&rsquo;t you ever bring up faze banks and how he is aways partying as well as everyone else or is it because you have a podcast together?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was so many deserving youtubers that should have gotten the money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by the way i said at the comments at the live saying: the d&rsquo;amelios are cheating and i was so mad that they cheated from one of my favourite youtubers wich is kwebbelkop

<p>Just terrible how the ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù Dixie and Charlie cheat to get money, those dumb gold diggers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheating doesn‚Äôt make yourself Smart, just making yourself very Thicker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8:30 is where they start talking about charli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The d&rsquo;amelio&rsquo;s video starts at 8:33</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tbh still confused on how they cheated?? The parents were there to answer too?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use me as a ‚ÄúI knew they were cheating‚Äù button</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about David‚Äôs house clip?? WtfüíÄ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sticking around for the video, but that giveaway has my attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel embarrassed living in LA right know</p>

<li>
<p>Whoever doesn&rsquo;t like the new studio obviously doesn&rsquo;t smoke weed ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p>

<p>I guess that Tiktok money ain&rsquo;t rolling in like it used to üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;HIT THE BELL, SELECTED ALL NOTIFICATIONS&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The damelos family not just had HUGE ADVANTAGES BUT THEY CHEATED</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs illegal what they did. They cheated their way to get 300k dollars. I don‚Äôt really know because it wasn‚Äôt an official contest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was so surprised at how good they were. Now I know&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>These tiktokers are like 15 and living in mansions. Also they have the IQ of a fetus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you just like this for memories. Machinima</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm so glad that people noticed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keemstar, i know they might anger you, but whats your thoughts on shadbase making a &ldquo;painting&rdquo; of your daughter?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There not cheating because before they started playing mr beast asked them before if the whole family was going to work together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everyone was talking abt Addison. Did y‚Äôall see that one girl who picked Asia as their country???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But they didn‚Äôt even get all the answers right they were just closer than the other people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think she just really needed the money lol üòÇ aww tik tok not bringing in enough revenue?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I knew the d&rsquo;amelios weren&rsquo;t smart i was so mad that they won i stayed up till 3 am to see the win</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once Tik tok dies the dammilos or however you spell it are screwed and that&rsquo;s s fact we all now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thing is that they wont be able to give the 300 grand away cause 99% of their fan base is under 18</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hit the bell good luck everyone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I subbed and put bell on best of luck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if dixie was allowed bring her family ksi should‚Äôve been able to bring the sidemen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄòClassifee tweeted out‚Äô</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MrBeast: ‚ÄúCheating isn‚Äôt tolerated at all‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Damelios: I like your funny words magic man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>D‚Äôamelio‚Äôs: holds phone in their hand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Came to see his latest video and noticed that his is still a loser</p>
</li>

<p>How am I just now finding this YouTube page‚Ä¶ I feel like I am so behind in life ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not anymore! Notifications on, and subscribed üíØ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Props to Addison Rae for actually being honest</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Edit: To everyone asking why I specifically mentioned Addison Rae, it&rsquo;s quite apparent that she lacks general knowledge from the answers she gave. But at least she didn&rsquo;t use dishonest means to cover up the fact that Tiktokers share a brain cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m never gonna get tired of commenting for a ps5 I&rsquo;m subbed with notis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They competed as the d‚Äôamelios not just du I or Charli d‚Äôamelio so they obv were allowed to do that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7:30 thank me later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So we are just now noticing he‚Äôs missing and it‚Äôs been 2 years!? Lmaoo wtf</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs sad how people admire these TikTok kids who go to party‚Äôs rn even though their killing people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay I mean he just helping mrbeast didn‚Äôt have a problem with it obviously</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are a entire team it&rsquo;s not cheating. It would be unfair for two teenagers to compete against full grown adults who also can have partners. Mr beast legit saw what was happening he would have told them to stop if it wasn&rsquo;t allowed, how you gonna tell him what&rsquo;s cheating on his own show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You have the best luck on earth if u win these types of giveaways so random out of millions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cough Xbox series X mMmMm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finally after years, we get help for E Tube. I have been watching his videos for the longest time, and now we have much more support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>well mrbeast did know they worked together.. He even joked and said &ldquo;since it was a 4v1 for the whole tournament, for the finals it will be a 1v1&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro the team was called the D‚ÄôAmelios just because Charlie and dixies face was on the board dosent said t was just them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I really want a console I never had one before I have a Nintendo switch üòû</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This seems like a good place to invade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How tf did the d‚Äôamelios cheat? The parents wear allowed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charli and Dixie are losers, they brought in their parents to help them out smh.

<li>
<p>Yesssszs I hate the d‚Äôamelios for winning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone send this to mrbeast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is funny cause when jimmy asked that question that had to do with decimals that those two guys got u can see dixie change her answer immediately after they showed their board. That why sometimes people need to be talking about what the damelios do cause the damelios have done multiple things that people dont even talk about and they dont even address it which is kind of unfair cause if it was another family the entire world will come for them but people treat the damelios &ldquo;especial&rdquo; treat every one the same if they did the same mistake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bro I have never liked Charlie and now I hate her even moreüò°üò°</p>

<p>Also them : lets cheat in mrbeast 300,000 head trivia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spoiler:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well it doesn‚Äôt really matter because they don‚Äôt keep the money, it‚Äôs given to charity or fans. Anyone who won had to give the money away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I were going to cheat I&rsquo;d have my headset on with a small earphone under the headset with someone telling me the answer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still curious why the rest of family went out of camera shot for last round</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literally ruined the entire game that&rsquo;s so annoying</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeaaa,dont care about tiktok news. Dislike for the tiktok news</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember watching the Magic Of Rahat guy years ago, used to be so entertained by those videos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>even if they did cheat, they don&rsquo;t keep the money. they donated it to charity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% That&rsquo;s cheating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually hate that Charlie won. She doesn&rsquo;t deserve to win</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I just realized that Charli isn‚Äôt gonna be a thing when tik tok is banned&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wished mrbeast takes the money and gives it to the others guy/girl that was about to win (btw thay are multi millionaires why would thay need 300k$)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ÄúI hit the bell, selected all notifications.‚Äù Good luck everyone! üòäüòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I hit the bell and all notifications &ldquo;ps I also subscribed</p>
