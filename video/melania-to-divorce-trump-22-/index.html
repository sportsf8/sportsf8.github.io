<p>When do you think Melania will divorce Donald? Leave a comment below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I bet her divorce lawyers find out what the media and the Dems haven&rsquo;t been able to: Donald&rsquo;s actual worth(money-wise, we already know he&rsquo;s worthless as a human being).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WHY SHOULD SHE CARE NOW SHE WAS BOUGHT AND PAID FOR SHE RUN WHEN SHE WANTS TO</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She used him to get her &amp; her family here. He probably holds her child over her head with the threat of getting full custody &amp; deportation. She&rsquo;s not legal. We never got the presser last year in September to show us her VISA??? I feel sorry for the kid&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lolololol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it&rsquo;s about time what type of woman put up with a husband goes to bed with another woman and one that you pay like 130,00 thousand dollars to buy her silence plus all his comment about women so what are you waiting for to divorce him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MELANIA HATES TRUMPS GUTS, BET THEY HAVEN&rsquo;T SLEPT TOGETHER IN A FEW YEARS, IF NOT MANY YEARS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to wash your hand 10K times after your hand is touched by a snake oil hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump is NASTY!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LOL &ldquo;It is what it is&rdquo; have a look at him why would she</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>#pardonmelania üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who seriously gives a shit?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh bless him. Soooooo sad, sorry, not sorry!!!!!!!!! Ha ha ha Mr Trump!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s do the world a favour and go live in trump&rsquo;s never ever land !! Trump uve made America laughing stock off the world?? So many lives lost on battlefield&rsquo;s you have never been on sent the different countries and colour&rsquo;s  and American&rsquo;s to do wat you hadn&rsquo;t!! THE BALL&rsquo;S TO DO ,  your a joke!! Covid19 is your nail in coffin!!! Your shift üôè BUNKER boy trump??????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disgusting to sleep with Shrek that doesn&rsquo;t transform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The smile on my face. I just wanna watch someone steal her away and rub it in his face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are you doing this type of story. This is so below the progressive movement. Who the F cares about the marriage of the vile person who is unqualified for a job. Talk about this in your personal time, there is so much real news to talk about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her contract must be up for renewal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Putin would hold his hand, if he asked nicely

</li>
<li>
<p>just prepare for the photo of trump at mar a lago shoveling to the mail box in his underwear getting the paper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s had sex with him ü§¢ü§Æ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ay ay ay&hellip;poor fat orange thing&hellip;.she doesn&rsquo;t even want to feel your old fat little hand touching her. May be $130.000 dollars would help??? It did with Miss Daniels!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What, she&rsquo;s just finding out that he&rsquo;s an asshole NOW?  She knew who he was.  Now she figures she can dump him safely, while still living in the style to which she has become accustomed.  They&rsquo;re two of a kind.  My punishment for them would be to force them to work at McDonald&rsquo;s&ndash; try living on poverty wages, you useless pos&rsquo;s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is actually kind of sad. I don&rsquo;t like Trump, in fact, I think he&rsquo;s a horrific excuse for a Man and a Human Being. But having said that, I can&rsquo;t help but feel some curious little pang of sympathy for him. Unfortunately, I ALSO doubt that Trump himself would feel that sort of empathy for anyone else &hellip; what&rsquo;cha goona do ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are saying&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She represents 70% of the country right there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GET THE HINT TRUMP SHE HATES YOU HEHEHE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hahaha SAD! I hope she does and we vote this fascist dictator out! Vote!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melania is no fool. She will stay there exactly as long is necassary for her and Baron. The second it is not beneficial and she has nothing to lose (The Pre-nup expires) she will be out of their faster that Road Runner fleeing Wily Coyote!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melanie Trump literally will do anything and put up with anything for money and privilege. She married the devil for goodness sake. She made her bed, she can lie in it and I believe she will because money to her is everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t giva a dam about her divorcing his ass, she not none that either</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melania is not divorcing Trump. That would defeat the whole purpose of marrying him in the first place. She‚Äôs waiting for him to die to reap the benefits. She never loved him&hellip; She‚Äôs always had goals. She didn‚Äôt go this far for nothing!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She doesn&rsquo;t want them Stormy Daniels cooties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She knew what he was from the beginning.  Like attracts like.  (No empathy here)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hell yes she got what she wanted out of the scumbag &hellip; Trump wanted to use her to help him down the steps, he wasn&rsquo;t trying to hold her hand in a loving relationships</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares,no give a dam only Fox news does, they see this has Earth breaking news, get all the cash, casino, golf course, you can, when you&rsquo;re married is over in 2021</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She knows where that hand has been.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he just wants to help her carry her bag :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melania had better get her money now, while it remains, and while he remains able to even give it.

<li>
<p>DIVORCE NOW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DIVORCE NOW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;ll be divorced in 2021</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All I saw was a fabulous Birkin bag and her trying to keep her dress from flying up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think she is also trying to make sure her skirt doesn&rsquo;t blow up from any errant gusts. No one wants that to happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What noticed is that Baron towers over his father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dear god - I actually feel sorry for Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No sure it was a real marriage anyway. Besides who cares.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lizard skin come on you&rsquo;re killing me with nicknames for Trump ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t work because he tried to grab her by the hand. He&rsquo;s clearly in decline xD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That is why he has to pay for sex at $130,000.00.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lizard skin come on you&rsquo;re killing me with nicknames for Trump ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bought and paid for, I own you. I don&rsquo;t  feel sorry for her. Because he is rich, is it not prostitution? Contractual sex for money. Any thoughts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conservatives tried to say she was stopping the wind from blowing her skirt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHE&rsquo;S NOT WEARING A FUCKING SKIRT AHAHAHAHAHAH</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking forward to her First Lady&rsquo;s speech at the RNC !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>who gives a shit? this is the end of journalism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He needs her to hold him up!  Maybe she will dump him off the coast near Mar a Lago!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nobody who knows drumpf likes him, nobody who likes drumpf knows him.

</li>
<li>
<p>Come on guys ..this was obviously a attempted purse snatching</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything Trump has is fake.  Fake billionaire, fake degree and fake marriage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see her divorcing him, she&rsquo;s holding out for him to die.  ü§£üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unless&hellip;  She wants to get alimony before he goes to jail after losing this election!  üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is holding on for him to pass to get all the money she can get. Its what gets her out of bed every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trump alone? Never. He has him, himself and him to keep him company in his universe of one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reality of there whole marriage was just money immigration papers nothing more. Mostly pathetic for the trump followers think this is a perfect/ what marriage is about üôÑ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mrs. Obama would hold Obama&rsquo;s hand no matter what!!! That is one of the many reasons why Trump hates Obama!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think he gets laid anymore ü§£üíÄ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fake mate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shes trying not to fall, her hair is covering her face, she cant see</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does anyone know what could have happened (at Fox News, for example) if J. Biden paid whores and actually requested London to relocate their Golf Tournament to his Golf Course? Honest answers please!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for Barron and Melania. They actively avoid the spotlight and are never seen smiling around Trump. What a sad family life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is right after the forward was released from Cohen&rsquo;s book. It&rsquo;s not about love with her. It&rsquo;s about him embarrassing her. He was only trying to hold her hand for optics in the first place and she knows that And I&rsquo;m SURE was double disgusted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is Melania still sleeping on a different floor of the WH?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A first lady, who Never smiles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not until she was in the presence of,  President Obama, that is..üòÖ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking down those steep steps in stilettos heels would be a challenge! I&rsquo;m sure his grubby little orange hands pulling her along would knock her off balance. They deserve each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love it: Trump the Lizard - how about that, QAnon&hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soon as he loses it&rsquo;s a shoe in. !!!

</li>
<li>
<p>Ha, ha Orange turd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s probably waiting for his ex-attorney&rsquo;s Cohen coming book to see how many hush-up checks did Trump write to women like Stormy Danielis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It  couldn&rsquo;t  have  happened  to a  nicer   guy.ü§†üôÇüòÄüòÅ IN  the end his little  hands  is  all that he  has left.  IT  IS  WHAT IT IS üòâüòâüòâ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;ll no doubt blame that on Obama Too !?  She&rsquo;s heard if you go black you don&rsquo;t go back !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should have divorced him after he cheated on her in 2015.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Mike Pence will hold his hand&hellip;lol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heard Melania&rsquo;s been playing Peter, Paul and Mary&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Leaving on a Jet Plane.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come on you both know she was with Maxwell for little while, why you think they give her to trump SHE HAS NO TALENT as they both said just look for kids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step stairs, windy, holding a bag, holding down dress not to fly up and not wanting to hold hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SHE DESERVES BETTER THAN TRUMP AKA BUNKER BABY DUMBER THAN A ROCK CRYING LIES LIES AND LIES NO CREDIBLY NOR ACCOUNTABILITY NO TRANSPARENCY DRAFT DODGER HE HAS FAILED US BOYCOTT FOX NEWS COWARDS LIES AND LIES VOTE BLUE  VOTE BLUE NOV 3RD 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any person with sense knew their marriage was a financial arrangement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look at those sausage fingers grabbing at her POOR arm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She¬¥s afraid his hand have ccovid -19 !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a sad. Melania is quiet, but to put in this position is not fair to her. This is too much for an immigrant that can barely speak English, yo put in from of humiliating circumstances because Trump is selfish, ignorant , and could careless about people but himself. It is very sad. If you notice she really did not anything, but that &ldquo;Be Best&rdquo;  but how can you enforce that when you have husband that is a lier, and a disgusting moron. I saw Byron with them, and he is taller than Trump , and he is only a teenager. Huh!! Just protect your child Melania, do not let him be like Trump Jr, Ivanka, Eric. Tiffany is fine, Byron will be too because you are there for him !!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Caaaan you feel the loooooove tonight&hellip;?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just the hand.. she&rsquo;s actually trying to get away from the guy but is only stopped by the fact that they&rsquo;re walking down a pretty narrow gangway with handrails. She looks like she would&rsquo;ve jumped off that thing if it hadn&rsquo;t been for those handrails &hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human contact? I think he just didn&rsquo;t wanna slip down another ramp and was grasping onto her for his dear life;D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She marries someone who is old enough to be her father.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was just smart enough to get a pre-dumptual agreement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want a diehard Trumper to comment on that video.

<li>
<p>She is a typical trophy wife for me. Completely unattractive and devoid of personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She is probably more intelligent than he is though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;s just scared of going down stairs. He must have fallen as a child. Or been pushed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only a fool would remain married to Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been saying she&rsquo;s gonna divorce him all year</p>

Pity is something she does not deserve has SHE KNEW WHAT THE HELL DONALD SWAMP IS AND WOULD DO AND YET STAYED AT HIS HORRIBLE SIDE, EVEN AFTER CHEATING ON HER WHILE PREGNANT PEOPLE!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We really don&rsquo;t care. Do u??????</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My sister suggested that Melania was trying to prevent her dress from blowing up. I‚Äôd rather think she was shunning him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aha! We have Proof Positive that Trump is a Purse-Snacher!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soo blinded by hate you people are truly blind</p>

<p>If he falls she won&rsquo;t be dragged down .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They‚Äôre both repulsive human beings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She was practicing social distancing before coronavirus hit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give Trump a break.  He just needed some help getting down the stairs like at West Point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how she wakes up everyday reading all the hate about her husband!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, IF she&rsquo;s going to divorce that creep and write a tell all book about that moron, it will make her richer than he is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She only married him for his money and the kid is not his. Yeah she can&rsquo;t stand him. Neither can most of the country and the world</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s obviously clear why that BOZO pays for sex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NO WOMAN WOULD EVER TOUCH HIM UNLESS HE PAID HER A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes me happy to see trump getting embarrassed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to &ldquo;hand&rdquo; it to her the way she treats him; he has earned it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The marriage is fake - just like everything else about Trump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wats up brotha u home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melania following Fauci&rsquo;s advice not to hold hands</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If She announce there separating that would be a Real October  surprise. Wonder how fox news  or Hannity would react.

<li>
<p>Most powerful people in the world: 1) Putin, 2) Melania&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who cares???? They‚Äôre two of the same kind&hellip;grifters!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as his sorry ass is hauled off to prison. You gotta believe she can&rsquo;t wait to get out of the friggin WH, so who knows, if he does somehow pull off a re-election, she may say bye then.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And i imagine it will turn into a big circus, where we never know the true details, it may just end up being a &lsquo;Separation&rsquo;, but she&rsquo;ll be spied running round the world with all kinds of jet-setting playboys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brrrrrrr. Gettin&rsquo; the brush.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kind of rubbish? It‚Äôs obvious that she is trying to keep her dress from flying. So she was supposed to just forget it and hold his hand.? Common. Bash him for the right reason. That‚Äôs is why repub hates demo media and vice versa. Oh. I forgot. U are not media. Just a hate channel. Much like trump Twitter. Say what u like and gets away from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neither one where wedding bands. She got her chain migration done. You bet the divorce is on as soon as he‚Äôs out of office. TRE45ON 175000 ‚ò†Ô∏è deaths. 71 days.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>This is breaking news thanks ,fantastic work you, nail it. Out standing   PROPHETS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s as big a piece of crap as he is.  I couldn&rsquo;t care less if she divorces him or not, I&rsquo;d care more if she stood up and publicly condemned this white racist conman rather than silently condoning him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She merely tolerates him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not his son lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never ! She is exactly the same as him! She loves his BRAIN! NO!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looks like he is going for her wallet to rob her just like everyone else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Trump loses the election then Malania will leave the Trump &amp; start the affair with Hohny Depp..‚ò∫</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She probably can&rsquo;t wait to get away from that orange cheating slob</p>

<p>I love how much Franny hates trump. Not for any logical reason. But for the fact that he‚Äôs not letting her racial group take over the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of course, she has to divorce him. His social life is ruined, no one in their circle is going to be seen with him and that includes at his own funeral. In order for her son to marry the right person and be in the right social circles she has to divorce him. It&rsquo;s going to happen immediately!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>definitely not a Chump fan, but I think she was just trying to to keep her clothing down while holding on to the railing&hellip;let&rsquo;s not make things up, you lose credibility if you do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything you have said bout Trump has been total bullshit so far.  And I am sure that this one is another one of your childish lies about him.  You wish she would but I am delighted to tell you that as usual you are wrong for he millionth time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I guess none of u have been married, this is par for the course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Melania speculation is projection. We want her to dislike him because we do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its about fucking time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He&rsquo;ll just call his buddy vlad and buy a younger version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;d rather hold her Birkin. That&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s here, dumb dumb. She doesn&rsquo;t care about your political career to fake it for the cameras. You&rsquo;re just THAT repulsive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe she&rsquo;ll hook up with Vladdy Putin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has any reporter out right asked him why his wife has refused to hold his hand on multiple occasions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hard being the devil&rsquo;s bride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hell, I&rsquo;d been taking bets on this some time back, you wait and see she will be gone with &lsquo;her&rsquo; son within hours of his &lsquo;de-throning&rsquo;!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She has a immigrant boyfriend named Alejandro</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;In the original marriage contract&hellip;.&rdquo; Hilarious!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You guys said give him credit for what he has accomplished then named some businesses and property &hellip; All that was left to him from daddy dumb dumb he has done nothing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>melania must be checking the electoral</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>college projections and sees how awful</p>
</li>

<p>they are for the orange messiah of magats.

<li>
<p>got her bags packed and ready. trump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the time of the election he&rsquo;ll be denying all knowledge of having ever met her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Property doesn&rsquo;t have rights!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for fox news to come up with an explanation. Lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate your video titles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His own hot beautiful (albeit ditzy) wife he bought does not actually love him? . . .  If she divorces him, she&rsquo;ll drop the news 1-2 weeks before the election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I doubt that it very much.  She sold her body and soul for a Gucci handbag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It makes me so happy to see Trump not being loved even by his own wife. The more miserable Trump is, the better</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guys, that&rsquo;s why she holds her purse in her left hand! So it&rsquo;s difficult for donnie dumbass to grab onto. She also wears coats and sweaters draped around her shoulders so her arms aren&rsquo;t readily available to extend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hate stories like this&hellip; Who cares about their stupid, fake marriage?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand the man but their marriage is their marriage. That has nothing to do with getting him out. Don&rsquo;t lower yourself to his level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her ass is just as evil as him, she isn‚Äôt leaving that meal ticket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only person I would watch at the Republican convention is MELANIA but I know the words she will speak will not be hers.  I believe he has humiliated her with every disgusting affair that has been made public. At some point you realize that selling your dignity for money destroys your essence of being. You can fall out of love as easily as you fall in love</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh god, it&rsquo;s just cross wires (and I can&rsquo;t stand trump), she tried to hold her dress down with her right hand, realised she needed to hold the railing with it so turned to her left hand - trump didn&rsquo;t know what she was thinking so tried again but she insisted on keeping her dress down. Her concentration was on holding her hand close to her thigh so her dress wouldn&rsquo;t blow up. Damage Report - you don&rsquo;t need to spread bs to get trump out - it makes you look pernicious - we&rsquo;ve got enough of that already - also, spreading confusion is immoral. Reports like this give credibility to trump&rsquo;s claims of Fake news.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melanija (the spelling on her Yugoslav birth certificate, and she&rsquo;s a &ldquo;birther&rdquo; LOL) must be thoroughly fed up with Trump. She scored big when she landed such a rich john, but the pleasure of that must have worn off long ago. Imagine how she feels now waking up beside that tub of lard. I&rsquo;m sure she took the Stormy Daniels (a much prettier woman) thing to heart as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than trying to grab her by the hand&hellip;..perhaps he should have grabbed her by the üêà</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their marriage is a business contract.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She lives in a suburban DC house with her parents&hellip;..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel sorry more for their son. Hang in there. Be smart. Associate with people who you could look up to.</p>

<p>Hes still going to win ,his supporters dont give 2 fucks about how he treats women because they treat thier women the same .way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nah, she was holding her dress from the wind&hellip; She is as evil as he is. Malaria will never divorce him because she is an mail order bride end knows that she cheated on visa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Owwwwwwweeeee. His hoar that he found on orgy island is gonna divorce himmmmm. Ouch.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Who gives a F&amp;@k. There‚Äôs plenty of gross woman that want her spot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melanoma has a separate bedroom on a separate floor of the WH; she took a long time getting to the WH after Dementia Trump was elected; she&rsquo;s cancelled (official) trips with Dementia; she doesn&rsquo;t play golf; she doesn&rsquo;t campaign much with him; official WH photos of FLOTUS usually don&rsquo;t include Dementia; it probably doesn&rsquo;t help that she is marginally more popular than he is; and she&rsquo;s rumoured to have her own squeeze back in Manhattan.  I don&rsquo;t think the two of them are destined to grow ancient peacefully together&hellip;</p>

<p>Her hands are bigger than his üò≠üò≠üò≠</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can see 5hat this is a loveless marriage,  I would bet money that she&rsquo;s only in it right now is because he pleaded or is paying her to stay while he&rsquo;s president,  I don&rsquo;t think Melania can go another four years of this idoit,  and we can&rsquo;t eather.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well all I can say is this is his last chance at a having a relationship. As I&rsquo;ve heard and seen she looks unhappy and who knows how many nasty names she has been called. He sleeps alone, that&rsquo;s if he ever sleeps. The only time she smiles is in another man&rsquo;s face. That should tell you something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Melania is also a grifter, she is there for one reason $$$$$$$$$. Ivanka is the real firs-lady and Melania knows it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHERE THAT HAND HAS BEEN</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe he was trying to steal her purse.  He probably needs the money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow.  I had no idea a gold digger could get tired of her free ride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s slapped that raggedy hand away a couple of times before on videotape. She stays mad at the Bozo. ü§£ This marriage is staged and for financial convenience.</p>

Why do we not hear about this book on American channels?iIt presents the case that there are 67  sexual assault charges against DT,That oughta make for some good bedtime read!
