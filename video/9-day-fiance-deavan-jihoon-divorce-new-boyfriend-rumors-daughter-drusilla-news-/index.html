<p>Why is it every couple likes to announce that they are going through marital problems on social media?? They need to keep their issues private because they KNOW people are going to take any sign of mess and run with it. Nothing good comes from posting your issues on social media, in fact, social media makes it worse. I don&rsquo;t understand why they have to run to social media&hellip; RUN TO A THERAPIST, RUN TO A COUNSELOR! I&rsquo;m tired of watching Divorce Court on instagram, please keep your issues private and then maybe there will be less outside interference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soooo you can insult Jihoon&rsquo;s manhood, but NOT question Deavan&rsquo;s parenting skills? And any1 with common sense can tell Deavan ain&rsquo;t in luv with Jihoon &amp; probably has a &ldquo;friend.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deaven‚Äôs Aunt has threatened her life before, so maybe there is some truth to what he is saying. Her family is &amp;$#@%&amp;!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan is always the victim! Now she has a boyfriend while she‚Äôs still married? üò≥ Jihoon‚Äôs post basically says to stop attacking Deavan and her mother, nothing more. Can‚Äôt believe Sharrell is siding with Deavan just because she‚Äôs her friendüòí</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting a little bored with &ldquo;90 days of syphilis!&ldquo;üòÅ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You literally are hating on Jihoon because you ‚Äúthink‚Äù he‚Äôs going to the blogs??</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Step down. üíÄ. This guy is literally suicidal because of all the hate he‚Äôs getting online. No need to make up lies about him üòëüòë</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well she should not have had her child on tv</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love your videos when talk about anyone but the people you&rsquo;re close with.. you get way too biased by the conversations u have with them. She should not have showed her child on TV if she was not ready for judgement. Ashley did not show her kids and she did not face the criticism. Jihoon seems emotionally distraught and I dont see you making the connection with how her ex made posts all those years ago also emotionally distraught. Deavan seems really toxic, every man she has a kid with gets depressed and things spin out of control. Hence her past with her ex I heard his new girl has never had domestic disputes with him legally. Takes 2 to tango. If she didnt want people in her dirt she shouldn&rsquo;t have subjected herself to being on TV. If she didnt want a child with someone she hardly knew and was not ready to become a parent she knows how babies are made and should have took proper precautions. This is all common sense. But your convos with her seem to leave you forgetting all this. Oh well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell, you mentioned that Deavon is your friend why are you doing a show about her.  You will not be fair. I like your show but you are a bias person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you&rsquo;re talking about them just as much as any other blogger so why are you acting so upset about the others?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the heck does she justify having a new boyfriend when she is still married to her husband?! Jumping onto a new man before you have even filed divorce is disgusting. Jihoon has every right to be mad that his wife is getting her clam tickled by another man.  Deavan was the one who exploited her children for fame.  She knew from the very first season that her kid was getting roasted and still she comes back for a second season. This is Deavans fault. Her childs unruly behavior is her fault. That terrible terrible name is her fault. She knew that the kid was going to catch it for her awful name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell - stop hating on Jihoon - I know you are friends with Deavon, but it&rsquo;s not right to throw Jihoon under the bus!!  Jihoon is a first time dad and has not been around his son for more than a few weeks -  the two of them should have taken precautions when they decided to have sex the first day they met - and since Deavon already has a child out of wedlock you would think she would know better.  Sorry, I have to say it like it is, Sharrell.  I love your videos but this is too much!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Please Deavan stop getting pregnant without knowing the guy well. Bringing a child to this world is something very serious. So immature she got pregnant when She meet Jihoon for the first time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Girl you are friends with Deavon. Maybe don‚Äôt report anything on this couple because you are always going to be on Deavons side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devan is also at fault. Stop blaming Jihoon for everything üíÄ. And stop shaming him for crying, we are all human.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan is self centered. Look at me. Look at me!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m losing interest here, you are way to biased. Why are you so ride and die for Deavon?

<li>
<p>Everything is one sided. The parents shouldn&rsquo;t be involved at all. Her mom is portrayed as an awful person, but she provided the footage. His mom is portrayed as meddling and unaccepting. It is all too much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is my adult conversation Jehu is a child she knew this from the get-go if you‚Äôre going to get on television and you‚Äôre bringing your daughter into it like she did she has to be responsible for what is what are people going to say there are haters out there so don‚Äôt go on TV if you don‚Äôt want your life exposed I am tired of this conversation I know this is your show and you have your opinion but my opinion is this girl is usChildish as he is so I hope we can move on from Devan and Jihoon And I know you like her and that‚Äôs fine that‚Äôs your opinion that‚Äôs your show but it‚Äôs enough already they are getting more then there 15minutes of fame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavon is moving on to next boyfriend and another child.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jihoon, please let her go. She&rsquo;s no good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;ll be pregnant again by someone new soon.She clearly has a ridiculous decision making process.Who in 2020 from America ,who already has one child, then gets pregnant from a one night stand in Korea ,decides they must have the baby ,and marry the stranger you can only speak to through a dodgy Amazon  translator ?Idiot tax?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The social media isn‚Äôt the route to go&hellip; look at Paul&hellip; JS!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan is a spaced out narcissist. The pity parties are tired. It takes two&hellip;it is not Jihoon&rsquo;s fault alone. Deavan lives with her crazy mom, but who is forcing her daughter to keep traveling to Korea&hellip;just to go over there and continuing to demean and belittle him?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt see a chance this marriage could work. I just don‚Äôt understand why anyone would put their private relationship information on social media.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell I love your channel but you‚Äôve become biased, please read your comments 90% of us cannot be wrong. For what it‚Äôs worth I don‚Äôt feel Jihoon and deavan working out as there are problems and immaturity with both parties. I do send all involved my love ü¶ã</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought this was all because people were looking deep into Deavan, finding out who Drascilla‚Äôs real dad is &amp; that people r taking pics of him &amp; his son who is Drascilla‚Äôs age. I didn‚Äôt think this had anything to do w/ Jihoonü§î</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frauded by TLC  was LIVE on IG last night &amp; this is how I took it &amp; people were commenting about what they thought about Drascilla &amp; her being brat, wild child, parented etc, then in came Deavan but she didn‚Äôt talk, she just posted little things, nothing much. Think this is all people ASSUMING it‚Äôs all about Jihoon?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I like Deavan &amp; Jihoon but he is just to immature for this marriage to last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell you are blinded mh deaven.  She and her mother are toxic people. Jihoon is better off without her.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She chose to be on the show you don‚Äôt get to pick and choose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan stop having boyfriends. You are looking for emotional support, and everything else in a man? Big mistake. Wait get more mature and get emotionally stable first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She should have never got pregnant on purpose by a childish stranger. If she had dated him longer she would have realized how immature he was.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She knew he wasn‚Äôt ready, the only reason she decided to go to Korea was because of filming purposes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan is a horrible mother&hellip; she keeps playing the victim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for Jihoon because I had a nightmare and Deavans mom was screaming at me&hellip; it was terrifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you‚Äôre going to report you should stay neutral. Just my opinion.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TLC edits to make things and people look awful</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What was said about her daughter?  Was she diagnosed with something that explains her behavior so that we can give Deavon benefit of the doubt?</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Jihoon and Deavon shouldn&rsquo;t be married at all because they don&rsquo;t know each other. They had a one-night stand and she got pregnant. That&rsquo;s no reason to get married.  He should support her, but that&rsquo;s about it. She also needs to step up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WE CAN ALWAYS AGREE TO DISAGREE !!!!! üíØüíØüíØ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come on- she paid for the place‚Äî stop being one sidedü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èshe and her mom gang up on him- are you serious!! She runs to her mom for everything!! She‚Äôs a mommy‚Äôs girl and he‚Äôs a mommy‚Äôs man‚Äî Stop picking sides. Blog and be fair not one sided. Girl‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new Asian man has a great source of income and is successful, and they travel to see one another. Wondering about those micro condoms and what her arrangement with Jihoon will be like? He owned being a flawed human, and while immature as all bloody hell, he doesn‚Äôt deserve this. That NDA is on shaky ground for darn sure. Hope he goes to college or a trade school, because being a delivery driver that takes naps, just won‚Äôt ever support him. These parents need to have space and a private conversation. It‚Äôs over for certain. Hoping people will please STOP saying awful things about the children, and let this couple handle this situation, far away from the media. Prayers for this little family. üôèüíîüôè</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I felt bad for her but seems like another one who went on TV to promote her career and get plastic surgery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devon is buying you. We can&rsquo;t take you seriously when shes giving you money and all of a sudden take her side on everything even if shes wrong. You&rsquo;re going to lose your audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the end of the day You are totally wrong. Stop throwing jhoon under the bus. You are sooo biased its sickening. It takes two!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deaven has no parenting skills either her mom child not train so go home and raise your children you and your mom go to someone country  and he disrespectful with drama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know that in a lot of circumstances from the mistakes that parents can make, it should be &ldquo;keep the kids out of it&rdquo; as children are sacred.  However, Deavan &amp; definitely her mom, are 2 grown ups w/a small child they&rsquo;re both raising &amp; what did Deavan think was gonna happened when she signed up for BOTH of them to be filmed on the, not new &amp; most popular, INTERNATIONAL television show? C&rsquo;mon&hellip;. More than anything she wanted the money &amp; the &ldquo;fame&rdquo;! She didn&rsquo;t think of the ramifications about her &amp; her child&rsquo;s privacy from the fallout afterwards? Not buying it as this leads me to her poor parenting skills. Once you have a child &hellip; EVERY DECISION FROM THAT POINT FORWARD IS MADE W/THE CHILDS BEST INTREST IN MIND FIRST! NOW she wants the PUBLIC to leave her kid out of it? SHE certainly didn&rsquo;t!! The whole unnecessary drama of last week&rsquo;s episode was ABOUT her kid!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the rumors of them splitting started when Deavan went back to the states , changed her youtube channel name and removed videos he posted on there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s really sad enough working it how you just attack him like that you can think you know the whole story but do you really..??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You&rsquo;re reporting should be bias. Taking her side because she called in, not cool. Maybe Sharrell you should put yourself in check. I usually like your video, but I&rsquo;m very disappointed. . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel that you are really biased.  You seem to always be on Deavan&rsquo; s side. You should not report on this couple anymore.  It will hurt your credibility.  Deavan is  not a good mother.  She is incredibly  irresponsible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to my sores the rumors are coming from Deavan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t feel like you are being fair to judge. It&rsquo;s not his responsibility to chase the daughter. This is a discipline problem. That is what everyone is upset about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Jihoon is right to split or even spread rumors the way she treats him is awful always nagging and always yelling. Even though he wasn&rsquo;t ready doesn&rsquo;t qualify u to become a major b. Also, if they do divorce it might be better for everyone. Also to point out, most men and some women on this show need some growing up to do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm so over Deavon and her wild child. I think that Jihoon was ABUSED by Deavon and her mom. Regardless of how irresponsible he is, no one deserves to be treated the way he was. If they are splitting up, that‚Äôs probably better than all the fighting that was going on. All that fighting is so bad when children are involved and may be witness to it

<p>Sharrell you were very rude to your callers because of Deavon calling in and sorry to say this and I have never seen you do anything like that ,I love to listen to you,Perry, GEO and Adam it‚Äôs always so good, a lot of us know the truth and you know there is always 2 sides to a story and then the truth, love you but I  felt very shaded just keeping it real</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs interesting how you were stating Asuelo is young to give him benefit of the doubt about raising a family. But why not for Jihoon?</p>

<li>
<p>Thank God! Jihoon dodged a bullet! I feel bad that he won‚Äôt get any parental rights but I‚Äôm not surprised that Devan would do this. Sorry Sharrell but I can‚Äôt defend Deven, she already has a new man.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Things happen for reason. This couple need to call it quits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell, I am soo disappointed in the way your show is heading.I was in the chat when Deavon came in and the way you took money from her is disgusting. No wonder you are constantly singing her praises and refusing to treat her like everyone else. Where are your morals and ethics? Why would you take money from her? If you want to keep your audience you are going to have to do better. I&rsquo;m on the verge of not watching you any longer but I&rsquo;m trying to hang in there. I think you need to be honest, do some soul searching, and discuss this on a show. As for not discussing a child, I actually totally agree. The issue I have with Deavon is that if she cared so much about protecting her child why put her on the show? Why not film around her? Why is Druscilla a part of the actual storyline?  As viewers are we supposed to ignore Druscilla, who is front and center of the story that her mother put her in? You seem to care more about protecting her than Deavon does. To sum this up, you need to check yourself and your biases otherwise many of us are going to move on to other shows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your wrong, Sharrell. Deavan knew exactly who she was marrying when she married him. Everything is Jihoons fault. Deavan got pregnant along with Jihoon. Deavan moves to Korea for the second time knowing good and well what was up. Your to biased on this one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even this lady misspelled Drascilla‚Äôs name! Ha! The thing is Jihoon doesn‚Äôt get paid anything at all from TLC. Who cares??????? Let him talk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>??? She alred have another guy. And you still are on her side?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sherrell are you playing Jihoon blame game to girl stay out if it you said you are Deavan friends excuse me you said you don&rsquo;t get involved with your customers when you were talking about Alma. Deavan is abusive to Jihoon everything is his fault Deavan doesn&rsquo;t do no wrong but she knew from the beginning Jihoon didn&rsquo;t have any money yet she keeps going back in forth to Korea. I think 90 day fiance is over with Deavan she is also blaming TLC for their editing just get her out of 90 day fiance its getting boring she just want to be fame but do it on your own and stay in America. Nothing wrong With Jihoon going to social media his being blame for everything even for the wild child that he didn&rsquo;t even raise, I would tell Jihoon Run. Tell your friend Deavan to watch Doubling down with the Derricos they have fourteen kids they are all well behaved and the parents don&rsquo;t blame each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team #jihoon Devon made her bed.  And ran back to the u.s.a . Her daughters old enough to know better and not run into traffic. She&rsquo;s not perfect obviously. But her childish reaction is 100 times worst then his. He owns his mess up. She blames everyone but herself. She jumped into the bed first date. She&rsquo;s just as in it as he is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought we&rsquo;re supposed to &ldquo;leave kids out of it&rdquo; and yet their names are being used for click-baiting in video titles, hmm&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you for real? You seriously blaming Jihoon for the split rumours getting out? How about the Deavan is not only in your ear but is all up in the ear with the blogger who do the story about their divorce &amp; her new boyfriend. Jihoon only confirmed it AFTER the news came out.  Deavan did a live with no wedding ring BEFORE the story came out &amp; BEFORE Jihoon confirmed it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>annoying couple&hellip;.what were they thinking having that little boy&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavon and Jihoo both of them really needs to learn how to grow up and stop acting like children and stop being absorbed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These people,should get to know each other and get married before they bring innocent children into the world.  What are the chances this youngest child will get to really know his father who lives across,the world?   This woman has 2 kids, by different men and neither one of them was her husband when she got pregnant.  What does this tell us about HER level of maturity and responsibility?   These two are more of a matched set than people will admit.  And now, she has TWO kids without father figures in their lives.  What now?  Bring on baby daddy number 3?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GIVE THIS ADVICE TO PAUL NOT JIHOON. PAUL IS ALMOST 40 AND NOT ACTING AS THE HEAD OF A FAMILY/HOUSEHOLD WHO CARES ABOUT HIS CHILDREN SHOULD ACT!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan always looks miserable. I don‚Äôt think she ever looked happy with Jihoon. She obviously cannot be without a man. She has children with men that are not good for her. Don‚Äôt know if she has moved on to another man, but she needs to stop and take a break. Unfortunately the 90 day attention and the media gets the best of them. They become addicted without realizing that some things should stay private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only person that is defending Deavan is Sharrell. If you take the time and read ALL the post every time you speak about Deavan no one agrees with you. Deavan and Jihoon are mirror images both are irresponsible, both run to social media for everything. Everything you just said you can repeat to Deavan. He‚Äôs a loser, he hasn‚Äôt suprisse us any of with his action, just Deavan! But there‚Äôs a reason people are defending him and not her. She mean as hell to him. Not once we seen her act like a loving wife. That she‚Äôs in love with him. She takes no responsibility for any of her part in this. She played with her children lives. She puts all the faults in everyone else. She‚Äôs alway in social media laying out her drama and making her look like a victim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>None of us know the whole story you literally thought up that he‚Äôs going to the blogs when we don‚Äôt even know that&hellip; ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan&rsquo;s new boyfriend is an Asian model. She still got yellow fever üòÜ

<p>THE ISH HAS HIT THE FAN ! LAWD HAVE MERCY!! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò≠ü§£</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d give him more credit for holding back after the treatment he received from deavan and her mom</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember she threatened his life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your siding with Devon, you are biased because Devon gives money for your blog!!! She whines all the time, her mom is CRAZY as hell!! Jahoon is just to immature!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devan is a problem all by herself&hellip;you all love to side with the wrong person&hellip;she shouldn&rsquo;t date and should try birth control seeing how she like to just hook up&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should step aside with this one Sherell, you friends with his wife. Also I didn‚Äôt here you mention her going on the media. Actually she was the first one who went to the media. Think back when you was on Amber side everybody was wrong in your eye sight about her. You see how that turn out. Be bias and step away let Perry and Geno handle this one. Because you can‚Äôt be fair</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If true not shocked. She really had no ties to korea to begin with. She was looking for something fun and got pregnant. Idk jihoons motives. But i think jihoon stated his past relationships only lasted a few months. I am doubtful he was looking to settle down. Most guys don&rsquo;t look for marriage until they are at a certain stage in their life. (More secure) And his history makes me think there is a good chance he usually just looked for fun and companionship not looking for a wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think they broke up and I‚Äôm sad they could not work it out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love deaven I really do but she didn‚Äôt make a wise choice getting pregnant by somebody she didn‚Äôt know real well. She‚Äôs 2 for 2 now. It‚Äôs time to grow up and make wiser choices because it‚Äôs the kids who pay when 1 parent is absent. Jihoon I like and I really thought he would grow up but I think his parents spoiled him to long and now he‚Äôs going to be hard to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jhoon&rsquo;s post was for Deevan&rsquo;s bebefit. Sharell you are not being responsible in your posting where Deavan is concerned..really you probably should not post your opion on people you are favoring. Jhoon is immature but so is Deavan. She needs to learn birth control. When Deavan became a staff member on a reality show and brought her family into the show as the storyline well you can expect opions voiced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharell steals her stories from John Yates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell, we know all this. They both need to grow up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And you Sharrell need to stop being so obvious that you are biased when it comes to Deavon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Makes me sad üò¢ that you are no longer impartial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hope he can still see his baby boy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavon and her mother are annoying. No one is saying her child is ugly or she doesn‚Äôt keep her looking well we are just saying she‚Äôs a spoiled hyperactive child that needs discipline. Jihoon is immature but Deavon can‚Äôt keep blaming him for everything she didn‚Äôt know this man long enough he inherited an instant family and then another child that‚Äôs her fault she should have used protection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When things don&rsquo;t go deavans way she runs to her mom too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not to be rude and crude with you Sharrell but you&rsquo;re totally being bias for Deavon Clegg and blaming Jihoon Lee for EVERYTHING, now yes he&rsquo;s a bit of a man-child and probably a slacker but doesn&rsquo;t mean you gotta ride on his butt hard til there&rsquo;s nothing left.  For him using the social media like the blogs are his source of therapy to get through stressful things that&rsquo;s in his way which as a Millennial I definitely understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am sorry,  Deavan needs to take some responsibility!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No sane person would have believed that the Jihoon she left behind in South Korea, would‚Äôve changed or turned his life around in less than a year, let alone four months. She knew he had that court judgement against him and a very big debt that came with it. She also knew he didn‚Äôt have a viable or stable job when she left S.Korea, but yet she thought he could change his life around in four months? It is not possible for more responsible people with proper stable jobs to turn their lives around to that extent in such a short time, let alone someone like Jihoon!

<li>
<p>They need to work it out for their son!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs only Jihoon and devons talk. They are the only ones that can fix this situation if they want to save there marriage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell, you are screwing up BIG TIME with all your unprofessional friendships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have no doubt you are losing subs over this crap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell you are probably the most beautiful woman I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Enjoy your show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dont these people know that when they put their kids on tv they r violating their Privacy anyhow? U wanna protect ur child that is only 3 years old&hellip; keep her off tv. Otherwise dont read the comments that hv public scrutiny and just hope ur kids will b okay cuz u hv them on tv</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you accuse Jihoon doing blogs about them not together anymore? That&rsquo;s B.S. The only thing he did to hint it was he unfollowed her IG. He even went to social media asking ppl not sending hate to her and his mom. She also hinted they were not longer together by not saying anything and acted happy on social media when he got death threats and he got so depressed that he even sent out suicide thought. She was a cold bitch in the show, and is in real life too. Look at Kalani, she got upset with her husband in the show but she told ppl she would delete any hate comments against him. She and you should stop blame everything on Jihoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow if it‚Äôs true that was fast üò≥ I actually think they‚Äôre a great balance for each other if they heed each other‚Äôs advice. Jihoon needs to be more responsible and Deavan should lighten up. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen her smile or laugh in one single scene beside the wedding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíõ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíöPersonally I could see a bit of maturity trying to sneak it&rsquo;s way through with Jihoon in the last few episodes &hellip; just a glimmer but there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üíô</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come on Sharrell! What in the world has gotten in to you? Most of the time you are dead on with your opinions however you are dead wrong with this couple.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry but reality tv has been a thing since the 90s with MTV&rsquo;s Real World. It&rsquo;s not some brand new thing and it&rsquo;s edited and produced for ratings. In the 90s social media wasn&rsquo;t as sophisticated and widely used as it is today so maybe a small group of people might&rsquo;ve talked shit about you on some obscure message board. In the 21st century though, both of them knew what they were getting into when they signed those contracts. You forfeit anonymity and you open yourself and your loved ones on the show up for criticism from strangers on so many platforms, who only know what was packaged and aired on tv for them. I dont feel sorry for any of these people and if she didn&rsquo;t want people going in on her kids or her parenting, she should have kept them off the show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jihoon was so cute with his old hair style!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharell STOPüõëwe don&rsquo;t believe Devean for one flat second.  She is a user, a toxic mother and the Dipp was CLEARLY Devean and/or her LA beau/handler&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>üî•üî•üî•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ur so right Sharell all though we all have different opinions about Jihoon and Deaven us viewers shouldn&rsquo;t have disagreements about the show we are not in there lives they are the only ones living through there pain what ever it is God bless</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think devan plays victim a lot to her parents. I feel that she was tricked to get over there but they are married and they both need to work to get what they want. Marriage isn‚Äôt someone taking care of you and kids. It‚Äôs 50/50 some times 60/40 and 40/60 you know your a team. And when it comes to the social media and marriage keep your stuff private to your self. That‚Äôs when it gets messy and hard to salvage when you run to social media everytime they make you mad.  He needs to grow up work harder and just prove to her that he is serious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavsns a fn liar too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Them two did to get out of the spot light and talk with cameras or parents

<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad to know that Jihon will no longer have to deal with emotionally unstable thottish Deavon, wild ADHD Dracula &amp; psycho mother in law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here to support and view. You‚Äôre looking really beautiful too! üëå</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They need to keep SOME THINGS PRIVATE</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deaven looks so different in pictures the on 90df has she gotten work done she looks really pretty in her ig pictures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OK really talk&hellip;.When Deavan laid down with Jihoon she knew he was childish but still she got pregnant. I feel Deavan played on Jihoon being  naive. I sure no real man would be bothered with her. I always say you  want to know who a women is look at her children. Drusilla always look like she is in need of a good bath! She lack discipline! I swore I seen her with a pull up or diaper on. That is ridiculous. 1 last thing why is it you never mention her horrible mother? She is the OG of the Karen&rsquo;s!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Already another boyfriend? I really hope she uses birth control! I feel sorry for the children, I hope they can sort something out! I do feel very sorry for Jihoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt like you Sharrell taking sides, but I too saw the split coming. Jihoon was a child himself. He partied most of the time and couldn‚Äôt provide for his family. It was a matter of time that Deavan would get fed up with that. Hopefully Deavan uses birth control with the new boyfriend and does not have baby number 3 by another daddy üòÇ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seem Jihoon is doing what he does best, passing the ball to someone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>else.‚ù§üòá</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, you talk about other parents and laugh about them but Deaven is a saint?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Truly a biased opinion. Bye üëãüèº</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to give Deavan credit. She lasted way longer than I would have. Expectations verses reality is huge here. The cultures are vastly different. Honestly I never thought this relationship would work. I had hoped as there is a child, but there are to many hurdles and changes for both of them to survive. ‚úåÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until Jihoon mans up and start being responsible this marriage is not going to work at this point he needs to show Deavan that he can do this. Personally I think Deavan needs to move on he&rsquo;s not acting like he wants to be a husband maybe by moving on this will encourage Jihoon to be a man and not a little boy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thanks for the update&hellip;love these two&hellip;also enjoy seeing Korea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little bit of bias&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are blaming jihoo for everything what about Deavan she is a poor excuse for a mother because she could have went over there alone and checked everything out for herself her mother is crazy and she is to</p>

<li>
<p>Very noble of you to help protect the children üíñüíñ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can not be fixed  jihnoon  not ready to be the head of a house hold they just  need go to mediation  and work  out that  way then deaven need to depart get on plane with her other child and go home  a start her life ‚úà‚úà‚úà</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw some of DeVans later utube videos when she was living in Korea. This is past the TLC we‚Äôre seeing now. Dracella seemed to be doing well.  Not running around aimlessly.  Walking with her mom down the sidewalks etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm going to advocate for Dracella. CHANGE her name.  I don‚Äôt know why Devan  named her that awful name to start with.  She‚Äôs a very pretty little girl who deserves a better name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&rsquo;s really not nice to say, but I do believe people should be more cautious with their bedroom decisions. One unexpected pregnancy, then two; both of which landed Deavan trying to build a life with people who were not right for her. These children have connected her to toxic men/situations and she will never be able to fully escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are you siding with Deaven?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Im sorry but you are clearly on her side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop reporting about them.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>I disagree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wonder if she‚Äôs pregnant with the new guy yet?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs over according to both- you know it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Sharrell but I think in most situations it best to stay neutral if that&rsquo;s your friend giving each side full freedom to vent their feelings but not getting drawn into any declarations of  loyalty one way or the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt think I have ever seen Deavan smile or laugh. Sharell you are just like my sister she never listens when you warn her about others I‚Äôm not saying Deavan is a bad person she seems nice but remember all the talk about Amber and everyone was right. Same with Angela everyone likes her but here in the U.K. Nigerian men don‚Äôt put up with this worse from a white woman you can‚Äôt treat them the way she treat Michael they would beat your ass he don‚Äôt love her it‚Äôs called GREEN CARD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop taking sides üíÄ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2:32 I like thatüòçüíã üíùüíñ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, so they are getting a divorce, that was inevitable.  Next news bulletin, Deaven is pregnant with her new boy friends baby.  It makes for good TV, but I feel for the two babies she already has&hellip;.I shall pray for all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt understand all the judgments against Devin and her mom. My mom would‚Äôve said the same thing if someone was being irresponsible with her grandchild. It may have been a bit of an overreaction but it was built up frustrations coming to head. Devin is much younger than him and two kids that age is a lot. Everyone who‚Äôs working and homeschooling their kids right now should be empathetic to that. I don‚Äôt like the moms judging moms comments. I think it‚Äôs too much judgement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought Jihoon and Deavan were never married!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devan does the say thing.

<li>
<p>They both have done the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The thing is if you dont want people to be up in your business dont go on TV for the world to see, and make there own judgements, of course people gonna say sorts, as they say you diug your hole got to lay in it, they should just go there separate ways to much drama..</p>

<p>Sharrells not taking money from anyone.  You people are brutal !!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&rsquo;t they have a YouTube channel together ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jihoon sometimes you need to understand no matter what problems you have in your life posting your problems on social media will not help anything and it will make things a lot worse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think she‚Äôs a little slow sorry üòê</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her name is Drascilla.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Still wondering what happened in Korea&hellip;she implied it was horrible.üòê</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorry but stop it! Deavan has been dropping bombs herself. Even posted a headless shot on the ig story of her and the guy. At least Jihoon kept it vague. She&rsquo;s been flaunting this relationship for about a month. Since she went to LA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel bad for the children.  This information shouldn&rsquo;t be out there. He&rsquo;s immature,  but she keeps choosing poorly. She&rsquo;s a young two time mom and hooked up with a dude with oversized condoms. Wow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iam a single mum and no one looks after my child but me. I would never expect jihoon to look after my child when I hardly know him myself. Why do women trust men to take on a child that is not there own. I would wait a few months before you meet my child.stop pushing jihoon to love your daughter like you do let it flo naturally jihoon don‚Äôt want her is scared of her leaving with the child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It takes a paper and thirty days to get a divorce in Korea&hellip; it‚Äôs not like it is in the US &hellip; she may very well be divorced in Korea where they were married&hellip;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know why Sharrell would think Jihoon is behind the leak, it is far more likely that it was Deavan. She is all over social media &amp; from what I understand it is pretty rare for Jihoon to be. She doesn&rsquo;t want to break her NDA, so she found this way to try to distract people from how badly she treated Jihoon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No matter who is behind it, I still hope they find a way for the baby to get to be with his dad &amp; extended family, it would be a real tragedy if he didn&rsquo;t get to.</p>

<p>Deavan needs to focus on her and her kids. This is too much and a man not going to bring happiness. She needs to find happiness within herself first. I also think Jihoon needs to focus on himself and grow up. They both are childish in many ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I believe both of them need to grow up.  If they won&rsquo;t work out their problems then they need to work on themselves to make themselves better parents. Both are too immature. And Deavan needs to take better care of herself. At this rate, she&rsquo;ll have 3 more kids from men she hardly knows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems  on the show that dijoun ran  as fast as he can to get the daughter,  the girl was wiggling a lot, and he couldn&rsquo;t have anything in his hands, I  have 3 kids, now grown,  i was confused how he wasn&rsquo;t watching her, he had to set her down,  cuz of her insistence,  what happened after that,  there were several adults  available,  why did the mom lose her mind.

<p>In my opinion there is fault on both sides. First of Driscilla is a child. She is probably upset with no father figure in her life and might be acting out because of it. Devon should give her rules when she acts out. Now Jihoon does act like a child. He did lie to her about working, the money, and promised her (before she came over ) that he was going to do better. He didn&rsquo;t. That is also why her mom is also upset. Plus TLC is also to blame because they didn&rsquo;t show the two times that Drissela ran. Both times she ran from Jihoon. Now he is her stepdad since he is married to Devon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is weird when you go to their family YouTube. They seem like they are happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh God, good grief, oh bother!!! Devan needs a real man!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharrell&hellip; I I&rsquo;m going to tell you whose side I&rsquo;m on. Your side you made 100% good Common Sense tonight. No one should take sides these people need to be left alone to solve their problems. Everyone should be on the children&rsquo;s side. Everyone&rsquo;s life is a bunch of mashed up mess LOL how else can I describe it. But you handled this so very well tonight I am very proud of you. I am glad you do talk about this because opinions are like assholes everybody has one. But you staying in the middle I have a lot of respect for you. So keep playing the referee LOL good luck with that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad they are separating because he&rsquo;s just too immature for her. Stay safe everyone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devan is very young and Jhoon is way immature. U don&rsquo;t think she is a bad Mom at all she may need to get more control with her Daughter but some kids are more hyper than others but I think that she is way more mature than he is and at the end of it all she will be the one raising those kids alone. He is almost 30 and she is only like 23 I think. He should be way more mature but he is a grown ass child</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I‚Äôm thinking Jihoon is saying and posting these random things about splitting up and stuff, because it‚Äôs what Deavan is telling/saying to him (or threatening him with) when she‚Äôs upset. Then he runs and posts about it because he‚Äôs freaking out, and he probably doesn‚Äôt even understand what she‚Äôs telling him. The language barrier doesn‚Äôt help much, we‚Äôve all seen how great that translator-thing they use works for them üôÑ</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deavan  needs to find a rich man because she said that she wants to be at home and taking care her kids nothing wrong with that but she needs a rich man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love deaven I really do but she didn‚Äôt make a wise choice getting pregnant by somebody she didn‚Äôt know real well. She‚Äôs 2 for 2 now. It‚Äôs time to grow up and make wiser choices because it‚Äôs the kids who pay when 1 parent is absent. Jihoon I like and I really thought he would grow up but I think his parents spoiled him to long and now he‚Äôs going to be hard to change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She&rsquo;s been home for awhile. I subscribe to her YouTube.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being a husband and dad takes a ‚ÄúREAL MAN‚Äù ..which you are not‚ÄºÔ∏è</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don‚Äôt blame him&hellip;.. he had a wife and son and then she left and already has a new man. He probably will never see his son again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are way too critical of Deavan. She met a guy like 95% of America women, slept with him cuz shit happebs and we r human and she got pregnant. Jihoon seems like a nice guy but at the end of the day he isnt stepping up as a husband and a father IDC what culture you are from. So Deavan fell in love had another kid and gave him the benefit of the doubt. Move on Deavan, you are better off. Deavan has shown she is a strong independent woman, she will be fine. Jihoon just didn&rsquo;t measure up, its not her fault.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yay she went home with the kids God bless her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m Alone üòçüò•</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel so terrible for this family!  They&rsquo;re seeking peace&hellip;so please people, let&rsquo;s give them peace because they&rsquo;re asking us nicely&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say murder? Why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jihoon needs to man up, he‚Äôs 30 and a father. He needs to be responsible for his kid. If he doesn‚Äôt want the responsibility send money enough for the kid and the therapy that kid is going to need. Devan needs to also take responsibility as well and realize that the show and the relationship isn‚Äôt good for her kids and bounce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jahoon is a child.  I wish Deavan all the best.  Jahoon lied to her over and over again, saying he had a job and could support her so she went back to Korea.  Good for Deavan , she gave it a try, it didn‚Äôt work now move on!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree with Sharrell.

<p>Whoa. Sharrell, I can‚Äôt believe how many people are coming down on you regarding Deavan &amp; Jihoon! Lots of Deavan haters around! As I see it, Deavan has given the man-child plenty of time &amp; opportunity to grow up &amp; get responsible. HE is the one throwing constant pity parties for himself &amp; THAT is what‚Äôs gotten old. He‚Äôs made so little effort it‚Äôs pathetic. He promises change, admits he‚Äôs a bum who works part time to have more goof-off time, &amp; does NOTHING. Clearly Deavan did the wrong thing getting pregnant way too soon&hellip;but does she deserve all, or any, of this hate? Absolutely not. I‚Äôm really kinda shocked at all of the comments, &amp; threats to you here.</p>
