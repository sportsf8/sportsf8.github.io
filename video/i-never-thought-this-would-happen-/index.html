<p>That moment when 2020 actually becomes someone’s year ♥️</p>
</li>
<li></li>

<p>Kristi: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not possible&rdquo;</p>

<p>GOD: *clears throat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally tried for over 7 years. 3 months before turning 33 I found out in pregnant!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently 30 weeks with a boy! 💙💙💙 2020 is a blessing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most beautiful thing about this, is that you stayed together for ten years even though you couldn&rsquo;t conceive, that&rsquo;s true love. I know girls that were left by their man because they couldn&rsquo;t get pregnant. Sending you love and positive vibes :)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hi kristi, i avoided watching this video out of fear and guilt. 1 week before u posted this video i found out i&rsquo;m pregnant with my first baby. I am a single, 22 year old mother and the dad won&rsquo;t be in its life. At first I wanted an abortion and was considering it. It wasn&rsquo;t until your video popped up that made me realize that what I&rsquo;m given is a blessing so many women want. I think this video was a sign for me. I am not 3 months pregnant expecting a baby in feb! :) i hope all the best for u and you&rsquo;re growing family. &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just imagine&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>a million people who don’t know each other, all in their respective homes, jobs, lives&hellip; all connected in a moment crying tears of joy for these beautiful humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i literally find it so crazy how she literally predicted she would get/be pregnant when she’s 33</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I AM UGLY FACE CRYING SO HARD FOR YOU RIGHT NOW!!! So happy for you!!! Sneding all the positive vibes to you right now for a healthy pregnancy!!💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Let’s say I’m like 33, and I finally just found out that I’m pregnant, which I’m pretty sure is never gonna happen&hellip;’</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>And now she’s 33 and pregnant. This kind of proves everything happens for a reason, at least for me. No matter how hard it can be, there’s a time and a place for everything. Everything is fated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a childfree woman I would gladly donate my fertility to anyone who wants a child. I wish it were possible. And I&rsquo;m so happy for you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as I realized what this was, I started crying out of joy for you

<p>Who rewatching this after learning the baby’s gender? 😭🥺</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ecclesiastes 3:1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens”  God is always on time!! 💙💙  Unexpected blessings! 👏🏽👏🏽</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You literally sitting there saying “I am 100% content with not ever having a baby” while simultaneously being pregnant and not knowing will ALWAYS blow my mind. God works in mysterious ways! And just like your dad said “praise Jesus!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kristi: I don’t get pregnant. I don’t ovulate. I can’t, I don’t have that &hellip;.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>God: Hold my beer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;..so you&rsquo;ve been our real dad all along</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When she said it hurts her that she can&rsquo;t make her husband a dad, broke me. As someone who also is struggling to get pregnant. I know that feeling&hellip;. I came to terms accepting that I probably can&rsquo;t get pregnant either. But knowing I can&rsquo;t make my husband a dad, hurts. I&rsquo;m SO SO SO SO happy for her and that God finally answered her prayers, and blessed her with a baby. Sharing her story gives women who are in the same difficult situation hope. &lt;3 Congrats on your pregnancy Kristi. You deserve it and so much more. &lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“When Allah wishes for something to be, He just says BE and it is” ❤️❤️❤️ I’m so happy for you!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You little beauty!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is so amazing. My husband and I actively tried for 8 years. They didn’t know why but I was infertile. We told family at Christmas 2017 that we were stopping all fertility treatments and moving forward with other life plans. In July of 2018 at 33 years old&hellip;I found out I was miraculously pregnant. I had a very similar reaction to you. The even crazier part&hellip;.my nieces call me GiGi. I do not know know but I feel so connected to you. We have shared many of the same emotions. I am so excited for you. My little miracle is now 17 months old :). I’m excited to have stumbled upon your videos. I’m excited to watch your journey.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 IS OFFICIALLY NOT RUINED</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bro&hellip;i must of watched this 100 times now .. i come back every couple days lol..and ic ry everytime lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It took my partner and I a total of 3 years to get pregnant and I’m now due on the 16th of July so in 10 days? Unfortunately the father of my unborn child passed away almost 3 weeks ago, so a month and a day to my due date and July 22nd would have been his 39th birthday. — He was found dead on the floor of a motel room 4 hours away in the city where he had stopped on his way back to Toronto basically abandoning our unborn child and I. I hope he’s at peace now, I really do. This year of 2020 has been hellish but clearly there are blessings to be grateful for, you guys being pregnant is definitely one of them! Congratulations!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“let’s say I’m 33 and find out I’m pregnant” when I say my jaw dropped girl &hellip;. so incredibly happy for you ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believe me, I have watched hundreds of &ldquo;finding out I&rsquo;m pregnant&rdquo; videos and yours is the only one that has made my eyes tear up. I&rsquo;ve now subscribed and look forward to follow your jurney. Hi from sweden ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ME: man, there is nothing good happening in 2020</p>
</li>
<li></li>

<li>
<p>Idk if you believe in god, but it’s all in his timing. This is like the 3rd video of yours I seen and I can’t stop crying. Congratulations love ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is the best YT video I have ever watched! Cried every second &amp; felt all the emotions. 15 years of infertility &amp; PCOS myself, I felt ALL your pain &amp; joy at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heartbreaking to watch (positively) to see HOW someone calls it &ldquo;can&rsquo;t be real&rdquo;, because that person had suffered so many disappointens in life. I wish you all the best!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Babies are blessings, their sent at the perfect time. Trust gods plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You: we’ve come to terms with it</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Your baby: HOLD MY BOTTLE IM COMIN IN HOT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jesus looked at them intently and said, “Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But with God everything is possible.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matthew 19:26</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God is in control baby girl he doesn’t make any mistake it has to happen when he saw fit congratulations and bless you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God’s timing is perfect !!! I have laughed and danced of course cried so happy mommy!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.&rdquo; Prov. 13:12.  I understand what it means to wait a long time for something you want and it seems like it will never come.  Congratulations to you and your husband for NEVER giving up. One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is after the first child is born for an infertile couple, the other children will come, &ldquo;fast &amp; furiously&rdquo;.  It&rsquo;s almost like the woman&rsquo;s body says, &ldquo;Oh!  So THAT&rsquo;S what I&rsquo;m supposed to do!&rdquo; So, hold on to your hats, cuz the other kids are right behind the first one!  Blessings to you and yours &amp; the little one on the way!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that your followers are all crying out of joy for you really says so much about you and your community Kristi 🖤 congratulations to both of you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ahh man this video reminds me of myself. I swore I would never be a mother. And now I have an 11 month old. Congratulations. You both deserve this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sitting in the office, got this on my recommendations and thank YouTube intensely for this. Crying my eyes out watching this because I’m so happy for you, Kristi ❤️ As a woman with endometriosis I know the struggle of getting pregnant. I’m still fighting and you gave me a big boost of hope. I wish you all the best health for you and your little miracle!❤️❤️❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This brought so many memories after two miscarriages I never thought I would have a child. 11 years later I had a beautiful daughter five year later I had my son.. I went through the same emotions even with my second child. congratulations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crying because I can&rsquo;t wait for this to be me.  We&rsquo;ve been trying to 4 years and nothing</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>Congrats to you and your family!!!!

<p>can’t actually breathe through these tears</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This gives me soooooo much hope for myself. Everything is on Gods time. He is so good and so wonderful. You’re going to be a great mama &amp; papa🤍🤍</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact that you said something along the lines of &ldquo;let&rsquo;s say I&rsquo;m 33 and i just find out I&rsquo;m pregnant?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, 32 is close enough, you waited. This is manifestation. It&rsquo;s time. 🥰👫👶</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>thank you for this! my husband and i have been trying for about 7 yrs out of the 10 yrs we been together , now and no luck because of me. years went by i kind of got over the fact of not being able to get pregnant but what makes me cry all the time is my husband. i always cry to him and tell him im siorry i cant give you a family and he always talks about having a family. =( anyways hes my number supporter as we go through our infertility journey , but praying for a healthy preg for you and yours. congrats! this give so much of women and myself hope!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mom too went years trying, it was hard for her because she was already older than 30. The moment she stopped trying, I popped up lol, so yeah never give up!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you were crying I felt like I could see the pain actually leaving you, may your pregnancy be a healthy one, may your birth be all you need, and your child healthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your baby has to be a miracle. I can feel that she/he is going to be soso special ❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mom had a colleague - a couple, actually, trying to have a baby for years and years. Then they had come to the conclusion that no matter what they do about it, they don&rsquo;t have any chance to have a baby. This was back in the 80&rsquo;s, so there was less chance and less availability for fertility treatment in my country. Then one day an opportunity came along for them to move to Egypt for 2 years for an engineering project - they were both engineers, way over 40 now and had given up on kids once and for all. They took a chance and they accepted the project and moved to Egypt from Europe. So as they were settling in, trying to get accustomed to new food, new people, new culture, very different living conditions - even the weather was challenging sometimes - you&rsquo;ve guessed, she got the news of pregnancy. They both were in complete shock as the lady was already kind of having pre-menopausal symptoms. Anyway, they have a grown up child now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I literally just cried watching this. Note this is my first time every seeing your channel and I am so happy for you. New subie lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dude I literally just got a fresh set of lashes lool omg congratulations to you both this is absolutely wonderful!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>😭 Congratulations !! This was so beautiful to watch. What incredible parents you are both going to be! 🎉🎉</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I had a similar experience.  I was told that when baby is ready and parents are ready, baby will happen unless there is a problem that cannot be amended.  Congratulations, and best of everything for your family in 2020 and beyond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cried watching this when it came out, I’ve been struggling for the past 1 1/2 with pcos. I just found on Friday that I am pregnant, 8 positive pregnancy tests 🥺💗🙏🏻</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sobbing because you said everything I feel. I’m 8 years in and hope one day I get that plus sign,  too. I’m so so happy for you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tried for six years and nothing, we went to countless appointments and spend so much money. I gave up heartbroken, my husband didn’t want to give up but he understood. We moved closer to my mom and bought a really nice house. Not even a month later at 30 years old, we got pregnant with our daughter then when she was six months,  we got pregnant with our son! I had given up but god didn’t give up on me, hope and love to all the women on here that struggle, it’s not easy! ❤️❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damn imagine being this kid and watching this and knowing how wanted and loved you are. What a blessing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wonder how long it took for her to stop telling at her past self that she&rsquo;s pregnant haha. Im here doing it hahah</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a shot every time she says “this isn’t real” and you will be dead of alcohol poisoning by the end of the video😂😂😂 no but for real I am so happy for you Kristi😭😭😭</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am literally sitting here crying tears of joy for you&hellip;i have been told I can’t get pregnant many times already&hellip;I’m hoping one day it changes and I am blessed with a child

<p>This is what the Beauty Community  needs!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the part of this that made my heart hurt most is the fact you’ve recorded every pregnancy test for 12 years just in case🥺</p>

<p>You got me at &ldquo;i filmed every pregnancy test for the last 12 years&rdquo; part&hellip; Damn. We underappreciate how easy most of us get it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We tried for 6 years, gp said I can’t have kids as I don’t ovulate and I have to have treatment. I realised I ovulate starlight after my period and four months later we got pregnant and I now have 2 boys. I relived  everything you went through. ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The look in his eyes when he said he wanted kids but then his stomach dropped bc he knew it hurt you. This baby is a miracle and a blessing :) I’m a 33yo mom of two and every time I watch this video I bawl happy tears for you!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love watching this and vicariously feeling all the happy surprise feels</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel this in my soul. Praying for a safe, very healthy pregnancy, baby, and momma. ❤❤❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only am I so unbelievably happy for you, the editing is also fire?? Best “I’m pregnant” video ever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It happens when you least expect it when God says yes than its YESSSSSS🌹you are ment to be a mother on GODS TIME!!!!!!!!sweetheart💞💞</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So, so, so happy for you guys. I had an emergency hysterectomy so I know the feelings of coming to grips of not becoming a mom. Like your man, mine has been by my side for 20 years now. Again, so happy for you guys. I believe everything has a reason and it&rsquo;s own time. Your baby&rsquo;s time is now. Congratulations to you both, well, I should saw to you three 🥳</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when you closed your eyes i thought to myself; now she has just understood it and her heart tells her: it is true .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wish you the best&hellip; for you , your man and your Little wonder! ☺️👍🏻😘</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>P.s You have a new sub 💗</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remember the time I saw my PT showing positive result after 4 yrs of trying. Just when  my husband and I accepted the reality that we might not have any kids (because I am 37yrs old that time and we are just being realistic), huwow! that&rsquo;s when we became pregnant! My son is 3 yrs old now. Parenthood is darn hard but the most rewarding thing. I wish you all the best on your pregnancy. Eat well, sleep a lot (because bye bye sleep when the baby is there 😂) and take care of yourself 😍.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Girl I&rsquo;m crying with you 😭😭 my cousins went through 12 years of miscarriages and infertility until finally 2 years ago they had a baby boy :)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Stumbled across your YouTube today, and I can relate to this on every levels. I felt your reaction in my soul. You&rsquo;re tears brought back the same tears I cried 3 years ago when I had a positive after trying for 5 years. We went through two fertility doctors, countless treatments, as much as we could afford. 5 failed IUI cycles. Then, as we prepared for the next cycle, we did TI the rest of the month, I ovulated late (almost missed it) and we conceived our daughter naturally. My RE was especially baffled because the cycle was considered failed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I still cry everytime I watch this! 😭😁 So so happy for y&rsquo;all !!!! Sending so much love ~from TN💖💖💖</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Some good things have come from 2020. 🥰</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am  pregnant. My baby has turned me towards God because I know that my conception was a miracle. I truly believe there are many things going on in our world right now that are blessings and miracles within the stress. #blessedthroughthestress</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>congrats girl .&lt;3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I cried so hard watching this. My sister is going thru the same struggle [even a ovarian cancer survivor] so my heart breaks when she goes thru these lows. I am soooo happy for you. I cant tell you what a blessing children are and every woman who wants to give that unconditional love, SHOULD ❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of all of the bruh moments of 2020 this one is my favorite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started crying so hard! I&rsquo;ve been watching your every single video for 2 years now and it always made me sad thinking that someone amazing as you can&rsquo;t be a mom. AND IT FINALLY HAPPENED. I&rsquo;M SO HAPPY I CAN&rsquo;T STOP CRYING! I know you will be amazing parents and that kiddo will love you! ❤️ ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my gosh, I am so happy for you all! Congratulations, you&rsquo;re going to be an amazing mother. Sending love, positive energy, and prayers your way. ♥️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your baby and I have something in common: both 10 years in the making❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After my mom and dad stopped trying to conceive, I made my appearance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have been blessed with four beautiful daughters.  I love them with so my heart.  But from day one my husband has wanted a boy and I have heard from countless other women how I have let him down.  That ache of knowing your husband, your soul mate, your world wants something and not being able to give it to him is devestating.  However, on my journey I have discovered God.  I have discovered that He is enough and everything else is just a blessing.  So even though I will never have a boy, I&rsquo;m okay.  I&rsquo;m blessed and I trust God.  I&rsquo;m so ugly crying seeing your blessing and I am so over joyed for you guys</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i never thought i could feel so close to a literal stranger on the internet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve literally just discovered your channel after a video came up on my feed and I&rsquo;m now sat sobbing watching this 😂 congratulations!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations!  I cried through this. I was diagnosed with PCOS in my 20s (in the late 90s) and only endured infertility treatments for a few years. I can remember being jealous of all of the women who easily got pregnant. I can also remember feeling that my husband should have married someone else. I did become a mother through adoption and we have three beautiful children. Adoption isn&rsquo;t for everyone. It is a tough road, but I truly feel that I was meant for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a frequent watcher can someone let me know why she didn&rsquo;t consider adoption? or did she? idk if that&rsquo;s rude to ask so ignore me if that&rsquo;s the case but I was just wondering</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your prayers have been answered. Stay happy and blessed with the newest addition to your wonderful family. May God bless this amazing family abundantly. 😇🥰🤗❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I NEED TO SEE HIS REACTION THIS SECONDDDDDD. I am sobbing, so happy for you both!!!!!!!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wow! Just wow! I’m in my early 30s, just got married last year and have pcos. Seeing someone go through what I’ve been going through and getting pregnant gives me so much hope. I am sooooo happy for you and your husband.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This brought back so many memories for me. We tried for almost 7yrs and one day I decided to take a test about a year after we stopped seeing doctors for infertility. I took 5 tests and even called the manufacturer 🤦🏻‍♀️ before I could believe it! Sure enough I was almost 8 weeks pregnant with our now 13 yr old daughter.  Congratulations!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>God is amazing. He&rsquo;s got you and you will have a beautiful baby. So many blessing to you both❤</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;m so happy for you, as a woman who is gonna be 35 this year and have struggled with infertility with my husband since day one your story have me hope and I want to thank you for that!

</li>

<p>I have never happy cried so hard for someone else.. ❤️ You deserve this sweet girl! Congratulations Kristi!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh my goodness, I just found out about you because I’ve been hearing about your new palette. This is the first video of yours I watched, and I can relate to all those feelings. I had miscarriage after miscarriage and finally just told myself I hated kids so I could bury all my feelings of failure and loss. When I got pregnant with my daughter I was in such shock that I took a pregnancy test every day for the whole first trimester. I kept waiting for that other shoe to drop, for the doctor not to find a heartbeat. I still didn’t believe it even when I was holding her in my arms. I am so beyond happy for you, and I hope you keep us all updated. I’m sending lots of sticky baby dust! ✨</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this video brought tears to my eyes. I’m so beyond happy for you and your husband. you two will be wonderful parents ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2020 IS OFFICIALLY NOT RUINED</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This whole video, ugh, my heart goes out to you. I’m so happy for you babe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Congratulations you guys deserve the world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m so happy for you and your husband. You’ve made me feel hopeful. Happy tears! 😭☺️</p>
