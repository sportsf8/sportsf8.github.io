<h1 id="harris-just-doing-my-job">Harris: Just doing my job</h1>
<p>“JUST trying my best to do my best”</p>
<p>It’s the simple mantra behind Tayla Harris’ growth in consistency during the 2020 AFLW season.</p>
<p>If the last two weeks are anything to go by, it seems to be working.</p>
<p>Tayla Harris spoke to the media to discuss this weekend&rsquo;s Carlton Respects game against St Kilda.</p>
<p>Published on 2 days</p>
<p>Harris has kicked three goals and averaged 12.5 disposals, lifting her work effort to cover more ground up the field, proving to be a valuable link for the team when transitioning from defence into attack.</p>
<p>It’s these efforts that the 22-year-old is most proud of when speaking of her own development.</p>
<p>“I’ve felt good, I’ve felt consistent,” Harris told media on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“I’ve just been doing my job for the team. It sounds really cliché, but it’s legitimate. I just want to do what I’m supposed to do.</p>
<p>“I had plenty of goals through the off-season that I wanted to achieve and I’m on my way to doing that.”</p>
<p>Carlton will be looking for its third win in a row when it comes up against St Kilda for the first time in the AFLW competition.</p>
<p>The Blues will have some insight into what to expect from the opposition on Saturday night, having faced off against the Saints in a practice match during the pre-season.</p>
<p>Still, Harris believes the Blues will need to be at their very best as they look to improve their chances of playing finals football.</p>
<p>“We can certainly win, that’s for sure. But whether we manage to bring everything together and everyone switches on on the night is a different story,” Harris said</p>
<p>“They’re a really well-drilled team. They came out really well structured and gave us a good run.</p>
<p>“I’m really interested to see how they go and I think it will be a good challenge. I think we can definitely get over the line with the way that we played. I do think they’re faring quite well.”</p>
<p>Saturday’s game also marks an important night for the Club as it looks to celebrate its third annual AFLW Carlton Respects game.</p>
<p>The Blues will add a touch of orange to their traditional Navy Blue, pulling up their orange socks to raise awareness for gender equality as a means to end violence against women.</p>
<p>“[Carlton Respects] is something that is incredibly important,” she told SEN earlier in the week</p>
<p>“It’s for raising awareness for violence against women and children. It’s something that, especially lately, is horrific.</p>
<p>“No-one in their right mind can say that that’s something that’s ok. What we can do is start the conversation.</p>
<p>“If someone says to anyone watching the footy game ‘why are they wearing the orange socks’. This is why.”</p>
<p>Fans wishing to show their support for the Carlton Respects program can do so by purchasing a pair of orange socks from The Carlton Shop.</p>
