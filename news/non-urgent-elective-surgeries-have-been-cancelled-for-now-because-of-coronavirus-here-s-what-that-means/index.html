Non-urgent elective surgeries have been cancelled for now because of coronavirus. Here&rsquo;s what that means</p>
<p>Updated</p>
<p>Starting today, non-urgent elective surgeries in Australia&rsquo;s public hospitals will be suspended.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s to help preserve resources, including protective equipment, and help the health system prepare for the influx of patients expected in the coming weeks and months due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Will surgeries in private hospitals still go ahead?</p>
<p>No. The new rules apply to both the public and private health systems.</p>
<p>They were agreed on by the National Cabinet and apply in every state.</p>
<p>But a late-night amendment to the suspension, announced on Wednesday, will give private hospitals a few extra days before the changes come into place.</p>
<p>Semi-urgent category two and three elective surgeries at private hospitals can continue until 11.59pm on April 1.</p>
<p>When will non-urgent elective surgeries resume?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no clear answer.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the suspension was &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; and would continue &ldquo;until further notice&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Victorian Government said the surgeries would resume only when it was safe to do so, and would consider surge capacity to reduce waiting lists, which would inevitably blow out.</p>
<p>But the timing all depends on how overwhelmed our hospital system gets and for how long.</p>
<p>And Dr Norman Swan told 7:30 the length of the pandemic depends on how successful our personal distancing measures are.</p>
<p>Which surgeries will be suspended?</p>
<p>All category three surgeries and most category two surgeries will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>According to the National Elective Surgery Urgency Categorisation Guideline published by the Australian Health Ministers&rsquo; Advisory Council, surgeries usually deemed category three include:</p>
<p>Total hip replacement</p>
<p>Total knee replacement</p>
<p>Shoulder reconstruction</p>
<p>Removing tonsils</p>
<p>Removing haemorrhoids</p>
<p>Laparoscopy for endometriosis</p>
<p>Breast reconstruction</p>
<p>Breast reduction</p>
<p>Varicose veins treatment</p>
<p>Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction</p>
<p>Which surgeries will continue?</p>
<p>Only emergency surgeries, category one and some exceptional category two surgeries will continue for now.</p>
<p>Surgeries usually deemed category one include:</p>
<p>Breast lump removal and biopsy</p>
<p>Mastectomy</p>
<p>Removing malignant skin lesions</p>
<p>Craniotomy for ruptured aneurysm</p>
<p>Neonatal surgery</p>
<p>Prostate biopsy</p>
<p>Removing urinary tract stones</p>
<p>Amputation of a limb</p>
<p>Many more surgeries fall into category two, and will continue in urgent circumstances where a delay would cause a risk to the patient.</p>
<p>Will IVF be cancelled?</p>
<p>Many IVF treatments will likely be delayed.</p>
<p>The Fertility Society of Australia has recommended patients talk to their specialist to &ldquo;discuss the appropriateness of postponing their treatment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be medical circumstances where delaying treatment may not be advisable and treating specialists should advise their patients if there are medical grounds to commence treatment now,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fertility Society of Australia appreciates the needs of individuals seeking assistance to conceive or preserve their fertility but also acknowledges that the overarching responsibility currently is to all patients as part of the Australian and New Zealand healthcare system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monash IVF Group chief executive Michael Knaap said it was important the sector helped ensure Australia&rsquo;s healthcare system was best placed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, we anticipate that our fertility activity will be impacted as patients defer treatment,&rdquo; he said in an announcement to the ASX.</p>
<p>How will it help?</p>
<p>Suspending elective surgeries will free up beds and health workers to better respond to COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>But another huge benefit is it will save scarce personal protective equipment such as masks, gowns, gloves and goggles.</p>
<p>Doctors have been appealing for more government action to boost supplies of personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has promised an extra 30 million medical masks in Australia within two weeks, but the director of a company that supplies more than 500 Australian hospitals has warned that &ldquo;most hospitals&rdquo; are only days away from running out.</p>

National cabinet on Wednesday night decided to extend the deadline for the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery undertaken at private hospitals.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Scott Morrison announced the suspension, that applies to both public and private hospitals and is designed to free up resources as hospitals prepare to deal with the full impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The measure, which covers only category 1 and some “exceptional” category 2 surgery would be apply “until further notice”.</p>
<p>It was originally to come into force on Wednesday night but the private hospitals are getting another week before the cut off date.</p>
<p>Patients awaiting elective surgery are placed by their doctor in one of three categories</p>
<p>Category 1 – Needing treatment within 30 days. Has the potential to deteriorate quickly to the point where the patient’s situation may become an emergency</p>
<p>Category 2 – Needing treatment within 90 days. Their condition causes pain, dysfunction or disability. Unlikely to deteriorate quickly and unlikely to become an emergency</p>
<p>Category 3 – Needing treatment at some point in the next year. Their condition causes pain, dysfunction or disability. Unlikely to deteriorate quickly.</p>
<p>Morrison said cancelling some elective surgery would “preserve resources including protective equipment” to help both public and private health services for COVED-19.</p>
<p>He said this had “already largely been implemented for category 1 and category 2 and what this means is a further scaling back of those elective surgeries in Category 2.”</p>
<p>Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone said the AMA supported the ban. “Doctors will ensure that patients who have their surgery delayed are looked after and given the best medical advice.”</p>
<p>The national cabinet on Wednesday night also agreed to widen the criteria for eligibility for COVID-19 testing.*</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews warned there would be a “stage three” of the response to the virus – after the national cabinet on Tuesday agreed to further shut downs - although he said we were not there yet.</p>
<p>Andrews reiterated it was vital people follow the health and social distancing advice. He said the Centrelink queues were heartbreaking but “what we don’t want is queues for people who need a machine to help them breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot have people queuing for intensive care beds – that will mean they will die,” he said.</p>
<p>“If we have a situation where this virus fundamentally gets away from us, we will have thousands of people who will only survive if they can breathe with the assistance of a machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will not have enough machines, nurses and doctors to provide that care. I’m not sure whether I could make it any clearer than that. If you need further evidence, turn on your TV. Have a look what’s going on in Italy.”</p>
<p>Morrison has also formed a COVID-19 Co-ordination Commission to advise on cushioning the virus’s economic impact, bringing together efforts to mitigate the effects.</p>
<p>Morrison said: “This is about working cooperatively across private-to-private and public-to-private networks to unlock resources, break bottlenecks and fix problems so Australian families, businesses and communities are supported through the challenging months ahead.”</p>
<p>It will be headed by Neville Power, former CEO of Fortescue Metals Group, with a board of commissioners with backgrounds in business, government, and the not-for-profit sector.</p>
<p>They include former Labor minister Greg Combet, former secretary of the health department Jane Halton, former managing director of Toll Holdings Paul Little, EnergyAustralia managing director Catherine Tanna and former Telstra CEO David Thodey (deputy chair), who headed the recent inquiry into the federal public service. Representation from the not-for-profit sector is yet to be announced.</p>
<p>The secretaries of the Prime Minister’s department (Phil Gaetjens) and Home Affairs (Mike Pezzullo) are also on the commission.</p>
<p>Morrison said the commission was “about mobilising a whole-of-society and whole-of-economy effort”.</p>
<p>He told a news conference he had rung Power and “I simply said, Nev, I need you to serve your country”.</p>
<p>Morrison admitted what he has been reluctant to say before – that there are differences in the national cabinet. Stressing its fundamental unity, he said, “Sure, there may be the odd time where there might be a bit of difference at the edge. But I can tell you in my entire working life, in public life, I have never seen the states and territories work together like they are working together right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all of our preference to keep that consistency and common action together as much as is possible. But we also need to recognise that in some places, states and territories are in different situations to other parts of the country.” He instanced the Northern Territory, with its remote communities.</p>
<p>It has been NSW and Victoria which have been the most forward-leaning on issues, notably schools.</p>
<p>NSW on Wednesday announced tough action to crack down on “reckless social gatherings”.</p>
<p>Police will be able to issue $1,000 on-the-spot fines for individuals and $5,000 for corporations that do not comply with ministerial directions. For example if a person organised or took part in a bootcamp of more than the permitted ten people they could be fined.</p>
<p>Police will no longer need a warrant to arrest someone breaching a public health order. This follows NSW legislation to increase police powers passed Tuesday.</p>
<p>*Expansion of coronavirus testing criteria</p>
<p>National Cabinet agreed to an Australian Health Principal Protection Committee (AHPPC) recommendation to expand the current coronavirus testing criteria to include testing people with fever or acute respiratory infection in:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>all health workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all aged/residential care workers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>geographically localised areas where there is elevated risk of community transmission as defined by the local public health unit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>where no community transmission is occurring, high risk settings where there are two or more plausibly-linked cases, for example:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>aged and residential care</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>rural and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>detention centres/correctional facilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>boarding schools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>military bases (including Navy ships) that have live-in accommodation.

All elective surgery other than the most urgent procedures will be put on hold to free up capacity in hospitals dealing with coronavirus.</p>
<p>State and federal leaders have agreed to indefinitely suspend all category three and most category two surgeries from midnight.</p>
<p>The cancellations will apply to both public and private hospitals.</p>
<p>The move would also help free up resources needed by healthcare staff, the prime minister told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“This will allow the preservation of resources like personal protective equipment and health services to prepare for their role in the COVID-19 outbreak,” Scott Morrison said.</p>
<p>The decision was quickly welcomed by the Australian Society of Anaesthetists.</p>
<p>“The only way Australian hospitals can effectively prepare for an influx of patients is if we have the time to devote resources to this preparation,” president Suzi Nou said.</p>

<p>“We believe that the health system is not yet ready to cope with the likely massive demand for our services.”</p>
<p>But Dr Nou said this was just the start and further action with containment measures would be needed.</p>
<p>Category one and two surgeries are classified as urgent and semi-urgent respectively, while category three surgeries are recommended to take place inside a year.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said only urgent category two cases would be allowed for surgery.</p>
<p>Before the prime minister’s announcement, Australian and New Zealand medical colleges warned unnecessary surgeries were soaking up precious resources needed to fight the pandemic.</p>
