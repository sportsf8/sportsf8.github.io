<p>A group of current and former firefighters who say they&rsquo;ve been sexually assaulted, bullied and harassed at work want an independent complaints authority established.</p>
<p>Photo: RNZ / Tracy Neal</p>
<p>The firefighters said their superiors failed to take action when they complained, and they were not offered any support.</p>
<p>Their calls for a separate body to handle complaints comes after a report last year found bullying and harassment was endemic across all levels of Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ).</p>
<p>FENZ chief executive Rhys Jones said the recommendations from that report, including a Code of Behaviour, were in the process of being implemented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sets out what is the expected behaviour: where is the level of conduct, and makes it very clear what are the various types of harassment and what is unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FENZ was also establishing an authority to handle complaints, but Jones said there were requests that it be independent of the organisation.</p>
<p>Victims rights advocate Louise Nicholas said it must be independent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Organisations such as FENZ, being such a huge organisation - I think are ill-equipped to deal with this type of situation,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they need independents to come in to talk to survivors and the accused as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Complaints met with inaction</p>
<p>Three firefighters told Nine to Noon they were assaulted by colleagues, but their complaints were never taken seriously.</p>
<p>Jaymie said she was sexually assaulted by a senior staffer at the brigade when she was working as a volunteer firefighter.</p>
<p>She felt a moral obligation to report the assault - but in the small town where she lived, when she went to police, she was told they wouldn&rsquo;t do anything.</p>
<p>She then complained to FENZ, but hit a brick wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way the chain of command works is, the person I would have reported what had happened to me was the person who assaulted me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She broke the chain of command, and went to the fire chief instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment I made a formal complaint to him, he contacted head office &hellip; and the very first thing he requested was information on how to snow job it, and make it go away. That was the very first thing - not to give me support, not to give me help, not to do the right thing, but to hide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jaymie said she had spoken to other firefighters current and former who had similar experiences: being assaulted, bullied or harassed at work, and met with complete inaction from the organisation.</p>
<p>Photo: RNZ / Meriana Johnsen</p>
<p>An independent review into the culture at FENZ, published last year, found bullying and harassment featured in the workplace at all levels and across all regions, but there were barriers to reporting it.</p>
<p>Retired judge Coral Shaw made 33 recommendations in her report, including implementing a code of behaviour, developing a &ldquo;more coherent system&rdquo; of bullying and harassment policies and procedures, and better training and education on bullying and harassment.</p>
<p>Jones said the recommendations were currently being implemented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our opportunity to rectify this, rather than blindly going on assuming and pretending it doesn&rsquo;t occur,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been a central pillar of my time as chief executive that we are going to address this problem. We&rsquo;re going to stamp it out - it&rsquo;s intolerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Independent complaint authority required</p>
<p>Another firefighter, Sarah, said she was sexually assaulted by a fellow brigade member who subsequently spent months bullying her, and is still harassing her now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I received a token apology from a person at national headquarters with no knowledge of the circumstances. The apology admitted errors and problems, actions and emissions, yet no action has been taken from FENZ against any personnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the people who did the misconduct have been promoted over the course of the matter, and are still working in complaints handling roles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was crucial any independent conduct authority sat completely outside the organisation, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything that is within FENZ [or] that is funded by FENZ, is never going to be able to hold to account the people with power in the organisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issue, and a lot of the abusers, are within national headquarters and that level needs independence over it. It needs to be an independent authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jones rejected the notion that abuse was rife within headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do disagree that it is just a headquarters cancer that is rotting the organisation. It&rsquo;s from me and it&rsquo;s from the leadership in Fire and Emergency that&rsquo;s driving this [change].&rdquo;</p>
<p>An independent body to handle complaints was being established, and would be akin to the Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA), with its decisions binding on FENZ, but unlike the IPCA it would be contracted by FENZ - and the contract is already out to tender.</p>
<p>It also would not be headed by a judge, which the IPCA is.</p>
<p>Louise Nicholas - whose allegations she was raped by police officers led to an inquiry into how investigations and complaints were handled by police - said it will be pointless if the new conduct authority was not completely independent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They cannot be a part of the organisation - it has to be people not within the organisation [and] have the ability to do a mediation to bring both parties together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Photo: Facebook</p>
<p>The complaints authority must be managed by experts, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just contracting to whoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Figures provided to RNZ from FENZ showed there had been two complaints of sexual harassment made and referred to police this year.</p>
<p>There were eight complaints in total last year, of which three were upheld, two were referred to police, and two resulted in dismissal.</p>
<p>Another firefighter, Nykita, said the organisation was still losing firefighters - both men and women - &ldquo;because they&rsquo;re not doing enough&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Her sexual assault complaint is being handled by an independent investigator, and the accused has been stood down pending the investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want it investigated properly and I want things to start changing within FENZ. Nothing is ever going to change until FENZ acknowledges the problem at the top that they&rsquo;ve got,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until everything starts getting acknowledged at the top, then there&rsquo;s definitely no way that things are really going to start changing.&rdquo;

<h3 id="independent-us-senate-hopeful-lisa-savage-picks-up-backing-of-one-time-democratic-rival">&ldquo;Independent U.S. Senate hopeful Lisa Savage picks up backing of one-time Democratic rival&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/BreKidman_1200x710-1024x606.jpg" alt="img">
Following a loss in a three-way Democratic primary for U.S. Senate, Saco lawyer Bre Kidman is bucking political tradition by refusing to endorse the winner.</p>
<p>Instead of urging voters to pick Democrat Sara Gideon in a ranked-choice voting race attracting national attention, Kidman is backing one of two independents on the Nov. 3 general election ballot.</p>
<p>Lisa Savage, a Solon educator, earned Kidman’s support because she “shows up for forums, makes herself available and accountable to voters, and focuses her campaign on the issues that really matter,” Kidman said in a prepared release.</p>
<p>Kidman said on Twitter that Savage is the only candidate left in the race “who supports Medicare for All and the Green New Deal” so she ought to be “where progressives plant our first choice vote. Policy before party!”</p>
<p>Savage is a longtime member of the Maine Green Independent Party but opted to run as an unenrolled candidate because securing a spot on the ballot as a minor party candidate is almost ludicrously difficult.</p>
<p>Savage hopes to unseat four-term Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in a race that also features Gideon, the state House speaker from Freeport, and Max Linn, a Bar Harbor independent who allies himself with President Donald Trump. Another independent, Portland lawyer Tiffany Bond, is trying to convince a court to put her on the ballot as well.</p>
<p>Kidman, the first openly non-binary candidate for U.S. Senate, racked up 7% of the vote in the July 14 Democratic primary, posting particularly strong numbers in the Portland area.</p>
<p>Kidman defeated Gideon in two rural towns, Van Buren and Eagle Lake, both of which were won by Betsy Sweet of Hallowell, who finished second in the primary.</p>
<p>Both Kidman and Sweet staked out positions to the left of Gideon, endorsing a progressive agenda that Gideon has not embraced. They also made an issue of reducing the reliance on campaign cash from the wealthy.</p>
<p>Kidman said voters need to “think critically about which candidates are willing to truly stand with the people against the unchecked influence of corporate power in this country.”</p>
<p>“With millions of dollars going into attack ads meant to obscure the fact that neither major-party candidate supports policies that Mainers favor by overwhelming margins, Lisa Savage stands out as the clear choice in this race,” Kidman said.</p>
<p>Savage praised Kidman’s “vibrancy and compassion” on the campaign trail in embracing the endorsement from a one-time rival for the Senate position Collins has held since 1996.</p>
<p>“I know that we share a belief that leadership is not reflected in the amount of money a person can raise, but rather by the amount of people whose lives a person can improve,” Savage said. “Bre’s focus on the every-person, those who are struggling to pay their rent and feed their children, is my focus, too.”</p>
<p>Kidman did not offer a second choice from among the candidates.</p>
<p>Unlike every other state’s Senate elections, Maine’s race does not necessarily diminish the chances of a favored front-runner because the votes given to anyone but the top two finishers are redistributed to whichever a voter prefers, if that voter ranked the candidates from best to worst on their ballot.</p>
<p>In short, Kidman’s endorsement of Savage does not necessarily make it any more likely that Gideon will lose to Collins if the two front-runners in the polls remain in the lead until Election Day.</p>
<p>“Mainers are tired of voting for the candidate they least dislike and being told they would otherwise be spoilers,” Savage said. “I’m here to tell them that they are free to vote their values this fall.”</p>

<h3 id="independent-gyms-in-flintshire-and-wrexham-welcome-news-of-an-opening-date-given-by-welsh-government">&ldquo;Independent gyms in Flintshire and Wrexham welcome news of an opening date given by Welsh Government&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.leaderlive.co.uk/resources/images/11653030/" alt="img">
INDEPENDENT gyms in Flintshire and Wrexham have welcomed the news that they will be allowed to reopen their doors within a week.</p>
<p>The First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, made the public announcement on July 31 that indoor gym facilities should prepare to reopen their workout spaces on August 10 – should conditions continue to allow it.</p>
<p>The news was met with open arms by most local owners who are counting down the days and preparing to reopen to members after being closed to the public since March.</p>
<p>Karen Turton, who is co-owner of Tribe Fitness on Flint’s Church Street, said she was ‘delighted’ to welcome back their members.</p>
<p>She said: “We are all operation go for Monday (10th). It cannot come soon enough, and we are absolutely delighted that it came this quickly because we were thinking that it may have been a little while longer that we had to stay shut.</p>
<p>“We put a lot of precautions in place to keep members safe when they feel ready to return to us such as temperature taking of those coming in and everyone having to pre book a slot to come in. Our own track and trace system is robust for what we need it to be.</p>
<p>“Lots is done through our app already and we operate as a cashless business too, so those aspects were already in motion for us. We’ve reduced class sizes and marked the floor so to comply with social distancing too.”</p>
<p>Karen says the Tribe business team, formed last year, looked at lockdown as a positive experience and have thought about what they can do adaptation wise and how it has helped them grow further as a start-up business.</p>
<p>Ricky Nicholson, who also has a gym based in Flint, said he is ‘overjoyed’ at the news and that it has been ‘a long time coming’.</p>
<p>He said: “It has been a long four-and-a-half months with limited support from the Government which has been a little disappointing. It is a welcoming decision, but it is dependent on what restrictions we need to have in place.</p>
<p>“But, because England reopened sooner, people from Wales have been going across the border to exercise. We pride ourselves on giving that personal touch that corporate gyms cannot manage – we know our members faces and hope they’ll return and support local gyms in their community given the news today.”</p>
<p>Ricky said that the gym will be operating on restricted numbers allowed in and reduced sizes for the classes they run.</p>
<p>He adds that sanitising of equipment at Nicholson Kickboxing and Fitness was a priority pre-COVID for the gym, but cleaning regimes have been increased again.</p>
<p>He said: “As a gym, we should maintain high standards of hygiene anyway, it’s just common knowledge and practice within the industry. Equipment is cleaned and sanitised after each session already, but it will just be monitored a lot more closely and we hope that the public will have hygiene at the forefront of their minds – now more so than ever.</p>
<p>“We have to build up that public confidence to return to the gym – for their own physical and mental wellbeing – and that has to be done slowly, it won’t happen overnight.”</p>
<p>He added that there will be sanitiser throughout the building, staff will be ‘quadrupling’ their attention to hygiene in the gym and members are being told they must bring their own equipment they wish to use for exercise to minimize the risk of transmitting the virus potentially.</p>
<p>Over in Wrexham, independent owners are happy to receive a date but have concerns that local spikes in cases may deter people from returning – and possibly see the restriction on opening put back in their path.</p>
<p>Paul Newell, owner of Ruabon Fitness Centre, shared his delight at the news but also said he has worries that the local situation in Wrexham may spell trouble for the future.</p>
<p>He said the gym will have proper markings to maintain distance and sanitiser stations and cleanliness will be kept monitored as best as possible.</p>
<p>Speaking on Friday, he said: &ldquo;It is essential that we open up. Big chains may have been able to cope but for small places like us we need to get back open as soon as we can - especially after months closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic that we&rsquo;ve got a date but for me its come too late - I wish there was a level date with England as I&rsquo;ve lost clients to gyms over the border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to make the most of the situation though as, in truth, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to be the 10th - I thought it would be delayed further. Wrexham is undergoing a bit of a spike with the worst rates in the country right now so there&rsquo;s a lot of people thinking we&rsquo;ll get a local lockdown here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig Hulme, the owner of Valhalla Gym, is one of many gym owners keen to reopen from the first day but said that, whilst the news was welcoming, expressed worries that opening behind England may result in clients lost to Welsh businesses.</p>
<p>He said: “It’s really good news that we’re now able to reopen as we’ve been closed since March 22. It is a long time to be out of business.</p>
<p>“The initial government support grants were quite generous but they only really covered up till July 1 so this month we’ve really been working from zero income. It could not have gone on a lot longer without a lot of smaller gyms across the country struggling.</p>
<p>“I spoke to a friend of mine that has a gym in Crewe to get an idea of what I need to have in place and getting some ideas. No two gyms will be the same based on the layout and number of people coming in so we are going to have to work it the best we can for our members – keeping people socially distanced and cleaning on a regular basis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People will also be expected to use common sense and best judgement of their own to maintain that safety element when using the machines in the gym – but staff will work their best to ensure people comply with the COVID regulations.</p>
<p>He also mentioned the delay in Welsh gyms has also meant that some of his members have made use of facilities in England – where gyms were allowed to open on Saturday, July 25 – and worries that other gyms in border towns will face the same prospect.</p>
<p>He added: “Given our closeness to Chester and Oswestry some of our members have gone over the border and we will have to wait and see if they return.”

John Oliver has criticised Donald Trump‘s handling of the coronavirus crisis, describing the US president’s actions as “shockingly reckless”.</p>
<p>Trump was widely condemned last week for using his Twitter account to promote a video in which a controversial doctor denounced the use of protective facial masks.</p>
<p>Dr Stella Immanuel, whom Trump called “impressive”, also endorsed the use of the chemical hydroxychloroquine as a measure to combat coronavirus, which experts suggest is not only ineffective, but highly dangerous.</p>

<p>In a press conference, Trump said that she’s ”had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients”, and described her voice as “important” – though he admitted he “knows nothing about her”.</p>
<p>Speaking on his HBO comedy series Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, the British-American comedian took issue with Trump’s remarks.</p>
<p>“That is not the philosophy you want when vetting medical experts,” he said. “Downplaying the risks of this have dire consequences.”</p>
<p>“Recklessness is abounding right now, heightening the need for strong leadership but unfortunately, we’re getting the exact opposite of that,” he said. “Just a week after Trump was given credit for shifting his rhetoric by urging Americans to wear masks, he did something that even for him was shockingly reckless.”</p>
<p>Oliver has been an outspoken critic of the president throughout Trump’s time in office, particularly during the pandemic. The presenter quipped that Trump belonged in the “knucklehead hall of fame” as a result of his actions.</p>
<p>The virus’s death toll in the US is higher than anywhere else in the world, with more than 155,000 people dying as a result of Covid-19.

The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.</p>
<p>During the full national lockdown, ministers were delighted with the success of their “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives” slogan. Indeed, some joked that it was “too successful”, as many people were reluctant to return to pubs, restaurants and workplaces when restrictions were eased.</p>
<p>Now Boris Johnson desperately needs a simple new message after making three U-turns: curbing foreign travel to Spain and Luxembourg; banning two households mixing in the north of England; and postponing planned relaxation of measures, including for weddings, bowling alleys, casinos, indoor theatres and concerts.</p>
<p>The prime minister tried but failed to conjure up a credible slogan at his Downing Street press conference on Friday, saying repeatedly, “hands, face, space”. He meant we should wash our hands, cover our face, and make space between us and other people. It probably sounded better when rehearsed in front of the mirror.</p>

<p>Of course, it just had to have three components, after “take back control” and “get Brexit done”. But the new one didn’t fly into the headlines as Johnson might have hoped. Media outlets realised that this was a pivotal moment; in an attempt to prevent a second spike, the easing has in effect gone into reverse, and his hopes of lifting restrictions by November have collapsed.</p>
<p>True, No 10 has had the communications task from hell after “stay at home” was inevitably replaced by more nuanced messages as the lockdown eased. Isaac Levido, the Australian strategist who ran Johnson’s successful election campaign last December, was recalled to Downing Street in March to fine-tune the message on the coronavirus outbreak, and helped to produce the “stay at home” slogan.</p>
<p>“The reason why it was so effective is because it was basically shorthand for the government strategy,” he told The Times this weekend. Crucially, he conceded that part of the reason the public did stay home was that they were “still seeing lots of people dying on the news”.</p>
<p>Local and now regional differences make the communications task even more daunting. But the government has not helped itself. Although sudden U-turns are inevitable in such a crisis, there have been too many contradictory signals from ministers, notably on face coverings – whether masks helped to contain the spread of the virus, when people should wear them, and in ministers’ own decisions on wearing them when they were liable to be photographed.</p>
<p>Ministers now blame the upsurge in infections on people failing to stick to social distancing rules – in their homes, rather than in the pub or at work – as well as their old favourite of “Europe” because of the “second wave” in parts of the continent.</p>
<p>Yet the public can’t be blamed for failing to decipher the fuzzy, mixed messages. As Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association’s council, told a cross-party parliamentary inquiry into the coronavirus last week: “Do you think any member of the public understands what ‘one metre plus’ means? What does the ‘plus’ mean? Many don’t really understand this because it’s not clear and they’re not social distancing.”</p>
<p>A study by University College London (UCL) found that nine out of 10 people understood the rules during the national lockdown, but there was “much poorer comprehension” once it was relaxed. Today, fewer than half of adults (45 per cent) in England report broad understanding of the rules (with only 14 per cent understanding them “very much”), compared with 61 per cent in Wales and 75 per cent in Scotland. Younger adults are less likely to understand the rules than older people, perhaps because it is harder to apply them to their more complex life scenarios and because they follow the news less than older people.</p>
<p>Daisy Fancourt, an associate professor at UCL, said: “The general drop-off in understanding could be due to unclear messaging from the government, or a reduction in interest and engagement from people, especially with the cessation of the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing in late June.” There will be daily on-camera briefings by Johnson’s new spokesperson, but not until the autumn and no one has been recruited yet.</p>
<p>With the clouds darkening again, there is a strong case to bring back daily briefings by ministers and their scientific advisers. The virus doesn’t respect August, so the government can’t afford to switch off. It should be honest with the public about the trade-offs needed to prevent a second spike, as Johnson and Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, commendably were at Friday’s press conference.</p>
<p>The communications challenge is going to get even harder. The Sunday papers suggested that Johnson war-gamed scenarios last week, including a lockdown for London with a border at the M25, asking many more of the over-50s to stay home, extending nationally the curbs on households meeting, and quarantining all arrivals for 14 days. Ominously, another scenario in the planning session was a rise in infections in the northwest, which came true just two hours after it was war-gamed.</p>
<p>No doubt the best brains in Downing Street are working overtime on refining the message. Perhaps they should imagine they are in a referendum or election campaign. Over to you, Dominic.

<h3 id="independent-canvey-cinema-pushes-back-plans-to-re-open">&ldquo;Independent Canvey cinema pushes back plans to re-open&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/11653050/" alt="img">
AN INDEPENDENT seafront cinema is hoping to open its doors in coming weeks</p>
<p>Bosses behind Movie Starr on Canvey’s seafront are hopeful they can re-open to their loyal customers on August 14.</p>
<p>A spokesman, posting on Facebook, said: “Due to recent changes to the upcoming film release dates, we have made the decision to move our re-opening. Unfortunately we will not be opening this month and we are hoping to re-open our doors on Friday, August 14.</p>
<p>“With the on going pandemic and film release dates changing this new date remains subject to final confirmation.</p>
<p>“We know how much you’ve missing the cinema and we hope to welcome you back to Movie Starr soon with great films ahead.”</p>
<p>It was met with delight on Facebook with more than 100 people liking the post and another 38 sharing the information to help spread the word about the possible re-opening of the popular cinema.</p>
<p>It comes Cineworld announced plans last week to re-open a number of its venues including its one in Basildon and with running a special 4DX Never Been Seen screening programme.</p>
<p>Then on Friday Boris Johnson announced the re-opening of “high risk” areas including skating rinks, casinos and bowling alleys will be delayed amid fears over a rise in the number of new coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>The sector had been planned to re-open tomorrow but PM Boris Johnson has now put the brakes on the plans, which comes after the Office for National Statistics revealed the number of coronavirus cases had increased with 35,700 people currently infected with the bug.</p>
<p>Re-opening of the “high risk” sector will be examined again in two weeks time.
