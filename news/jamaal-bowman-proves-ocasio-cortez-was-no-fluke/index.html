<p>He also got ample financial help from liberal groups like the Working Families Party and political action committees like the Justice Democrats, which jointly spent more than $1 million to oust Mr. Engel. Justice Democrats also recruited Mr. Bowman, after recommendations for education activists.</p>
<p>A first-time candidate with a fiery anti-establishment message, Mr. Bowman ran a campaign that built firmly on the pillars of current progressive policy: reforming the criminal justice system, addressing income inequality and embracing Medicare for All. He also preached about the need for broader social changes such as what he called “righting the wrongs of our country’s history toward a better future.”</p>
<p>Those issues took on new urgency as the United States reeled after the killing in police custody of George Floyd in late May. The protests that followed were broadly incorporated into, and invigorated, the Black Lives Matter movement, and provided Mr. Bowman, who is Black and said he had been physically attacked by the police as a child, with a powerful talking point.</p>
<p>The Black Lives Matter movement also served as a backdrop for a cringe-inducing moment for Mr. Engel. At a social justice event in the Bronx in early June, he was caught on microphone suggesting that he was only there because of his contested race.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t have a primary,” he said, “I wouldn’t care.”</p>
<p>Some analysts say Mr. Bowman’s win — and strong showings by Mr. Jones, Mr. Torres, and Mr. Patel — reinforces the power of Black and other minority voters in an increasingly diverse city.</p>
<p>“The demographics have flipped,” said Peter Ragone, a former top aide to Mayor Bill de Blasio and a regular adviser to Democratic politicians. “And it’s accelerating with a velocity that no one could have anticipated.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bowman, who said his campaign had made a million calls to voters, also hammered Mr. Engel for not being in the district during the crisis, suggesting that the incumbent spent much of his time at a home he owns in suburban Maryland. Mr. Engel sought to refute the assertion, saying he was a steady presence in the district, including in Riverdale, where he lives.

<p>Jamaal Bowman, a progressive candidate running in his first political campaign, has defeated longtime Rep. Eliot Engel in the New York Democratic primary.</p>
<p>Bowman’s victory over Engel in New York’s 16th Congressional District is a mirror image of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning upset win over longtime Rep. Joe Crowley in the 14th district in 2018. Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bowman over Engel before the June 23 primary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m a Black man who was raised by a single mother in a housing project,&rdquo; Bowman tweeted after the Associated Press projected Friday that he&rsquo;d won the race. &ldquo;That story doesn’t usually end in Congress. But today, that 11-year-old boy who was beaten by police is about to be your next Representative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Engel conceded a short time later. &ldquo;The numbers are clear, and I will not be the Democratic nominee for the 16th Congressional District seat in the fall election,&rdquo; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serving the people of the Bronx and Westchester in Congress has been the greatest privilege of my life, and what a remarkable 32 years it has been,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Mr. Bowman well as he begins this new chapter in his life,&rdquo; Engel added.</p>

<p>Bowman, a 44-year-old father of three, centered his campaign on racial injustice and human rights.</p>
<p>“Coming into the campaign, we felt that structural racism, institutional racism, institutional classism, institutional sexism and militarism are the evils that continue to plague American society generally,&rdquo; he told NBC News last month.</p>
<p>The win is a major victory for the progressive wing of the party. Bowman, who resigned as the principal of a middle school in the Bronx to focus full time on his race, was endorsed by Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., as well as Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
<p>His victory comes as Ocasio-Cortez routed a Democratic challenger, and insurgent candidate Suraj Patel is running neck-and-neck with House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The races suggest a growing power of young and diverse progressives in the New York City metropolitan area, even as the left has lost primaries elsewhere.</p>
<p>Bowman was recruited by the liberal activist group Justice Democrats in a contest that was initially seen as a long shot for Engel&rsquo;s challenger.</p>
<p>Engel, a New York congressman since 1989, was backed by former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>Bowman had been leading in the vote count since the night of the June 23 primary, but a surge in absentee voting as a result of the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a delay in the final results. Under New York state law, absentee votes can&rsquo;t begin to be counted until one week after the primary.</p>
<p>The 16th district covers parts of the Bronx and Westchester County and is heavily Democratic, making Bowman a strong favorite to win the general election this fall. There&rsquo;s no Republican candidate running. Bowman will face off against a single challenger, Conservative Party candidate Patrick McManus, in November.</p>
<p>The campaign of Engel, 73, spiraled downward amid a series of unforced errors in the final six weeks before the primary.</p>
<p>It began with an article in The Atlantic revealing that Engel&rsquo;s campaign had created the impression that he was participating in events at home during the coronavirus pandemic while he was actually living in his Washington-area home. In early June, he had a hot mic moment indicating that he wanted to speak at event just to ward off a political threat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t have a primary, I wouldn&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he said in a comment that was picked up by a TV microphone.</p>
<p>Bowman&rsquo;s victory comes as Ocasio-Cortez routed a Democratic challenger and insurgent Suraj Patel runs neck-and-neck with House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. The races suggest a growing power of young and diverse progressives in the New York City metropolitan area, even as the left has lost primaries elsewhere.</p>
<p>Bowman was recruited by the left-leaning activist group Justice Democrats in a contest that was initially seen as a long shot for Engel&rsquo;s challenger.</p>
<p>In a tweet Friday, the group hailed Bowman’s win. “The Squad is here to stay — and it&rsquo;s growing,” the tweet said.

Read: Why this Democrat won’t go home</p>
<p>Bowman: What you discovered just revealed and confirmed that he’s not here. When you live in NYCHA [New York City Housing Authority], for example, and your front door has been broken and your mailboxes have been broken and the elevator has been broken for four years, and whenever it gets fixed, it gets broken again, and you can’t get maintenance done in your apartment, and you can’t find fresh organic food at the local supermarket, and your schools are underfunded, it makes it worse that your congressperson is not physically living in the district and not engaging and connecting and leading on the issues that impact your quality of life every day.</p>
<p>Dovere: How much do you think the Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd changed your race?</p>
<p>Bowman: I shared personal stories of police brutality and police harassment throughout the campaign, prior to this. I was 11 years old when I was initially brutalized by the police, just for horse-playing with my friends and not responding to the police in the way they wanted me to. I was thrown against the wall, handcuffed, had my face dragged on the ground, had a nightstick to my back because of this incident, only to be let go without charge—as an 11-year-old. There were multiple times I was pulled over by the police, handcuffed, taken into custody, only to be released without charge. This happened at least two or three times in my life. I have been very transparent with those things prior to the George Floyd murder. After the murder, I did a direct-to-camera video and I was crying, I was sobbing. I just want to share my feelings in that moment. I had people in a district telling me, you know, how my voice was needed more now than ever at this moment in this country’s history. I hate that it took for the world to see the murder of another Black man.</p>
<p>Dovere: But so far, we haven’t seen many substantial results happen, and the protests have mostly faded. Would you call them a success?</p>
<p>Bowman: I don’t know if I would agree that we haven’t seen results. One could argue that our victory is a result. There were protests all throughout this district. I attended many of those. And I got a chance to speak at many of those. We still have the presidential election, and how are we going to organize in support of Joe Biden to help him get elected? And how are we going to continue to organize to work with President Joe Biden and also hold him accountable to what the American people are demanding at this moment?</p>
<p>Dovere: You said in your primary-night speech, “You know what Donald Trump is more afraid of than anything else? A Black man with power.” What do you mean?</p>
<p>Bowman: Well, because he’s a racist, and a fascist, and he has benefited from white supremacy his entire life. And when you carry that ideology—white supremacy not just as skin color, but as mindset, as ideology—when you benefit from that, you can’t tolerate a Black man or a person of color with power who is not afraid to speak up for themselves, to speak truth to power, to engage in the community in the way that might be undermining to you. That’s what it is. And when I say “Black man,” I also mean Black people and people of color and white allies who are done with institutional racism. The collective power that we possess is what’s going to ultimately defeat Trump both as a president, but also as an idea—the idea of Trump or someone else coming along at the end, trying to leverage reality-TV stardom and wealth based on a rigged system to win the presidency.

<h3 id="what-a-difference-a-cycle-makes-pelosi-statement-on-jamaal-bowman-compared-to-aoc-tells-a-tale-of-two-years">&ldquo;What a Difference a Cycle Makes: Pelosi Statement On Jamaal Bowman Compared to AOC Tells a Tale of Two Years&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2020/07/AP_20198580144702-e1595085234627.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800" alt="img">
What a difference a cycle makes. This time around, the group Justice Democrats, which had backed Ocasio-Cortez, put its energy behind Jamaal Bowman, taking on Rep. Eliot Engel in a neighboring district to Ocasio-Cortez’s. Engel had been in Congress a decade longer than Crowley, and was a real chair, sitting atop the House Foreign Affairs Committee. On Friday, after mail-in bailouts had been counted, Bowman was officially declared the winner of the primary. Pelosi’s reaction was markedly different.</p>
<p>I salute Chairman Crowley for a formidable legacy of achievement for the people of New York. I congratulate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her victory.</p>
<p>As Chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Joe Crowley brought principled, unifying and forward-looking leadership to the historic challenges of the Trump Administration. Our Caucus has been strengthened by his chairmanship, and by Chairman Crowley’s relentless determination to defend the inclusive America symbolized by the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>Chairman Joe Crowley has been an unwavering champion for America’s working families for almost two decades. To know Congressman Crowley is to know his fierce pride in representing Queens and the Bronx, and the joy and effectiveness he brought to serve as their voice in the Congress.</p>
<p>Crowley was not the chairman of a major committee, but held the title of Chair of the House Democratic Caucus, an honorific she used in her farewell note. The statement itself would not generate significant news, but would send a signal to other House Democrats about how she was thinking about his loss. It included only a passing reference to the future congresswoman in the final line.</p>
<p>The day after New York Rep. Joe Crowley lost his primary to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House, issued her statement on the affair, solemnly titled, “ Pelosi Statement on Chairman Joe Crowley .”</p>
<p>The first subtle change is in the headline. Where the previous statement centered Crowley, the new one moves into neutral: “Pelosi Statement on the NY-16 Primary Election.”</p>
<p>Pelosi’s words are carefully chosen, and watched closely by her Democratic colleagues in the House as a gauge of the direction of the party’s politics. When she slighted the so-called Squad last year as just “four people,” she effectively signaled how seriously she took their challenge. The warm note sent Saturday morning to Bowman — who has promised to “cause trouble for the status quo in Washington” — sends an entirely different signal.</p>
<p>Like with Crowley, her statement on the latest race fairly begins with kind words toward her vanquished colleague:</p>
<p>Chairman Eliot Engel has been a powerful force for good in America in his three decades of service in the Congress. His leadership has strengthened our Caucus, Congress and country at the helm of the Foreign Affairs Committee, where he has been masterful in his work keeping the American people safe at home while protecting our interests and advancing our values abroad. And serving as a Senior Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he has strengthened millions of families’ health, financial security and well-being.</p>
<p>But from there, however, she pivots to Bowman.</p>
<p>Jamaal Bowman has run an electrifying campaign that has stirred the Bronx and Westchester communities with his message of hope, justice and progress. As an educator and progressive advocate, he has been a voice for the voiceless who brings great urgency to the fight to lift up working families.</p>
<p>She concludes with a similar refrain to her Crowley statement, but adds a welcoming note that was not offered to Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
<p>I salute Chairman Engel for his distinguished service, which has made a difference for America. I congratulate Jamaal Bowman on his victory and look forward to welcoming him to Congress.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean Bowman and the Squad will be welcomed with open arms next term. A “congressional source” went to the New York Post with an entirely different tone, using Bowman’s win as another opportunity to take a swipe at Ocasio-Cortez. “People keep writing positive articles about her because it gets clicks. But what’s the reality? What has she delivered? So much has been written about the Green New Deal… did it ever become law?” he said. “She is good at tweeting, not legislating.”</p>
<p>The source went on to dunk on Ocasio-Cortez for losses in primaries by Morgan Harper and Jessica Cisneros, candidates she endorsed for Congress in Ohio and Texas, respectively, though Ocasio-Cortez hadn’t actually endorsed Harper. “Her candidates have gotten crushed from Ohio to Texas. Bowman and Jones are excellent candidates who would have won without her endorsement,” the source claimed. Jones refers to Mondaire Jones, who primaried Rep. Nita Lowey, who retired rather than run for re-election. Jones then won the open primary.</p>
<p>Whoever the Post’s quoted source is, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who took over Crowley’s role a chair of the caucus, has sounded a similar note before. After Harper’s loss to Rep. Joyce Beatty, Jeffries took to Twitter:

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GJHIXPWGWQI6VKBFQ4RAATSBKA.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
“I really want to vote for you!” said the driver.</p>
<p>“Appreciate you, brother,” said Bowman, who gently informed the driver that the primary had happened a few days prior, with Bowman getting more than 60 percent of the in-person vote. The 44-year-old middle school principal who’d never run for office before was the prohibitive favorite in the primary race against Rep. Eliot L. Engel, a 31-year congressman who is chairman of the powerful House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Everyone in the car cheered. Like many other races in New York, though, results may not be official until August due to a massive influx of mail-in ballots because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The 16th Congressional District is majority black and Latino, with large pockets of white suburbs, covering the northern part of the Bronx and the southern part of Westchester County. And it just so happens to adjoin the 14th Congressional District in the Bronx, where two years ago then-28-year-old bartender Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pulled off the surprise defeat of Joseph Crowley, the No. 4 Democrat in the House.</p>
<p>With two neighboring white male incumbents overthrown by liberal, first-time politicians of color in two years, the upstart left wing of Democrats seems to be proving AOC’s win was not a fluke.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>This election cycle, the waves of leftist rabble-rousing influence have boomed out like an earthquake in concentric circles, from Ocasio-Cortez’s district (where she is headed toward reelection despite well-funded primary challengers) to Bowman’s, and — more surprising still — deep into the wealthy suburbs of Westchester along the Metro North. There, another black liberal and first-time candidate, 33-year-old attorney Mondaire Jones, won the hotly contested open seat vacated by 83-year-old Rep. Nita M. Lowey (D) in the even more suburban 17th Congressional District, which is 60 percent white.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>New York also may soon claim the first two openly gay black or Latino members of Congress: Jones and Ritchie Torres, a city council member who is black and Puerto Rican and appears to have won the open seat in the 15th Congressional District in the Bronx. What’s more, Bowman, Jones and Torres all grew up in either public or Section 8 housing.</p>
<p>That voters have elevated these voices, in the middle of a pandemic that has disproportionately affected black and brown people and as Black Lives Matter protests have spread across the state, seems to signal that there may be further political changes to come.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>As things stand, Bowman has a 25 percentage point lead, but Engel has filed a lawsuit that would allow him to challenge absentee ballots and refuses to concede. Bowman doesn’t have the official green light to celebrate, but Jones does. On Tuesday, the Associated Press declared him the winner with a lead that was too large for his opponents to overcome three weeks after Election Day.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In Yonkers, though, it feels as if Bowman has already won. He’s doing Zoom calls with community leaders to push for an eviction moratorium and rent freezes, and reading a proposal Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) wrote for a Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation Commission.</p>
<p>“Watch out!” he shouted.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>His wife, Melissa, an elementary school teacher, was pulling into the driveway. He hugged his kids, Maya, 6, and Marcel, 10 (his oldest son, Jelani, 19, is off at college in New Jersey). Soon he was carrying Maya’s pink bike with training wheels and “LOL” stickers into the house.</p>
<p>“During the race, Melissa was angry with me the whole time, until it was like, ‘Yo, you might win.’ Then she started getting friendly,” Jamaal said. “It was just the stress of the whole race and the fact that I turned her life upside down by running for office.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s your perception?” Melissa said. “I mean, I was worried. There’s so much uncertainty.” But now? “I’m excited. I’m excited. There’s so much he can do. It’s limitless.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I curse?&rdquo; Bowman said when asked why he started hinting to friends years ago that he wanted to run for Congress. &ldquo;S&mdash; was f&mdash;ed up! I mean, I&rsquo;m a principal on the Bronx side of the district for 10 years. I&rsquo;ve got families losing their homes, parents that have been killed, kids self-mutilating because of mental distress, kids being admitted into mental institutions.&rdquo; Thirty-four children in his district died in the 2017-2018 school year, 17 of them from suicide. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s talking about the connection between trauma and poverty and bad policy, in the Bronx, in Yonkers, wherever black and brown people are. That is unacceptable. And it&rsquo;s been like that my entire life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bowman was raised by a single mother, a postal worker, in public housing in East Harlem before moving in with grandparents in rent-stabilized housing in the Yorkville section of the Upper East Side. He taught and was a guidance counselor for 10 years, then founded a middle school, Cornerstone Academy for Social Action, in the Bronx, while his house is in Yonkers, a working-class inner suburb that is technically its own city (the fourth-biggest in the state) but feels more like an extension of the Bronx.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Like many black men who grew up like he did, Bowman can cite his first beating by a police officer, an incident he said he spent many years trying not to think about. He was 11 and “was simply horseplaying and giving a little back talk,” he said. “That led to me being thrown up against a wall, thrown to the ground, nightstick to the back, face dragged against the floor, and my mother and I felt like we didn’t have any recourse.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>It’s his personal connection to these issues that makes his win less surprising in the Bronx, one of the city’s hardest-hit coronavirus hot spots, and the site of lootings and violent clashes with the police during the protests.</p>
<p>The liberal wave leaned so far left this cycle that Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez in Brooklyn faced a primary challenge from Paperboy Love Prince, a 27-year old rapper whose name appeared exactly like that on the ballot, who prefers “futurist” and “Team Love” to “progressive,” who aimed to be the first non-binary member of Congress, and who walked away with 20 percent of the in-person vote. The wave goes beyond New York, too. In New Jersey, Amy Kennedy — yes, a Kennedy! — won by running as anti-establishment.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Bowman’s and Jones’s presumptive wins in particular reflect a national trend of changing demographics, said Waleed Shahid, spokesman for the Justice Democrats, the liberal political action committee that formed after Sen. Bernie Sanders’s 2016 campaign and backed Bowman and Ocasio-Cortez’s current campaign.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“A lot of people don’t know this, but many of the suburbs in Westchester are majority people of color now,” Shahid said. “What we’re seeing across the country is that working-class people of color are being pushed out of cities because of gentrification and the high cost of rent.”</p>
<p>Like Ocasio-Cortez, Bowman was recruited by the Justice Democrats, which had identified Engel as vulnerable and the 16th Congressional District as ripe for an overhaul. A fellow educator nominated him as a candidate, and Bowman’s campaign benefited from the expertise of two of the staffers who worked on Ocasio-Cortez’s winning campaign.</p>
<p>“He had a record of leadership in the district that was really impressive,” Shahid said. Not only had he been in education for 20 years, “he’d been an organizer in the fight for public schools and racial and economic justice. So many families knew him. Activists knew him.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And they didn’t just know his name. They knew him, had been students of his or had kids in his classes. Bowman kept his job as a principal through all of 2019, resigning only in January. In the last stretch of the campaign, he toured the district in a yellow school bus with a megaphone attached.</p>
<p>Being a principal of a public middle school in the Bronx earned him instant respect, said Luke Hayes, Bowman’s campaign manager: “People with kids or teachers are like, ‘Yeah, that’s a tough age to have to be an educator in.’ ” As the hosts of “Desus &amp; Mero” pointed out when Bowman came on their talk show, handling Congress or the press corps would be easy compared with keeping the attention of a roomful of tweens.</p>
<p>Yet as late as May, Bowman’s own internal poll from Data for Progress showed him trailing Engel by 30 percentage points. Then the Atlantic’s Edward-Isaac Dovere published an article saying that Engel had been sheltering in place in Maryland and hadn’t set foot in the Bronx during the entire pandemic. “I’m in both ­places,” Engel replied when Dovere confronted him about being in Maryland while his presence was being touted at events in New York.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Three weeks before the election, days into the protests that erupted after the killing of George Floyd, Engel did show up at a Bronx event calling for peace amid looting. When informed there wasn’t time for him to speak, Engel said, twice, into a hot mic: “If I didn’t have a primary, I wouldn’t care.”</p>
<p>A day later, Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Bowman, followed by Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>Eleventh-hour endorsements from establishment Democrats, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Clinton, and from members of the Congressional Black Caucus came in for Engel.</p>
<p>“The Clinton endorsement led to our second-biggest fundraising day of the campaign,” said Bowman — second only to the hot-mic moment day. “So, thanks! It gave us another hundred grand to put toward more advertising.”</p>
<p>If Bowman ran largely on his record as a principal, Mondaire Jones earned his votes more through the hope and generational change he represented. His district is divided by the Hudson River. To the east is Westchester County, which has one of the highest concentrations of wealthy communities in the country. To the west is Rockland County, a nirvana of greenery with pockets of deep poverty, where Jones grew up and now lives.</p>
<p>He was Lowey’s first primary challenger since she took her seat in 1988, which may have led to her announcing her retirement in October. Now he’ll probably be the first African American or person of color to hold that seat, having triumphed over a formidable seven-person field — including a pharmaceuticals heir who spent $4 million of his own money.</p>
<p>“We need more politicians for whom policy is personal,” is one of Jones’s frequent mantras. He was raised on food stamps by a single mother. He made it out of a declining public school to Stanford University, Harvard Law, and a stint with the Obama administration. He argued for canceling the student debt that led him to work in corporate law before he wound up at Westchester County’s Law Department. He called climate change an existential crisis in river towns where people regularly bail water out of their basements. He was the one candidate advocating for Medicare-for-all during a pandemic when people had lost their health-care coverage along with their jobs, and the one candidate who had criminal justice reform in his platform before George Floyd was killed.</p>
<p>Sitting outside his apartment complex in Nyack, Jones said he’d told Bernie Sanders, who endorsed him, that he owed his election to the frustrations young liberals had over the presidential primary.</p>
<p>“I am so grateful to them for channeling that hurt, that pain into down-ballot races like mine,” he said. At one polling place in a majority-white precinct, Jones’s staff members talked to people who were still in line at 11 p.m. “They said, ‘My kid is going to kill me if I don’t stay in this line and vote for Mondaire Jones,’ ” Jones said.</p>
<p>Bowman, too, benefited from appealing to younger voters ready for change. Back in Yonkers, he’d switched into a more recognizable face mask. It was his signature in the home stretch of the campaign, with the bright yellow logo of his favorite hip-hop group, the Wu Tang Clan.</p>
<p>It’s a conversation starter for anyone his age group.</p>
<p>“They know where I’m coming from without even saying anything,” he said. “Hip-hop is the culture that raised me along with my mother.”</p>
<p>For him, Wu Tang, who rose out of the projects in Staten Island, aren’t just about the music. They’re an ethos, an inspiration.</p>
<p>“Hip-hop is a culture that is created by teenagers who were forgotten about,” he said, “and because they were forgotten about, they were forced to come together and create something beautiful.”</p>
<p>He spent the day driving around thanking supporters: from Janice Simpson at the Caribbean American-owned shop Lloyd’s Carrot Cake to Melissa Meshulum, an organizer in Riverdale, a predominantly white and Jewish neighborhood home to two of the city’s most elite private schools.</p>
<p>Bowman appears to have carried Riverdale despite the Democratic Majority for Israel spending more than $1.3 million backing Engel.</p>
<p>Next, he drove back to Yonkers to meet up with Sangeet Raj and Nubia Earth Martin, a doula and midwife who’d helped organize his first campaign event in June, bringing attention to the maternal mortality rate among black women, which is 12 times higher than white women in New York City.</p>
<p>“To me,” Bowman said, “if we have a system that allows black women to die at a disproportionate rate at a time in their lives that is supposed to be the most joyous and celebratory, then we’re sick as a society, right?”</p>
<p>The final stop was in a predominantly minority-occupied affordable housing development called Co-op City, where Lorraine Fairley, 63, another educator, had organized many of the residents to vote for Bowman. She’d actually tried to discourage him from running. “Those kids love him. I didn’t want him to leave the school!” she said.</p>
<p>With Bowman and Jones, it’s hard to separate their hard-fought, shrewdly strategic wins from the momentum gained by being the right candidates for this moment of pandemic and protests. But Jones at least feels like they’re imminently easy to separate: “There is this narrative that is actually condescending that, you know, my victory is owed to that fact that we are experiencing racial unrest.”</p>
<p>What it comes down to, he said, is “people want to be inspired by their member of Congress and they certainly don’t want to be told what we can and cannot do.”</p>
<p>In his race he was the only candidate who, as Bowman had said in more colorful language, called for tearing down broken, inequitable systems.

“I’m a Black man who was raised by a single mother in a housing project. That story doesn’t usually end in Congress. But today, that 11-year old boy who was beaten by police is about to be your next Representative,” Bowman said in a statement. Bowman said his campaign was anchored in the fight for racial and economic justice “and it resonated in every part of the district.”
