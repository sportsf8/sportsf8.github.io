<p>He wrote in the caption: &lsquo;To 2020! The new era has already begun. So let&rsquo;s all keep only moving forward, staying so present to enjoy each and every moment throughout this beautiful new beginning. Happy New Year, peeps. So much love and gratitude for all in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In addition to starring in Netflix series The OA and American Horror Story: Hotel, he was signed to the Chadwick modelling agency.</p>
<p>Harry was also a musician performing under the name, ANTIBOY, an alter ego he described as a &lsquo;gender fluid robot from the future&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Harry identified as gender-fluid, according to a March 2019 interview with <a href="https://boysbygirls.co.uk/conversations/harry-hains">Boys by Girls</a> magazine. The article referred to Harry using &lsquo;he&rsquo; and &lsquo;him&rsquo; pronouns.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that I am born male but I don&rsquo;t think I represent what it means to be a man,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe we should be whatever we want. It gets kind of confusing when we start labelling ourselves so I try to stay away from labels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I grew up in Melbourne and I had a very open and accepting family. Dating someone of either sex didn&rsquo;t make a difference to me.&rsquo;</p>
