<p>In early 1941, as America launched a massive military buildup in preparation for World War II, a backbench Missouri senator named Harry Truman became shocked by the corporate profiteering in the building of military bases.</p>
<p>Beginning his investigations at Fort Leonard Wood in his home state, Truman drove an estimated 10,000 miles across the country to document the waste, the incompetence and the bill padding that came with cost-plus contracts. As Truman explained, “Huge fixed fees were offered by the government in much the same way as Santa Claus passes out gifts at a church Christmas party.”</p>
<p>Truman’s solution was to successfully propose a special Senate investigative committee. The Truman committee sparked predictable alarm at the White House and the War Department.</p>
<p>As David McCullough writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning Truman biography, “A single nettlesome senator could mean unending problems and bad publicity. … Constant congressional probing could well delay or deter the whole program.”</p>
<p>The president was Franklin D. Roosevelt, at the height of his powers after being inaugurated for an unprecedented third term. But Truman, a fellow Democrat, was undeterred, believing that patriotism in a wartime era mattered more than party loyalty.

The long-lost Anglo-Saxon abbey where Edgar the Peaceful was crowned as King of England in 973AD may have finally been discovered by archaeologists in Bath.</p>
<p>The monarch ascended to the throne following the death of his older brother in 959AD but was not crowned until 973AD — 14 years later.</p>
<p>His coronation cemented his place as a divine ruler and made him the first king to be formally recognised by God. He was the first king to rule over all regions of Britain, from Scotland to Mercia and Wessex.</p>
<p>The coronation set the blueprint for all future Kings and Queens.</p>

<p>Bath Abbey&rsquo;s (pictured) site has long been thought to have been home to an Anglo-Saxon monastery but no evidence was ever found</p>
<p>WHO WAS EDGAR THE PEACEFUL? Pictured, Edgar the Peaceful who presided over a stable 14-year period King Edgar the Peaceful, son of Edmund I and Ælfgifu of Shaftesbury and brother of Eadwig, became monarch in 959AD and ruled for 16 years. He was just a teenager when he ascended to the throne following the death of his older brother an decided to have his coronation in Bath. He is also believed to have been slight of stature, according to surviving contemporary records. However, his rein was known for its stability. Following his famed coronation in Bath in 973AD. The ceremony was devised by Edgar and his advisor St Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and drew heavily on the West Frankish (Carolingian) imperial coronations and explicitly emphasised that Edgar was king by the will of God. He is said to marched to Chester and been met by six so-called kings of England. Edgar was the first crowned King of England, uniting the kingdoms of Wessex, Mercia and Northumbria into one political entity. The kings, including the King of Scots, King of Strathclyde, Cumbria, , Gwynedd, Morgannwg and Norse-controlled York are said to have signalled their allegiance to Edgar by rowing him in his state barge across the River Dee. He died two years later but is deemed to be the first King who united the many regions of Britain under one rule. Advertisement</p>
<p>Semi-circular relics were found by a team from Wessex Archaeology during renovation work at Bath Abbey.</p>
<p>They were dated to between the 8th and 10th century AD and experts believe it may well be the site of King Edgar&rsquo;s coronation.</p>
<p>The structures were found to the south of the modern-day Abbey, below street level but on top of Roman remains that pre-date the site.</p>
<p>Plaster from the uncovered remains contained charcoal and were sent to Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast for radiocarbon analysis.</p>
<p>The dates came back as AD 780-970 and AD 670-770, much to the delight of Wessex Archaeology Senior Project Officer Cai Mason.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;The most likely place to find this type of structure is at the east end of an ecclesiastical building, such as a church or chapel, and given the fact that the excavated structures are surrounded by late Saxon burials, this is the most likely explanation for their use.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This, together with the late Saxon stonework and burials found at the Abbey, provides increasingly strong evidence that we have indeed found part of Bath&rsquo;s lost Anglo-Saxon monastery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bath Abbey&rsquo;s site is long thought to have been home to an Anglo-Saxon monastery but no evidence was ever found.</p>
<p>The two structures were discovered during excavations as part of Bath Abbey&rsquo;s Footprint project.</p>
<p>It hopes to restore the Abbey&rsquo;s collapsing floor, install an eco-friendly heating system utilising Bath&rsquo;s famous thermal springs, and creating new facilities to improve its hospitality, worship and service to the city.</p>

<p>It is believed the Anglo-Saxon monastery was the specific site.</p>
<p>Findings of the building&rsquo;s physical form add weight to this belief.</p>
<p>The Reverend Canon Guy Bridgewater at Bath Abbey said: &lsquo;This is a really exciting find.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While we&rsquo;ve always known there once was an Anglo-Saxon monastery on this site, no trace of the building remains above ground today.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So it&rsquo;s amazing that we now have an actual record of it and can get a real sense of it as it was.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Bath Abbey site has a complex history which features Romans, Anglo-Saxons and several renovations. Ongoing work has unearthed the latest relics</p>
<p>Wessex Archaeology Senior Project Officer Cai Mason said the most likely place to find the relic structures is in an ecclesiastical building, such as a church or chapel</p>

<h3 id="the-lost-king-of-england">&ldquo;The Lost King of England&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.heritagedaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ETH111.jpg" alt="img">
Æthelred II, also dubbed the Unready was King of Saxon England during 978–1013 and 1014–1016.</p>
<p>Under his father Kind Edgar, England had experienced a period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelaw in the mid-10th century. However, beginning in 980, small bands of Danish invaders carried out coastline raids testing defences across England that included Hampshire, Thanet, Cornwall, Dorset and Cheshire.</p>
<p>After several successful Danish raids such as the Battle of Maldon, where a sizable Danish fleet defeated Byrhtnoth, ealdorman of Essex, Æthelred turned to paying tributes to hold off the invaders and keep the peace in his realm.</p>
<p>This policy was to change when Æthelred ordered the massacre of all Danish men in England to take place on 13 November 1002, St Brice’s Day, otherwise called the “St. Brice’s Day Massacre.” It is thought that Gunhilde, sister of Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark, was said to have been among the victims.</p>
<p>Historians have generally viewed the massacre as a political act which helped to provoke Sweyn’s invasion of 1003. In 1004, after the Danish sacking of Norwich, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports a bloody battle between the East Anglians led by Ulfcytel Snillingr and an army led by Swein Forkbeard.</p>
<p>The Chronicle states that Ulfcytel and the “councillors in East Anglia” attempted to buy a truce with Swein, but that the Danes broke the truce and marched to Thetford where a part of the East Anglian fyrd engaged them.</p>

<p>The battle seems to have been a draw as the Danes managed to escape. Two of the Chronicle manuscripts state that the Danes later “admitted that they had never met with harder hand-play [fighting] in England than Ulfcytel gave them”. The Danish army left England for Denmark in 1005, perhaps because of their injuries sustained in East Anglia, or perhaps from the very severe famine which afflicted the continent and the British Isles in that year.</p>
<p>Sweyn later returned to England in 1013 with an invading force intent on crowning him King of England. By the end of 1013, English resistance had collapsed and Sweyn had conquered the country, King Æthelred sent his sons Edward (Ironside) and Alfred to Normandy, and retreated to the Isle of Wight, where he fled overseas in exile to seek support from his ally, the Norwegian king Olaf.</p>
<p>In 1014, Sweyn suddenly died, leaving his son Cnut the Great as King, but secretly a deputation was sent to Æthelred to restore him to the throne. Æthelred then launched an expedition against Cnut and his allies, the men of the Kingdom of Lindsey. Cnut’s army had not completed its preparations and, in April 1014, he decided to withdraw from England without a fight leaving his Lindsey allies to suffer Æthelred’s revenge.</p>
<p>A Norse saga tells of a battle when King Æthelred returned to attack Danish-occupied London.</p>
<p>According to the saga, the Danes lined London Bridge and showered the attackers with spears. Undaunted, the attackers pulled the roofs off nearby houses and held them over their heads in the boats. Thus protected, they were able to get close enough to the bridge to attach ropes to the piers and pull the bridge down, thus ending the Viking occupation of London.</p>
<p>Viking Invasion by Cnut the Great</p>
<p>War loomed again, when in the summer of 1015, Cnut the Great, son of Sweyn Forkbeard set sail for England with a Danish army of perhaps 10,000 men in 200 longships. The invasion force was to engage in close and grisly warfare with the English for the next fourteen months.</p>
<p>Cnut eventually conquered most of England, while Edmund rejoined Æthelred to defend London where Æthelred subsequently died on 23 April 1016. The subsequent war between Edmund and Cnut ended in a decisive victory for Cnut at the Battle of Ashingdon on 18 October 1016.</p>
<p>Cnut maintained his power over England by uniting Danes and Englishmen under cultural bonds of wealth and custom, rather than by sheer brutality. The protection he lent against Viking raiders (many of them formerly under his command) restored the prosperity that had been increasingly impaired in England.</p>
<p>Historian Norman Cantor went further to make the statement that he was “the most effective king in Anglo-Saxon history”, despite him not being Anglo-Saxon.</p>
<p>In contrast, Æthelred went down in history as being branded with the notorious nickname “unready”, from Old English Æþelræd Unræd. Bosworth-Toller’s Anglo-Saxon Dictionary defines the noun unræd in various ways, but generally it means “evil counsel”, “bad plan”or “folly”.</p>
<p>The epithet would seem to describe the poor quality of advice which Æthelred received throughout his reign, presumably from those around him, specifically from the royal council, known as the Witan. Though the nickname does not suggest anything particularly respectable about the king himself, its invective is not actually focused on the king but on those around him, who were expected to provide the young king with god ræd (i.e. good counsel).</p>
<p>Æthelred was buried in Old St Paul’s Cathedral, London, where he was placed next to King Sæbbi of Essex (d.697). The location of his tomb was outlined in the plan of the Cathedral created by Wenceslaus Hollar in 1658, where much of the detailed information historians have of the cathedral is taken from William Dugdale’s 1658 History of St Pauls Cathedral.</p>
<p>The tomb and his monument were later destroyed along with the cathedral in the Great Fire of London in 1666.</p>
<p>King Æthelred the Unready remains the last monarch to be buried at St Paul’s..A modern monument in the crypt lists his among the important graves lost to time….</p>

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/23/17/27564202-0-image-a-5_1587659677690.jpg" alt="img">
An extremely rare 1,000 year old penny coin depicting a child King of England has sold for £11,160.</p>
<p>The ancient silver coin showed the face of Edward the Martyr who ruled Saxon Britain in the 10th Century, aged 13, before he was assassinated three years later.</p>
<p>It was found by a metal detectorist in a field on the Isle of Wight and has sold for £4,000 more than its maximum estimated pre-auction value.</p>
<p>Part of the proceeds will be donated to NHS Charities Together which works with more than 250 UK organisations.</p>
<p>A rare coin from the short reign of the boy king Edward the Martyr 1,000 years ago</p>
<p>Experts said the coin was exceptionally rare and appeared &lsquo;almost as struck&rsquo; by the Saxons when it was unearthed in March 2018.</p>
<p>King Edward the Martyr, crowned in 975, is depicted as a very young king wearing a royal band known as a diadem that signified he was monarch.</p>
<p>Coin specialists say the silver piece is an example of Britain&rsquo;s early unified coinage.</p>
<p>It would have been accepted throughout the kingdoms of Britain and even throughout the world due to its previous metal value.</p>
<p>It was minted in Canterbury in Kent where the teen prince had the support of the church for his claim to the throne when his father King Edgar the Peaceful died.</p>
<p>The Saxon penny sold for £11,160 in an online live auction at Dix Noonan Webb which specialises in international coins, medals, banknotes and jewellery.</p>
<p>Nigel Mills, antiquities expert at the auctioneers, said: &lsquo;The price realised for the Edward the Martyr penny exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It reflects the quality and rarity of the coin combined with the fact that it is a new discovery and it is the first time that it has been offered for sale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The penny was discovered on a ploughed field by a 68-year-old retired council worker using a Minelab E-Trac metal detector.</p>

<p>Frustrated at only finding three 22 lead bullets on one spot and ready to give up for the day, the metal detectorist, who wished to remain anonymous, then got another signal and dug down four to five inches to uncover the Saxon penny.</p>
<p>On one side of the silver penny are the words &lsquo;EDPEARD REX ANGLORX&rsquo; which translates as &lsquo;Edward king of the English.</p>
<p>On the reverse is a small cross in the centre with the words &lsquo;AELSTAN M&rsquo;O CANT&rsquo; - Aelfstan moneyer of Canterbury - written around the edge.</p>
<p>There were 39 mints operating around the country at the time with three moneyers working at Canterbury.</p>
<p>The front and back of the coin from the short reign of the boy king Edward the Martyr</p>
<p>King Edward rose to the throne aged just 13 and was murdered three years later, some say on the orders of his half-brother who succeeded him aged ten and became known as Ethelred the Unready.</p>
<p>Nigel said: &lsquo;Because Edward was the eldest by a few years, he took to the throne and was crowned king. But there were a lot of disputes going on between the family regarding who was or should be king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Edward had gone to see his half brother at Corfe Castle where he was murdered. They dragged him off his horse and stabbed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was apparently then taken away on the horse and dragged for some distance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The online auction comprised 692 lots and saw only four unsold.</p>
<p>Another notable highlight was an Australian coin which was one of the first coins to have been made for circulation in the new colony of New South Wales in 1813.</p>
<p>Otherwise known as a Dump, the coin was from the Collection of British Colonial Coins formed by the late John Roberts-Lewis.</p>
<p>Valued at Fifteen Pence and comprising a circular centre segment from the Five Shilling Holey Dollar, it had been estimated to fetch £2,000-£3,000.</p>
<p>But after significant interest, it was snapped up by an Australian collector fetching a substantial £6,820.</p>
<p>Peter Preston-Morley, specialist and associate director at Dix Noonan Webb, said: &lsquo;The phrase dump is an Australian colloquialism invented in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The piece is from an old collection of British Colonial coins that DNW are offering, the previous owner bought it 58 years ago for £4.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are about 800 pieces known, so it isn&rsquo;t that rare as such, but of the 800 only about 120 or so are in the sort of condition that this one is.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most were used until they wore out and were melted down for silver in late Victorian times.&rsquo;

Aethelred the Unready Levi Roach Yale , pp. 369 , £</p>
<p>Aethelred the Unready (c.968—1016) has not, as Levi Roach acknowledges, enjoyed a good press. In recent times there may have been some attempt in academic circles to take a more measured view of his calamitous reign, but the fact remains that if most us would have trouble saying quite what he did or did not do, or even what ‘unraed’ actually means, we all know how it ended. ‘And that is called paying the Dane-geld;’ wrote Kipling,</p>
<p>“ But we’ve proved it again and again,</p>
<p>That if once you have paid him the Dane-geld</p>
<p>You never get rid of the Dane.</p>
<p>On the face of it the revisionists have an uphill battle, too, because when Aethelred came to the throne as a child the kingdom was looking in pretty good shape. Less than a century before his birth his great-great-grandfather Alfred had defeated the Danes and unified the Saxon kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia, and over the succeeding reigns, his son and grandson had extended their power across the east and north so that for the first time a Saxon king could legitimately style himself rex anglorum and we can reasonably begin to speak of a coherent ‘English nation’.</p>
<p>It was this inheritance — enriched and consolidated during the halcyon reign of his father Edgar the Peacemaker — that Aethelred squandered, and Roach has set himself in this largely sympathetic biography to ask how and why. He is under no illusion that there is a strong case to answer, but underneath the superficial order of Edgar’s reign were religious and factional tensions that no child king under the thumb of a powerful mother — still less one who had come to the throne as a result of the murder of his older half-brother, Edward the Martyr — could possibly have resolved.</p>
<p>It should be no more of a surprise, either, that Aethelred turned his back on his mother and her party as soon as he came of age, and it was again, perhaps, his misfortune rather than his fault that his own youthful excesses should coincide with a renewal of Viking raids. In cosier times he might easily have got away with seizing the odd bishop’s lands, but in a society that saw a direct link between morality and earthly prosperity, the Viking scourge and the miseries that followed came to seem a divine judgment on a sinful king who had rejected his advisors and attacked the church.</p>
<p>The result in the short term was a penitent Aethelred, restitution of despoiled lands and a return of the old guard, but neither God nor the Vikings were to be so easily bought off. A brief period of reform in the 990s seems to suggest some kind of stability, but this was no more than a pause, and as the raiding parties grew in scale and ambition then the grim logic of his own penitential piety began to work itself out.</p>
<p>He had renounced his youthful sins in the firm belief that they had brought disaster on the kingdom, but as it had clearly not ‘worked’, then logic demanded that the finger of blame and retribution point elsewhere. If Roach is right, the factional killings and blindings of these later years, and even the appalling 1002 St Brice’s Day massacre of his Danish subjects, were at least in part a result of this need to ‘purify’ the kingdom and so, paradoxically, it was as much Aethelred’s attempts at reform as his earlier failings that hurried his reign to its close. Through the last years, royal ordinances and pulpit rhetoric continued to call the nation to penance and unity, but it was too late for sackcloth and ashes. Cnut’s armies ravaged the country and his own closest counsellors defected to the enemy, Anglo-Saxon England’s longest reign guttered to its dismal and unloved end.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinary period of English history, and there is a widening gap between academic writing about it and the general reader. Levi Roach has written a book that at least tries to bridge that gap. He is understandably rather more interested in addressing his peers than the rest of us, but if he can sometimes seem to make a kind of fetish of his scholarship, straining at one contextual gnat or another, he is very good at extracting from the dry bones of charters, witness lists, land grants and coinage types, a compelling and impressive picture of what was going on at the court of Aethelred.</p>
<p>We get no sense of the king’s personality — such a thing is probably impossible — and still less any feel for the physical realities of the Anglo-</p>
<p>Saxon world; but that is not his aim. What he is giving us, instead, is something he calls Aethelred’s ‘thought world’ — and what a strange world that was. It was a world living under the shadow of the end of time, a world in which blinding could seem an act of charity and treacherous slaughter a rite of national purification. Aethelred’s was as much the age of St</p>
<p>Dunstan and Archbishop Wulfstan as it was of the Viking Thorkell the Tall and the warrior dead at the Battle of Maldon. And unless we remember that, as Roach makes clear, we are not going to understand it or him.

<h3 id="medieval-mothers-had-to-marry-and-murder-to-get-their-way">&ldquo;Medieval Mothers Had to Marry and Murder to Get Their Way&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/wGDgGu-iFgpqzJTwIGC1OtJZ6xE=/fit-in/1600x0/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/34/fb/34fba13b-824f-4926-b00d-e08740cc3540/pictures_of_english_history_plate_ix_-_the_wicked_queen_elfrida-wr.jpg" alt="img">
In the rough-and-tumble setting of medieval England, royal mothers were expected to do far more than just ensure their children, the future monarchs, were healthy and well-educated. She had to wield all her influence and patronage to keep her son in power—and keep her husband from killing him.</p>
<p>Before the Norman Conquest of 1066, royal succession was not fixed. The inheritance rights of young children were often passed over to ensure that an experienced warrior was on the throne. It provided the perfect recipe for royal intrigue, and mothers with sons to defend often faced down tradition—and their own husbands—along the way. Queens were supposed to value their roles as both wives and mothers, but when forced to pick between the two, their children always came first.</p>
<p>Raising Royalty: 1000 Years of Royal Parenting How royal parents dealt with raising their children over the past thousand years, from keeping Vikings at bay to fending off paparazzi. Buy</p>
<p>During the Roman Empire’s rule of Britain, the wives of emperors were well-known public figures whose conduct was scrutinized—and frequently criticized. The Anglo-Saxon queens that followed had no public role or even the title of queen. But in the 10th century, Elfrida refused to honor this relatively recent convention. She was not content to exist in the shadows as “the king’s wife,” and when her husband, Edgar the Peaceable, took the crown in 973, she was crowned with him.</p>
<p>The king had a son from a previous marriage, but Elfrida insisted that her own children were more fit to rule. When her stepson became king and was quickly and mysteriously murdered, allowing Elfrida’s own son Ethelred to succeed him, the political elite was suspicious. One chronicle stated only that the murdered king was not mourned by his relatives, but a later writer claimed that Elfrida had masterminded the attack on her stepson “with a stepmother’s hatred.”</p>
<p>True or not, she now had a reputation as one of medieval England’s wickedest stepmothers. But Ethelred the Unready, as he became known, was a disaster. Like previous rulers of Anglo-Saxon England, he faced a series of Viking invasions. Instead of fending them off, he paid danegeld, a bribe intended to stop them.</p>
<p>The strategy backfired. Despite being paid for peace, the Vikings attacked anyway. Two generations of Danish Vikings then reigned in England while the children of former Anglo-Saxon rulers hid with relatives in Europe.</p>
<p>But one royal mother was not content to wait out the Vikings’ reign. Emma didn’t murder her son’s rival; she married him. In 1017, just months after her feckless husband Ethelred died, she became Queen of England for a second time—as the bride of Danish king Canute.</p>
<p>Did Emma marry her eldest son’s rival to protect her children or because she valued her position as queen over her responsibilities as a mother? Regardless of her reasoning, her son felt betrayed. After he became king, he ordered his mother to give up her keys to the royal treasury, confiscated much of her property and made clear that he expected her to move out of his palace. Emma never regained her position of influence at the English court.</p>
<p>After the William the Conqueror emerged victorious in 1066, the main threat to royal heirs was not Viking attacks, but their own fathers. Adult sons managed their own castles and had knights and foot soldiers of their own. In these circumstances, fathers and sons sometimes went to war—and only the intercession of the queen allowed both sides to make peace without losing face.</p>
<p>Matilda of Flanders had an unusually harmonious marriage with William. But in 1077, her eldest son Robert led a rebellion against his father. By 1079, they were on opposite sides of the battlefield, coming so close to each other in the fighting that Robert knocked the king off his horse.</p>
<p>When William discovered that Matilda had been sending her son money throughout the rebellion, he was irate. “A faithless wife brings ruin to the state,” he raged, and threatened to have the eyes gouged out of the messenger who carried letters between mother and son. Matilda defended herself. “How can you imagine that I can find any joy in possessing great wealth if I allow my son to be burdened by dire poverty?” she asked.</p>
<p>Matilda was able to reconcile her husband and son in a fragile peace that lasted for the rest of her lifetime. After her death in 1083, however, this accord broke down and William prevented Robert from inheriting England, leaving his kingdom to his second son instead.</p>
<p>Eleanor of Aquitaine did her sons one better: She joined them in a revolt against their father, Henry II. When Henry decided to transfer some of his eldest son’s lands as a show of favor to Eleanor’s youngest son, the future King John, Eleanor and her other sons rebelled. Henry put down the revolt and made a show of forgiving his sons. But he kept Eleanor confined for the rest of his reign.</p>
<p>Her decision to rebel labeled her as a troublemaker and was rebuked by clergymen for failing as a wife and mother. “You should return with your sons to your husband whom you are obliged to obey and live with,” one archbishop told her. Her reputation improved during the reign of another son, Richard the Lionheart, when she helped raise a king’s ransom for his release after he was captured on his way home from the Third Crusade.</p>
<p>By the 13th century, an orderly law of succession began to take shape in England. These days, English royals must fend off the paparazzi instead of Vikings. The modern royal family consists of a monarch and three generations of direct heirs –Elizabeth II, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George – who get along and have little chance of being involved in medieval-style family intrigue. What remains the same for royalty is the experience of parenting in the public eye—one that’s always trained on mothers of children who will wear the crown.
