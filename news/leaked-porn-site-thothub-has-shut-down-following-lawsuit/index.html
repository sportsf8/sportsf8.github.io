<p>Thothub, an adult website that hosted paywalled content from platforms like OnlyFans for free, has gone dark following a lawsuit filed earlier this week by a popular OnlyFans model.</p>
<p>On Monday (August 3), OnlyFans content creator Deniece “Niece” Waidhofer filed a complaint against Thothub.tv for hosting her images without her consent.</p>
<p>Waidhofer, who has 1.9 million followers on Instagram, sells semi-nudes to followers on her OnlyFans account for $14.99 a month. The lawsuit demands that Thothub stop infringing on Waidhofer’s copyright and seeks damages.</p>
<p>“This content is only supposed to be available to paid subscribers through the Licensed Sites,” the lawsuit claims. “Thothub’s primary purpose – its raison d’etre – is to steal this exclusive, behind the paywall content from the Licensed Sites and unlawfully distribute it to millions of its associates.”</p>
<p>The site went down on Wednesday evening, and the server appears to no longer exist.</p>
<p>“I’m standing up to the pirates and their enablers on behalf of all the creators whose work they have stolen and bodies they exploited. We won’t take it anymore. Lawyer up, Captain Thotcakes,” Waidhofer wrote on Instagram.</p>
<p>As part of the lawsuit, Waidhofer is also suing adult platforms BangBros and Chaturbate for advertising on Thothub (the lawsuit claims this funds Thothub’s business), as well as internet infrastructure service Cloudfare for protecting the site.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Thothub and the other companies are in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), because they’ve “engaged in intentional and willful conduct in service of the criminal enterprise”.

Le lundi 3 août 2020, le modèle Deniece « Niece » Waidhofer a déposé une plainte contre Thothub. Cette dernière a accusé le site pour adulte d’avoir diffusé des « nudes » provenant de son profil OnlyFans sur sa plateforme sans son autorisation. En temps normal, les photos dénudées de Niece Waidhofer ne sont disponibles que sur OnlyFans, moyennant un abonnement de 14,99 $ par mois.</p>
<p>D’après Brett S. Rosenthal, l’avocat de Niece Waidhofer, la publication de ces photos sur le site de Thothub, porte préjudice à sa cliente et nuit à son business. Le site Vice a contacté Thothub pour obtenir sa version de l’histoire. Le site pour adulte a expliqué qu’il avait supprimé les photos en question de sa plateforme après avoir reçu la plainte de Niece Waidhofer.</p>
<p>À ne pas louper : Les Galaxy Note 20 sont disponibles en précommande</p>
<p>Quelques jours après ces déclarations, on a appris grâce au site Vice que Thothub a décidé de fermer ses portes.</p>
<p>Thothub, accusé de violation des droits d’auteurs</p>
<p>Dans sa plainte Niece Waidhofer a accusé Thothub de violation des droits d’auteur. Ce modèle, qui est suivi par près de 1,9 million de personnes sur Instagram, a exigé la suppression de ses photos sur la plateforme et a réclamé des dommages et intérêts.</p>
<p>En dehors de cela, Niece Waidhofer et son avocat veulent obtenir des informations sur l’identité des personnes qui dirigent Thothub. Face à cette menace, le site pour adulte a jugé préférable de disparaître sans crier gare.</p>
<p>Niece Waidhofer ne lâche pas l’affaire</p>
<p>Désormais, lorsqu’on essaye de se rendre sur le site de Thothub, on est accueilli par une animation interactive du Système solaire ainsi qu’une adresse email dédiée aux demandes de renseignements. En dépit de cela, Niece Waidhofer ne compte pas en rester là, comme l’a fait savoir Brett S. Rosenthal.</p>
<p>« Thothub a vu la menace qui planait sur lui et a estimé qu’il n’avait d’autre choix que de mettre fin à ses activités criminelles. Mais nous ne faisons que commencer. Nous tiendrons les membres de Thothub et les entreprises qui ont permis ce piratage pour responsables des dommages qu’ils ont causés. Nous continuerons à traquer les pirates en ligne et nous demanderons aux tribunaux d’appliquer la loi existante pour obliger des entreprises comme Cloudflare à adopter des politiques raisonnables et efficaces pour empêcher des sites comme Thothub de prospérer », a-t-il déclaré.</p>
<p>Pour rappel, Cloudflare, Chaturbate et BangBros sont également dans la ligne de mire de Niece Waidhofer.

Deniece &ldquo;Niece&rdquo; Waidhofer, an OnlyFans content creator, is suing Thothub for spreading her images that she had behind a paywall on OnlyFans, according to VICE . Niece is a model and relies on her OnlyFans page to bring in revenue each month. According to VICE, she has over 1.9 million followers on Instagram and sells her semi-nude content to subscribers on OnlyFans for $14.99 per month. Over the past few months, she&rsquo;s found her semi-nude photos and lingerie shots on Thothub.</p>
<p>Now, Niece is suing after alleging Thothub has not been adhering to copyright-related takedown requests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After being published on Thothub and downloaded by many of its one million-plus members, Waidhofer&rsquo;s published and unpublished works have been widely disseminated across the Internet and seen by millions. This has caused, and continues to cause, personal, reputational, and monetary harm to Waidhofer,&rdquo; the complaint, written by attorney Brett S. Rosenthal from law firm Reese Marketos, reads.

A website that hosted adult content taken from models sold on platforms like OnlyFans is down, following a lawsuit filed earlier this week by a popular OnlyFans model.</p>
<p>On Monday, attorneys for Deniece “Niece” Waidhofer filed a complaint against Thothub.tv for hosting her images without her consent. The lawsuit demands that Thothub stop infringing on Waidhofer&rsquo;s copyright and seeks damages, and is seeking information on who runs Thothub.</p>
<p>The site went down on Wednesday evening, and as of writing, was replaced by an interactive animation of the solar system and an email address for inquiries.</p>
<p>“Thothub clearly saw the writing on the wall and decided it had no choice but to shut down its criminal activity,” attorney Brett S. Rosenthal from law firm Reese Marketos, who is representing Waidhofer, told Motherboard. “But we are just getting started. We will hold Thothub’s members and the companies that enabled its piracy accountable for the harm they caused. We will continue to chase down online pirates, and we will ask courts to enforce existing law so that companies like Cloudflare must enact reasonable and effective repeat infringer policies to prevent sites like Thothub from flourishing. It’s time to end the era of online copyright lawlessness.”</p>
<p>Prior to Motherboard&rsquo;s reporting, there were videos and galleries of images claiming to be &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; from Waidhofer&rsquo;s Patreon and OnlyFans accounts. After Motherboard reached out to Thothub to confirm that Waidhofer filed takedown requests, as she claimed in the lawsuit, the site removed those threads.</p>
<p>“We remove on average about 200 entries from the main page and the forums per week and we are constantly in contact with multiple lawyers all over the world to have the illicit material removed, for which we have a dedicated team,” a spokesperson for Thothub told Motherboard before the filing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This content is only supposed to be available to paid subscribers through the Licensed Sites,&rdquo; the lawsuit claims. &ldquo;Thothub’s primary purpose—its raison d’etre—is to steal this exclusive, behind the paywall content from the Licensed Sites and unlawfully distribute it to millions of its associates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you have experience with Thothub or similar adult content hosting sites? We’d love to hear from you. Contact Samantha Cole securely on the messaging app Signal at +6469261726, direct message on Twitter, or by email: <a href="mailto:samantha.cole@vice.com">samantha.cole@vice.com</a></p>
<p>As part of the lawsuit, Waidhofer is also suing adult platforms BangBros and Chaturbate for advertising on Thothub (and therefore funding Thothub&rsquo;s business, complain claims) as well as internet infrastructure service Cloudflare for protecting the site.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that Thothub and the other companies are all in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), in that they&rsquo;ve &ldquo;engaged in intentional and willful conduct in service of the criminal enterprise,&rdquo; including copyright infringement and extortion.</p>
<p>Thothub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

<h3 id="an-onlyfans-creator-is-suing-a-site-that-hosts-paywalled-images-for-free">&ldquo;An OnlyFans creator is suing a site that hosts paywalled images for free&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=1200%2C630&amp;crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=95&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-08%2Ff7f9fd80-d668-11ea-bdf7-30dbc6c2cf3c&amp;client=amp-blogside-v2&amp;signature=1b09e64dd84786c3f52d39d96e65ad3e4b56d26c" alt="img">
Waidhofer and her attorney allege that Thothub has not been responsive to repeated requests to remove content, but Thothub told Motherboard that it “did not receive any valid DMCA request and no valid information for removals” via its takedown request form. Thothub did reportedly remove images of Waidhofer after Motherboard contacted the site to verify Waidhofer’s requests.</p>
<p>The lawsuit hopes internet infrastructure company Cloudflare and Chaturbate and BangBros, sites that advertise on Thothub, might help identify who runs Thothub. But Chaturbate and BangBros both say that ads are placed through third-party advertisers, and after being contacted by Motherboard, both said they would no longer allow their ads to appear on Thothub. Cloudflare did not respond to Motherboard’s requests for comment.</p>
<p>This suit goes beyond Thothub, Cloudflare, Chaturbate and BangBros, though. It could set a precedent for content harvesters outside of adult content. YouTube has tried to make it easier for creators to address copyright claims, but even that system isn’t perfect, and there are plenty of other sites scraping content without creators’ permission or knowledge.

OnlyFans content creator Deniece “Niece” Waidhofer is suing Thothub, a site that reposts adult content users would usually need to pay to access, for spreading her images without her consent.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed Monday, is also suing internet infrastructure firm Cloudflare for providing services to Thothub, as well as adult websites Chaturbate and BangBros for advertising on Thothub, arguing that advertisements fund the distribution of terabytes of stolen OnlyFans material.</p>
<p>The news could provide some precedent for creators legally challenging sites that steal and profit from their work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After being published on Thothub and downloaded by many of its one million-plus members, Waidhofer&rsquo;s published and unpublished works have been widely disseminated across the Internet and seen by millions. This has caused, and continues to cause, personal, reputational, and monetary harm to Waidhofer,&rdquo; the complaint, written by attorney Brett S. Rosenthal from law firm Reese Marketos reads.</p>
<p>Rosenthal filed the suit on behalf of Waidhofer (who goes by Niece on her platforms), a model and OnlyFans creator who also has 1.9 million followers on Instagram. According to the complaint, Waidhofer sells semi-nude content to subscribers via her OnlyFans for $14.99 a month. Her OnlyFans page says “no nudes,” but she sent some semi-nude images to individual users via direct message, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Both her lingerie modeling photos and nudes have ended up on Thuthub, a site dedicated to re-publishing ordinarily pay-walled content, primarily from subscription-based OnlyFans, as well as Patreon. Thothub also runs a forum where users are encouraged to share material in order to gain access to other sections of the site.</p>
<p>Stolen adult content resold or reposted on sites like Thothub is a huge problem in the adult industry. But as OnlyFans has gained popularity in recent months, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic that’s forced people to find work they can do from home, interest in stealing content from the site has spiked. In June, Motherboard uncovered an entire underground market of people mass-scraping content from OnlyFans and other paywalled sites, uploading it illegally to sites like Thothub, and selling OnlyFans scraping services on Discord.</p>
<p>Thothub’s terms of service prohibit uploading stolen works, but its front page features reposted content from well known creators, and even notes which paid platform the content originally appeared on. A description at the bottom of the site says that &ldquo;thothub.tv is a parody. It provides an automatic stream of content sent in from e-girls. Thothub is the biggest e-girl showcase in the world! Join now and get e-famous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waidhofer and her attorney allege that Thothub has not been responsive to repeated copyright-related takedown requests. The complaint says that Waidhofer flagged the copyrighted material to Thothub multiple times and did not receive a response. Like Pornhub and other adult content sites that host unverified user uploads, Thothub has a DMCA takedown request form on its site where people can allegedly &ldquo;supply sufficient identification and proof ownership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motherboard viewed emails provided by Rosenthal that he claimed Waidhofer sent to Thothub requesting that her material be taken down. One of these examples was detailed and showed that the material had been taken from Waidhofer&rsquo;s Pateron account.</p>
<p>When Motherboard asked Thothub whether it had received any DMCA complaints from Waidhofer, Thothub said it had only received one brief message, and that &ldquo;We did not receive any valid DMCA request and no valid information for removals on that front page link.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thothub removed images of Waidhofer after Motherboard contacted the site to verify that Waidhofer made that request.</p>
<p>“We remove on average about 200 entries from the main page and the forums per week and we are constantly in contact with multiple lawyers all over the world to have the illicit material removed, for which we have a dedicated team,” a spokesperson for Thothub told Motherboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chatter or discussion about removed forum posts, we have the right to remove anything to following copyright/dmca rules,&rdquo; one of the forum&rsquo;s staffers wrote in a forum post laying out the site&rsquo;s rules.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is seeking information from Cloudflare and the advertisers that may be useful in identifying who runs Thothub. It is also hoping the court will force Thothub to stop infringing Waidhofer&rsquo;s copyright, and that she will be awarded damages.</p>
<p>The lawsuit also targets BangBros and Chaturbate, two well-known adult websites that advertise on Thothub. The complaint alleges that without these two companies&rsquo; financial assistance, Thothub would be unable to function.</p>
<p>When Motherboard reached out to Chaturbate for comment on why they placed ads on Thothub, a spokesperson said that the ads were placed there “without [Chaturbate’s] knowledge by independent third-party advertisers participating in Chaturbate’s referral marketing program.” Advertising on websites that use stolen or unlicensed content is against Chaturbate’s marketing program terms, the spokesperson said. “We immediately reached out to the responsible advertisers and informed them that thothub.tv is not an appropriate site for sending traffic to Chaturbate and asked them to immediately remove any of their CB ads that may be appearing on thothub.tv.”</p>
<p>A BangBros spokesperson told Motherboard that their media buyers weren’t familiar with Thothub, as their ads are placed using a third-party advertising network. “Now that this has been brought to our attention, our marketing department will reach out to the ad network asking this site be put on an exclusion list,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Cloudflare did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today Thothub’s monthly costs likely approach or exceed $100,000 for content hosting and delivery, and Thothub likely has annual hosting and delivery costs of $1 million or more,&rdquo; the complaint reads. &ldquo;Thothub is only able to bear these costs due to the revenue it derives from advertising. Put differently, absent the financial backing of the Advertiser Defendants, Thothub could not continue to commit acts of infringement with anywhere close to the frequency and scale that it now does. The Advertiser Defendants thus materially contribute to the infringement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, the lawsuit alleges that Cloudflare is part of the scheme by providing internet infrastructure services to Thothub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloudflare admits on its website that it has the ability, &lsquo;[i]n appropriate circumstances [to] disable access to Cloudflare services or terminate the accounts of users determined to be repeat infringers.&rsquo; But Cloudflare has not implemented a reasonable repeat-infringer policy. Cloudflare does not have reasonably adequate protocols, policies, or metrics for addressing repeat infringement by customers, and it does not take reasonable action after being notified about repeat infringement. Cloudflare apparently has no policy to follow up on infringement notifications to determine whether the infringing content was, in fact, removed from the customer site,'&rdquo; the complaint reads.

Thothub clearly saw the writing on the wall and decided it had no choice but to shut down its criminal activity. But we are just getting started. We will hold Thothub’s members and the companies that enabled its piracy accountable for the harm they caused.</p>
<p>We will continue to chase down online pirates, and we will ask courts to enforce existing law so that companies like Cloudflare must enact reasonable and effective repeat infringer policies to prevent sites like Thothub from flourishing. It’s time to end the era of online copyright lawlessness.
