<p>The Interface is a daily column and newsletter about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe here .</p>
<p>It’s been such a newsy week that we’re ending it with two columns — enough to last you the whole weekend. First, we have what we hope is the ultimate Twitter hack FAQ, in response to this week’s catastrophic security breach. Yesterday’s issue was the most-read in Interface history, and we wanted to make sure you had all the latest developments.</p>
<p>Second, I’m excited to share a conversation I had this week with Facebook’s chief diversity officer, Maxine Williams, on the occasion of the company releasing its annual diversity report. I wanted to know why progress on the issue has been so hard to come by, what it means that she reports to Sheryl Sandberg now, and much more. Williams is a dynamo; I hope you’ll enjoy our chat.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Wednesday, Twitter had the worst security incident in company history, with a coordinated attack resulting in the takeover of more than a dozen high-profile accounts including President Obama, Joe Biden, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and Elon Musk. On Thursday, the fallout began.</p>
<p>Here are some top questions about the attack, answered as best we can as of press time.</p>
<p>Do we know who perpetrated the attack? Ace cybersecurity reporter Brian Krebs traces the attack to a community of “SIM swappers,” though the report is as yet unconfirmed. The FBI is investigating. And I imagine that the Federal Trade Commission, which has Twitter under a 20-year consent decree for failing to protect users’ personal information, will be looking into it as well.</p>
<p>Do we know how the hack happened? We do not, though Twitter shared a handful of details late Wednesday. Among other things, the company confirmed that a Twitter employee was involved in the incident. How exactly? It won’t say; Dustin Volz describes the range of possibilities nicely at the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<p>The social-media company hasn’t said specifically how the attackers penetrated its internal systems and tools or indicated how long they had access to them. Twitter has said only that the hackers used “social engineering” techniques, where employees are tricked into clicking a link, divulging information or otherwise aiding outsiders. The hackers might have accessed information or engaged in other malicious activity, Twitter said, adding that it has “taken significant steps to limit access to internal systems” while it continues to investigate the incident.</p>
<p>What if I want to read a speculative but plausible account of how the hack worked from one of the victims? This piece by the owner of the @6 Twitter account is very good.</p>
<p>Did the hackers access our passwords? Twitter says there is no evidence that they did.</p>
<p>Did the hackers access our direct messages? Twitter won’t comment, presumably because it doesn’t yet know. Also, maybe DMs should be encrypted?</p>
<p>Are there wild theories about other attacks that the hackers might be planning based on their theoretical access to DMs? Yes.</p>
<p>Does Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey promise to tell us everything that happened as soon as he can? He does.</p>
<p>Do lawmakers have some sternly worded questions for Twitter in the meantime? They do.</p>
<p>Will the activist hedge fund that took a stake in Twitter earlier this year also have some strongly worded questions for the company? Maybe!</p>
<p>How far back does the behavior of taking over a Twitter account to sow panic go? At least 2011. In that year, NBC News’ account got hacked and falsely said that Ground Zero was under attack. Two years later, someone took over the Associated Press account and falsely reported that there had been explosions in the White House; the stock market dropped on the entirely fake news.</p>
<p>What are some other examples of hackers using social engineering techniques to wreak havoc? Here’s a story about employees of telecoms getting recruited by criminals to transfer numbers to different SIM cards, enabling the criminals to take over social media accounts. And here’s a story about an employee of the popular game platform Roblox who was bribed by a hacker to look up users’ personal information.</p>
<p>What should we expect tech companies to do about these internal threats? Alex Stamos, who used to run security at Facebook, has some good ideas. Make customer-service tasks two-person jobs rather than one-person jobs, increasing friction for would-be criminals; and stop holding customer service representatives to impossible speed quotas, giving them more room to suss out attacks.</p>
<p>Could you have made more money off this level of account access than the attackers did? Maybe, but it would have been much more work than these attackers seemed to have put in, and there’s no guarantee you would have succeeded.</p>
<p>Was Twitter better when verified accounts couldn’t tweet? Many people are saying this.</p>
<p>Q&amp;A with Facebook’s chief diversity officer</p>
<p>The Black Lives Matter protests that swept the country in June brought fresh attention to the country’s history of racial injustice, and galvanized discussions within workplaces about what role corporations could play in addressing that history. One company where those discussions were particularly vigorous was Facebook, a platform that showcased the protests and the violence that led up to them — and, some employees argued, had empowered white supremacy and other forms of hate speech through a combination of content policies and moderation decisions. An advertiser boycott of Facebook and other social networks this month, along with a difficult civil rights audit of the company, have brought further scrutiny to the issue.</p>
<p>All of which made the publication of Facebook’s annual diversity report this week especially fraught. Diversity reports first became popular in Silicon Valley in the middle of the 2010s as a way for the technology industry to attempt to hold itself to a higher collective standard. And while almost every major tech company now publishes such a report annually, the industry’s overall diversity has remained disappointingly stagnant.</p>
<p>At Facebook, the news for 2020 is mixed. Sarah Frier summed it up at Bloomberg:</p>
<p>Black employees now comprise 1.7% of the social media company’s technical roles, up from 1.5% in 2019 and 1% in 2014, Facebook said in its latest diversity report. The demographic lags even as the company has made progress in other areas, like gender. Women now make up 24.1% of technical employees, up from 15% in 2014.</p>
<p>Since 2013, the project of improving Facebook’s diversity and inclusion efforts has been led by Maxine Williams. As Facebook’s chief diversity officer, she works to attract and retain members of underrepresented groups at the company. And so when Facebook invited me to speak with her about the company’s latest diversity report, I jumped at the chance. (You can read Facebook’s 2020 diversity report here.)</p>
<p>“We try to keep our eyes on the long term,” Williams told me. As representation has grown at the company, employees have made more demands for inclusion — policies that help retain talent once Facebook successfully attracts it. Recently, Williams’ role was elevated to report directly to Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, and she now sits on Mark Zuckerberg’s leadership team. The reason, she told me, is to make sure inclusion is “in everything, front and center.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Williams said, diversity and inclusion is challenging because people themselves are complicated. “People are the most complex systems,” she said. “Computer scientists can talk all they want about code. Nothing is more complex than people.”</p>
<p>Highlights of our talk are below. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p>Casey Newton: Recently the Black Lives Matters protests led to a lot of internal questions from Facebook employees about the role the company can play in fighting racism. Is that a rare opportunity to improve inclusion within a company, since for once you have a huge part of the workforce focused on justice issues?</p>
<p>Maxine Williams: Oh yes, and not just for my company — I mean, across the board in America. It’s a moment of stress, because we’re constantly re-traumatized by what we’re talking about. And by the way, if you’re a somebody in this role, disproportionately people on diversity teams are people from vulnerable groups themselves. And so it is hard — every day, when what we’re talking about is like, they kill people that look like me. But at the same time, it is a moment of opportunity. If [a company] made a statement, they should probably walk the walk, too. Personally I’d prefer that we never had to be here. But there is some opportunity to be had from it, yes.</p>
<p>One thing I’ve heard from Facebook employees is that the experience for nonwhite workers is inconsistent. Some people have a great career at Facebook, while other people don’t and quit. I’m sure that’s true for a lot of reasons, but to the extent that it’s an inclusion issue, how do you figure out where the gaps are?</p>
<p>What we have come to realize is that in people analytics, often with minority groups, we wouldn’t get insight on them because there weren’t enough of them to hit some kind of [statistical] standard for confidence. Right. And we cannot be in this loop where it’s like, well, “we could tell you what was going on, if there were more of them.” When the point is that there aren’t enough of them because something’s going on.</p>
<p>And so we pivoted how we did people analytics to put much more weight into qualitative feedback. We hold focus groups all the time. We’re gonna have to get comfortable with a different level of confidence seen in the traditional way, and buttress what we see internally with research or other studies.</p>
<p>And then we started to hire people who are race experts, bias experts, social psychologists, to work on this and to give us the insight. Your question is, how do you figure out what’s going on if there’s this inconsistency? And that’s one of the ways.</p>
<p>The advertiser boycott that’s under way right now has called for a C-level executive that will, among other things, review products that are in development to assess their impact on civil rights. Do you think that a role like that would be beneficial?</p>
<p>Yes. We’ve already opened a job requisition, and people are applying. We’re going to hire a vice president of civil rights.</p>
<p>And that person will work on product issues?</p>
<p>Product, policy, everything.</p>
<p>What I have done a lot of in my seven years here is &hellip; call it internal consulting. Advice and input looking through the lens of equal value. Is this product going to bring equal value to all people? Because minority groups can often get overlooked.</p>
<p>But civil rights is also its own body of work, which has its own legal underpinnings. So I think it’s important to have somebody who’s focused through that lens, as I focus on equal value for diverse groups. These things are complementary, but they’re not the same.</p>
<p>Finally: what do you hope Facebook accomplishes on diversity and inclusion in the next year?</p>
<p>One is building a consistency of behavior. We’ve put a lot of strategies into play; We need everybody to now do it consistently. It’s not very sexy, but it’s actually, I think, probably the most important thing.</p>
<p>And I think the other thing would be, we’re working on a lot of work streams now to give more people voice in the development of products. To make products more inclusive in development and policies. And that is very early stage, but in a year’s time, we should have built out some of that and have a sense of how it’s working.</p>
<p>It’s one of the things that, in the civil rights audit, the auditors talked about: employees wanting more participation. And so we’re trying to figure it out. But it’s complicated, too, because you want to balance that with not having the employees who are most passionate, who are probably from underrepresented groups, paying an additional tax, right? Now they have a job on top of their job. So you need to balance that. In a year’s time we’ll have something to say, whether it’s gonna be, “it’s amazing!” or “wow, we learned that that first version didn’t work. There will still be something to say, because we are gonna focus a lot on how we give more people voice.</p>
<p>The Ratio</p>
<p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p>
<p>Trending up: TikTok launched a new video series with some of the app’s top creators to help people spot misinformation. The campaign, called “Be Informed,” will address topics like how to scrutinize the credibility of sources and how to distinguish fact from opinion. (Mark Sullivan / Fast Company)</p>
<p>Trending down: Twitter’s rigid fact-check rules have allowed President Trump to continue spreading false information about the election. Under the company’s policies, untrue tweets about vote-rigging in a specific state are unacceptable. But the rules don’t apply when those lies are spread on a national scale. (Marshall Cohen / CNN)</p>
<p>Governing</p>
<p>⭐ Facebook announced it will add labels to all posts from presidential candidates that mention voting or ballots, regardless of whether they contain misinformation. The move is a response to recent accusations that the company isn’t doing enough to tackle voter suppression on the platform. Here’s Sara Fischer at Axios:</p>
<p>The labels, rolling out today, aren’t a judgment of whether the posts themselves are accurate, but are instead meant to signal to Facebook users that they can get the most accurate information about voting by leading them to an official government website.</p>
<p>Related: Facebook is rife with misinformation about voting, according to an analysis by ProPublica and the nonprofit First Draft. Many of the misleading posts center on voting by mail, which is the safest way of casting a ballot during the pandemic. While these posts appear to violate Facebook’s policies, many continue to stay up. (Ryan McCarthy / ProPublica)</p>
<p>⭐ The White House said restrictions on TikTok could come in “weeks, not months.” Trump’s chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration is also looking at WeChat “and other apps that have the potential for national security exposure.” Sam Byford at The Verge has the story:</p>
<p>“There are a number of administration officials who are looking at the national security risk as it relates to TikTok, WeChat and other apps that have the potential for national security exposure, specifically as it relates to the gathering of information on American citizens by a foreign adversary,” Meadows told reporters traveling from Atlanta on Air Force One. “I don’t think there’s any self-imposed deadline for action, but I think we are looking at weeks, not months.”</p>
<p>A prosecutor on the trial team that won Roger Stone’s conviction is leaving the Justice Department to join Facebook, where he will set policy on the site’s content. The move follows Trump’s decision to commute Stone’s sentence. (Christian Berthelsen / Bloomberg)</p>
<p>Attorney General William Barr accused companies like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple of being “all too willing to collaborate with the (Chinese Communist party).” He added that Hollywood has routinely caved into pressure and censored their films “to appease the Chinese Communist Party.” (Sarah N. Lynch, David Shepardson / Reuters)</p>
<p>A second surge in coronavirus deaths is upon us. And it was easily predicted by all available data on the subject. (Alexis C. Madrigal / The Atlantic)</p>
<p>Russian hackers are attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research from American, British, and Canadian universities and health care organizations. The National Security Agency said that a hacking group implicated in the 2016 break-ins into Democratic Party servers has been implicated in the attacks. (Julian E. Barnes / The New York Times)</p>
<p>Europe’s top court struck down a flagship EU-US data flows arrangement called Privacy Shield. The court’s finding is that “the requirements of US national security, public interest and law enforcement have primacy, thus condoning interference with the fundamental rights of persons whose data are transferred to that third country.” (Natasha Lomas / TechCrunch)</p>
<p>Industry</p>
<p>⭐ Instagram is preparing to launch its TikTok competitor, known as Reels, in the US. The company expects to bring the new video feature to its platform in early August. Here’s Sarah Perez at TechCrunch:</p>
<p>Reels was designed to directly challenge TikTok’s growing dominance. In a new area in the Instagram app, Reels allows users to create and post short, 15-second videos set to music or other audio, similar to TikTok. Also like TikTok, Reels offers a set of editing tools — like a countdown timer and tools to adjust the video’s speed, for example — that aim to make it easier to record creative content. Instagram, however, doesn’t have the same sort of two-tabbed, scrollable feed, like TikTok offers today. The move to more quickly roll out Reels to more markets comes as TikTok has come under intense scrutiny for its ties to China. India banned the app, along with 58 other mobile applications designed by Chinese firms, in June. The Trump administration more recently said it was considering a similar ban on TikTok, for reasons related to national security. Yesterday, it said such a decision could be just weeks away.</p>
<p>Instagram is also starting to roll out a dedicated Shop page under the Explore tab that’ll highlight different brands and items that people can purchase. The move is meant to make it easier for people to shop inside its app. (Ashley Carman / The Verge)</p>
<p>Facebook added screen sharing to Messenger video calls on its iOS and Android mobile apps. Previously, the feature was only available on Messenger’s web or desktop apps. (Christine Fisher / Engadget)</p>
<p>Hollywood has been noticeably silent on the Facebook ad boycott. While film studios are big advertisers on the platform, only Magnolia Pictures Sesame Street have joined what civil rights groups are calling the #StopHateForProfit campaign. (Brooks Barnes and Nicole Sperling / The New York Times)</p>
<p>Google launched a video shopping platform called Shoploop to introduce consumers to new products in under 90 seconds. It’s a project from the company’s R&amp;D division, Area 120, where it tests out new ideas with a public user base. (Sarah Perez / TechCrunch)</p>
<p>Twitter is rolling out a new version of its developer API. Twitter API v2 includes features that were missing from the earlier API, like conversation threading, poll results in tweets, pinned tweets, spam filtering and more powerful stream filtering and search query language.</p>
<p>Twitter also unveiled a new interface for its direct messages on the web, allowing users to send and receive DMs without having to leave their timelines. Currently, users have to open a separate section of Twitter’s website to look at their DMs. (Jon Porter / The Verge)</p>
<p>Amazon added live streaming to its existing Amazon Influencer Program. The move gives live streamers a new way to earn commissions on purchases of products showcased in their streams. Who will reinvent QVC first — Amazon or Instagram? (Sarah Perez / TechCrunch)</p>
<p>Amazon is extending its corporate work-from-home policy through January 2021. The company is also planning to continue restricting nonessential business travel through the end of the year. (Nick Statt / The Verge)</p>
<p>A viral Twitter account about Jurassic Park is the perfect satire for companies reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic. (David Mack / BuzzFeed) (David Mack / BuzzFeed)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/07/18/21/30922912-0-image-a-26_1595105459404.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Manchester City earned a momentous reprieve in one competition last week but in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley with only 90,000 empty seats as judge and jury, they could not escape their sentence. The Court of Arbitration for Sport might have allowed them back into the Champions League for the next two seasons but Arsenal showed them no mercy here.</p>
<p>Their shock 2-0 victory was a triumph of uncharacteristic resilience in defence, led by a brilliant display from David Luiz, and of clinical finishing from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored goals in each half to dump City out of the competition they won last year by trouncing Watford in the final. Arsenal will play either Manchester United or Chelsea in the final on August 1.</p>
<p>It was also the most significant victory yet for Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta, who has only been in charge at the Emirates since December but is already effecting improvements in attitude and style. This one was a victory for the apprentice over his old master as Arteta plotted a way past his former boss, Pep Guardiola.</p>
<p>Arsenal are into the FA Cup final after a thrilling victory over Manchester City in the first semi-final of the weekend</p>
<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was the hero for the Gunners, notching one goal in either half to put the Gunners through</p>
<p>The Gabon international first latched onto a cross from Nicolas Pepe before a trademark finish on the break from a long ball</p>
<p>MATCH FACTS Arsenal (3-4-3): Martinez 7; Mustafi 7 (Holding 87), Luiz 8, Tierney 8; Bellerin 6, Ceballos 6 (Kolasinac 88), Xhaka 7, Maitland-Niles 7; Pepe 7 (Willock 72), Lacazette 6 (Torreira 78), Aubameyang 8 Subs not used: Papastathopoulos, Nelson, Macey, Smith, Saka Booked: None Goals: Aubameyang 19', 71' Manchester City (4-2-3-1): Ederson 6: Walker 6, Eric Garcia 6, Laporte 5, Mendy 5: De Bruyne 6, Gundogan 6 (Rodri 66); Mahrez 5 (Foden 66), Silva 6 (Fernandinho 87), Sterling 6; Gabriel Jesus 5 Subs not used: Stones, Zinchenko, Bernardo Silva, Joao Cancelo, Otamendi, Carson Booked: None Goals: None Referee: Jon Moss Advertisement</p>
<p>Arsenal are languishing in ninth place in the Premier League but suddenly their season has new life. They beat champions Liverpool on Wednesday and this result stunned English football. City were widely expected to win this match and claim the FA Cup as their consolation prize for losing the Premier League but they spurned chance after chance and never looked at their best.</p>
<p>City will now be able to pour everything into their pursuit of the Champions League but if they show the same vulnerability at the back in the second leg of their second round match against Real Madrid as they did here against Arsenal, the Spanish champions will fancy their chances of overhauling their first leg deficit. Overwhelmed by Liverpool in the league, this defeat was a rude shock for Guardiola and his team.</p>
<p>The empty stadium seemed particularly stark here. FA Cup semi-final day is usually a riot of colour and a feast of fan expectation and nerves. It is a day out as much as a football match, a day to dream of the final and sing about putting the champagne on ice. Not this time. Not now. Here, there were groundsmen forking the pitch and music echoing around an empty Wembley. It is a necessary measure for now but that does not stop it feeling all wrong.</p>
<p>Even with nine substitutes, Arteta could not find any room for either Mesut Ozil or Matteo Guendouzi in his squad. It is starting to feel increasingly likely that neither will be at the club next season, although finding someone to pay Ozil’s wages has always been put forward as the biggest stumbling block to the Germany midfielder moving on.</p>
<p>Arteta stayed true to the same system he had used in Wednesday’s victory over champions Liverpool at the Emirates and lined up with Kieran Tierney on the left side of a back three. It is the system that seems to get the best out of David Luiz - or do most to protect him, depending on your point of view – and after some heart-stopping early exchanges, Arsenal used it well.</p>
<p>Arsenal nearly handed City an early lead in the ninth minute with the kind of comedy defending that has become one of their hallmarks. Luiz played the ball square across his own box to Shkodran Mustafi who tried to step inside Raheem Sterling as Sterling closed him down. It had trouble written all over it.</p>
<p>Sterling dispossessed Mustafi easily six yards out and it appeared Arsenal were about to be severely embarrassed. Sterling tried to play the ball inside to give Gabriel Jesus a tap-in but Mustafi’s blushes were spared when the pass was intercepted and the danger cleared. It felt already as if Arsenal were in for a long evening.</p>
<p>Manchester City bossed the first few minutes with Kevin De Bruyne in particular influential in trying to create chances</p>
<p>Aubameyang however had the first real opening of either side but after being played in by David Luiz struck at Ederson</p>
<p>But just a couple of minutes later the Gabon international redeemed himself by poking Nicolas Pepe&rsquo;s cross past the Brazilian</p>
<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles was surprisingly brought in for the game but did well on the left-hand side to martial City&rsquo;s attackers</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola was noticeably agitated by his side&rsquo;s first half performance after they lacked their usual cutting edge</p>
<p>City were out early in the second half and started brightly again before Riyad Mahrez tested Emiliano Martinez with a drive</p>
<p>Arteta’s side were starved of possession and defending with a degree of desperation. Kevin de Bruyne floated a ball to the back post, Riyad Mahrez nodded it back across goal and it was hacked clear before City could apply the finishing touch. By then, Kieran Tierney had already had to make a separate last-ditch clearance.</p>
<p>But after quarter of an hour, Arsenal should have taken the lead. Luiz has been roundly criticised since the restart but he received a ringing endorsement from Pep Guardiola last week when the City manager said he laughed when he heard pundits dismissing his talent. On cue, Luiz intercepted a long ball forward, chested it down, and played a slide-rule pass through to Aubameyang. Aubameyang was clean through but he hit his shot straight at Ederson, who saved it easily.</p>
<p>City did not learn from their escape though. A minute later, at the end of an 18-pass move that had started in Arsenal’s area and included ten players, Nicolas Pepe curled a ball across the City box to the back post. Aubameyang drifted away from Kyle Walker and met the ball as it dropped, clipping a right-footed half-volley past Ederson from a difficult angle. The keeper had no chance and the ball went in off the far post.</p>
<p>It was a brilliant finish to a superb move. It is easy to mock Arsenal’s talent for self-destruction but the goal was crafted from the courage to stick to their plan of playing the ball out from the back and beating the City press. Even though they had nearly come unstuck earlier, this time they had the skill and the confidence to work it perfectly.</p>
<p>City wanted a penalty after Shkodran Mustafi challenged Raheem Sterling, but VAR decided he had won the ball</p>
<p>The German put in an excellent defensive display with the likes of David Luiz and Hector Bellerin as Arsenal defended well</p>
<p>City continued to put on the pressure and Kevin De Bruyne was astonished David Silva was unable to finish from close range</p>
<p>After the drinks break the Gunners then doubled their lead after a fine break away move finished by Aubameyang</p>
<p>Arsenal nearly allowed City back into the game when Hector Bellerin played the ball straight to Gabriel Jesus on the edge of the Arsenal area. It looked curiously precise and deliberate, as if he meant it and it almost created the equaliser. Gabriel Jesus laid the ball back to De Bruyne but his thunderous drive was blocked superbly by Granit Xhaka, who flung himself into its path.</p>
<p>When Arsenal kept the ball long enough to fashion any kind of a foray forward, City looked alarmingly open at the back. Walker headed behind after one Arsenal breakaway and when Dani Ceballos curled in the corner, Mustafi met it at the near post and forced a fine save out of Ederson, who leapt to tip it over the crossbar.</p>
<p>City had grown uncharacteristically sloppy in possession, too, giving the ball away so often it felt like an offence against nature. Arsenal deserve credit for that, too, because they harried City out of their stride. As half time approached, Guardiola began to look increasingly irritated with the performance of his team.</p>
<p>Tierney played a long ball over the top for Aubameyang and he charged towards goal before finishing coolly under Ederson</p>
<p>Manchester City threw on Phil Foden and Rodri to try and change things but Maitland-Niles managed to nullify the youngster</p>
<p>City spurned a golden chance to equalise three minutes into the second half. David Silva fed the ball to De Bruyne, who cut inside and slid it across the area into the path of Sterling. Sterling met it first time but pulled his left foot wide of the post from ten yards out.</p>
<p>Arsenal settled into a state of siege. De Bruyne whistled a free kick inches wide of the post after an hour, Arsenal survived a VAR delay when a clumsy challenge from Mustafi sent Sterling sprawling and then, when Mustafi inadvertently flicked on a City corner, Sterling could not react in time to turn his header past Emiliano Martinez.</p>
<p>Arsenal were clinging on. De Bruyne drilled a cross to the near post but Silva sidefooted it wide. It seemed as if it could only be a matter of time until City equalised but then Arsenal completed their smash and grab with a second goal.</p>
<p>Pepe burst forward down the Arsenal left and then laid a pass back to Tierney. Tierney lofted a ball forward towards Aubameyang, who was played onside by Benjamin Mendy. Aubameyang advanced on Ederson and slid the ball underneath him.</p>
<p>City could scarcely believe it but their consternation was complete a few minutes later when Sterling seemed about to bring them back into the match as he turned past Mustafi and lined up a shot. As the ball sped towards goal, Luiz flung himself at it and blocked it with his right leg. His transformation from villain to hero was complete. Arsenal were in the final.</p>
<p>Luiz then threw his body in front of the ball to stop Sterling all but certainly halving the deficit after cutting inside

<p><img src="https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/50-cent-jamira-haines-pic.jpg" alt="img">
Something’s wrong with 50 Cent’s phone, and a lot of fans believe that the device might have been hacked. It all started a few hours ago when a photo of his GF Cuban Linked popped up on his account, and the caption said that she took over.</p>
<p>At first, fans thought that this is just a joke, but then even more pics featuring Link appeared on 50 Cent’s IG, and that’s when people started to believe that this is definitely not her fooling around.</p>
<p>Someone said: ‘Lol leak the spinoffs sis we bored on quarantine,’ and a follower posted this: ‘Dont give it back to him. Post pics of you on this shit. Tired a 50 now. Dont tell him 😂’</p>
<p>One other person said: ‘You guys make a great couple, just beautiful.’ and someone else posted: ‘You better give him back his phone and run. Run fast.’</p>
<p>Another person said: ‘She must have found something in that phone,’ and someone else wrote: ’50 must be sleeping 😂😂😂😂 better delete this shit before he wakes up.’</p>
<p>Someone said that this is definitely not her: ‘This can’t be her posting herself,’ and a follower agreed: ‘I was thinking the same thing captions basic asf.’</p>
<p>One other follower also seems to believe that this is not her: ‘I am beginning to think its not @_cuban_link She doesn’t type like this.’</p>
<p>In other news, 50 Cent reacted following Harvey Weinstein’s sentencing.</p>
<p>After the sentence became public, a lot of celebrities shared their thoughts and feelings and took to social media to celebrate the decision. The man will spend 23 years behind bars for the rape accusations that have been brought against him.</p>
<p>50 Cent also made sure to share a few words after the news was out a few days ago, and he chose Twitter to do this.</p>

<h3 id="will-julian-assange-and-wikileaks-finally-tell-the-truth-about-seth-rich">&ldquo;Will Julian Assange and WikiLeaks Finally Tell the Truth About Seth Rich?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/assange.jpg" alt="img">
WASHINGTON — There is one person who can almost singlehandedly put to rest one of the more cruel conspiracy theories to infect American politics this century. That person is Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks who currently sits in Britain’s Belmarsh prison. That theory claims Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic Party staffer murdered in what police call a street robbery gone wrong, leaked tens of thousands of private emails to WikiLeaks in 2016, upending the U.S. presidential race and leading to the resignation of senior party officials.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the legal team for Seth Rich’s older brother, Aaron, have escalated their efforts to force Assange and WikiLeaks to come clean with what they know about Seth Rich and the DNC hack. Aaron Rich filed a defamation lawsuit last year after he became a target of baseless theories involving Seth, and now his lawyers are seeking to use some novel legal maneuvers — including serving a subpoena on WikiLeaks via Twitter — to force Assange and his organization to provide documents and a deposition before the case potentially goes to trial next summer.</p>
<p>“WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, are uniquely positioned to confirm the truth: that neither [Aaron] Rich nor his brother ever provided any documents to, or received any payments from WikiLeaks or its agents,” reads the most recent filing by Aaron Rich’s lawyers. “However, despite multiple attempts through various channels over more than a year, Mr. Rich has to date been unable to serve a subpoena on WikiLeaks or Mr. Assange — or even confirm an address or agent on whom to serve a subpoena on them — as the former does not have a known physical location for service of process and the latter had been under the protection of the Ecuadorian Embassy prior to his more recent incarceration in the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>Aaron Rich’s lawyers declined to comment further on the motions. Twitter declined to comment on whether it would comply with a third-party subpoena intended for WikiLeaks. A U.K.-based lawyer for Assange, Jennifer Robinson, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>In August 2016, Assange gave a TV interview with a Dutch TV program. WikiLeaks had published thousands of stolen DNC emails, throwing the presidential race into chaos and leading to the resignations of top officials at the Democratic National Committee, including Chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.).</p>
<p>In the Dutch TV interview, Assange demurred on how he obtained the DNC emails, then dropped a tantalizing hint. “There’s a 27-year-old who works for the DNC who was shot in the back, murdered, just a few weeks ago, for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.”</p>
<p>“That was just a robbery, I believe, wasn’t it?” the host interjected.</p>
<p>“No,” Assange said. “There’s no finding.”</p>
<p>“What are you suggesting?”</p>
<p>“I’m suggesting that our sources take risks,” Assange said, “and they become concerned to see things occurring like that.”</p>
<p>Assange never said Rich’s name, but the implication was obvious: Rich was his source. WikiLeaks then announced a $20,000 reward on Twitter for information about Rich’s murder.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks later released a statement vaguely distancing itself from Rich, but it was too late: Assange’s hint and the reward acted like an industrial-grade accelerant. Rich’s name went viral: Twitter data reviewed by Rolling Stone show a huge spike in mentions of Rich’s name, most of them amplifying Assange’s insinuation. According to BuzzFeed News, the frenzy reached as far as China, where the youth wing of the Communist Party piled on: “The sources of the Hillary leaked emails were murdered, one after another? This is the truth of Western democracy!”</p>
<p>Assange’s comments fueled bogus theories about Rich, the DNC, and the 2016 election — theories that continue to this day. Within the Trump administration, those theories reportedly reached as high as the CIA director and the White House. Indeed, the president’s insistence that it was Ukraine’s government, not Russia’s, that interfered in the 2016 election and his fixation on the American cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike overlap with the Rich theories: In both cases, Trump seeks to deny Russia hacked the Democratic Party, weaponized stolen emails, and published those emails in an effort to hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign.</p>
<p>But that, of course, is what happened, according to the U.S. intelligence community, the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s 22-month investigation. The special counsel’s probe offered the strongest evidence yet that Seth Rich had nothing to do with the DNC hack after Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for carrying out the hack and laid out in detail how they did it.</p>
<p>Mueller’s final report accused Assange of “falsely implying” Rich provided the stolen DNC emails to WikiLeaks. “Beginning in the summer of 2016, Assange and WikiLeaks made a number of statements about Seth Rich, a former DNC staff member who was killed in July 2016,” the report said. “The statements about Rich implied falsely that he had been the source of the stolen DNC emails.”</p>
<p>Assange, for his part, has never apologized or retracted his comments referencing Rich. He is currently held in Belmarsh prison in London and is fighting extradition to the U.S. where he faces charges of violating the Espionage Act for receiving and publishing classified military cables leaked by Chelsea Manning. A group of doctors recently published an open letter that says Assange is in poor health and could die in prison if he doesn’t receive treatment.</p>
<p>In March 2018, Aaron Rich sued a former Fox News pundit and a pro-Trump blogger for defamation after they made statements accusing Aaron of participating in the DNC hack with his brother and taking money from WikiLeaks. (The two defendants denied many of Rich’s allegations but failed to dismiss the case. A trial is tentatively scheduled for June 2020.)</p>
<p>In court filings, Rich’s lawyers say they’ve tried various traditional methods to serve a subpoena on WikiLeaks and Assange without success. Rich’s lawyers now want the court’s permission to serve WikiLeaks via Twitter, where the group continues to maintain an active presence. Federal courts have granted similar service-by-Twitter requests before: A judge in the Southern District of New York allowed the D.N.C. to serve a complaint and summons for WikiLeaks via Twitter in its election-hacking lawsuit against WikiLeaks as well as the Trump campaign and the Russian Federation. (A judge tossed out that suit in July.)</p>
<p>Aaron Rich’s lawyers have also asked the judge in the case, a George W. Bush appointee named Richard Leon, for help to ask the British justice system to make Assange available to respond to a “limited set of questions” connected to Aaron Rich’s case.</p>
<p>Judge Leon has yet to rule on the two motions.

<p>Google Maps was hilariously hacked to show ‘empty seats’ as Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium recently.</p>
<p>Due to their sudden success in recent years, the Sky Blues have regularly been mocked for failing to sell out their 55,097 seater stadium.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that City actually have an average home gate in the Premier League this season of 54,391 - so the mocking seems a little unfair.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped Google Maps poking fun at the current champions of England.</p>
<p>When users typed in ‘empty seats’, the app would take the searcher directly to the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>In fact, it still works! Go ahead and try it for yourself…</p>
<p>City also expanded their stadium in 2014/2015 after selling out their full allocation of season tickets.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Pep Guardiola has denied that he is not focussing enough on the Premier League, insisting he is still demanding his side finish second behind Liverpool.</p>
<p>“Yes [the motivation is] to finish second, to improve every day for the knockout games in the other three competitions we have,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>(Image: Google Maps)</p>
<p>“There has to be something inside of all of us, to keep going, to move forward and try to improve.</p>
<p>“You cannot play good games in the cup competitions when you are not running well in the Premier League. It&rsquo;s not one day you are bad, the next you are good.</p>
<p>“We have to maintain the standards as high as possible.”

<h3 id="gathering-to-kill-me-coronavirus-patients-in-haiti-fear-attacks-harassment">&ldquo;&lsquo;Gathering to kill me&rsquo;: Coronavirus patients in Haiti fear attacks, harassment&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20200511&amp;t=2&amp;i=1518186597&amp;w=1200&amp;r=LYNXMPEG4A10Q" alt="img">
PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian pastor Burel Fontilus feared for his life in late March when he contracted the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>Pastor Burel Fontilus speaks during an interview with Reuters after his recovery from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Port-au-Prince, Haiti May 3, 2020. Picture taken May 3, 2020. REUTERS/Jeanty Junior Augustin</p>
<p>It wasn’t the COVID-19 respiratory disease that frightened him, he said, rather gun-toting vigilantes in his neighborhood near Port-au-Prince who were threatening to lynch him.</p>
<p>Word that Fontilus, 42, had fallen ill while traveling quickly morphed into accusations on social media that he was carelessly spreading it.</p>
<p>“They were gathering to kill me,” Fontilus told Reuters. “Neighbors said they had seen groups preparing.”</p>
<p>Reuters was unable to verify independently Fontilus’ claims that an armed mob in his suburb of Carrefour was organizing to harm him.</p>
<p>Carrefour Police Commissioner Charles Maunaude said authorities took the alleged threats against Fontilus seriously. Police were dispatched near his home to pre-empt any potential aggression, Maunaude said, while a squad car escorted the ambulance that took Fontilus to the local hospital.</p>
<p>Around the world, sufferers of coronavirus and health professionals have faced stigma due to fear and ignorance. Medical workers in the Philippines have had bleach thrown at them. Doctors in India have been forcefully evicted by their landlords over infection fears.</p>
<p>In Haiti though, the poorest country in the Americas, that stigma has become a major concern among health authorities trying to contain the outbreak. Haitians have long been distrustful of their institutions, wariness that a corruption-fueled political crisis, food insecurity and a surge in gang crime have only exacerbated. Now fear of contracting coronavirus has some taking matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>“The only way they feel they can be saved from COVID-19 is by eliminating those who have it,” Fontilus said. He said he has recovered. But he refuses to return home, instead relocating with his family from the home of one friend to another so that his would-be attackers can’t track him down.</p>
<p>Fontilus has good reason to be cautious.</p>
<p>Violence erupted during the last major epidemic, a nearly decade-long cholera outbreak that began in 2010; more than 800,000 people were sickened and around 10,000 died. At least 45 priests of Haiti’s voodoo religion were killed, some hacked to death, by mobs who blamed them for causing it with their spells, the government said at the time.</p>
<p>Coronavirus so far has proven far less lethal that cholera. Haiti has registered just 182 cases to date and 15 deaths. But harassment of patients such as Fontilus poses a major challenge to authorities trying to get those who contract COVID-19 to come forward for treatment.</p>
<p>“The fight against stigmatization is our greatest battle,” said Laure Adrien, General Director of Haiti’s Health Ministry and co-chief of the commission managing the outbreak.</p>
<p>President Jovenel Moise said in an April 27 address to the nation that the government would not tolerate violence against coronavirus sufferers. Yet Haitians say the state is too weak to stop the perpetrators.</p>
<p>One of Haiti’s few well-equipped hospitals, the Bernard Mevs in Port-au-Prince, canceled plans to open a center for treating coronavirus patients due to opposition by local residents who feared it would be a vector for contagion, an administrative staffer told Reuters.</p>
<p>Other Haitian hospitals and clinics face similar opposition, according to Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), an international body devoted to improving public health in the Americas.</p>
<p>People “are actually obstructing the access to be able to set up COVID health facilities, and threatening to burn them and to attack the healthcare workers,” Etienne said during a weekly regional briefing on Tuesday. “The lack of security at those facilities is a huge issue.”</p>
<p>COVID-19 survivor Gyliane Woel told Reuters the state ambulance service recently sent her home in the dead of night from the hospital that treated her in Mirebalais, just north of the capital, stressing it was for own safety.</p>
<p>Didie Herold, director of Haiti’s National Ambulance Centre, denied that. He said some drop-offs occur at odd hours because the service has only four or five ambulances devoted to transporting COVID-19 patients in the area around Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>NOWHERE TO BURY CORPSES</p>
<p>Haiti’s relative isolation and last year’s political unrest have helped keep its case count low to date, health experts said, as international travelers have stayed away. But they said the outbreak could yet explode in the vulnerable, densely populated Caribbean island nation of 11 million.</p>
<p>Thousands of Haitian migrant laborers are now returning from the neighboring Dominican Republic, one of the worst-affected regions in Latin America, after losing their incomes during lockdown.</p>
<p>Basic sanitation is a challenge in Haiti’s vast slums and rural hinterlands. Health care services were already collapsing before the pandemic due to lack of financing. The country had just some 100 ventilators before the crisis, according to Adrien of the health ministry, although it just received 100 more from China.</p>
<p>Fear and loathing, however, are not in short supply.</p>
<p>In the northeastern coastal city of Fort Liberte in early April, a bereaved man asked city officials to help him find a burial spot for his wife who had died of COVID-19, after a mob armed with stones, machetes and guns tried to prevent her internment in an old cholera graveyard on the outskirts of town, according to Mayor Etienne Louis Jacques.</p>
<p>Louis Jacques said a spot was secured in the city’s cemetery, but authorities had to fire warning shots to scare off stone-throwing locals so the family could lay the woman to rest. He said the grave was dug 30 feet deep and covered with concrete to allay contagion fears.</p>
<p>In Saint-Michel de l’Atalaye, a town on the central plateau, an orphanage was stoned after its Belgian director was diagnosed with coronavirus, said Michelot Dorcenat, a local health ministry official for Saint-Michel and neighboring Marmelade.</p>
<p>“They were furious, saying the Belgian brought the illness to Haiti,” said Dorcenat, adding that Saint-Michel residents were barred from attending a popular market at the nearby town of Saint-Raphael by residents there.</p>
<p>A person at the orphanage, who declined to be named, confirmed Dorcenat’s account of events.</p>
<p>DENIAL</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund and the U.S. government have respectively announced $111.6 million and $16.1 million in funding to help Haiti tackle the outbreak and its financial fallout.</p>
<p>Some Haitians suspect the government and local authorities are inventing coronavirus cases to rake in more financing, leading some citizens to ignore health precautions such as wearing masks and engaging in social distancing.</p>
<p>“They do believe the pandemic is political gimmickry and they do not appreciate the severity,” PAHO’s Etienne said.</p>
<p>Secretary of State for Communication Eddy Jackson Alexis denied allegations that public officials were seeking to profit off coronavirus. He said Haitians were beginning to acknowledge the illness thanks to efforts to raise awareness by the government, civil society and the media.</p>
<p>Yet three weeks ago, in southeastern Côtes-de-Fer, the family of a 41-year old COVID-19 sufferer refused to believe his diagnosis and insisted on removing him from the local hospital where he was in a coma, the facility’s epidemiologist Jean Daniel Laguerre told Reuters.</p>
<p>The hospital did not have sufficient security to fend off some 50 people who arrived to take the patient away, he said, highlighting the weakness of the state. Mayor Francoeur Dalexis told Reuters he had reinforced police patrols since the incident but resources were tight.</p>
<p>Laguerre said the man died the following day and his family held a large wake.</p>
<p>“I fear there will be a massive outbreak” in the area Laguerre said. “But until now, none of those in (the victim’s) entourage have wanted to be tested, and they have even put barricades on the road.”</p>
<p>VOODOO CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>With the attacks on voodoo priests over cholera fresh in their memories, leaders of that religious community are appearing on radio and television to dispel any notions that they may have conjured the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Health experts agree more education is needed to explain the virus. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said it has helped the government produce 500,000 flyers, 250,000 leaflets and 100,000 posters as well as videos and audio spots.</p>
<p>But nearly half the population is illiterate, and many rural residents have no access to the internet, television or radio.</p>
<p>Popular musician Jean Jean Roosevelt, who recorded a song with UNICEF called “Corona Can Cause a Lot of Damage,” said he travels to remote regions with around 40 volunteers and megaphones.</p>
<p>“We try to help people understand that someone who is infected with the virus is not necessarily a danger for the rest of the community if this person follows the rules,” he said.</p>
<p>Slideshow (12 Images)</p>
<p>But even these messengers are at risk. In the mountainous northern town of Marmelade, a young man trying to educate the community about the virus was beaten by locals and had his wrist cut, said Dorcenat, the local health ministry official.</p>
<p>Fontilus, the recovered COVID-19 patient, said he’s trying to set up a foundation to raise awareness. But with death threats still coming in, the pastor said he’s looking to relocate to the United States.</p>
<p>“I’m impatiently waiting the day embassies are working again,” he said, “so I can apply for visas for my family and save my skin.”

<h3 id="newcastle-tips-the-best-bets-for-mondays-action-as-racing-emerges-from-lockdown-to-restart">&ldquo;NEWCASTLE TIPS: The best bets for Monday&rsquo;s action as racing emerges from lockdown to restart&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/31/20/29046444-0-image-a-44_1590954034284.jpg" alt="img">
Ahead of racing&rsquo;s return on Monday in Newcastle, SAM TURNER provides a race-by-race guide and tips to look out for.</p>
<p>1.00 STONE MASON and Heavenly Tale are the least exposed of these runners and arguably the most interesting given they could well thrive for a switch in trainer.</p>
<p>Marginal preference is for the former who shaped with promise in a Newbury handicap (10f) last season which has worked out well last summer and the drop back to a stiff mile could see him shed the maiden tag.</p>
<p>1.35 The market hasn&rsquo;t missed the chances of MUTASAAMY (nb), but the unexposed Newmarket raider begins the season on a very handy mark judged on his victory at Kempton last autumn. The fact connections have kept him in training appears a tip in itself and he looks one of few runners here capable of leaving behind his current mark.</p>
<p>Newcastle is set to host the resumption of racing in the UK following the coronavirus lockdown</p>
<p>2.10 Bond&rsquo;s Boy ran to a good level in a well-contested Newmarket sales race in the autumn and is respected along with newcomers Blazing Hot and Freedom Flyer, both of which should be monitored in the market.</p>
<p>However, LITTLE RED SOCKS was professional when scoring on debut at Wolverhampton in March so may put her experience to good use in this company.</p>
<p>2.45 ART POWER and Magical Journey could well make their racecourse experience count here unless newcomer Continental proves to be above average.</p>
<p>The selection, well regarded by connections, hacked up at York on his final start as a juvenile and looks to have the scope to make his mark in better races this summer.</p>
<p>MONDAY&rsquo;S NEWCASTLE TIPS ROBIN GOODFELLOW 1.00 Stone Mason 1.35 Mutasaamy (nb) 2.10 Little Red Socks 2.45 Art Power 3.20 Heath Charnock 3.55 Rock Of Diamonds 4.30 Be Proud 5.05 GOOD TIDINGS (nap) 5.40 Frankly Darling 6.15 Valyrian Steel GIMCRACK 1.00 Al Ozzdi (nb) 1.35 Motawaafeq 2.10 Bond&rsquo;s Boy 2.45 Continental 3.20 Tathmeen 3.55 Rock Of Diamonds 4.30 Requinto Dawn 5.05 GOOD TIDINGS (nap) 5.40 Frankly Darling 6.15 Luck on Sunday Advertisement</p>
<p>3.20 Tathmeen has won five of his 12 starts at Monday&rsquo;s venue, but is arguably a more potent force at five furlongs so HEATH CHARNOCK may prove the answer to a tricky heat.</p>
<p>The selection finished behind Tathmeen when they met here in February, but the extra furlong might see him reverse placings. Money for Brian The Snail could be significant.</p>
<p>3.55 A change to the handicap rules allows the twice-raced ROCK OF DIAMONDS and Oakenshield to take their chance and, given the handicapper has been denied many opportunities to assess their ability, they may prove well treated. Rock Of Diamonds could emerge best of the duo as he went close on his Lingfield debut so clearly goes well fresh and he wasn&rsquo;t disgraced at Wolverhampton in March.</p>
<p>4.30 As with many of these races, fitness will be the biggest deciding factor and there is a question mark how straight BE PROUD will be following a 136-day absence. However, the four-year-old, nicely drawn in stall seven, is a pretty solid course and distance performer and also goes well for Daniel Tudhope. Tomshalfbrother and Fox Hill are the most feared of his rivals.</p>
<p>Racing fans will finally get their competitive fix at the Newcastle racecourse&rsquo;s restart</p>
<p>5.05 A really interesting handicap of its type and the two Newmarket representatives, Alignak and GOOD TIDINGS (nap) boast strong claims as they bid to withstand the challenge of the Philip Kirby-trained duo Ice Pyramid and December Second. This course and distance appears to suit the selection well and he is best forgiven an abject final effort at Chelmsford over a trip that stretched him.</p>
<p>5.40 This promises to be a highly informative affair with FRANKLY DARLING touted as a possible Oaks contender if she can impress here. She shaped like a decent filly in heavy ground last autumn at Yarmouth when narrowly outpointed and should give Kempton fourth Thibaan and newcomer Dream With Me a battle in an informative heat.</p>
<p>6.15 A cracking event to conclude the card with some well-bred newcomers tackling the likes of Byzantine Empire and Wise Glory, who was a shade unfortunate when beaten at Beverley on debut when well supported. VALYRIAN STEEL has been well mentioned in dispatches and, given he cost 600,000 Euros and holds a Derby entry, could prove above average so is narrowly preferred.
