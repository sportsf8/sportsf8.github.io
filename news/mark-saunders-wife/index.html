<p>TORONTO — Three days after kneeling publicly in solidarity with anti-racism protesters in downtown Toronto, the city’s police chief announced his plans Monday to step down this summer.</p>
<p>Mark Saunders, whose contract was set to expire in eight months, told a news conference he would leave his job on July 31. He said after decades of serving in the force, he wanted to spend more time with his family.</p>
<p>“I look forward to being a full-time dad and a full-time husband that’s not an exhausted byproduct that walks through the door at the end of the day,” he said.</p>
<p>The surprise announcement comes amid growing anti-racism protests triggered by the death of George Floyd — a black man who died last month in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes.</p>
<p>The protests that started in the U.S. have since spread to cities around the world, including Toronto, where thousands have taken to the streets to demand police reform.</p>
<p>Saunders, the department’s first black chief, took over the organization in 2015 after three decades on the job, including many as a homicide detective.</p>
<p>The veteran officer, whose tenure at the helm has included clashes with some of the city’s most marginalized communities, said he was not leaving with a heavy heart.</p>
<p>“Here I am after 37-plus years of serving what I believe to be the best law enforcement agency in the world,” Saunders said. “I have watched this organization — from start to finish — grow, learn, listen, and serve the fourth-largest city on the North American continent and the most diverse city in the world.”</p>
<p>Mayor John Tory thanked Saunders for his service.</p>
<p>“He has been a dedicated and responsible chief of police who has always worked to protect the city,” Tory said. “He cares deeply about the people of the city, all of its neighbourhoods, and about the men and women who serve with him.”</p>
<p>He cares deeply about the people of the city</p>
<p>Federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, Saunders’ predecessor in the Toronto job, said on Twitter that Saunders served the city “admirably … and will be missed.”</p>
<p>Saunders was named chief in April 2015 and saw his term in the top post extended until 2021 despite some high-profile clashes with the city’s LGBTQ community, particularly during the investigation of a serial killer who targeted men in the city’s gay village.</p>
<p>Saunders drew particular ire by suggesting members of the community had failed to offer enough co-operation in the years leading up to Bruce McArthur’s arrest and ultimate conviction on eight counts of first-degree murder. The force has since established a dedicated missing persons unit partially in response to the McArthur case.</p>
<p>Ongoing tensions have also led to members of the police force being barred from participating in the city’s Pride parade in uniform. Pride Toronto did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
<p>Saunders also had a rocky relationship with the city’s black community.</p>
<p>Syrus Marcus Ware, a core team member of Black Lives Matter — Toronto, did not mince words about the outgoing chief.</p>
<p>“We won’t miss him, good riddance,” Ware said. “His tenure proves that more diversity, or having a black police chief, does actually nothing and is a faulty way to approach the solution of the anti-blackness that is happening and rife within the police force.”</p>
<p>We won’t miss him</p>
<p>A one-time Toronto mayor and long-time observer of policing in the city described Saunders’ overall leadership as “disappointing,” saying few significant policy changes took place under his watch.</p>
<p>John Sewell, co-ordinator of the Toronto Policing Accountability Coalition, said Saunders largely maintained the status quo. He cited the relationship between senior and rank-and-file officers, reliance on strip searches and lack of reform when dealing with residents in crisis as areas where policies have remained static during Saunders’ tenure.</p>
<p>“He held his place as chief, but I’m not sure he made very much useful change,” Sewell said.</p>
<p>During his five years on the job, Toronto saw a sharp rise in gun violence and homicides, culminating in a record number of shootings — 490 — in 2019. Saunders also oversaw the force’s response to two of the city’s worst instances of mass violence: the Yonge Street van attack of April 2018 and the Danforth shooting three months later.</p>
<p>On Monday, Saunders thanked the city for supporting the force, but also for those “buffer moments” when police actions were “questionable.”</p>
<p>“You’re the ones that came to the table to keep us in check whenever it was necessary.”</p>
<p>Despite undergoing a kidney transplant in 2017, Saunders said his health was not a factor in his decision.</p>
<p>He said he would continue to work “for free” to help the city in his next venture.</p>
<p>“I see a lot of young black boys getting killed by young black boys and law enforcement deals with those symptoms,” Saunders said.</p>
<p>“I want to help cure the disease.”</p>
<p>Of late, the Toronto force has been the focus of growing criticism over its handling of those in mental health crisis, with many suggesting money from the police budget could be better used to support community programs.</p>
<p>Saunders said he was encouraged by the youth involvement in the latest protests in Toronto.</p>
<p>“This is a fantastic opportunity for all of us. We have to move past words — we’re tired of the words. It’s time to move to action,” he said.

TORONTO &ndash; A husband and wife who operated a daycare centre in Toronto have been charged in connection with the sexual assault of two young girls who were in their care.</p>
<p>The couple operated the centre near Caledonia Park Road and Davenport Road for the last 30 years, according to the Toronto Police Service.</p>
<p>Investigators allege that between 2017 and 2020, a 63-year-old man assaulted a now nine-year-old girl on multiple occasions. The same man, police say, allegedly sexually assaulted a now 11-year-old girl between the years of 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>“The man’s wife became aware that her husband was sexually assaulting the girls,” police said in a news release issued on Monday. “She, as the primary babysitter entrusted to be in charge of the girls, endangered the health of the children, failed to protect them and failed to report the abuse.”</p>
<p>A suspect identified by police as Toronto resident Jose Dias was taken into custody on May 29 and was charged with sexual interference, invitation to sexual touching and sexual assault. He was further charged on June 3 with another count of all three offences, as well as an additional charge of making available sexually explicit material to a person under 16 years old, after the second victim came forward.</p>
<p>He is scheduled to appear in court on Aug. 21.</p>
<p>Marie Alice Cruz, 60, of Toronto was also taken into custody on June 4 and charged with two counts of failing to provide the necessaries of life and failing to report a child in need of protection.</p>
<p>She is scheduled to appear in court on Aug. 13.</p>
<p>Police say they are concerned there may be other victims and are asking anyone with information to contact them at 416-808-2922 or to reach out to Crime Stoppers anonymously.

Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders on Thursday described the hurt he felt when he saw how George Floyd was killed by police in Minnesota, adding that the subsequent protests that followed clearly show that &ldquo;the time is now over for incremental change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There have been huge protests across the United States and global outrage over the killing of Floyd, with demonstrators repeating chanting, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were among the last words spoken by Floyd as a now former police officer had his knee to Floyd&rsquo;s neck. That officer now faces a second-degree murder charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not any law enforcement officer that I can think of that did not have a horrible feeling in their stomach when they saw what happened to George Floyd,&rdquo; Saunders said at a news conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It still bothers me. I have kids&hellip; That is not what law enforcement is trained to do,&rdquo; Saunders said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are there to preserve life. We are there to enhance community safety and when you see that, they all have their day in court, but I was offended by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People tend to forget&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saunders also explained that for him, anti-black racism is more than just words, adding that he understands it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a reality. When you look at North America&rsquo;s history, you have to learn it. You have to own it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So when we talk about lynching, nobody talks about the subject matter. Take 1940 for example &hellip; a black man was hung because he did not address the officer by &lsquo;mister.&rsquo; He said his first name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These types of atrocities have happened, and a lot of people tend to forget that. When they had public lynching, they would be put in the newspaper, &lsquo;Tomorrow at 2 p.m. there will be a hanging.&rsquo; People would put on their Sunday best to watch,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>WATCH | Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders about anti-black racism in North America:</p>
<p>“Anti-black racism, it&rsquo;s not words, it&rsquo;s a reality,” Toronto police chief Mark Saunders said in a press conference on Thursday. 1:48</p>
<p>&lsquo;There has to be a bigger change&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saunders said that while things have gotten better, the fact that change has been so &ldquo;incremental&rdquo; explains why many are so angry right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has to be a bigger change. The community has to have a stronger footprint. We have to change our training processes collectively, and these are things that in this seat I have done. These are things I will continue to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We as members of the Toronto Police Service are also grieving at the recent events. But we are hoping that as a community we can all continue to work together. We will listen, we will continue, through words and action, to help restore any public trust that is fractured, especially when it comes to anti-black racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Near the finish line&rsquo; for body cameras</p>
<p>Saunders has been an advocate for police officers wearing body cameras, something he said would help when there are controversial incidents. When the Toronto Police Service released its proposed budget for 2020 late last year, it said a part of the requested $1.076 billion would also go toward providing body-worn cameras.</p>
<p>Saunders was asked to provide an update on this at Thursday&rsquo;s news conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are near the finish line,&rdquo; he said, admitting that this has been a topic of discussion for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have wanted body cameras. This adds to transparency between police and community, and having those body cameras will help give an objective account in that situation in those moments. And it is critical. We are near the finish line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Protests planned for Toronto this weekend</p>
<p>Saunders also addressed reports that peaceful protests planned for the city this weekend could be infiltrated by other groups with a more violent agenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard this dialogue throughout this whole event. Every protest we&rsquo;ve had to date has been peaceful, so I am not going to speculate on what the intentions are,&rdquo; Saunders said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you that through my front-line officers, the vast majority of people who have gone to the protest in the city of Toronto have been peaceful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a lot of passion. There is a lot of anger and there is a lot of hope. And I hope that as Torontonians we continue to do that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of the members that are at the protests have self-regulated those that were showing up and had a different agenda. We are hoping that that will continue,&rdquo; Saunders added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are coming down because they&rsquo;re protesting, because they&rsquo;re upset and they want change,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We as law enforcement want change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if things turn violent at Friday&rsquo;s demonstration, Saunders said his officers are ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the resources necessary to deal with the situations.&rdquo;
