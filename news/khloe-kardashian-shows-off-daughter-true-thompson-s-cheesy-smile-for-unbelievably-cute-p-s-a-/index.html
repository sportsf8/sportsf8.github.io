<p>Khloe Kardashian is pandering to the masses by using her daughter&rsquo;s adorable smile to remind people about good hygiene.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Keeping Up With The Kardashians&rdquo; star stressed the importance of washing your hands on Wednesday. Khloe enlisted the help of 2-year-old, True Thompson, to get her message out. The toddler pressed her clean hands against her face and let her toothy grin shine through. The little one was dressed in an extremely oversized shirt from Scott Disick&rsquo;s clothing line called Talentless.

On Monday night, Khloé Kardashian uploaded a photo she snapped from inside Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s private jet.</p>
<p>A napkin caught in the frame of the photo read, &ldquo;Kylie Air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kylie Cosmetics founder purchased the Global Express jet for $50 to $70 million earlier this year, before the coronavirus pandemic hit, for Stormi Webster&rsquo;s lavish second birthday party.</p>
<p>In this episode of What Do Quasi-Billionaires Actually Spend Their Money On?, Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s private jet takes center stage.</p>
<p>Khloé Kardashian took us inside the famed airplane via her Instagram Story on Monday night, snapping a photo from her window seat that featured the remnants of a stunning sunset and a reflection of some midflight snacks sitting on her tray table. A cocktail napkin, sneakily positioned in frame, read, &ldquo;Kylie Air,&rdquo; as the interior of the plane basked in a hot-pink glow.</p>

<p>Page Six reported that the Kylie Cosmetics founder purchased the Global Express jet earlier this year for her daughter Stormi Webster&rsquo;s second birthday party (a.k.a. the infamous Stormi World). The purchase reportedly cost Kylie an estimated $50 to $70 million.</p>
<p>Though Khloé didn&rsquo;t disclose their destination, People reported that it&rsquo;s possible Kylie Air was destined for Cody, Wyoming, where the Kardashian–Jenner family celebrated the seventh birthday of Kim Kardashian West&rsquo;s eldest daughter, North West. A source also told the outlet that the birthday bash was cowboy themed and that sisters Kylie, Khloé, Kim, and Kourtney Kardashian were all in attendance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were happy to all be together for North&rsquo;s birthday,&rdquo; the insider said. &ldquo;No one has travel plans this summer, so Cody will be their escape when they want to get away from Los Angeles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson have grown &ldquo;closer&rdquo; throughout the lockdown.</p>
<p>The former couple have been quarantining together so they can both be with their two-year-old daughter True and now they are much closer.</p>
<p>A source told People magazine: &ldquo;They are clearly enjoying each other&rsquo;s company. The lockdown made them closer. They hadn&rsquo;t spent this much time together since they lived in Cleveland. They have had an amazing spring with True in Los Angeles &hellip; Khloe and Tristan are great co-parents and they also really like each other. Tristan has been on his best behaviour. Khloe is definitely charmed by him. If he is able to keep things up, it&rsquo;s very possible that Khloe would get back with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Khloe is said to be &ldquo;reconnecting&rdquo; with Tristan in lockdown, after once falling out when Tristan cheated on her by kissing pal Jordyn Woods just weeks before Khloe gave birth to their baby.</p>
<p>A source said recently: &ldquo;Khloe and Tristan have been isolating together and have really enjoyed their time with daughter True. This alone time has really allowed them to reconnect without outside influences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It comes after the &lsquo;Keeping Up With The Kardashians&rsquo; star slammed the &ldquo;sick and hurtful things&rdquo; she had been reading about herself as a result of the pregnancy rumours, with sources claiming that she was expecting after Khloe admitted she was considering Tristan to act as a sperm donor for her to be able to have future kids.</p>
<p>She wrote: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go on social media platforms much these days AND this is one of the main reasons why I stay away. The sick and hurtful things people say. I am disgusted by so many things I am seeing. SMH people swear they know everything about me. Including my uterus. Sick. The nasty things you&rsquo;re saying about me are over A RUMOR. I have seen so many hurtful/despicable stories and tweets about me over a false story. And if it were true. &hellip; it&rsquo;s MY LIFE, NOT YOURS. (sic)&rdquo;

<h3 id="khloe-kardashians-hair-transformation-prompts-cheeky-comment-from-ex-tristan-thompson">&ldquo;Khloe Kardashian&rsquo;s hair transformation prompts cheeky comment from ex Tristan Thompson&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article22198097.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Khloe-Kardashian.jpg" alt="img">
Khloe Kardashian has caught the eye of her ex boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, as she debuted her latest hair transformation.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star showed off her new &lsquo;do&rsquo; on Instagram as she traded up her platinum blonde hair for a light honey glow.</p>
<p>The reality star also took a few inches off her hair length as stylists Andrew Fitzsimon and Tracey Cunningham looked to change it up with a colouring they dubbed &lsquo;bronde&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Khloe shared her summer-ready look with her followers among a collage of selfies.</p>
<p>She captioned the pics with: &ldquo;location: under bitches skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: khloekardashian/Instagram)</p>
<p>Among the thousands that decided to have their say on Khloe&rsquo;s new look was her ex, Tristan Thompson.</p>
<p>The NBA star is father of Khloe&rsquo;s daughter True and it has been heavily rumoured that Tristan has been turning up the romance during the lockdown period, in a hope of erasing a bad 12 months or so between them, after he was caught kissing Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s BFF at the time, Jordyn Woods.</p>
<p>He must be feeling more comfortable with his position with Khloe, as he turned up the banter with a cheeky comment in reply to her pic.</p>
<p>Along with two fire emojis, a red heart emoji and the muscle emoji, the Cleveland Cavaliers star added: &ldquo;Baddie. P.S. I&rsquo;m all for the caption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While fans of the Kardashians are torn over whether Khloe should hook up with Tristan again, a source has told E! News that their cordial relationship at the moment is for the sake of daughter True, rather than any romance blossoming.</p>
<p>They are &lsquo;doing what is best&rsquo; for the two year old and the source revealed: &ldquo;They have a great co-parenting relationship right now and that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>(Image: khloekardashian/Instagram)</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been spending extra time together but have both agreed they aren&rsquo;t getting back together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The source went on to sat that the reason why Tristan has been spending so much time at Khloe&rsquo;s house was to give True &ldquo;some normalcy with both parents being around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The source continued: &ldquo;Khloe and Tristan have finally gotten to a good place where they can have conversations&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s running smoothly right now and Khloe wants it to stay like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: Tristan Thompson/Instagram)</p>
<p>The source added that there is hope for the basketball star: &ldquo;Khloe will always have Tristan&rsquo;s back. He&rsquo;s been a great dad to True and she respects him in that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5ecbf1e7f34d054ac5193486?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Khloe Kardashian became the subject of numerous memes and call-outs over the weekend after the reality-TV star showed off a drastically different look on Instagram.</p>
<p>Kardashian posted a picture in which her face shape appeared radically different, and Twitter users quickly created memes about her &ldquo;new face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Khloe Kardashian be looking like a different person every year,&rdquo; one person wrote. Others made jokes connecting Kardashian to the Faceless Men and Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar from &ldquo;Game of Thrones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Khloe kardashian entered a Khloe kardashian look alike contest I&rsquo;m not sure she&rsquo;d even be in the top 10,&rdquo; another person said.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Khloe Kardashian posted Instagram photos showing off a dramatically new look on Saturday, and people on social media were quick to accuse the reality-TV star of editing the photos and getting cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>Kardashian posted the photos with the caption &ldquo;Location: under b&mdash;-es skiiiinnnnn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>location: under bitches skiiiinnnnn 💋 A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 22, 2020 at 2:51pm PDT May 22, 2020 at 2:51pm PDT</p>
<p>While some commenters praised the star&rsquo;s hair and makeup, others on Twitter said Kardashian&rsquo;s face — especially her jawline, eyes, and chin — looked radically different.</p>
<p>—Dr. John Carter (@ludachrist0pher) May 23, 2020</p>
<p>Some users attributed Kardashian&rsquo;s new look to a skilled photo-edit or even plastic surgery.</p>
<p>—Diane N Sevenay (@DianeSevenay) May 23, 2020</p>
<p>Several users even jokingly connected Kardashian&rsquo;s new look to the &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo; characters Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar and the Faceless Men, the assassins who switch faces to kill people.</p>
<p>Several people expressed disbelief at Kardashian&rsquo;s radical new look and made plenty of jokes at her expense.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time a member of the Kardashian/Jenner family has been accused of editing their photos on social media. In April, people called out an editing fail by Kardashian&rsquo;s half-sister Kylie Jenner.</p>
<p>Representatives for Kardashian didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to Insider&rsquo;s requests for comment.

Keeping Up With the Kardashians initially premiered in 2007, and since season one a lot has changed. Over the past 18 seasons, the famous celebrities’ reputations and success have skyrocketed. The stars and cast of Keeping Up With the Kardashians have grown accustomed to living lavish lifestyles. In light of this, it seems like one of the famous sisters is looking to upgrade. Khloé Kardashian hasn’t put her home on the market just yet, but there is plenty of reason to believe this is what she is preparing to do. See why so many people have been speculating about the famous star’s real estate decisions.</p>

<p>It looks like Khloé Kardashian is preparing to sell her house</p>
<p>Timer Fridman is the go-to real estate agent for the Karadashian-Jenner family, according to TMZ. Fridman recently spoke out about a seller he is working with at the moment. Though Fridman didn’t mention Khloé Kardashian by name, fans and viewers were able to figure it out through his context clues. The real estate agent slyly gave the public multiple clues about the previous owners of the property leaving the only option to be Khloé Kardashian’s beautiful home. Apparently, the famous reality television star is looking to sell the property for around 19 million dollars.</p>

She bought the mansion from the famous pop singer Justin Bieber. At the time, Khloé Kardashian paid about $7.2 million for the house, according to Observer. She immediately began renovating the space in hopes of creating her dream house. The out-of-this-world gym is probably the most well-known area of the house. From her photographs, the pool looks absolutely amazing. It is hard to imagine anyone wanting to leave a home that is that glamorous, but that seems to be the case for the famous Kardashian.</p>
<p>How are fans reacting to the speculation surrounding Khloé Kardashian’s real estate decision?</p>
<p>Keeping Up With the Kardashians fans had a lot to say when they heard the news of the possibility of Khloé Kardashian selling her house. Lots of viewers and fans voiced their opinions regarding the manner in this Reddit thread. One fan guessed, “She probably decided to just renovate and sell for a nice profit and then move into a home that has everything she needs.” Though that could be the case, it begs the questions, what else does the famous celebrity need?</p>
<p>Some fans were wondering the same thing. Another viewer sarcastically commented, “Because 8 bedrooms and 7 bathrooms is obviously not big enough.” Keeping Up With the Kardashians viewers are curious to see where the reality television star will land next. Some people in the thread even speculated if this could be mean Khloé Kardashian could be moving to Cleveland to be closer to her ex, Tristan Thompson. Though that seems unlikely, anything seems like a possibility at the moment.</p>
<p>Some people think Khloé Kardashian could be exploring this option simply as a way to turn over a profit. A fan added to the discussion, “I remember [in] Keeping Up, Khloe was telling Kris that she was going to add square footage to the house for a gym and more space. I don’t think that ended up happening because all her workout stuff is still in her garage. She probably decided to just renovate and sell for a nice profit and then move into a home that has everything she needs.” Nothing is out of the question, and only time will tell what Khloé Kardashian is planning to do.

<p>With a pink-tone and an almost blurred look the photo had a near-retro feel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our crowns may slip a tad but they never fall off,&rsquo; Khloe captioned the post. And she went on to add &lsquo;#Queens #BFF #MyQueenMalika #Love.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Changing up her look yet again, Khloe, 35, donned tight cornrows braids, a style she and her sisters have come under fire for in the past.</p>
<p>Along with sisters Kim and Kylie Jenner, they have often been accused of appropriating black culture when they don these hair styles in the past.</p>
<p>Controversial style: In the recent photo, Khloe, 35, donned tight cornrows braids, a style she and her sisters have come under fire for in the past</p>
<p>In the past: Along with sisters Kim and Kylie Jenner, they have often been accused of appropriating black culture when they don these hair styles in the past and fans were already pointing to the style as cultural appropriation an hour after her recent post</p>
<p>Cornrows is a hairstyle that originated with women in Africa dating back to 3000 B.C., according to Ebony.</p>
<p>Just an hour after posting fans in her comments were already pointing to the hairstyle, which she donned after coming under fire for diversity at her company Good America.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So no ones gonna complain about the braids,&rsquo; one wrote in the comments. While signaling to the style another wrote &lsquo;Just in time after being found out you only employ 15% of black people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Khloe, who has been isolating with daughter True, two, and ex Tristan Thompson, 29, along with her brand Good American did the Pull Up For Change challenge on Instagram, Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pull up: Just an hour after posting fans in her comments were already pointing to the hairstyle, which she donned after coming under fire for diversity at her company Good America after they released numbers of diversity on their staff in the Pull Up for Change challenge</p>
<p>The challenge asks companies to reveal how diverse their staff is. According to numbers released by Good American, the company&rsquo;s staff is 15% black, 52% white and 32% people of color.</p>
<p>The brand was at pains to point out that reality star Khloe&rsquo;s co-founder and the CEO of Good American Emma Grede is black and that 84 percent of the workforce are female identifying.</p>
<p>Good American was founded by Khloe and Emma in 2016 and initially offered denim clothing designed a &lsquo;curvier, sexier and stronger shape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a statement on Instagram, the company said: &lsquo;Diversity and inclusion has always been at our core, so we see this as an opportunity to highlight the consistent and constant work our brand has done to ensure our mission is felt at all levels of the company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Khloe Kardashian&rsquo;s clothing brand Good American revealed Wednesday that 15 percent of its employees are black as well as having a black woman Emma Grede as co-founder and CEO</p>
<p>It added: &lsquo;We are committed to continuing our focus on diversity throughout our organization: both within the talent and partners we work with and the employees at our office. We refuse to be complacent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fans response to the announcement was mixed with some praising the brand while others didn&rsquo;t think the numbers were good enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With a company with a Black ceo/cofounder, I would expect better numbers,&rsquo; one fan wrote.</p>
<p>While another pointed to what positions the diverse staff is working in saying: &lsquo;What I’d like to see is what positions are they at…if it’s all customer service and warehouse then it’s a problem.&rsquo;</p>
