<p>The foreign secretary has said he would not “take a knee” in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, arguing that the protest is “a matter of personal choice”.</p>
<p>Asked on Thursday whether he would take part in the symbolic show of support, Dominic Raab said: “I take the knee for two people; the Queen and the missus when I asked her to marry me.”</p>
<p>Explaining why he would not participate, Mr Raab told TalkRadio: “I understand this sense of frustration and restlessness that it driving the Black Lives Matters [sic] movement.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to say, on this taking a knee thing, I don’t know, maybe it’s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones [sic], feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it so it’s a matter of personal choice.”</p>
<p>Mr Raab is one of the prime minister’s top deputies, and covered for Boris Johnson while he was out of action with coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Taking a knee” as a custom began in 2016 as a protest by US athletes, who knelt on one knee during the US national anthem to highlight racism and police brutality.</p>
<p>The act has since spread and become a broader symbol of solidarity with and support for the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>The foreign secretary faced barrage of criticism for his comments.</p>
<p>“This is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab,” Labour MP David Lammy said. “He is supposed to be the foreign secretary of the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p>Labour former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott wrote: “Taking the knee began in 2016 with American athletes refusing to stand for US national anthem.</p>
<p>“They were protesting police brutality and racism. But Dominic Raab thinks it comes from Game of Thrones”</p>

<p>Later the same day Mr Raab issued a statement on Twitter: “To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the issues driving them. If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.”</p>
<p>Downing Street declined to say whether Mr Raab had been ordered to issue the clarification, but said that Boris Johnson had not spoken to him about his comments.</p>
<p>The PM’s official spokesperson distanced Mr Johnson from the foreign secretary’s remarks telling reporter that Mr Raab was “very clear he was expressing a personal opinion”.</p>
<p>But he refused to discuss whether the PM himself would be willing to take a knee, saying only: “It’s not something that has happened, but you have got his words on what he wants to focus on in response to the protests and demonstrations and the very strong feelings we have seen over the last couple of weeks. We set up the race commission to focus on a positive agenda for change.”</p>
<p>Labour leader, Keir Starmer, last week tweeted a picture of himself taking a knee in his parliamentary office in support of protesters.

Dominic Raab has said he will only take the knee for two people — the Queen and “the Mrs” when he proposed.</p>
<p>Asked for his views on footballers taking the knee in support of Black Lives Matter as the Premier League restarted, the foreign secretary revealed his views on the gesture, which has become a symbol of support for the anti-racism movement.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, players from Aston Villa, Sheffield United, Manchester City and Arsenal – as well as officials and backroom staff – took the knee at the start of their games as the football season resumed.</p>

<p>Raab said: “I understand this sense of frustration and restlessness which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to say on this taking the knee thing — which I don’t know, maybe it’s got a broader history but seems to be taken from Game of Thrones — it feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation.</p>

<p>He added: “By the way, she disputes that&hellip; I’m sure I did but we’d obviously had too much champagne at the time, but I’m certain I did.”</p>

<p>As he faced anger and mockery for his comments on taking the knee, the Foreign Secretary later tweeted: “To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the issues driving them.</p>

<p>Football teams across the UK have showed support for the Black Lives Matter movement, with many releasing pictures and statements.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the chairman of football&rsquo;s equality and inclusion organisation Kick It Out called on every Premier League player to take a knee.</p>
<p>After Wednesday night’s match, in which the words ‘Black Lives Matter’ were emblazoned on the backs of his players’ shirts, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said more still needs to be done to combat racism.</p>
<p>He said: “We should send a thousand million messages for the black people, because more than four centuries, four hundred years, to do what we have done to this kind of lovely people, I’m embarrassed.</p>
<p>“I’m ashamed for what white people have done for the black people.</p>
<p>“All the gestures are good, are positive, but you have to do it with facts. I think it’s not going to be solved in a few days, but everything we can do to make conscious it isn’t acceptable in the 21st century.</p>
<p>“This kind of thing is not just in the USA. Everywhere, all around the world. We have to do a lot of things for the black people that we have not done so far.”

Dominic Raab says he would not take the knee for Black Lives Matter as it is ‘a symbol of subjugation’</p>
<p>Dominic Raab said he only kneels for the Queen and his wife when asking her to marry him (PA)</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said he would not kneel in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement he views it as a “symbol of subjugation and subordination”.</p>
<p>It comes after players from Aston Villa and Sheffield United “took a knee” on Wednesday evening in support of the cause ahead of the first Premier League match since lockdown began.</p>
<p>Asked by talkRADIO’s Julia Hartley-Brewer if he would also take the knee if asked, the Foreign Secretary said it was a “matter of personal choice”.</p>
<p>He said: “I understand this sense of frustration and restlessness which is driving the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to say on this taking the knee thing which, I don&rsquo;t know, maybe it’s got a broader history, but seems to be taken from Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>“It feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than a one of liberation and emancipation.</p>
<p>“But I understand people feel differently about it, so it’s a matter of personal choice.”</p>
<p>Taking the knee was first popularised by American sportsman Colin Kaepernick in 2016 when he knelt during the national anthem before an NFL game.</p>
<p>The act is considered a peaceful protest against police brutality and racism in the United States and has been adopted widely during recent demonstrations across the world following the death of George Floyd in police custody.</p>
<p>Asked if he would take a knee in support of Black Lives Matter, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab: &ldquo;I take the knee for two people; the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.&rdquo; Listen live ► https://t.co/sv3MZUm41c@JuliaHB1 | @DominicRaab pic.twitter.com/HbCIrCFKKV — talkRADIO (@talkRADIO) June 18, 2020</p>
<p>When pushed by Ms Hartley-Brewer on whether he would kneel in solidarity with the movement, the Foreign Secretary said: “I take the knee for two people: the Queen and the Mrs when I asked her to marry me.”</p>
<p>Mr Raab later clarified his view, writing on Twitter: &ldquo;To be clear: I have full respect for the Black Lives Matter movement, and the issues driving them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comments attracted criticism from Labour MPs, with Shadow Justice Secretary David Lammy tweeting: “This is not just insulting to the #BlackLivesMatter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab.”</p>
<p>And Diane Abbott expressed disdain at the suggestion that taking the knee was from the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, reminding her followers in a tweet that it began with “American athletes… protesting police brutality and racism”.</p>
<p>Shadow minister Wes Streeting said: “Every day, Government ministers flaunt their ignorance like it&rsquo;s a qualification. He&rsquo;s the Foreign Secretary.”</p>
<p>‘AIRBRUSHING HISTORY’</p>
<p>Elsewhere in his interview, Mr Raab was also critical of the decision to board up Winston Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square.</p>
<p>Barriers around the monument are being taken down today, after being put up to protect it from vandalism during recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations.</p>
<p>He said: “The Prime Minister was absolutely clear it’s ridiculous. That was on the authority of GLA, the London Assembly.</p>
<p>“And the PM had made very clear, particularly at a moment when President Macron is coming over to pay tribute to the cooperation that de Gaulle got in France’s darkest hour from Churchill that we should be proud of that.”</p>
<p>And the Foreign Secretary also repeated past criticisms of those who damage or remove controversial statues, insisting we “should have a debate about our history”.</p>

<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has outlined the government&rsquo;s stance on the proposed Saudi takeover of Newcastle United.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Magpies have finally confirmed fans will be able to apply for refunds for the remaining nine Premier League fixtures.</p>
<p>Here are your top Newcastle United stories for June 18:</p>
<p>Government stance on takeover</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says we have to &lsquo;trust&rsquo; the legal safeguards in place to ensure the proposed takeover of Newcastle United is &lsquo;done the proper way&rsquo;.</p>
<p>PCP Capital Partners&rsquo; takeover bid, spearheaded by financier Amanda Staveley and also involving the Reuben brothers, Simon and David, is backed by the mega-rich Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and is now awaiting the green light from Premier League chiefs.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>The bid is still at the Premier League&rsquo;s Owners and Directors&rsquo; Test stage and has been described as one of the most &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; takeover cases the competition has had to contend with.</p>
<p>Given the human rights issues attributed to the Saudi regime, as well as their alleged complicity with the piracy of Premier League television coverage, we still await a decision as to whether they will be granted control of Newcastle United.</p>
<p>NUFC finally address ticket refunds</p>
<p>Newcastle United have confirmed that fans will receive a refund for their tickets ahead of the remaining nine games of the Premier League season.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>The club have been in touch with fans on where things stand on fees for matches paid before the virus pandemic.</p>
<p>Three new dates</p>
<p>Newcastle United have been handed dates and kick off time for three more of their final nine Premier League games of the season.</p>
<p>The Magpies will get back under way on Sunday with a home clash against Sheffield United (2pm) but further dates for July fixtures have now been published by top-flight chiefs.</p>
<p>United&rsquo;s game with West Ham will take place at St James&rsquo; Park on Sunday, July 5 with a 2pm (BST) kick-off and Sky Sports will broadcast the game.</p>

<p>United will then travel to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday, July 8 for a 6pm (BST) kick-off which will be shown live on BT Sport.</p>
<p>And the Magpies&rsquo; trip to Watford will be played on Saturday, July 11 at 12.30pm (BST). Amazon Prime Video will screen the game.</p>
<p>Lascelles on strong finish</p>
<p>Newcastle United skipper Jamaal Lascelles says he never gave up hope of completing the 2019/20 season - even in the middle of the UK&rsquo;s lockdown when big suggestions were being made to cancel the campaign altogether.</p>
<p>Lascelles and his team-mates had steered the team to a position of relative safety in the top-flight and were eight points clear of the drop zone when the season was suspended back in March.</p>
<p>With hopes still alive in the FA Cup - and a quarter-final against Manchester City lying in wait - there was a genuine belief in the Toon camp that the season could have an ending to celebrate.</p>
<p>However, the virus pandemic left those hopes in serious doubt and Newcastle&rsquo;s best run in the FA Cup since 2006 and the chance to record a rare top 10 finish looked to have hit the buffers.</p>
<p>Barlaser on unexpected chance</p>
<p>Dan Barlaser says he is ready to grasp his unexpected chance to shine at Newcastle United after his loan at Rotherham ended prematurely.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old - who has already played for the first team under Rafa Benitez - is back in the fray for the final nine games of the season in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The virus pandemic may have brought this loan deal with the Millers to an end, but promotion from League One has now been confirmed.</p>
<p>As reported by the Chronicle back in February, Barlaser was always set to get a chance in pre-season but his opportunity to impress comes a month early.</p>
<p>Wilder provides injury update</p>
<p>Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder is hopeful both defender Jack O&rsquo;Connell and midfielder John Fleck will be available to face Newcastle United on Sunday.</p>
<p>The pair have been influential in the Blades&rsquo; surprise bid to qualify for European football next season but missed out on Wednesday&rsquo;s 0-0 draw at Aston Villa through injury.</p>
<p>The Blades moved up to sixth in the Premier League table following their point at Villa Park but arguably should have won all three having seen a goal not given despite the ball crossing the Aston Villa goal-line.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they will hope to return to winning ways when they travel to an empty St James&rsquo; Park on Sunday as they look to avenge December&rsquo;s 2-0 defeat to Newcastle at Bramall Lane.</p>
<p>New deal for Carroll &lsquo;makes sense&rsquo;</p>
<p>Former England international goalkeeper Paul Robinson believes it &lsquo;makes sense&rsquo; to offer Andy Carroll a new deal at Newcastle United.</p>
<p>Chronicle Live revealed over the weekend that Carroll was ready to commit to another season at St James&rsquo; Park ahead of his current deal expiring at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Newcastle have pencilled in June 23 for talks with Carroll about initially extending his deal until the end of the Premier League campaign and the possibility of the England international forward signing on for next season as well.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old has not featured since January through injury and it was injury problems that plagued a frustrating stay at West Ham prior to his return to Newcastle.</p>
<p>Carroll remains popular among the fanbase, though, and his family are settled in the North East. And while Robinson recognises the obvious concerns over his fitness, he believes there is &lsquo;logic&rsquo; in offering the former Liverpool forward a new one-year deal.</p>
<p>Sports centre given green light</p>
<p>A spectacular sports centre and community hub just a goal kick away from St James’ Park finally looks set to be built.</p>
<p>The Newcastle United Foundation has won council backing for its multi-million pound plans to redevelop the site of the old Murray House community centre.</p>

<p>The striking development will feature a rooftop 4G pitch boasting views of the iconic football stadium.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the demolition and transformation of the Diana Street site can start later this year, with the state-of-the-art hub due to open in autumn 2021.
