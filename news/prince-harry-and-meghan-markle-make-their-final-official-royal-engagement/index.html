Prince Harry and Meghan Markle finally bade farewell to their duties as senior royals on Monday.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex put on a united front, walking hand-in-hand into Westminster Abbey for their first reunion with the royal family since Megxit — and their last-ever scheduled royal engagement.

Even that was more low-key than expected, with a last-minute change seeing the Sussexes skipping their expected place alongside Queen Elizabeth II in the formal procession into the Commonwealth Day service.

Instead, the pair were led straight to their seats in the second row at the televised event, chatting and laughing with Harry’s uncle Prince Edward and his wife, Sophie Wessex, who were seated next to them.

The 38-year-old Duchess — dazzling in a bright green outfit, including a hat and cape — smiled expectantly as Harry’s brother Prince William, 37, walked in with wife Kate Middleton, 38, equally as striking in all red.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge initially appeared to avoid eye-contact, before TV footage saw Harry, 35, mouthing “hello” at his reportedly feuding sibling while his wife smiled and gave a small wave.

It is the first time the brothers have been seen together since Harry’s shocking announcement that he was quitting the royals, a move long-rumored to have been fueled by a falling out with William.

It is also unclear how much — if any — time they have spent together since Harry returned to the UK for his royal tour.

With the Sussexes and Cambridges both skipping the formal procession into the abbey — despite the order of service saying otherwise — it left the only royals alongside the 93-year-old monarch being her eldest son, heir to the throne Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla. Neither Kensington Palace nor Buckingham Palace have said why the late amendment was made, the Daily Telegraph said.

The Queen’s rumored “favorite son,'”Prince Andrew, 60, was missing, another byproduct of his scandalous ties to late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Royal biographer Penny Junor said that everyone was bound to be “on absolutely best behavior” knowing the world would be watching their every interaction.

“But goodness knows what they will all be thinking privately,” Junor said.

Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson also attended with pregnant fiancée Carrie Symonds.

The service was the last-known public engagement for the Sussexes, ending the saga that started in January with their public declaration of plans to live independent of the royals.

That new life does not start officially until April 1 — with the palace stressing that it was on a one-year trial basis, with the Queen reportedly telling Harry recently that they will “always be welcomed back.”
