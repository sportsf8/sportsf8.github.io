<p>Dil Bechara is slated to release on Disney+Hotstar on July 24 and it will be available to both subscribers as well as non-subscribers of the streaming platform.

<p>Highlights Sanjana Sanghi shared an Instagram story from the Mumbai airport</p>
<p>&ldquo;Milte hain? Jaldi. Ya shayad, nahi,&rdquo; she wrote</p>
<p>Sanjana Sanghi revealed she&rsquo;s flying back to Delhi</p>
<p>Actress Sanjana Sanghi, who stars in Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s last film Dil Bechara, bid adieu to Mumbai in an Instagram story posted on Wednesday afternoon. She said she&rsquo;s flying back to her hometown Delhi. Sharing a selfie of hers from the Mumbai Airport, Sanjana Sanghi wrote a cryptic but heart-wrenching farewell note to Mumbai, hinting that she may never return to Maximum City. &ldquo;Khuda hafiz, Mumbai. Chaar mahine baad apke darshan hue. Main chali Delhi vaapis. Aapki sadke kuch alag si lagi, sunsaan thi, shayaad mere dil mein jo dukh hai, mere nazariye ko badal rahe hain, ya shayaad filhaal aap bhi thode dukh mein hain (Bye, Mumbai. It took me four months to see you. I&rsquo;m going back to Delhi. Your streets seemed a little different, they were empty. Perhaps the sadness in my heart is changing my viewpoint, or perhaps you are also in pain),&rdquo; read Sanjana Sanghi&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>She wrapped her note with these cryptic words: &ldquo;Milte hain? Jaldi. Ya shayad, nahi (See you&hellip; soon&hellip; or may be not).&rdquo; Sanjana Sanghi stepped into Bollywood with 2011 film Rockstar, co-starring Ranbir Kapoor and Nargis Fakhri. She&rsquo;s also featured in several adverts.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Sanjana Sanghi posted on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Screenshot of Sanjana Sanghi&rsquo;s Instagram story</p>
<p>After Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death, Sanjana Sanghi paid heart-wrenching tributes to her Dil Bechara co-star. &ldquo;Whoever said time helps heal all wounds, was lying. Some feel like they&rsquo;re being ripped open, again and again, and bleeding,&rdquo; read one of her send-off notes to Sushant. On the day of the actor&rsquo;s death, Sanjana had written: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to spend an eternity to try and make sense of what you&rsquo;ve left us behind with and I personally never will be able to.&rdquo; Sushant Singh Rajput died in Mumbai on June 14. The police say he died by suicide and an investigation is currently underway.</p>
<p>Dil Bechara marks Sanjana Sanghi&rsquo;s first Bollywood film in a lead role. The film will release on Disney+Hotstar on July 24, an announcement which prompted backlash from fans of the late actor asking for a theatre release. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not make it about the size of the screen we get to watch this labour of love on, his last, and in my humble belief, his finest,&rdquo; Sanjana wrote in an Instagram post after that.

<p><img src="https://images.mid-day.com/images/2020/jul/SSR-Sanjana-Mumbai-1_d.jpg" alt="img">
Newcomer Sanjana Sanghi was all geared up to open her debut Bollywood film, Dil Bechara, in cinema halls when tragedy struck. Her first co-star, Sushant Singh Rajput, passed away before what would be his final film. Now, the makers of Dil Bechara have decided to take the OTT route, leaving SSR&rsquo;s fans even more dismayed.</p>
<p>Recently, Sanjana Sanghi took to Instagram to write a cryptic note along with a masked photo of herself that read, &ldquo;Khuda Hafiz, Mumbai. 4 mahine baad aapke darshan hue. Main chali Dilli vapis (Khuda Hafiz, Mumbai. Saw you after four months. I&rsquo;m going back to Delhi)&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the picture, we can see that Sanjana Sanghi is at Mumbai international airport when she posted this. We wonder what the actress meant by this note.</p>
<p>Sanjana Sanghi was shocked and upset by the news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s demise. The actress posted a video where she expressed how she was feeling after hearing the news. Sharing the video, Sanjana wrote, &ldquo;I refreshed my web pages a 100 times hoping I&rsquo;m reading some sort of horrible joke. I&rsquo;m not equipped to process any of this. I don&rsquo;t think I ever will be. I&rsquo;m definitely not equipped to articulate my feelings, this is me failing, but trying&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of Dil Bechara, the film is the official remake of the 2014 Hollywood romantic drama The Fault in our Stars, based on John Green&rsquo;s popular novel of the same name. Sanjana Sanghi makes her Bollywood debut with this film, while Mukesh Chhabra makes his directorial debut with this movie.</p>

<h3 id="sushant-singh-rajputs-last-film-dil-bechara-to-release-on-disney-hotstar">&ldquo;Sushant Singh Rajput’s last film ‘Dil Bechara’ to release on Disney+ Hotstar&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sq88eo/article31913665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dil-Bechara" alt="img">
Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput’s last movie Dil Bechara is getting a release on Disney+Hotstar on July 24.</p>
<p>With an aim to honour the legacy of the actor, the streaming platform is making the movie available to even the non-subscribers.</p>
<p>Rajput was found dead at his Bandra home on June 14 at the age of 34.</p>
<p>Billed as a soulful love story, Dil Bechara marks the directorial debut of casting director and Rajput’s industry friend Mukesh Chhabra. The film is produced by Fox Star Studios. The mobie will see Rajput in a leading role alongside debutante Sanjana Sanghi, and Saif Ali Khan in an interesting cameo</p>
<p>Dil Bechara is the official remake of 2014 Hollywood romantic drama The Fault in our Stars, which was based on John Green’s popular novel of the same name. The Hindi adaptation of the movie was done by Shashank Khaitan and Suprotim Sengupta.</p>
<p>“We are humbled to be able to play a small part in sustaining the legacy of a fine actor like Sushant Singh Rajput. In celebration of his life and his extraordinary work, ‘Dil Bechara’ will release directly on digital this July on Disney+ Hotstar; and will be available to all subscribers and non-subscribers across India. Our prayers and wishes to his family and loved ones,” Uday Shankar, President — The Walt Disney Company APAC and Chairman, Star &amp; Disney India, said.</p>
<p>The actor had a long-standing relationship with the STAR &amp; Disney India network, having started his career with the show Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil in 2008 to his Bollywood transition where he delivered some of his most memorable performances in M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) and Chhichhore (2019), both produced by Fox Star Studios.</p>
<p>Chhabra said he never imagined he would release the film without Rajput: “Sushant was not just the hero of my debut film as a director, but he was a dear friend who stood by me through thick and thin. We had been close right from ‘Kai Po Che!’ to ‘Dil Bechara’ He had promised me that he would be in my first film.”</p>
<p>“So many plans were made together, so many dreams were dreamt together but never once did I ever imagine that I would be left alone to release this film. He always showered immense love on me while I was making it and his love will guide us as we release it,” the director said.</p>
<p>The music of the film has been composed by AR Rahman and the lyrics are by Amitabh Bhattacharya.</p>
<p>Dil Bechara revolves around Kizie Basu (Sanghi) and Immanuel Rajkumar Junior or Manny (Rajput) and explores the funny, thrilling, and tragic adventure of being alive and in love.</p>
<p>Together Kizie and Manny embark on an on-off-up-down-sad and sweet profound journey into the heart of that crazy little thing called life. It teaches them what it means to feel truly alive and fall in love.

Sushant and Sanjana in Dil Bechara. (courtesy: sanjanasanghi96)</p>
<p>Highlights The film will release on July 24 on Disney+Hotstar</p>
<p>The film is inspired by John Green&rsquo;s book The Fault In Our Stars</p>
<p>Dil Bechara also stars Saif Ali Khan in a cameo appearance</p>
<p>After the release date of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s last film Dil Bechara was announced, a section of the Internet wasn&rsquo;t happy with its digital release and demanded the film to be out in theatres. Dil Bechara is slated to release on July 24 on Disney+Hotstar. Addressing the disappointed fans, the film&rsquo;s lead actress Sanjana Sanghi, in her latest Instagram post, wrote: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make this a time to celebrate a legendary life, a film.&rdquo; With the theatres being shut and keeping into consideration the current scenario of the coronavirus pandemic, Sanjana wrote: &ldquo;A time to give a tribute, to embrace these extremely challenging circumstances we all are in. And not a time to revolt, asking for something that in our present reality cannot be made possible. Let&rsquo;s not make it about the size of the screen we get to watch this labour of love on, his last, and in my humble belief, his finest. Let&rsquo;s instead make it about the size of our hearts that we can make as big as we wish to, and fill up with as much love, joy and pride as we want. Let&rsquo;s cherish it. Relish it. Celebrate it. In any and every way we can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She signed off the post saying, &ldquo;Socha agar moral support hee dena hai, toh shayad #DilBecharaOnAnyScreen ki thaan lo aur #DilBecharaOnBigScreen ko abhi ke liye, bhool jao. Aur jahan rahi intezaar karne ki baat. Intezaar toh mahino se kar rahe hain, taqleefon se guzar rahe hain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Sanjana Sanghi posted:</p>
<p>On Thursday, sharing the poster of Dil Bechara, Sanjana Sanghi wrote: &ldquo;A story of love, of hope, and of endless memories. Celebrating our dearest, and the late Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s legacy that will be etched in the minds of all and cherished forever. Dil Bechara is going to be coming to everyone on Disney Plus Hotstar on July 24. For the love of Sushant and his love for cinema, the movie will be available to all subscribers and non-subscribers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dil Bechara is inspired by John Green&rsquo;s book The Fault In Our Stars, which was also adapted into Hollywood film with the same name and it featured Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in the lead roles. The film has been directed by casting director Mukesh Chhabra, who is making his debut as a director with the movie. Dil Bechara also stars Saif Ali Khan in a cameo appearance and the film&rsquo;s music has been composed by AR Rahman. The film will be available to all subscribers and non-subscribers across India.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at home in Mumbai on June 14 and police say it was by suicide. After his star-making performance as the lead on the show Pavitra Rishta, Sushant Singh Rajput made his film debut in 2013&rsquo;s Kai Po Che! His impressive filmography includes Kedarnath, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Raabta, Chhichhore and Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! Mr Rajput was last seen in 2019&rsquo;s Drive.</p>
