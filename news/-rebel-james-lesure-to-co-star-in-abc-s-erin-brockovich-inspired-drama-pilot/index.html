<p>EXCLUSIVE: James Lesure has been cast as a series regular opposite Katey Sagal in Rebel, ABC’s drama pilot inspired by the life of activist Erin Brockovich. Executive produced by Brockovich, Rebel hails from Grey’s Anatomy and Station 19 executive producer/showrunner Krista Vernoff, Davis Entertainment, Sony Pictures TV and ABC Studios.</p>
<p>Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All</p>
<p>Written by Vernoff, Rebel centers on Annie “Rebel” Bello (Sagal), a blue-collar legal advocate without a law degree. A funny, messy, brilliant and fearless woman who cares desperately about the causes she fights for and the people she loves.</p>
<p>Lesure plays, Benji, a corporate lawyer who was Rebel’s second husband, and he is Cassidy’s father and Lana’s brother. A polished man, Benji is still welcome in Rebel’s life — but he knows that he’ll always get lambasted for siding with the fat cats instead of suffering humanity.</p>
<p>In addition to Sagal, Lesure joins recently cast John Corbett who plays Rebel’s third husband.</p>
<p>Vernoff executive produces through her Trip the Light banner alongside Brockovich, Davis Entertainment’s John Davis and John Fox as well as Trip the Light’s Alexandre Schmitt. Davis’ Mike Stein is Co-Producer. Sony Pictures TV, where Davis Entertainment previously had a deal, co-produces with ABC Studios, where Vernoff is under an overall deal.</p>
<p>Lesure co- starred on all five seasons of the hit NBC drama series Las Vegas. He recently had a heavily recurring role on NBC’s Good Girls and recurred as Sarah Jessica Parker’s love interest on the HBO comedy series Divorce. On ABC, he played one of the leads in the comedy series Uncle Buck. He is repped by Innovative Artists, Good Shepherd Mgmt and Meyer &amp; Downs.

<p><img src="https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/good-girls-season-3-finale-christina-hendricks-manny-monatana-1014x570.jpg" alt="img">
[Warning: The below contains MAJOR spoilers for Season 3, Episode 11 of Good Girls, &ldquo;Synergy.&quot;]</p>
<p>Good Girls&rsquo; third season concluded five episodes earlier than originally planned (due to production shutdowns) with May 3&rsquo;s &ldquo;Synergy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even so, fans were left with one cliffhanger as newbie Lauren Lapkus&rsquo; character Agent Phoebe Donnegan encroached on Beth (Christina Hendricks), Ruby (Retta) and Annie&rsquo;s (Mae Whitman) illegal operations. Phoebe has been investigating the women&rsquo;s involvement in counterfeit cash production. Add in their ongoing plot to remove Rio (Manny Montana) from his perch as head honcho, and fans were left wondering what&rsquo;s next.</p>
<p>See Also My Comfort TV With&hellip; &lsquo;Good Girls&rsquo; Newbie Lauren Lapkus The actress shares what she&rsquo;s watching right now while staying at home, and previews her &lsquo;Good Girls&rsquo; character Phoebe&rsquo;s &lsquo;sloppy&rsquo; side.</p>
<p>While Good Girls hasn&rsquo;t officially been renewed for Season 4, showrunner Jenna Bans and executive producer Bill Krebs are dishing on what could be coming down the pike should they get the green light. Dishing on everything from the Beth-Rio relationship to the threat Phoebe poses, Bans and Krebs are shedding light on where things could go next.</p>
<p>Despite closing the season out five episodes early, fans were left with a pretty good cliffhanger. What was it like having to work around the obstacle of ending the season earlier than planned?</p>
<p>Jenna Bans: The episode was always going to end that way&hellip; It was the last one we finished completely, when we had to shut down for safety reasons. So, it was sort of making the best situation creatively of, what we were left with. And I think, once we knew that was going to be our season finale, we sort of took an eye to editing and music, and what we could do to make it feel finale-esque.</p>
<p>Bill Krebs: It was originally teeing up the last half of the season, or the last third of the season. And so, it&rsquo;s still an exciting sort of moment, the fact that Phoebe is infiltrating the women.</p>
<p>Yes, Phoebe is clearly shaping up to be a key adversary against Beth, Ruby and Annie. How does she differ from the threat Agent Turner (James Lesure) once posed?</p>
<p>Bans: I think that&rsquo;s probably one of our biggest disappointments that we didn&rsquo;t get to fully flesh that storyline out. That was going to be a big character arc, going forward in the last five episodes. She&rsquo;s very different from Agent Turner, she becomes almost a frenemy, of Beth&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot she admires about Beth and she was sort of the nerd in high school, and thinks Beth was this golden girl. So it&rsquo;s a sort of a love, but then hates her, at the same time. And as she gets closer to the women, particularly Beth, we start to see that sort of odd adversarial friendship grow. And they end up having a really, really unique relationship that we&rsquo;re hopeful to play out.</p>
<p>Krebs: Turner&rsquo;s issue was always sort of class with Beth, in that Beth could get away with things that he might not have been able to. Whereas, Phoebe is more of a social status issue. And, what she represented in high school to what Beth represented in high school, has really never left her.</p>
<p>Bans: Yeah, she&rsquo;s really fascinated by the friendship between the three women, and it&rsquo;s that fascination that really draws her closer to them.</p>
<p>So, if the show continues onto Season 4, would they pick up with the five episodes that were left unfinished?</p>
<p>Bans: All those discussions are being had, right now. We&rsquo;ve shot some of the last five episodes. So, we&rsquo;re not going to just throw that footage away, but there&rsquo;s always some creative tweaks to be made.</p>
<p>Krebs: Yeah, we wouldn&rsquo;t be building towards that finale anymore, per se. That&rsquo;s one of the discussions.</p>
<p>Bans: But I would say, there was a lot of good things coming up that we were both really were creatively excited about, and at this point we don&rsquo;t plan to throw out the baby with the bath water. We really know that a lot of stuff coming up would be exciting to the fans, especially the Beth and Rio relationship.</p>
<p>Krebs: And if it gets into the Season 4, we can even make more of it, which we&rsquo;re very excited about.</p>
<p>Bans: Exactly. The good news is, it&rsquo;ll make the beginning of [a possible] Season 4 our most exciting season, ever.</p>
<p>Season 3 was particularly dark, have we reached the lowest point yet or is it going to get even darker?</p>
<p>Bans: That&rsquo;s something we discuss amongst ourselves a lot, because at the end of the day, creatively the show isn&rsquo;t Breaking Bad, where you can really get darker and darker and darker. At its core, this still has comedic elements, and that&rsquo;s something we love about the show and really want to preserve.</p>
<p>Krebs: They&rsquo;re still housewives who are trapped, who are in over their heads and we still want to play the fun of all that, as opposed to the grim reality of crime.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve had a stellar cast of guest stars throughout the series, is there any chance some Season 3 newbies will could pop up in the possible future?</p>
<p>Bans: For sure. One of our favorite things making this show, is discovering that amazing guest star that just pops. And oftentimes, we write to that. In the case of JT (Julian Gant), who is the owner of the Quick Cash they initially robbed, and now he&rsquo;s sort of a confidant&hellip; We&rsquo;ve never intended that to be more than one episode.</p>
<p>Krebs: He auditioned along with a hundred other people, and he just popped off the screen. And he was so funny, and just so great to work with.</p>
<p>See Also Where Are Your Favorite TV Shows Filmed? (PHOTOS) L.A. is still the entertainment capital of the world, but a surprising number of TV shows film outside of California, too.</p>
<p>Bans: So, we love finding people like that, and then, using them over and over again. To just populate the world, and make it more colorful. David Hornsby&rsquo;s an old friend of mine and he was like, &ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll do the pilot.&rdquo; I had originally intended on killing him, in the pilot. And then he was just so good and smarmy [as Boomer] he ended up playing a huge role, over the past couple of seasons. And we have plans for him in the future [if the show continues]. We love having this sort of theater troupe of fun guest stars to go to, in a pinch.</p>
<p>Wow, Boomer really does have nine lives then?</p>
<p>Bans: Yeah, he&rsquo;s a weed.</p>
<p>Krebs: They can&rsquo;t rid of them if they tried.</p>
<p>Speaking of weeds, is Rio&rsquo;s possible fate something fans should actually be worried about? Beth did hire a hit man (Andrew McCarthy) and Rio did tell her the only way she&rsquo;ll gain control is by killing him.</p>
<p>Bans: Yeah, they should be. I think, at the end of the day, Beth has such complicated feelings towards him. And right now, they are of the more angry variety, because she feels like he&rsquo;s masterminding her entire plan. She thought she was finally rid of him and starting her own business, and he basically has the women in his clutches again. So, she&rsquo;s desperate, and I think when these women are backed into a corner they are capable of anything.</p>
<p>Krebs: He also made the threat very clear, when he killed Lucy (Charlyne Yi) in front of them. If this season is about anything, maybe it&rsquo;s about them trying to get back to a normal life. And he very much complicated that.</p>
<p>See Also Lauren Lapkus Joins &lsquo;Good Girls&rsquo; in Key Season 3 Role The &lsquo;Big Bang Theory&rsquo; and &lsquo;OITNB&rsquo; alum will recur as Phoebe Donnegan, a former beta looking to become a full alpha.</p>
<p>Bans: Yeah. At the same time, he&rsquo;s obviously one of our favorite parts of the show. We love the Beth-Rio relationship, the push and pull. And we were going some really, really sort of interesting juicy ways with that, in the last five [episodes]. So, regardless of what happens, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve seen the last of him.</p>
<p>Krebs: The more dangerous it gets, the more attractive he is.</p>
<p>Bans: Yeah. To all of us, really.</p>
<p>Ruby and Stan (Reno Wilson) went through their own challenges in this episode but ultimately came out on the other side. Will there ever be a point when the weight of their lies will break that seemingly unbreakable bond?</p>
<p>Bans: They&rsquo;re one of our favorite couples and we are always talking in the writer&rsquo;s room how, it&rsquo;s a marriage we all aspire to, and we all sort of want. So I don&rsquo;t think Bill or I really have any interest in permanently breaking them up.</p>
<p>Krebs: No, it&rsquo;s more of a test of how bulletproof can a perfect marriage be?</p>
<p>Bans: Yeah. And that&rsquo;s what we find really interesting. They&rsquo;ve known each other forever, but people grow and change during a marriage. And no one more so than Ruby, in the past two seasons, so to not sort of test their marriage through that just didn&rsquo;t feel real to us.</p>
<p>Krebs: She always feels she&rsquo;s [committing crimes] for the noble reasons of getting kidney medicine for her daughter or buying a car for Carl and Jenny versus, Stan now is just getting money to buy things. And, which person is right, when they&rsquo;re both doing the wrong thing?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also Annie who can&rsquo;t seem to catch a break in the romance or schooling department. What track would she be heading down next?</p>
<p>Bans: I think the Annie storyline was something we were most excited about this season and especially where we were going. I don&rsquo;t think anybody would predict where she was ending up, at the end of this season. It very much seems like she&rsquo;s going down the same path, with an emotionally unavailable man, and sort of trading her future and her opportunities for that. And so, I think I&rsquo;m most disappointed where that has ended, here because it was a really clear arc, in showing that she has grown this season. And we didn&rsquo;t get to the growth part, necessarily.</p>
<p>Krebs: Yeah, her finally learning how to make the right decisions, or the right choices in her life, versus the wrong ones.</p>
<p>Bans: I would say, that&rsquo;s definitely something we&rsquo;d to pick up in Season 4, just because it feels like we didn&rsquo;t get to end it, in the way we wanted to. But at the same time, I think it&rsquo;d be really fun and surprising for people, what would happen to Annie in Season 4 now, would really take the show in a whole new direction, even with the other women.</p>
<p>Speaking of growth, Dean (Matthew Lillard) has improved as a person since the series premiered, and Beth lied to him again. Who should we be rooting for in this circumstance?</p>
<p>Bans: I think, both of them.</p>
<p>Krebs: Yeah, I think you&rsquo;re rooting for them as a couple in a lot of this, and that&rsquo;s sort of how we crafted it from the beginning. Trying to see in all this messiness, is there anything salvageable? As they both start to respect one another again, throughout this season. Even though Beth is going behind his back, and seeing Rio, it&rsquo;s for the right reason. She&rsquo;s trying to raise money to get rid of Rio, so she can get back to a normal situation, with her husband. Whether that happens..</p>
<p>Bans: Will remain to be seen, obviously. We&rsquo;ve really tried to rehabilitate Dean, in the past few seasons, and show that he&rsquo;s grown. And whether we believe that he&rsquo;s the right romantic partner for Beth, and whether that&rsquo;s a marriage that&rsquo;s full of romance and spiciness, that&rsquo;s a different question. But, she&rsquo;s obviously drawn to Rio for other reasons. We didn&rsquo;t want Dean to be the cliche jerk season after season. We really wanted to sort of dimensionalize him, and show that he has a heart and cares about his family, too.</p>
<p>What else can you tease about the show&rsquo;s possible future?</p>
<p>Bans: I would say, the beginning of a Season 4, there would be much to look forward to, because it&rsquo;s completely unexpected, and also, really satisfying, in terms of what the fans love about the show. There would still be some things the fans really want to see happen, which is fun, but they&rsquo;d happen in a way that will be surprising and sort of unpredictable.</p>
<p>Krebs: Yeah, Phoebe entering their lives is really going to alter everything that they know. And how they react.</p>
<p>Bans: And really launch us into a different sphere, than we&rsquo;ve ever been in in the show. They&rsquo;ll be in a different situation in Season 4 than they&rsquo;ve ever been in.

<p>When you choose to be a criminal, nothing is straightforward. You will have to get dirty. You will have to give up your humanity. That is the underlying ideology of the black comedy Good Girls.</p>
<p>A highly underrated show, it follows three suburban mothers who decide to pull off a heist to make ends meet. While their intentions are good, their actions aren’t. Their wrong decisions land them into a muddy situation that is more than they bargained for.</p>

<p>Created by Jenna Bans of Gray’s Anatomy fame, Good Girls has a small but loyal fanbase. However, the question is whether NBC will renew the show or not. Here is what we know.</p>
<p>Is the Show Renewed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisement -</li>
</ul>
<p>As of writing this article, no announcement has been made by the showrunners or the network. The third season recently began airing. Its final episode is yet to be released.</p>
<p>So, any information regarding season 4 will be made available to us after the third season finale of Good Girls.</p>
<p>Who Might Return in Good Girls Season 4?</p>
<p>The leading trio will return. It is their story, after all. Christina Hendricks, Retta, and Mae Whitman will reprise their roles as Beth Boland, Ruby Hill, and Annie Marks. Reno Wilson, Manny Montana, Lidya Jewett, Isaiah Stannard, and Matthew Lillard will also return in leading roles for Good Girls season 4.</p>
<p>James Lesure, David Hornsby, June Squibb, and Zach Gilford will be in supporting roles. Although, some of the supporting cast may or may not return.</p>
<p>What to Expect From Season 4?</p>
<p>As of yet, no information is available about the plot of the show. Season 3 finale will give us an idea of where the show is headed. Until then, we can only theorize what will happen.</p>
<p>However, the fans can expect the witty banter, quirky pickup lines, and a foolproof structure from the script. Everything one knows and loves about Good Girls.

<p>Good Girls is a crime drama that is a mix between Desperate Housewives and Ocean’s Eight. It follows Elizabeth Boland (Christina Hendricks), Annie Marks (Mae Whitman), and Ruby Hill (Retta). They are three mothers who live in Detroit and whose economic problems are piling up. This is reason enough to convince yourself to rob a supermarket.</p>
<p>From this decision, a series of events are triggered that they never saw coming. Just as the premise of laughable and implausible sounds, it works because of the charm of its female protagonists and because the scripts are agile, entertaining, and frantic.</p>

</ul>
<p>The third season promises to throttle and push viewers to the limit. The last installment of the romance between Beth Boland with a particular trafficker brought them more problems than they thought. Now the danger is more latent than ever for the three protagonists, who will look for a job that has them incognito.</p>
<p>With this, Agent Turner (James Lesure) will be removed. Their criminal activities will not stop. But what happened in the past is beginning to leave an apprenticeship in all three. Although how stubborn they are may make them falter and make a mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisement -</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s not forget that we have a new character: Rhea, played by Jackie Cruz and Beth’s friend. But she is not just anyone. Her past will be involved with Rio’s (Manny Montana).</p>
<p>Series creator Jenna Bans spoke more about this story arc: “When Annie and Ruby learn about Rhea’s past, they will question Beth for keeping her close to them.”</p>
<p>The third season will explore the effects of what happened with Rio and the possible collateral consequences. The question that many ask themselves is if, with their new jobs, the three girls will return to the old ways.</p>
<p>The Good Girls will have to answer for their actions. Another important fact is that there will be a new good girl: Lucy (Charlyne Yi), who enters to help the three of them earn more money. But according to its creator, the character will be more of a problem for the protagonists. This, in turn, decisive for development. It’s from the season. We will soon know more details regarding this mysterious role.</p>
<p>Release of Good Girls season 4</p>
<p>right after the release and success of season 3, fans wanted to know more about another season. No official announcements are out for a new season. Though, the events in season 3 call for more.

The Good Girls are back at it.</p>
<p>Christina Hendricks, Mae Whitman and Retta return to shake things up in the third season of NBC&rsquo;s crime dramedy, which picks up not long after the events of the sophomore season finale, and only ET premieres the exclusive first look at next Sunday&rsquo;s return episode.</p>
<p>When we last saw Beth (Hendricks), she had just shot Rio (Manny Montana) as he was beating up Agent Turner (James Lesure). Now that Rio&rsquo;s out of the picture (for now), she’s ready to run the game and stay in control. The women each take on seemingly innocent jobs &ndash; Beth in a stationary store, Ruby (Retta) in a nail salon and Annie (Whitman) as a valet &ndash; each with a special purpose to aid them in their new criminal enterprise as amateur counterfeiters. What happens as they expand their operation will have a ripple effect with their families.</p>
<p>In ET&rsquo;s exclusive clip, the main trio find themselves desperate for help as they try to improve on their illegal side hustle. As they pull into a parking lot moments before they&rsquo;re set to meet a potential asset, expert graphic designer and Beth&rsquo;s co-worker, Lucy (Charlyne Yi), they have a real gut-check conversation in the car about how legitimate this woman is. Let&rsquo;s just say, their paranoia is at an 11.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could be an undercover cop!&rdquo; Annie worries, causing Beth to reassure her friend that Lucy isn&rsquo;t exactly working for law enforcement. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know that! She could be wearing a wire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t even know what we&rsquo;re going to say,&rdquo; Beth says with a smile, clearly a little amused at the whole situation. &ldquo;She just works at a paper store, OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noah just worked at a grocery store,&rdquo; Annie reminds Beth, referencing Annie&rsquo;s ex-lover who turned out to be an undercover cop tasked with finding out her secrets.</p>
<p>When Beth brings up the fact that Lucy &ldquo;has birds,&rdquo; Annie is sure that this woman is &ldquo;a nutcase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or worse,&rdquo; Ruby joins in after quietly listening to the two bicker.</p>
<p>Can the three Good Girls put aside their differences for the good of their&hellip; criminal operation? Watch ET&rsquo;s exclusive sneak peek above to find out what happens next.</p>
<p>From executive producer Jenna Bans, Good Girls mixes a little Thelma &amp; Louise with a bit of Breaking Bad, and also stars Matthew Lillard, Reno Wilson, Lidya Jewett and Isaiah Stannard.</p>
<p>Good Girls premieres Sunday, Feb. 16 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.</p>

<h3 id="the-republic-of-sarah-kirsten-nelson--james-lesure-join-cbs-drama-pilot">&ldquo;‘The Republic Of Sarah’: Kirsten Nelson &amp; James Lesure Join CBS Drama Pilot&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/kirsten-nelson-james-lesure.jpg?w=630" alt="img">
EXCLUSIVE: Kirsten Nelson (This is Us) and James Lesure (Men at Work) are set as series regulars opposite Sarah Drew in The Republic of Sarah, CBS’ drama pilot from Fulwell 73 and CBS TV Studios.</p>
<p>Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All</p>
<p>Written by Jeffrey Paul King and directed by Marc Webb, The Republic of Sarah is said to have a Northern Exposure feel. It centers on a small New Hampshire town that is thrust onto the world stage when the discovery of a valuable resource within its borders compels the residents to declare themselves an independent nation, thus setting the unlikely young mayor, Sarah Cooper (Drew) and her Cabinet of inexperienced locals on the path of running a brand-new country.</p>
<p>CBS</p>
<p>Nelson will play Francine, Morrisville’s sheriff. Unflappable and resolute, Francine lives her life according to old-school principles of honor and duty and isn’t afraid to speak her mind when she feels those principles are being ignored. She is an important member of Sarah’s new government, but that position becomes imperiled when her illicit romance with a married Morrisville citizen goes public.</p>
<p>Lesure is Tim, an aloof banker who splits his time between Wall Street and a rustic getaway in New Hampshire. Tim always has been the smartest and most powerful guy in any Morrisville room, until the town chooses – against his advice – to put its faith in Sarah and her plan for independence. Tim quickly becomes a thorn in Sarah’s side as he fights to stop her and her new nation.</p>
<p>Carlos Leal and Jonathan Slavin co-star in the pilot, which King and Black Lamb’s Webb executive produce with Anna Fricke and Fulwell 73’s Leo Pearlman and Jeff Grosvenor.</p>
<p>Nelson recurs on This Is Us and is about to start production on the second made-for-TV movie from the cult USA series Psych. Nelson is repped by Domain and Meghan Schumacher Management</p>
<p>Lesure’s credits include Men at Work, Las Vegas, Good Girls and the upcoming season of Divorce. Lesure is repped by Innovative Artists, DaVida Smith at Etcetera &amp; Company and Neil Meyer at Meyers &amp; Downs.
