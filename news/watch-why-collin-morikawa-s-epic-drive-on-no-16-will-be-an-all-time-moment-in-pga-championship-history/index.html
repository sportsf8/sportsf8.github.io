<p>Collin Morikawa is 23 years old and just getting started with his professional career, yet he&rsquo;s already a major champion. And in winning the 2020 PGA Championship, he lived up to his reputation as one of the elite ball-strikers on the PGA Tour with a relatively limited number of events under his belt.</p>
<p>Hole No. 16 at TPC Harding Park was one of two drivable par-4s on the par-70 track this week, and Sunday&rsquo;s pin placement on the right side of the green just beyond the greenside bunker provided the ultimate risk-reward calculation. Stretching to 294 yards, players had to feel confident not only in their distance but their accuracy in order to set themselves up for an eagle opportunity. With the wrong line, one could end up clipping the trees on the right; with the wrong distance, one could end up in the sand or the thick and penal rough surrounding the green.</p>
<p>Bryson Dechambeau took aim just before Morikawa reached the No. 16 tee, burning the edge of the green and hanging on to the top lip of the bunker. DeChambeau&rsquo;s putt from the fringe didn&rsquo;t drop, but he tapped in for birdie to join a five-way tie for the lead at 10-under par, one shot back of Morikawa.</p>
<p>So here&rsquo;s the setup. You&rsquo;re 23 years old, tied for the lead up one stroke over five players &ndash; a group that includes the likes of Jason Day, Bryson DeChambeau and Tony Finau &ndash; with three holes to go at the PGA Championship. Morikawa could have played it safe with a layup, leaning on the same kind of wedge shot he holed at No. 14 to take the lead, but he took aim at the pin one of the greatest shots in major championship history.</p>
<p>Morikawa pulled his driver and landed the ball just short of the green. After a favorable bounce, it wound up snug, 7 feet from the pin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just fit my eye. We were just hoping for a really good bounce,&rdquo; Morikawa said after the round. &ldquo;We got it, hit a really good putt, and now we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the few spots of concern in Morikawa&rsquo;s scouting report has been his putting. When he fell short of Tiger Woods&rsquo; record of made cuts after joining the PGA Tour, it was his work on the green that contributed to missing out on history. Morikawa always argued that made cuts streak wasn&rsquo;t a big deal, and maybe after it was broken we&rsquo;ve seen him take the next step in his professional evolution. He bested Justin Thomas in a playoff at Muirfield Village with confidence in his swing and his putter, and when the championship was on the line with that 7-foot eagle putt, there as no hesitation or doubt from the newly-crowned major champion.</p>
<p>A big theme of Sunday was recognizing how the golf&rsquo;s newest stars were right there with established winners like Day, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Justin Rose. But while Matthew Wolff, Cameron Champ and even DeChambeau have gotten more headlines prior to this week, none of them are a major champion like Collin Morikawa.</p>
<p>When we talk about the youth movement and the future of golf, the conversation should start with Morikawa and moments like his epic shot at No. 16 in the 2020 PGA Championship.</p>
<p>And when the PGA of America rolls back reels of the best shots ever made at its major championship, you can bet Morikawa&rsquo;s drive on No. 16 will be in the highlight package.

<p>Collin Morikawa&rsquo;s drive on 16 was the shot of the tournament. CBS Broadcast</p>
<p>TPC Harding Park’s 16th hole has provided plenty of excitement this week. The short, dog-leg right par-4 with multiple tee boxes allowed for a variety of setups and, with it, many avenues to play the hole. On Sunday, it served as the host for the shot that won the PGA Championship.</p>
<p>Collin Morikawa stepped on the tee box at 16 already having holed a momentum-seizing shot with his chip in on the 14th, but that shot pales in comparison to what he would do moments later. With the tee box up on 16 for the final round, the hole was playing 294 yards, easily reachable for most players in the field. The shot merely called for shaping the ball around the towering cypress trees for a look at the green.</p>
<p>With those variables in mind, Morikawa unsheathed the lumber and took dead aim. What happened next will be replayed for years to come.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old unleashed a towering fade around the trees as the ball tracked on a beeline for the green. The ball carried 274 yards, bouncing on the front of the green and hopped up to within eight feet of the hole. When Morikawa saw the result, he calmly handed the driver to his caddie and cracked a small smile.</p>
<p>“Absolutely brilliant!” exclaimed CBS’ Frank Nobilo.</p>
<p>Moments later, Morikawa stroked his putt dead center to open up a two-shot lead at 13 under, which proved to be the winning margin.</p>
<p>“It just fit my eye,” Morikawa said. “We were just hoping for a really good bounce, and we got it, hit a really good putt, and now we’re here.”

Today’s final round of the 2020 PGA Championship at Harding Park in San Francisco has been unreal, with seven players at one point being tied for the lead during the final nine holes.</p>
<p>But then one of those players did something incredible and took what seems to be control of the tournament with a drive and a putt that will always be shown in major championship highlights.</p>
<p>Collin Morikawa, who is just 23 years old, stepped up to the drivable par-4 16th and drove the green with a beautiful 293-yard tee shot. That set up a 7-footer for eagle that he calmly sunk for a two-stroke lead.</p>

<p><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/08/10/d6bb9c72-f8c2-48fd-8314-8f8bf8c809fb/thumbnail/1200x675/3eec18a062a82731505f57edb5ef6431/collin-morikawa-wanamaker-trophy-drop-pga-getty.jpg" alt="img">
Collin Morikawa pulled off a stunning feat Sunday when, at just 23 years old, he bested the likes of Paul Casey and Dustin Johnson to win the 2020 PGA Championship. The victory, Morikawa&rsquo;s first major, was all the more impressive considering it was his first PGA Championship appearance second major tournament ever.</p>
<p>In notching the historic win, Morikawa became the third-youngest player to win the PGA Championship in the stroke play era. He joins Jack Nicklaus (1963), Tiger Woods (1999) and Rory McIlroy (2012) in an elite group to hold up the Wanamaker Trophy at 23.</p>
<p>We write all that so you can understand that Morikawa&rsquo;s mindset as he experienced a crowning achievement in his professional career. In lifting up the symbol of his triumph, the storied Wanamaker Trophy, Morikawa apparently forgot the hardware has a top &hellip; and yes, that top detaches when it&rsquo;s not held upright.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no harm, no foul, and Morikawa&rsquo;s slip wasn&rsquo;t any more than a great anecdote on what was a thrilling final round of golf at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco.</p>
<p>If anything, this will be a blip on highlight reels Sunday and Monday. Morikawa&rsquo;s stunning Sunday will be remembered for some great back-nine moments, including a sweet chip shot for birdie at No. 14 and a drive on No. 16 that would make Happy Gilmore blush.</p>
<p>Still, Morikawa&rsquo;s near slip at the end was a reminder that even the best golfers can get caught up in the moment. After all, it&rsquo;s not like it hasn&rsquo;t happened before.

In a sports year upended by the coronavirus pandemic, championship moments have been long awaited, and Collin Morikawa created an extraordinary one on Sunday at the 102nd P.G.A. Championship at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco.</p>
<p>A 23-year-old native Californian, Morikawa etched his name on the Wanamaker Trophy with a final-round six-under-par 64 in only his second appearance at a major championship. He became the third-youngest winner of the P.G.A. Championship since it became a stroke-play event in 1958. Only Jack Nicklaus in 1963 and Rory McIlroy in 2012 were younger.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited, but it feels like this is where I’m supposed to be,” said Morikawa, who was a four-time All-American at the nearby University of California, Berkeley. He turned professional just last year.</p>
<p>Morikawa’s play down the stretch on Sunday suggested a maturity that could not be measured in years.

Every major winner has a major moment, a shot that will replayed for year to come.</p>
<p>Collin Morikawa had two Sunday at TPC Harding Park en route to his maiden major title at the PGA Championship.</p>
<p>First, there was the chip-in birdie. Tied for the lead with five holes to play, Morikawa came up some 55 feet shy of the green with his approach at the par-4 14th hole. Despite not having much green to work with, Morikawa holed his third shot to take a one-stroke lead.</p>
<p>He added to that advantage two holes later, hitting a beautiful baby-cut driver into the green at the 336-yard, par-4 16th. With just 7 feet left, he followed by rolling in the eagle putt to break a tie with Paul Casey and pull ahead by two.</p>
<p>Morikawa is a rising star and certainly will be expected to have more major moments like Sunday. But he&rsquo;ll always remember these two shots that helped him capture his first.

SAN FRANCISCO — The best shot of his life, the shot that made Collin Morikawa a major champion, was never supposed to happen.</p>
<p>He knew the tee on the 16th at Harding Park would be moved forward at the PGA Championship. He said during practice rounds that wouldn’t tempt him to go for the green. But this was Sunday afternoon, right after Morikawa had chipped in for birdie to break out of a seven-way tie, and at this moment was tied again with Paul Casey.</p>
<p>“I knew I had to hit a good one,” he said.</p>
<p>The shot will be remembered as one of the best in a major that hardly anyone witnessed, not with spectators banned during the COVID-19 era for majors.</p>
<p>Morikawa hit driver on the 294-yard hole that was perfect in flight and even better when it landed, hopping onto the green and rolling to 7 feet for an eagle that all but clinched victory on a mostly quiet, chilly afternoon at Harding Park.</p>
<p>In the first major without spectators, the 23-year-old Californian finished with a bang. The chip-in for birdie, the tee shot for eagle, it added to a 6-under 64 and the best closing round by a PGA champion in 25 years, and a two-shot victory over Casey (66) and Dustin Johnson (68).</p>
<p>The only regret was the lack of a roar this shot deserved. He had no idea how good it was until he got closer to the green.</p>
<p>“This is one time I really wish there were crowds,” he said with a broad smile. “I was just praying for a straight bounce … and then after it bounced, it kind of got behind a tree that we couldn’t see around the corner. So once it bounced, I was like ‘OK, I will take it anywhere.’</p>
<p>“I peeked around right and looked around the tree, and it looked really, really good.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic that moved the PGA Championship from May to August was allowed to be played only if spectators were not allowed. But there was one person who won’t forget what he saw.</p>
<p>Casey, with his first good shot at winning a major, birdied the 16th to tie Morikawa for the lead. Standing on the tee at the par-3 17th, he looked back and saw the ball roll toward the cup.</p>
<p>“What a shot,” was all Casey could say. “Nothing you can do but tip you cap to that. Collin had taken on that challenge and pulled it off. That’s what champions do.”</p>
<p>Golf’s latest major champion was still in the vicinity of Harding Park just over a year ago, finishing up his degree at California and his All-American career, part of a new cast of young stars in a sport filled with them.</p>
<p>He only played Harding Park about a dozen times while in college, but never set up with rough like this or with the tees all the way back.</p>
<p>Now he has three PGA Tour victories and is No. 5 in the world, taking his place among the young stars by beating a cast of world-class players on the public course in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“Those are moments I’m always going to remember,” said Morikawa, who became the sixth player to capture this major before turning 24.</p>
<p>For Johnson, it was another major that got away. He had a one-shot lead and didn’t do too much wrong on the day except for not keeping it in the fairway for better chances of birdie. He drove into the hazard on the 16th and chipped in for birdie when it was too late, and a birdie on the 18th gave him a tie for second.</p>
<p>It was his fifth runner-up finish in a major — his only title is the 2016 U.S. Open — and his second straight runner-up in the PGA Championship.</p>
<p>Brooks Koepka proved to be all talk. He looked at the crowded leaderboard on Saturday night and didn’t see anyone with his experience of four major championships, even dishing on Johnson because he has “only won one.”</p>
<p>Koepka didn’t make a birdie until the 12th hole. He went from two shots behind to a 74, tying for 29th.</p>
<p>“It’s my first bad round in a major in a while,” said Koepka, who said he spent the back nine mostly trying to cheer on Casey and his bid to win a first major at age 43.</p>
<p>Youth rules these days.</p>
<p>Morikawa finished at 13-under 267, and left so many others wondering how close they came.</p>
<p>Matthew Wolff, who grew up with Morikawa in Southern California and turned pro last summer with him, shot a 65 and joined Jason Day, Bryson DeChambeau, Tony Finau and PGA Tour rookie Scottie Scheffler at 10-under 270.</p>
<p>Cameron Champ, among eight players who had a share of the lead at some point, lost momentum with a double bogey at the turn. DeChambeau dropped two shots at the turn and never caught up until it was too late.</p>
<p>Morikawa, in only his 28th start as a pro and his second major, played bogey-free. His only mistake was at the end, when it was time to hoist the Wanamaker Trophy, the heaviest of the four major trophies. The lid came off and tumbled to the grass as Morikawa’s eyes bulged.</p>
<p>If that was his only mistake, consider it a successful day. A major success.
