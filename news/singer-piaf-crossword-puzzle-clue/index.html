<p>TUESDAY PUZZLE — Maybe you solve your crossword puzzles and then just go about your day, but I am a highly suggestible person and find that all sorts of things bubble up for me as I fill in the squares. And they tend to stay with me.</p>
<p>This is how I wound up sitting my kids down on the couch and subjecting them to a Mel Brooks movie marathon, beginning with “Blazing Saddles.&rdquo; It didn’t matter to me that they had already seen many of them (I consider it my duty as a parent to expose my children to only the finest of culture so that they would grow the highest brows possible), it only mattered that they watch them again. This is a weird timeline that we are all living through, and a Mel Brooks movie marathon is an excellent way to regain one’s perspective.</p>
<p>Anyway. The thing that triggered this bout of mandatory family fun was Joel Fagliano’s puzzle, which made me think of this scene:

MONDAY PUZZLE — This puzzle by Brad Wilber was delightfully unexpected for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that Mr. Wilber has primarily been a late week puzzle maker, offering some of the toughest puzzles in the New York Times Crossword archive.</p>
<p>Second, the theme surprised me because it came from a man. And before anyone says anything about that: It’s not so much that a man wouldn’t know about this topic, but I just assumed that it wouldn’t be top of mind for him. Then I remembered that there is a version of the object in the theme that is targeted to the men’s market, so maybe that’s what Mr. Wilber was thinking about. Kudos to him for including theme entries that any gender might carry.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>5A: I can’t believe I’m saying this, but hi, kids! “TAXI” was a sitcom that ran on NBC and ABC from 1978 to 1983. It was memorable not only because it was hysterically funny, but also because it began the careers of quite a few people, Danny DeVito included. If the man in this scene looks familiar, that’s because the character was played by Christopher Lloyd, who also played — among other roles — “Doc” Emmett L. Brown in the “Back to the Future” movies.

The California-based producers Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, who work together as the Kitchen Sisters, have been producing immersive, beautifully observed, historically relevant stories for public radio since 1979. Their style is both distinctive and invisible: rich in audio delights but minimally hosted, narrated largely by interviewees. “The Kitchen Sisters Present,” from Radiotopia, is a treasure trove of the duo’s recent and earlier work. “Waiting for Joe DiMaggio,” from 1993, about the retired ballplayer’s attempt to visit the Sicilian village of his family’s origin, tells a quiet story that amazes, as does “Tupperware,” an influential early piece, from 1980, that takes us to—and far beyond—a Tupperware party. Other classic episodes feature Studs Terkel’s “Working” interviews; Charles Aznavour reminiscing about nights with Edith Piaf; and, in “Shirley,” a Vietnamese-American nail salon and the legacy of Shirley Temple. For quarantined listeners wistful for another New York, the 2001-02 “Sonic Memorial” series, about the World Trade Center area, and a recent foray into the New York Public Library’s Lou Reed Archive are particularly striking, warm, and powerful.

<h3 id="rufus-and-martha-wainwright-review--quirky-magnificent-festive-blowout">&ldquo;Rufus and Martha Wainwright review – quirky, magnificent festive blowout&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbeb477f36e84963c47299785e366ed424875c0b/991_134_2904_1742/master/2904.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=d1ebe5ec13374675a646d377d5753895" alt="img">
Royal Festival Hall, London Chrissie Hynde, Neil Tennant and Sophie Ellis-Bextor joyously topped up the Wainwright siblings’ big-hearted Christmas fundraiser, A Not So Silent Night</p>
<p>Christmas with the extended family can be an ordeal. After too many days in close proximity to rarely encountered aunts or cousins, the Yuletide season’s compulsory mood of forced jollity can switch to listless ennui or murderous rage.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Wainwright family’s festive musical shindig, usually held in Canada or New York, is quite a tradition. Rufus and Martha last threw a Christmas party in London 10 years ago, six weeks before the death from cancer of their folk-icon mother, Kate McGarrigle. To mark the anniversary, this show is a benefit to raise funds to provide music-therapy resources for cancer patients.</p>
<p>The Wainwrights make for well-heeled but idiosyncratic Xmas hosts, despite their own history of family dysfunction. Between twinkling Christmas trees, the many family members and their party guests take turns to perform then loll on plush red sofas on a set resembling a lavishly appointed country-house sitting room.</p>
<p>Martha and her sister Lucy Wainwright Roche kick off the festivities, turning Jackson Browne’s The Rebel Jesus into a soft Irish air. It’s charming – as is Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s reshaping of O Little Town of Bethlehem into immaculately enunciated lounge jazz, backed by numerous Wainwright siblings and cousins.</p>

<p>Splendid in a specially grown Santa beard, Rufus duets What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve? with Ed Harcourt, complete with a sub-Strictly waltz, like a high-camp modern take on the Rat Pack. Neil Tennant and Martha imbue McGarrigle’s I Cried for Us, long covered by Pet Shop Boys, with fervent yearning, despite Tennant’s career-long habit of singing through his nose.</p>
<p>Guy Garvey joins Rufus for a sumptuous croon through In the Bleak Midwinter before Martha trills Trois Anges, in French, like a Yuletide Piaf merry on sweet sherry. Duetting with Rufus on Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Chrissie Hynde’s voice is, as ever, a sultry throb.</p>
<p>It’s all a very warm, big-hearted celebration. Rufus’s husband, Jörn Weisbrodt, unleashes a surprisingly powerful, Lee Marvin-like basso profundo on White Christmas and Heilige Nacht. Not to be outdone, opera soprano Janis Kelly crafts an epic gothic take on Burl Ives’s Silver and Gold.</p>
<p>With Rufus’s barbed wit largely sheathed tonight, it’s Martha who is the life and soul of the party, giddily exuberant on the Waitresses’ 1981 fun-punk romp Christmas Wrapping, and turning trad folk song Mary Had a Baby into racked blues. Her brother’s microphone-free, a cappella rendition of Minuit, Chretiéns/O Holy Night is captivating.</p>

<p>After Chrissie Hynde drawls 2000 Miles, sounding like Christmas incarnate, the entire company gather for a nicely shambolic roister through John and Yoko’s Happy Xmas (War is Over). The encore brings a delicate rendering by the three Wainwright siblings of Proserpina, the last song written by McGarrigle before her death.</p>
<p>The evening ends as all Christmas shows should. “This is a song about alcoholics from Galway,” notes the reliably waspish Rufus, before he and Martha lead an ensemble romp through the Pogues’ Fairytale of New York. It’s been a magnificent Christmas bash: a night of joyous depths and shallows.</p>
<p>• This article was amended on 8 December 2019 to correct a misspelling of the song Proserpina and to remove the claim that Kate McGarrigle was Lucy Wainwright Roche’s mother.

<h3 id="charles-aznavour-i-wanted-to-break-every-taboo">&ldquo;Charles Aznavour: &lsquo;I wanted to break every taboo&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>

Charles Aznavour, one of the greatest singer-songwriters France has ever known, sits in a velvet armchair a few days before his 91st birthday, discussing the whiff of ladies’ armpits.</p>
<p>A song on his new album, in which he declares, “I love the smell of your underarms,” worried his Swedish wife of 50 years, but Aznavour knows his audience. If he’s the most successful French crooner in the world – a lyricist who defined the country’s popular culture for decades – it’s precisely because his songs have always been risky.</p>
<p>When Aznavour began writing in the 1940s, sex was something that happened with the light off. It was OK for women singers to howl over their broken hearts, but men didn’t sing about their own emotional despair – and later their dodgy prostates. Aznavour shone a spotlight on masculinity and libido, singing about depression, sex, prejudice and rape. His hits ranged from the 1970s story of a gay transvestite in What Makes a Man, to the once-banned ballad of muggy, post-coital exhaustion, Après l’Amour, and the controversial You’ve Let Yourself Go – the plea of a man whose wife has grown dowdy and fat (“I gaze at you in sheer despair and see your mother standing there”).</p>

<p>He is unrepentant. “It’s a kind of sickness I have, talking about things you’re not supposed to talk about. I started with homosexuality and I wanted to break every taboo.” The armpit line comes in a new ballad about a blind lover’s sense of smell. “When I wrote a song about the deaf [Quiet Love], I learned sign-language to perform it on stage. On this album, I wanted to describe what it was like for someone non-sighted.” He pauses. “I still don’t know how I’m going to perform it …” In his shows, he takes on various personas with dramatic gestures that resemble a mime act. He’s an actor who sings rather than a Frank Sinatra-style singer who acts.</p>
<p>Aznavour is still composing and performing, he’s written around 1,200 songs and sold more than 100m records in his 70-year career. France worships him as the last living legend of a golden era. Like many popular singers who came to represent the very essence of France – such as Georges Moustaki and, to a certain extent, Edith Piaf herself – Aznavour is shaped by his foreign roots. Born Shahnour Varenagh Aznavourian in Paris to an actor-father and singer-mother who had fled the Armenian genocide, he left school and became a child actor at the age of nine. He survived the German occupation of Paris singing in cabarets, while his parents hid fellow Armenians, Jews, Russians and Communists in their apartment and his father joined the resistance.</p>
<p>Piaf pestered him to have a nose job. Afterwards he presented himself for inspection. &lsquo;I preferred you before,&rsquo; she said</p>
<p>But Aznavour’s path to success was long and torturous. French critics dismissed him as repulsively ugly, too short, with a terrible voice and dubious song titles. It wasn’t until the end of the 50s, a decade after Piaf had taken him on as her songwriter, flatmate and all-round bag-carrier that he finally began to make it. In 1960, he played the shy and haunted piano-player in François Truffaut’s classic New Wave film, Shoot the Piano Player (he went on to act in over 60 films). But his global singing fame was cemented in the 70s with a triumphant crossover into the US and UK – something he puts down to the excellent translation of his lyrics into English. (The bittersweet British No 1, She, is hardly known in France). Britain was seduced by this scrawny Frenchman crooning about painful crushes in a 10-ton accent. “I often say: ‘France is for lyrics, England is for music’,” he muses.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Aznavour is a “dinosaur” – his word – who trades on agelessness. His 51st studio album is out in the UK now and he is working on his 52nd. He loves being sampled by adoring French rappers. He relishes the irony that at 30 he was considered ugly, but past 90 he is now seen as dashing. What it’s like being 91? “I wouldn’t have a clue,” he says, wide-eyed. “I don’t feel 91. I’ve always thought a person must never lose the gaze of a child.” At 5-foot-3, he holds his tiny frame perpetually taut (keeping his shoulders straight is one his secrets of eternal youth). But he’s brutally honest about performing on stage. “I hide nothing from the audience,” he says. He tells them he has an Auto-cue because his memory is fading, and says his mouth ulcers make it hard to sing. He relies on hearing aids. But he loathes what he calls the show-business “cult of youth”.</p>
<p>“More and more men are changing themselves, having surgery, and you can see it on TV, because their dyed-black hair turns blue under the lights,” he says. “I had a problem with my nose, I got it done. I made some white hair that was falling out grow back. But I left my wrinkles where they are. And I look younger than the others because I have never retouched nature’s work.”</p>

<p>In fact, it was Edith Piaf cabaret superstar and queen of chanson française, who forced Aznavour to have a nose job 50 years ago. She pestered him for months to fix what she deemed his too-large hooter. He eventually went under the knife, and presented himself for inspection. “I preferred you before,” she said.</p>
<p>There’s a song about Piaf on the new album. It is the first time he has written about her, though they lived together – platonically – for eight years. “We were like cousins. We had this extraordinary complicity. I never had a love affair with her – that’s what saved us.” Why did Piaf, the star, latch on to him, an unknown nine years her junior? “I brought her my youth, my madness, she loved my whole jazzy side.”</p>
<p>I can’t say anything about [Kim Kardashian], because I would anger half the Armenians.</p>
<p>His other main role today is as one of the world’s most famous Armenians. He has finally taken dual Armenian citizenship, is Armenian ambassador to Switzerland and travelled with the French president François Hollande to mark the centenary of the Armenian genocide this year. But France still defines his identity. “I’ve always felt totally French. That really vexed the Armenians in Armenia, but now they’re used to it.” He politely declines to say what he thinks about his challenger as pop culture’s international symbol of the Armenian diaspora: Kim Kardashian. He’s never met her. Does he watch her reality show? “I can’t say anything about it, because I would anger half the Armenians.” He laughs nervously. “I suppose Armenians are quite prudish and don’t like too much nudity …”</p>

<p>A few years ago, he caused shockwaves in France by saying he’d paid backhanders to figures on all sides of the political spectrum after being told he was facing a tax inspection, presumed to have been in the 1970s. A later tax investigation found no irregularity. Decades ago, he left France to live just over the border in Switzerland. “I was never a tax exile,” he is at pains to point out. “I didn’t have a penny when I left.”</p>
<p>The phrase Aznavour probably hates the most is “farewell tour”. He swears he has never uttered the words, and vows to keep performing until he dies.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to learn to leave the table when love is no longer being served,” he once crooned. But with audiences still dishing up a never-ending pot of it, he’s happy to stick around.

50. Lloyd Cole and the Commotions</p>
<p>Lost Weekend (1985)</p>
<p>Poor old Lloyd went to Amsterdam and all he got was double pneumonia in a single room. And, by the sounds of it, his love life is going horribly wrong. Just don’t ask him about the price of medicine (obviously he didn’t get his European health insurance card). It’s enough to make anyone go No Deal, really.</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>Peter Hammill</li>
</ol>
<p>German Overalls (1973)</p>
<p>More continental misery from the never knowingly cheerful Peter Hammill, who’s on tour in Germany and not enjoying it. At all. In Mannheim, “on a rainy Saturday with no money nor friend / Only tequila can end the boredom”. Worse still, he can only find old copies of the Sunday Times to read. Well, it was 1973.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Freddie Mercury And Montserrat Caballe in Ibiza, 1987.</p>

<ol start="48">
<li>Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé</li>
</ol>
<p>Barcelona (1988)</p>
<p>You might think it a silly piece of fluff (and so might I), but the Spanish newspaper El País calls Barcelona “iconic … a musical masterpiece”. The pairing of the Queen singer and the Spanish opera star certainly created a wedding cake of a song. And as all visitors to Barcelona now observe: “Such a beautiful horizon.”</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>Teleman</li>
</ol>
<p>Düsseldorf (2016)</p>
<p>One of the greatest entries in the folder labelled “indie bands who’ve listened to Neu!” comes from the London quartet who cleverly matched the motorik to a song in which Thomas Sanders bewails the fact that “the girl from Düsseldorf has gone”. It doesn’t quite sound like a motorway, more like the racket of a really great motorway services.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li>Peggy Lee</li>
</ol>
<p>Autumn in Rome (1964)</p>
<p>It could perhaps do without the chirruping birds (aren’t they more of a springtime thing, anyway?), but once Peggy Lee starts singing – that smoky voice deployed with perfect restraint – you can forgive them. It helps that Paul Weston and Alessandro Cicognini had concocted the perfect piece of musical melancholia to go with Sammy Cahn’s lyric.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>Jason Isbell Stockholm (2013)</li>
</ol>
<p>Another one from the on-the-road files, though Isbell isn’t as miserable as Peter Hamill was, not least because Stockholm is evidently quite nice, what with “ships in the harbour and birds on the bluff”. The problem is that he’s fallen in love back home, and he just wants to get back there. Poor love.</p>
<ol start="44">
<li>John Cale</li>
</ol>
<p>Paris 1919 (1973)</p>
<p>Take the placing with a pinch of salt; this is a great song. But there are two problems: first, there are so many great songs about Paris that there’s a risk of bunching them at the top; second, if Cale hadn’t explained it was about the treaty of Versailles, no one would have a clue what it was about.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>The Clash</li>
</ol>
<p>Spanish Bombs (1979)</p>
<p>I can take or leave the Clash’s revolutionary sloganeering, but Mick Jones didn’t half know his way round a tune. The linkage between the fighters of the Spanish civil war, English package tourists in the late 70s and ETA bombing campaigns doesn’t make a lot of sense, but then the Clash often didn’t make a lot of sense.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Fleet Foxes</li>
</ol>
<p>Mykonos (2008)</p>
<p>The second most seductive portrayal of a Greek island (after Gerald Durrell’s My Family and Other Animals) came from some Seattle longhairs half in thrall to the Beach Boys and half to folk music. Their version of Mykonos doesn’t sound much like the one of “pumping clubs, bars open until dawn” that Expedia offers.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paris Sous Les Bombes … Suprême NTM in Marseille, 1998. Photograph: Sipa/REX/Shutterstock</p>
<ol start="41">
<li>Suprême NTM</li>
</ol>
<p>Paris Sous Les Bombes (1995)</p>
<p>A landmark in Parisian hip-hop, Suprême NTM’s vision of Paris is not one of pavement cafes, chic boutiques and grand boulevards. It’s an ineffably creepy overview of their own Paris – one of graffiti crews and grim suburbs. More La Haine than Amélie.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Mieczysław Fogg</li>
</ol>
<p>Piosenka o Mojej Warszawie (1944)</p>
<p>A pre-war star, Fogg stayed in Warsaw throughout the second world war, where he played concerts to raise the morale of the Poles and hid a Jewish family in his apartment. This postwar song declares his love for the city: “I know that you’re not yourself today / That you survived bloody days.”</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Parquet Courts</li>
</ol>
<p>Berlin Got Blurry (2016)</p>
<p>A rather different set of concerns occupied the minds of Parquet Courts on their visit to central Europe, on a song that sounds as blurry as the title suggests, as if everything has just taken too much effort. “Funny how it charms you, that Teutonic frankness,” they sing, a line that would have horrified Mieczysław Fogg.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>The Beautiful South</li>
</ol>
<p>Rotterdam (Or Anywhere) (1996)</p>
<p>When life is desperate, it doesn’t matter where you are in Europe: “The whole place is pickled / The people are pickles for sure.” Rotterdam becomes indistinguishable from Liverpool or Rome because loneliness feels the same in any surroundings.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>AC/DC</li>
</ol>
<p>Bedlam in Belgium (1983)</p>
<p>If you can show me a better song about crowd bedlam at a heavy rock festival in Belgium – indeed, any of the low countries – I’d like to see it. AC/DC have recorded 23 songs in which the word “rock” or one of its derivatives appears in the title, but only one in which either “Bedlam” or “Belgium” appear. This is a collector’s item.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Jens Lekman</li>
</ol>
<p>Wedding in Finistère (2017)</p>
<p>So many Jens Lekman songs take place in specific European locations – from anti-capitalist riots in Gothenburg, to having to pretend in Berlin that he’s going out with his friend Nina so her dad doesn’t guess she’s gay. This account of playing a wedding in Finistère and watching the kids is one of the loveliest.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Bouga</li>
</ol>
<p>Belsunce Breakdown (2000)</p>
<p>Marseille has its own hip-hop culture, distinct from the Parisian one – less angry, despite it being France’s most dangerous city. Belsunce Breakdown is a sketch of a neighbourhood from the rapper Bouga, with music supplied by IAM, the originators of Marseillaise hip-hop (more from them later).</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Rammstein</li>
</ol>
<p>Deutschland (2019)</p>
<p>The latest single from the German band for whom no gesture is too overstated is just as berserk as you might expect. And just as uncomfortable – what with its references to a Germany that is “über alles” and video featuring one member in Nazi uniform. Though, to be fair, he does get shot by a concentration camp prisoner. So we think they’re on the right side.</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers</li>
</ol>
<p>Give Paris One More Chance (2001)</p>
<p>A change of mood with Jonathan Richman, who is intensely concerned that you really didn’t make enough effort to fall in love when you were in Paris: “Maybe your heart needs a telegram from up above / If you don’t think Paris was made for love.”</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Amália Rodrigues</li>
</ol>
<p>Cheira Bem Cheira a Lisboa (2008)</p>
<p>Why do so few songs about cities talk about the smells – the good ones, rather than the drains and traffic fumes? Here, the queen of fado is exploring her city through scent – the rosemary, the wine, a carnation, strong coffee and roasted chestnuts. As the title says: smells good, smells like Lisbon.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci</li>
</ol>
<p>Spanish Dance Troupe (1999)</p>
<p>“My conclusion this summer / Was there was much too much rain / So I ran off on Thursday / With a dance troupe from Spain,” sings Euros Childs, a sentiment that seems completely reasonable. This 1999 single is perfect: not a second wasted and the burst into the Iberian-flavoured trumpet break is a glass of cold white rioja for the ears.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paris is Burning … St Vincent in Chicago, 2018. Photograph: Timothy Hiatt/WireImage</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>St Vincent</li>
</ol>
<p>Paris is Burning (2007)</p>
<p>From 2007, when she was still St Vincent, rather than the Famous And Revolutionary St Vincent – which proves only that brilliance doesn’t always get noticed immediately. It’s the end of the second world war in Paris and an American soldier is not finding any romance in the city: “We are dancing a black waltz / Fair Paris is burning after all.”</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>The Associates</li>
</ol>
<p>White Car in Germany (1982)</p>
<p>The early 80s was British pop’s Mitteleuropa period. Possession of synthesisers and raincoats led a generation of musicians to believe they were consumed by Germanic angst and embodying cold-war paranoia. With some of them, including the Associates, it worked.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Regina Spektor</li>
</ol>
<p>Düsseldorf (2006)</p>
<p>Regina Spektor escapes sounding like a musical gap-year postcard in her European travelogue, thanks to her exuberant delight at her surroundings and her self awareness. It might have been the tulips and canals that made her crazy in Amsterdam, “or it might have been all that hash”.</p>
<ol start="27">
<li>Robert Wyatt</li>
</ol>
<p>A Sunday in Madrid (1997)</p>
<p>It sounds like a Sunday; lazy and meandering. And it reads like magical realism, as the Spanish capital shuffles past in a haze of imagery: “Elsewhere, bare buttocks wait their turn in vain. No guides available. All busy in the Prado.”</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>IAM</li>
</ol>
<p>Je Danse le Mia (1993)</p>
<p>Back to Marseille, for a breakthrough hit from 1993. Watch the video – directed by Michel Gondry – rather than just listening to the song (unless your French is fluent). It’s a portrait of Marseillaise jack-the-lads and it’s hard not to think this is what a French Del Boy would be like.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Django Reinhardt</li>
</ol>
<p>Echos de France (1947)</p>
<p>A violin picks out La Marseillaise, and the king of gypsy jazz cuts it off with a flourish of notes, before resuming the melody, then taking it across several borders. Reinhardt is as much a key voice of French music as his fellow Belgian, Jacques Brel.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Tangerine Dream</li>
</ol>
<p>Poland (1984)</p>
<p>Late in 1983, the German synth rock pioneers crossed into Poland for six shows, recording them and releasing a double album. Poland, recorded live in Warsaw, was suitably icy and ascetic, but filled with hope, too.</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>U2</li>
</ol>
<p>Zoo Station (1991)</p>
<p>In which U2 got out their Build Your Own Bowie kit and headed over to Hansa Studios to make Achtung Baby. It’s easy to mock – fun, too – but U2 created something extraordinary, even if Bono’s claims about it being a metaphor for German reunification are a bit “You what, mate?”</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Scott Walker</li>
</ol>
<p>Copenhagen (1969)</p>
<p>The American who was more European than the Europeans paid tribute to the Danish capital on Scott 3: “Copenhagen, you’re the end / Gone and made me a child again.” Might not have been as effective had it been entitled Basingstoke.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>The Divine Comedy</li>
</ol>
<p>Sweden (1998)</p>
<p>In effect, Scott Walker with a sense of humour. Neil Hannon wants to go and live among the “tall and strong and blonde and blue eyed / Pure and healthy, very wealthy”. The likes, he explains, of “Ingmar Bergman, Henrik Ibsen, Karin Larsson, Nina Persson”. Wouldn’t we all?</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>David Bowie</li>
</ol>
<p>Where Are We Now? (2013)</p>
<p>Bowie’s 2013 comeback single gained its power not so much from the melody as from revisiting his old Berlin haunts. When someone so resistant to nostalgia seemed to want to cast an eye over his past, it had meaning greater than old holiday snaps.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ibiza … The Prodigy live at the Isle of Wight, 2015.</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>The Prodigy</li>
</ol>
<p>Ibiza (2015)</p>
<p>Sleaford Mods join the Prodigy for a night out. It doesn’t sound like fun. The music is a pneumatic drill, the lyrics a stream of scabrousness: “Plug it in, pre-mixed, all bought in / It’s all about the gear / Bleached-hair wanking mates / Just flown in on the Lear.”</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Ute Lemper</li>
</ol>
<p>Streets of Berlin (2000)</p>
<p>Originally sung by Mick Jagger in the 1997 movie adaptation of Martin Sherman’s play Bent, but Lemper’s version is rather better: you might expect a Kurt Weill specialist to wring rather more out of a lyric about Berlin in the 1930s than Jagger, and so it proves.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Etienne Daho</li>
</ol>
<p>Week-end à Rome (1984)</p>
<p>The chassis for Saint Etienne’s He’s on the Phone, Daho’s electropop wisp sounds as optimistic as the first coffee of the morning, with the heat not yet settled over the city. You can cram a lifetime into a weekend, after all.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>The Pogues</li>
</ol>
<p>The Broad Majestic Shannon (1988)</p>
<p>Shane MacGowan was, more than anything, a London songwriter who took excursions. On the third Pogues album he went over to the west of Ireland for one of those bruised, romantic pieces of confected nostalgia he managed to make sound true.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Edith Piaf</li>
</ol>
<p>L’Homme de Berlin (1963)</p>
<p>Don’t talk of Berlin, because it is nothing to Edith Piaf. Or perhaps it’s everything. Even under the dirty Berlin sky, she found an eternity in a moment with one man. And then, because she’s Edith Piaf and she doesn’t live happily ever after, it ends.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Low</li>
</ol>
<p>Just Like Christmas (2004)</p>
<p>More commonly found on lists of great Christmas songs, but really it’s the greatest on-tour-in-Europe song, right from the awry, distorted musical backing, which sounds like extreme fatigue. It’s snowing in Scandinavia and it’s the oddness, not joy, that makes it feel like Christmas.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>The Fall</li>
</ol>
<p>Bremen Nacht (1988)</p>
<p>Mark E Smith makes feeling ill at a gig in a German college sound like the worst case of paranoia. He later suggested his maladies were caused by the ghosts of Nazis who had died in the allied bombing of the city.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Neutral Milk Hotel</li>
</ol>
<p>Holland, 1945 (1998)</p>
<p>The strangest, most joyful meditation on the Holocaust and the death of Anne Frank: the only song to describe a girl being buried alive that makes you want to throw your hands in the air and sing along. It never sounds unremarkable.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>The Sex Pistols</li>
</ol>
<p>Holidays in the Sun (1977)</p>
<p>From the opening borrowing of the situationist slogan about Club Med (“A cheap holiday in other people’s misery”), Holidays in the Sun is a deep dive into horror, though John Lydon actually enjoyed Berlin: “I loved the wall and the insanity of the placing.”</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Joni Mitchell</li>
</ol>
<p>Free Man in Paris (1974)</p>
<p>Paris as symbol of liberation (part one): Joni Mitchell imagines being David Geffen, escaping from California to somewhere he can be an out gay man rather than just a record company machine: “I was a free man in Paris / I felt unfettered and alive / Nobody calling me up for favours / No one’s future to decide.”</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest I’ve Seen That Face Before … Grace Jones, 1981.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Jacques Brel</li>
</ol>
<p>Amsterdam (1964)</p>
<p>Such a persuasive song that both David Bowie and Scott Walker would cover it. Jacques Brel slowly peels back the layers of the port, getting seamier each time, from the sailor singing of the sea, until we reach “the whores of Amsterdam … their virtue long gone / For a few dirty coins”.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Roxy Music</li>
</ol>
<p>A Song for Europe (1973)</p>
<p>One side has won out now, but there was a time that Bryan Ferry embodied so many cross-cutting personalities: the English gentleman; the fashion dandy; the continental sophisticate. The latter sings this one, yet he also sounds adrift, unanchored.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Jay Z and Kanye West</li>
</ol>
<p>Niggas in Paris (2011)</p>
<p>Paris as symbol of liberation (part two): From Josephine Baker onwards, Paris became a place where black American artists could find freedom. Kanye West embraced the city and he and Jay Z turned their experiences there into a triumphalist centrepiece of the Watch the Throne tour.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Grace Jones</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango) (1981)</p>
<p>What an extraordinary record: tango, reggae and chanson wrapped up in one, and Grace Jones singing about the man she sees on every street corner in Paris: “Like a hawk stealing for the prey / Like the night waiting for the day.” A reminder that the darkness is not necessarily a time for freedom.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Lou Reed</li>
</ol>
<p>Berlin (1973)</p>
<p>You can have either the Berlin album version, or the one from Reed’s first solo album. That’s the one I prefer, largely because you know it doesn’t prefigure what sounds like a suicide note set to music, which rather changes the context in which you hear it.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest I love Paris … Ella Fitzgerald on the Frank Sinatra Show, 1958. Photograph: ABC Photo Archives/Getty Images</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Ella Fitzgerald</li>
</ol>
<p>I Love Paris (1956)</p>
<p>Oh, Cole Porter! When you pair one of the greatest writers of all with one of the greatest singers of all, you do tend to get something approaching perfection. So it goes with Ella, who loves Paris both in winter (“when it drizzles”) and in summer (“when it sizzles”). So why does the song sound so sad?</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vienna … Ultravox’s defining song of European identity for a generation of Britons, 1980.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Ultravox</li>
</ol>
<p>Vienna (1980)</p>
<p>It is, clearly, complete nonsense. It is also, clearly, nothing to do with Vienna. But there is a generation of Britons for whom this is the defining song of European identity, although that’s largely down to the video, which brought the aesthetics of The Third Man to provincial shopping centres.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Randy Newman</li>
</ol>
<p>In Germany Before the War (1977)</p>
<p>An extraordinary song, sombre and foreboding, alluding to both a serial child murderer in Düsseldorf in the early 1930s and to the rise of nazism. Its very restraint makes it all the more chilling, before the ghastly final lines: “We lie beneath the autumn sky / My little golden girl and I / And she lies very still.”</p>
<ol>
<li>Kraftwerk</li>
</ol>
<p>Trans Europe Express (1977)</p>
<p>In the past, the future looked thrilling. Kraftwerk signalled the way towards it, both musically and lyrically. Trans Europe Express was to be one of the most important pieces of electronic music ever made: its central motif became the spine of Afrika Bambaata’s Planet Rock; its Mitteleuropean chilliness was the model for those Brits in raincoats. But what seems most appealing is its vision of a Europe open to all, where you can rendezvous on Champs-Élysées, go to a late-night cafe in Vienna, then return to Düsseldorf to meet David Bowie and Iggy Pop. The same 1977 album also offered the hymn to “parks, hotels and palaces / Europe endless”. Oh, for the possibilities!
