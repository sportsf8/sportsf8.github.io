<p>Now that it is part of a Saturday-Sunday doubleheader, the start time for the second NASCAR Cup Series race at Michigan International Speedway this season is a little later than planned even though it will play out on the originally scheduled date. It&rsquo;s another example of a TV network (in this case, NBCSN) pushing NASCAR for a later afternoon viewing window.</p>
<p>Due to the same coronavirus pandemic-related issues that shut down live sports in March, NASCAR created a modified schedule of races for May, June, July and August that continues today at 4:30 p.m. ET at the two-mile oval located in Brooklyn, Mi. Sunday&rsquo;s Consumers Energy 400 is the fifth NASCAR Cup Series race to be shown on NBCSN this season.</p>
<p>Scheduled to take the green flag shortly after 4:30 p.m. ET, Sunday&rsquo;s race at Michigan is the same distance as Saturday&rsquo;s race — 156 laps for a total of 312 miles.</p>
<p>Below is all you need to know about the schedule for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR race at Michigan and beyond.</p>
<p>MORE: Watch today&rsquo;s NASCAR race live with fuboTV (7-day free trial)</p>
<p>What time does the NASCAR race start today?</p>
<dl>
<dt>Race : Consumers Energy 400 at Michigan International Speedway</dt>
<dd>
<p>Consumers Energy 400 at Michigan International Speedway Date : Sunday, Aug. 9</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Sunday, Aug. 9 Start time: 4:30 p.m. ET</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The green flag for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR Cup Series race at Michigan will wave shortly after 4:30 p.m. ET, assuming there are no rain delays as there have been so often since NASCAR returned to live racing in May.</p>
<p>Though NASCAR will have plenty of time to get the race in with the sun not setting in Brooklyn, Mi., until almost 9 p.m. ET, the relatively late start time for an afternoon race is notable because Michigan International Speedway does not have lights.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s race is scheduled for the same distance as Saturday&rsquo;s race — 156 laps around the two-mile oval for a total of 312 miles.</p>
<p>What channel is NASCAR on today?</p>
<dl>
<dt>TV channel : NBCSN</dt>
<dd>
<p>NBCSN Live stream: NBC Sports Go | fuboTV (7-day free trial)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>NBCSN is the TV channel for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR race at Michigan as originally scheduled even though it&rsquo;s now the second leg of a doubleheader. Of the 20 NASCAR Cup Series races NBC will broadcast in 2020, 12 were scheduled to be shown on NBCSN with the other eight on NBC&rsquo;s flagship cable network.</p>
<p>As for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR Cup Series race on NBCSN, the network has a channel finder feature for viewers to find the TV channel options in their areas.</p>
<p>As is the case for all the Cup Series races on NBC and NBCSN this season, Rick Allen will call the race with the assistance of analysts Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Burton and Steve Letarte.</p>
<p>NASCAR live stream for Michigan race</p>
<p>Anybody who has a cable or satellite subscription can stream Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR race at Michigan live via NBCSports.com or the NBC Sports app. This should be the preferred route for a viewer who has such a subscription but isn&rsquo;t able to get in front of his or her TV.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t have a cable or satellite subscription, there are five OTT TV streaming options that carry NBC and NBCSN — Sling, Hulu, YouTubeTV, fuboTV and AT&amp;T Now. Of the five, Hulu, YouTubeTV and fuboTV offer free trial options.</p>
<p>Below are links to each.</p>
<p>NASCAR schedule 2020</p>
<p>NASCAR on July 8 released its latest revised Cup Series schedule through August of 2020. It remains committed to running 36 races, four of which were completed before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the sports world. NASCAR hopes to keep its 10 playoff races in the fall intact and at their original tracks.</p>
<p>Below is the schedule revision for the Cup Series regular season, starting with the races at Darlington the Cup Series ran in its return in May.</p>
<p>Date Track TV channel Start time Sun., May 17 Darlington FOX 3:30 p.m. ET Wed., May 20 Darlington FS1 7:30 p.m. ET Sun., May 24 Charlotte FOX 6 p.m. ET Wed., May 27 Charlotte FS1 8 p.m. ET Sun, May 31 Bristol FS1 3:30 p.m. ET Sun, June 7 Atlanta FOX 3 p.m. ET Wed, June 10 Martinsville FS1 7 p.m. ET Sun, June 14 Homestead-Miami FOX 3:30 p.m. ET Sun, June 21 Talladega FOX 3 p.m. ET Sat., June 27 Pocono FOX 3:30 p.m. ET Sun., June 28 Pocono FS1 4 p.m. ET Sun., July 5 Indianapolis NBC 4 p.m. ET Sun., July 12 Kentucky FS1 2:30 p.m. ET Wed., July 15 Bristol (All-Star Race) FS1 8:30 p.m. ET Sun., July 19 Texas NBCSN 3 p.m. ET Thurs., July 23 Kansas NBCSN 7:30 p.m. ET Sun., Aug. 2 New Hampshire NBCSN 3 p.m. ET Sat., Aug. 8 Michigan NBCSN 4 p.m. ET Sun., Aug. 9 Michigan NBCSN 4:30 p.m. ET Sun., Aug. 16 Daytona (road course) NBC 3 p.m. ET Sat., Aug. 22 Dover NBCSN 4 p.m. ET Sun. Aug. 23 Dover NBCSN 4 p.m. ET Sat., Aug. 29 Daytona NBC 7:30 p.m. ET</p>
<p>The Darlington race on May 17 ran instead of the the Chicagoland race that was originally scheduled for June 21. The Darlington race on May 20 ran instead of the postponed Richmond race that was originally scheduled for April 19. The Charlotte race on May 27 ran instead of the Sonoma race that was originally scheduled for June 14.</p>
<p>The Pocono doubleheader remained as previously scheduled for the final weekend of June, with the Cup Series racing on back-to-back days. Those races were presented on Fox (and FS1) rather than on NBC. Fox closed its coverage this season with the All-Star Race at Bristol on July 15.</p>
<p>The previously postponed races at Dover and Michigan are now part of Saturday-Sunday doubleheaders at those respective tracks in August.</p>
<p>Because New York requires people to quarantine for 14 days after traveling from one of the states impacted heavily by COVID-19 (including North Carolina), the Watkins Glen race on Aug. 16 was moved to the Daytona road course. According to The Athletic, NASCAR tried to get a quarantine waiver for its Watkins Glen races but was denied by Gov. Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The Aug. 16 race will be the NASCAR Cup Series&rsquo; first on the road course at Daytona.

In ways both literally and figuratively the NASCAR Cup Series field saw red most of Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Kevin Harvick&rsquo;s red No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford was out front the majority of the afternoon — leading a race-best 92 of the 161 laps — but five restarts in the final 30 laps, including an overtime finish, forced Harvick, &ldquo;The Closer,&rdquo; to close out the win.</p>
<p>NASCAR AT MICHIGAN: Highlights from Saturday&rsquo;s opening race</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was just an awesome car to drive today,&rdquo; Harvick said.</p>
<p>Below is more about Harvick&rsquo;s win, plus the complete results of Saturday&rsquo;s FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan.</p>
<p>Who won the NASCAR race yesterday?</p>
<p>Kevin Harvick dominated the FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan International Speedway, resulting in his third Michigan win in the last four races and the fourth of his career. It was also his fifth win of the 2020 NASCAR Cup Series season, tying him with Denny Hamlin for most in the series this year.</p>

<p>He took the W in overtime, tying him with Lee Petty on @NASCAR&rsquo;s all-time wins list. pic.twitter.com/vrlfruKDFo — NASCAR on NBC (@NASCARonNBC) August 8, 2020</p>
<p>Harvick edged Michigan native Brad Keselowski by 0.284 seconds for the victory on a final overtime restart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kevin is just super-fast on the straightaways and doesn’t give up anything in the corner,&rdquo; said Keselowski, who was hoping to become the first Michigan native to win a NASCAR Cup Series race at the state’s famed two-miler. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got some work to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keselowski was referring to the second half of the Michigan doubleheader weekend, which features another scheduled 156-lap race Sunday, the Consumers Energy 400 (4:30 p.m. ET; NBCSN, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio).</p>
<p>The lineup for Sunday&rsquo;s race was set in a unique way — inverting the top 20 finishers on Saturday. That means 20th-place Chris Buescher and 19th-place Clint Bowyer will start out front.</p>
<p>NASCAR results at Michigan</p>
<p>Martin Truex Jr., Ryan Blaney and Kyle Busch rounded out the top five after Harvick and Keselowski. Busch was racing for the win when Harvick&rsquo;s car almost made contact with Busch&rsquo;s car. The resulting change in air flow caused Busch&rsquo;s car to get loose and nearly hit the outside wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Felt like we had a fast car,&rdquo; said Busch, the reigning series champion who is still looking for his first victory of the season. &ldquo;But it was the best of the rest. The 4 car (Harvick) was lights out. He deserved to win the race. It was a race for second today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamlin, Chase Elliott, Joey Logano, Bubba Wallace and Kurt Busch completed the top 10.</p>
<p>Below are the complete results from the FireKeepers Casino 400 at Michigan:</p>
<p>Finish Driver 1 Kevin Harvick 2 Brad Keselowski 3 Martin Truex Jr. 4 Ryan Blaney 5 Kyle Busch 6 Denny Hamlin 7 Chase Elliott 8 Joey Logano 9 Bubba Wallace 10 Kurt Busch 11 Erik Jones 12 Jimmie Johnson 13 Christopher Bell 14 William Byron 15 Matt DiBenedetto 16 Aric Almirola 17 Matt Kenseth 18 Tyler Reddick 19 Clint Bowyer 20 Chris Buescher 21 Alex Bowman 22 Corey LaJoie 23 Ty Dillon 24 Daniel Suarez 25 Ryan Preece 26 JJ Yeley 27 Quin Houff 28 Ryan Newman 29 Michael McDowell 30 Reed Sorenson 31 Austin Dillon 32 Ricky Stenhouse Jr. 33 Timmy Hill 34 Cole Custer 35 Garrett Smithley 36 John Hunter Nemechek 37 Brennan Poole 38 James Davison 39 Joey Gase</p>

<h3 id="kyle-busch-rallies-to-fifth-after-near-brush-with-kevin-harvick">&ldquo;Kyle Busch rallies to fifth after near-brush with Kevin Harvick&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nascar.media/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png" alt="img">
Kyle Busch’s hopes for a breakthrough victory in this star-crossed 2020 NASCAR Cup Series season seemed so close Saturday at Michigan International Speedway — as close as the paper-thin distance between his car and Kevin Harvick’s in their late-race contest at the front of the pack.</p>
<p>RELATED: Race results | Weekend schedule</p>
<p>Busch’s No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota drifted up the track near the Turn 4 retaining wall as Harvick grabbed the lead for the final time in the 148th of 161 laps in the FireKeepers Casino 400. Busch recovered after sliding back to ninth place, rallying to a fifth-place result at the checkered flag.</p>
<p>Replays showed no contact between the cars of Harvick and Busch, but their cozy proximity upset the aerodynamic balance of Busch’s No. 18. Busch blurted out some angst-heavy profanity over the team communications but was more measured post-race about the run-in.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Definitely got loose. Don’t know whether it was contact or just air,” said Busch, who led four laps as he secured his ninth top-five finish of the season. “Definitely got loose and had to chase it and catch it. Thankfully, kept it out of the fence. We were able to salvage a fifth. Felt like we had a good second-place car today. The M&amp;M’s Fudge Brownie Toyota Camry was fast. Just nowhere near his level of fast.”</p>
<p>As Busch was regaining ground amongst the top 10, Harvick sailed away to his fifth win of the season. The Stewart-Haas Racing driver said he couldn’t tell if he had initiated contact until seeing a video replay.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I didn’t touch him,” Harvick said as he watched NBC Sports’ footage in Victory Lane. “Well, that makes me feel better because I knew we had a fast enough car to just pass him, but I knew that I need to take the opportunity that I had, and I needed to side draft right there, so that video makes me feel better.”</p>
<p>Busch started seventh and finished among the points-earners in both stages, praising crew chief Adam Stevens’ adjustments after an early pit stop. But his winless streak to start the season hit 21 races, a drought dating back to his championship-clinching victory last November at Homestead-Miami Speedway.</p>
<p>Busch gets another chance to end the dry spell in Sunday’s Consumers Energy 400 (4:30 p.m. ET on NBCSN/NBC Sports App, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio) in the second leg of Michigan’s Cup Series weekend doubleheader.</p>
<p>“We definitely didn’t have the speed we needed but had a good balanced car, good driving car and hopefully we can work on it a little bit tonight and get it better for tomorrow,” said Busch, who is set to start 16th Sunday. “Just need to be better in traffic and be able to maneuver and be able to pass just a bit more.”

<h3 id="what-channel-is-nascar-on-today-tv-schedule-start-time-for-sundays-michigan-race">&ldquo;What channel is NASCAR on today? TV schedule, start time for Sunday&rsquo;s Michigan race&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/aa/ff/nascar-michigan-080620-getty-ftrjpg_1lhqg4pq8xs6f1lyxqr0gy2z8l.jpg?t=-956944285&amp;quality=100" alt="img">
The TV channel for a NASCAR race is elusive enough in a normal season when Fox and FS1 trade broadcasts of Cup Series events through the first half of the schedule before NBC and NBCSN take over for the second half. The schedule shake-up associated with the coronavirus pandemic make the &ldquo;what channel is today&rsquo;s NASCAR race on&rdquo; question even more understandable.</p>
<p>For the second time this season, NASCAR is working through a Saturday-Sunday doubleheader as part of those schedule changes, this time at Michigan International Speedway. As was the case for Saturday&rsquo;s race, the TV channel for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR race is NBCSN. The Consumers Energy 400 marks NBC/NBCSN&rsquo;s sixth broadcast of the season, as Fox/FS1&rsquo;s slate ended with the July 15 All-Star Race.</p>

<p>Sunday&rsquo;s race at Michigan is the 18th race in NASCAR&rsquo;s return on an altered, short-term schedule, and the 22nd Cup Series races overall as NASCAR attempts to keep a 36-race slate intact for 2020. The first Michigan race originally was scheduled to run in early June but was rescheduled amid the pandemic and paired with the August Michigan race for a doubleheader.</p>
<p>The start time for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR Cup Series race at Michigan is 4:30 p.m. ET, 30 minutes later than the start time of Saturday&rsquo;s race.</p>
<p>Below is how to watch Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR Cup Series race at Michigan, including the TV channel and live stream options.</p>

<p>NBCSN is the TV channel for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR race at Michigan as originally scheduled even though it&rsquo;s now the second leg of a doubleheader. Of the 20 NASCAR Cup Series races NBC will broadcast in 2020, 12 were scheduled to be shown on NBCSN with the other eight on NBC&rsquo;s flagship cable network.</p>
<p>As for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR Cup Series race on NBCSN, the network has a channel finder feature for viewers to find the TV channel options in their areas.</p>
<p>As is the case for all the Cup Series races on NBC and NBCSN this season, Rick Allen will call the race with the assistance of analysts Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Burton and Steve Letarte.</p>
<p>What time does the NASCAR race start today?</p>

<p>Sunday, Aug. 9 Start time: 4:30 p.m. ET</p>

<p>The green flag for Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR Cup Series race at Michigan will wave shortly after 4:30 p.m. ET, assuming there are no rain delays as there have been so often since NASCAR returned to live racing in May.</p>
<p>Though NASCAR will have plenty of time to get the race in with the sun not setting in Brooklyn, Mi., until almost 9 p.m. ET, the relatively late start time for an afternoon race is notable because Michigan International Speedway does not have lights.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s race is scheduled for the same distance as Saturday&rsquo;s race — 156 laps around the two-mile oval for a total of 312 miles.</p>
<p>NASCAR live stream for Michigan race</p>
<p>Anybody who has a cable or satellite subscription can stream Sunday&rsquo;s NASCAR race at Michigan live via NBCSports.com or the NBC Sports app. This should be the preferred route for a viewer who has such a subscription but isn&rsquo;t able to get in front of his or her TV.</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t have a cable or satellite subscription, there are five OTT TV streaming options that carry NBC and NBCSN — Sling, Hulu, YouTubeTV, fuboTV and AT&amp;T Now. Of the five, Hulu, YouTubeTV and fuboTV offer free trial options.</p>
<p>Below are links to each.</p>
<p>NASCAR schedule 2020</p>
<p>NASCAR on July 8 released its latest revised Cup Series schedule through August of 2020. It remains committed to running 36 races, four of which were completed before the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the sports world. NASCAR hopes to keep its 10 playoff races in the fall intact and at their original tracks.</p>
<p>Below is the schedule revision for the Cup Series regular season, starting with the races at Darlington the Cup Series ran in its return in May.</p>
<p>Date Track TV channel Start time Sun., May 17 Darlington FOX 3:30 p.m. ET Wed., May 20 Darlington FS1 7:30 p.m. ET Sun., May 24 Charlotte FOX 6 p.m. ET Wed., May 27 Charlotte FS1 8 p.m. ET Sun, May 31 Bristol FS1 3:30 p.m. ET Sun, June 7 Atlanta FOX 3 p.m. ET Wed, June 10 Martinsville FS1 7 p.m. ET Sun, June 14 Homestead-Miami FOX 3:30 p.m. ET Sun, June 21 Talladega FOX 3 p.m. ET Sat., June 27 Pocono FOX 3:30 p.m. ET Sun., June 28 Pocono FS1 4 p.m. ET Sun., July 5 Indianapolis NBC 4 p.m. ET Sun., July 12 Kentucky FS1 2:30 p.m. ET Wed., July 15 Bristol (All-Star Race) FS1 8:30 p.m. ET Sun., July 19 Texas NBCSN 3 p.m. ET Thurs., July 23 Kansas NBCSN 7:30 p.m. ET Sun., Aug. 2 New Hampshire NBCSN 3 p.m. ET Sat., Aug. 8 Michigan NBCSN 4 p.m. ET Sun., Aug. 9 Michigan NBCSN 4:30 p.m. ET Sun., Aug. 16 Daytona (road course) NBC 3 p.m. ET Sat., Aug. 22 Dover NBCSN 4 p.m. ET Sun. Aug. 23 Dover NBCSN 4 p.m. ET Sat., Aug. 29 Daytona NBC 7:30 p.m. ET</p>
<p>The Darlington race on May 17 ran instead of the the Chicagoland race that was originally scheduled for June 21. The Darlington race on May 20 ran instead of the postponed Richmond race that was originally scheduled for April 19. The Charlotte race on May 27 ran instead of the Sonoma race that was originally scheduled for June 14.</p>
<p>The Pocono doubleheader remained as previously scheduled for the final weekend of June, with the Cup Series racing on back-to-back days. Those races were presented on Fox (and FS1) rather than on NBC. Fox&rsquo;s closed its coverage this season with the All-Star Race at Bristol on July 15.</p>
<p>The previously postponed races at Dover and Michigan are now part of Saturday-Sunday doubleheaders at those respective tracks in August.</p>
<p>Because New York requires people to quarantine for 14 days after traveling from one of the states impacted heavily by COVID-19 (including North Carolina), the Watkins Glen race on Aug. 16 was moved to the Daytona road course. According to The Athletic, NASCAR tried to get a quarantine waiver for its Watkins Glen races but was denied by Gov. Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The Aug. 16 race will be the NASCAR Cup Series&rsquo; first on the road course at Daytona.

<h3 id="ryan-blaney-brad-keselowski-crash-in-second-michigan-race">&ldquo;Ryan Blaney, Brad Keselowski crash in second Michigan race&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nascar.media/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png" alt="img">
Team Penske drivers tangled in the final stage of Sunday’s Consumers Energy 400 NASCAR Cup Series race at Michigan International Speedway.</p>
<p>Race-leader Ryan Blaney and teammate Brad Keselowski were side-by-side racing into Turn 1 on Lap 96 when Keselowski got loose in the No. 2 Ford, sliding into the left-rear quarter panel of Blaney’s No. 12 Ford. The contact sent both drivers hard into the outside retaining wall at the exit of Turn 2.</p>
<p>Keselowski’s car came sliding to a halt on the backstretch, while Blaney was able to nurse his car back to the garage area. Both drivers were forced to retire from the 156-lap event due to the significance of the damage. Both drivers were evaluated and released from the infield care center.</p>
<p>Keselowski took full responsibility for the incident.</p>
<p>“I just lost it,” Keselowski told NBC Sports. “It’s my fault. I feel really bad for my teammate, Ryan Blaney. He didn’t deserve that. I just came off of Turn 4 and the 4 car (Kevin Harvick) was behind me and he gave me a push and I swear I went into the corner like 20 miles an hour faster than I had been all day and got past the 11 (Denny Hamlin) and I went to get underneath the 12 and I just slipped.”</p>
<p>RELATED: Brad Keselowski takes blame for the incident</p>
<p>Blaney explained both he and Keselowski had showcased good speed throughout the race before the incident.</p>
<p>“It’s just unfortunate for the whole Penske organization,” Blaney said. “… We were so fast. We had to battle back from having to pit again and got to 10th for the second stage and then got the lead. I was like, ‘All right, we can finally go back at it,’ and just got together there. That’s unfortunate, but it’s not gonna carry over. Things happen. Mistakes happen. It’s just a shame both of us got taken out.”</p>

<p>Keselowski finished in the 39th and final position, while Blaney finished one spot ahead in 38th.</p>
<p>Blaney and Keselowski are locked into the NASCAR Playoffs with race victories. Blaney earned a victory at Talladega Superspeedway, while Keselowski has wins at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway and New Hampshire Motor Speedway.</p>
<p>Keselowski finished second in Saturday’s Cup Series first race at the 2-mile oval, while Blaney finished fourth.

<h3 id="erik-jones-blindsided-a-little-bit-by-jgrs-decision-for-2021">&ldquo;Erik Jones ‘blindsided a little bit’ by JGR’s decision for 2021&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nascar.media/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/fbrfg/apple-touch-icon.png" alt="img">
Erik Jones said Sunday that he was mildly surprised when told that he wouldn’t return to Joe Gibbs Racing next season, adding that he has a “great few opportunities” for 2021.</p>
<p>RELATED: Potential options for Jones | Silly Season’s key players</p>
<p>Jones’ remarks came in an interview with NBC Sports ahead of Sunday’s Consumers Energy 400 (4:30 p.m. ET, NBCSN, MRN, SiriusXM) at Michigan International Speedway in his home state. He said that he was informed of the organization’s decision Thursday morning; the news broke later that day.</p>
<p>“I was blindsided a little bit,” Jones told NBCSN. “I didn’t really expect it coming from our talks. I thought we were moving in a good direction, but at the end of the day, I’ve had a great really eight years almost with Joe Gibbs Racing between Xfinity and Cup, and I’m thankful for that time. It’s good to see the support that’s been out there the last few days on social media, and everybody that’s coming out in support has been awesome. We’ve got a great few opportunities out there, which has been good to see over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, we can have some good talks. Excited about that, and excited about the next 15 races, too.”</p>
<p>Jones is the latest driver to become a key free agent ahead of the 2021 season. He is in his third season driving JGR’s No. 20 Toyota and ranks 15th in the Cup Series standings.
