<p>The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued a show-cause notice to AirAsia India’s head of flight operation two weeks after one of its pilot alleged violations of safety norms by the low-cost carrier. Captain Gaurav Taneja, who runs the popular YouTube channel Flying Beast, on June 14 on his twitter handle said that he has been suspended by AirAsia India “for standing up for safe operations of an aircraft and its passengers”.</p>
<p>A PTI report on Sunday quoted DGCA officials saying: “A show cause notice has been issued to Manish Uppal, head of operations, AirAsia India, after the pilot’s allegations.”</p>
<p>AirAsia also confirmed receiving the DGCA notice. “We are assisting the regulator in its fact-finding process. We will fully cooperate with the regulator,” said the spokesperson of the airline, as reported by PTI.</p>
<p>Taneja on June 15 had posted a detailed video on YouTube titled “Reasons behind suspension from my pilot job”. After which DGCA on Twitter said it had taken note of concerns raised by some stakeholders “against a particular airline and its approach to safety”. The aviation regulator also said it has already begun a probe into the matter and will take appropriate action after the investigation.</p>
<p>Taneja in his video alleged that the airline has asked its pilots to opt for 98% of landings in the “Flap 3” mode. The mode allows aircraft to save fuel. According to Taneja, the airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure if a pilot does not do 98% of landings in the “Flap 3” mode.</p>
<p>During landing and take-offs, flaps are used to create a drag. Flaps are part of the wings of an aircraft. In airports where an aircraft descends more steeply for landing, it requires drags so that it remains slow, and the pilot does a “Flap full” landing.</p>
<p>“In order to achieve targets” set by the airline, “what would people do? They will do Flap 3 landings without giving consideration whether it is safe or unsafe,” Tajena said in his video, adding ”this directly impacts the passenger safety.”</p>
<p>On June 15 after Taneja’s video, DGCA officials had confirmed that AirAsia India was under investigation.

<p>Gaurav Taneja, who also runs a popular YouTube channel called Flying Beast, on Sunday tweeted that he had been suspended by the airline “for standing up for safe operations of an aircraft and its passengers”. Subsequently, he posted a detailed video regarding the same on his YouTube channel. Also Read - India Prepares to Resume International Flights on Select Routes: What Are The Main Hurdles?</p>
<p>His video went viral across social media platforms, with AirAsia customers writing about how their experiences were relatable to Taneja’s narration. This forced the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to probe into AirAsia’s actions.

<p>The pilot claimed that the airline asked its pilots to do 98 per cent of landings in “Flap 3” mode in order to save fuel and that if anyone does not do it, the airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure (SOP).</p>
<p>Taneja went on to explain how, in certain cases, “Flap 3” landing becomes extremely difficult and puts the lives of crew and passengers at danger. He gave the example of Imphal airport and said when an aircraft is coming down steeply, it needs to have a drag so that it remains slow, and in such circumstances, a pilot has to do a “Flap full” landing.</p>
<p>“In order to achieve targets, what would people do? They will do Flap 3 landings without giving consideration whether it is safe or unsafe. This directly impacts the passenger safety,” he said in his video.</p>
<p>As a result, the DGCA took note of the complaints raised by a number of stakeholders and started an investigation into the flagged issues. The aviation regulator said it will “take appropriate action based on the outcome of the said investigation”.</p>
<p>However, an AirAsia India spokesperson said that the carrier “stands firmly on its value of ‘Safety Always&rsquo;”.</p>
<p>“The safety of our guests is of paramount importance in every aspect of our operations. AirAsia India is cognizant of the matter in regard to a social media post put up by one of its employees. We are cooperating with the DGCA on this matter. As a policy, AirAsia India does not comment on matters pertaining to its business or employees,” the spokesperson said in the statement.

<p>A show-cause notice was issued to low-cost carrier Air Asia by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), two weeks after launching an investigation over allegations of flouting safety rules raised by now suspended pilot Gaurav Taneja. Earlier this month, Taneja, a pilot-cum-YouTuber, uploaded a video on this popular channel &lsquo;Flying Beast&rsquo;, where he accused the airline of not complying with safety guidelines established by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and other International Safety norms.

<h3 id="airasia-india-allegedly-suspended-pilots-due-to-flagging-safety-issues--aeronautics">&ldquo;AirAsia India Allegedly Suspended Pilots Due to Flagging Safety Issues – Aeronautics&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://aeronauticsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/cropped-Aeronautics-White-Slash-Logo-32x32.png" alt="img">
On Monday, an AirAsia India pilot has accused the Air Asia India of suspending him for highlighting to the company that there were serious safety violations during operations. An Airbus A320 captain, Gaurav Taneja has alleged that the airline had violated several safety protocols, which has endangered the lives of passengers onboard AirAsia India aircraft. His video posted on Youtube “Reason Behind Suspension from my Pilot Job” has led to a #BoycottAirAsiaIndia trending on Twitter with 26,000 tweets on Monday.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from AirAsia India didn’t provide any comments and only stated that the issues that were brought to light are now being internally investigated. They also stated that the pilot was not suspended for reporting issues, but rather, Mr. Taneja was suspended due to disciplinary issues. In addition the DGCA or Directorate General of Civil Aviation has commented that: “DGCA has taken note of the concerns raised by some stakeholders against a particular airline and its approach to safety. DGCA has already started an investigation into the issues flagged and shall take appropriate action based on the outcome of the said investigation.”</p>
<p>Through the video, Taneja had stated that AirAsia India was not following certain DGCA mandated safety guidelines, after the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. In the video posted on Youtube, Mr. Taneja stated: “On 22-23 March, I delayed my flight for about 40 minutes as safety-related guidelines were not being followed by the airline.” He also added that he gave feedback that certain regulations were not being followed during flight operations by the airline, however, the airline had taken no action. This inflexibility from the airline has forced Mr. Taneja to not fly on the 24 March as the airline was not observing certain safety measures that were repeatedly flagged by him.</p>
<p>Later on, in the video he stated that: “On 4 May, I was shown a notice which stated that the company incurred losses because of my actions. It was clear administration issues were labeled on me. It was clear that they are unhappy with me for pointing out safety lapses.”</p>

<p><img src="https://simpleflying.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1151854631.jpg" alt="img">

<p>AirAsia India’s decision to suspend a whistleblower pilot has drawn severe criticism. The pilot, Gaurav Taneja, was suspended after he raised a number of objections about the airline’s culture and safety procedures. The allegations are now being investigated by India’s regulatory body, the DGCA. What are the allegations against AirAsia India and how did the airline respond? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>Public allegations</p>
<p>The decision to suspend the pilot came after he went public with his allegations against the airline. Captain Taneja, the pilot in question, posted a 27-minute video detailing the failings of the AirAsia management in dealing with a number of safety issues. These issues ranged from taking punitive action against pilots for sick leave to forcing pilots to operate flaps at a certain level to save fuel.</p>
<p>The decision to suspend the whistleblower has drawn outrage against AirAsia India. According to the pilot, the decision to go public came after multiple lapses on the airline’s part. In one instance in March, he opted to delay a flight by 40 minutes because he did not believe the AirAsia team had followed flight safety procedures. Many online have said the airline’s decision is a hasty and vindictive move, meant to threaten his pilot’s license.</p>
<p>Conflict over landing procedure</p>
<p>According to the pilot, AirAsia India’s Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) requires that 98% of a pilot’s landings be done at Flap 3 level. Landing at Flap 3 is a procedure followed by many airlines since it can save up to 8kgs of fuel per landing, a major cost-saving for airlines.</p>
<p>However, at certain airports with a steep descent, landing requires full flaps. According to the pilot, this is the case at Imphal Airport, where he landed twice. However, the decision to land with full flaps instead of Flap 3, led to AirAsia pulling the pilot up for violating the SOP.</p>
<p>The decision to mandate Flap 3 at nearly all landings in a potential threat to passenger safety, according to Captain Taneja. Pilots may need to adapt to changing circumstances and forcing them to operate a certain way can be a threat. However, some analysts have said Flap 3 is a standard followed by many airlines isn’t a threat itself. Mandating its use to pilots could pose a risk though.</p>

<p>Unsafe airline culture</p>
<p>The decision to mandate Flap 3 is not the only time AirAsia has put the bottom line above safety, claims the pilot. According to him, the management of AirAsia India has repeatedly refused to take up his concerns about safety. He once opted to delay a flight where procedures weren’t followed, albeit without explaining which procedures were missed, and then refused another day, citing safety risks. He even goes on to claim that AirAsia India threatened to blemish his personal flight record, by requesting an extra physical check.</p>
<p>The DGCA has since taken up these allegations and will investigate the airline’s procedure. However, it seems that AirAsia has taken a larger reputational hit, as social media is trending with #BoycottAirAsia. AirAsia has refused to give a statement on the suspension, remaining tight-lipped about the incident. The coming weeks will likely see more unearthed about these allegations.</p>

Air Asia is in troubled waters after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has acknowledged allegations made by Youtuber Gaurav Taneja, aka Flying Beast, who has accused the airline of not complying with safety guidelines established by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and other International Safety norms. Taneja, a Delhi based pilot, has documented his statement in a 27-minute video uploaded on his YouTube channel and has stated that he lost his job for regularly flagging the issues with the airline.</p>

<p>Pilot says airline does not follow safety guidelines</p>
<p>DGCA has taken note of the concerns raised by some stakeholders against a particular Airline and its approach to safety. DGCA has already started an investigation into the issues flagged and shall take appropriate action based on the outcome of the said investigation. — DGCA (@DGCAIndia) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>The aviation regulator stated that it has launched an investigation in all claims made by regarding all safety aspects which have allegedly been ignored by the airline and will be taking appropriate action as per the findings of the investigation.</p>
<p>In the video, Taneja mentioned that the airline&rsquo;s sick leave policy is such that it indirectly forces the pilots to work even if he or she is not healthy and is under some kind of physical distress - in effect compromising the ability to fly the airplane and thus putting the lives of the passengers at risk. Taneja added that he raised the loophole regarding the leave policy multiple times, but they were brushed aside by the management. Taneja went on to claim that it was done in order to help the airline save money via employee leaves.</p>

<p>Raising the second lapse in safety, Taneja stated that he had raised issues after certain rules set by the regulatory body were not followed and although he had personally intervened to resolve them, no action had been taken after multiple attempts had been made.</p>
<p>Taneja stated that he decided to not fly a plane as scheduled on March 24 due to lack of enough safety operations and ended up receiving a show-cause notice by the airline which listed multiple complaints against him.</p>
<p>The pilot later received a mail from the airline questioning a video which he had uploaded wherein he spoke about the financial burden faced by him and his family due to the lockdown and the salary cuts.</p>

<p>The third issue raised by Taneja was regarding the landing technique implemented during in the month of March, which was not in line with the company&rsquo;s policy. Taneja alleged the airline has asked its pilots to do 98% of landings in &ldquo;Flap 3&rdquo; mode, which allows it to save fuel. He said if a pilot does not do 98% of landings in &ldquo;Flap 3&rdquo; mode, the airline considers it a violation of its standard operating procedure (SOP). Flaps are part of wings of an aircraft and they are engaged to create a drag during a landing or a take off.</p>

<p>Taneja uploaded the video on June 14 and it has garnered more than four million views. DGCA took cognisance of the issue and announced about the investigation on June 15. Soon after the video was uploaded, &lsquo;BoycottAirAsia&rsquo; was trending on the internet in support of Taneja.</p>
<p>Taneja&rsquo;s channel Flying Beast has 2.94 million subscribers and each video gets more than millions of views, with his last 79 videos crossing the mark.</p>
<p>The airline has stated that it follows all safety procedures and that it is currently cooperating with DGCA on the issue.</p>
