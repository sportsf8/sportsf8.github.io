<p>Here’s yet another case of celebrities behaving badly. When will they ever learn?</p>
<p>In an exclusive, The Hollywood Reporter writes that actor Hartley Sawyer has been fired from popular superhero series “The Flash” after several of his tweets containing misogynist and racist references surfaced in the past week.</p>
<p>Sawyer played Ralph Dibny on The CW series for the past three seasons.</p>
<p>Related Articles Summer TV preview: 15 new shows we can’t wait to see The tweets, all posted before he joined The CW series, reportedly make references to sexual assault and contain racist and homophobic language. Sawyer’s Twitter account has been deleted, but screenshots of the old posts have circulated online in the past two weeks.</p>
<p>His firing also comes amid nationwide protests against systemic racism in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police officers.</p>
<p>“Hartley Sawyer will not be returning for season seven of The Flash,” reads a statement from The CW, producers Warner Bros. TV and Berlanti Productions and executive producer Eric Wallace. “In regards to Mr. Sawyer’s posts on social media, we do not tolerate derogatory remarks that target any race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, or sexual orientation. Such remarks are antithetical to our values and polices, which strive and evolve to promote a safe, inclusive and productive environment for our workforce.”</p>
<p>Among the tweets users recently dug up are one from 2012 in which Sawyer wrote: “The only thing keeping me from doing mildly racist tweets is the knowledge that Al Sharpton would never stop complaining about me.”</p>
<p>In 2014, he wrote, “Enjoyed a secret boob viewing at an audition today.”</p>
<p>In addition, several tweets refer to assaulting women, and one reads, “Date rape myself so I don’t have to masturbate,” THR reported.</p>
<p>Sawyer has since issued an apology on his Instagram. “I’m not here to make excuses,” he wrote. “Regardless of the intention, my words matter and they carry profound consequences. And mine can and have caused pain and embarrassment, along with feelings I can only imagine, to my supporters and fans, my cast mates, the crew, my colleagues and friends. I owe them all an apology. And I owe each of you an apology. Thank you for holding me accountable.”</p>
<p>Sawyer went on to say that he is “incredibly sorry, ashamed, and disappointed” in his behavior. “I want to be very clear: this is not reflective of what I think or who I am now. Years ago, thanks to friends and experiences who helped me to open my eyes, I began my journey into becoming a more responsible adult — in terms of what I say, what I do, and beyond.”</p>
<p>Sawyer was cast as Ralph Dibny on “The Flash” in 2017 and he was promoted to series regular status in 2018. It’s unclear at this point if Dibny will be written off of the show or if Sawyer will simply be recast.

Actor Hartley Sawyer has been fired from TV show The Flash after offensive tweets resurfaced.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old – who played Ralph Dibny aka the Elongated Man on the superhero series – apologised after posts containing “sexist and racist” references emerged.</p>
<p>Sawyer said the tweets were “hurtful and unacceptable”, and that “I regret them deeply”.</p>
<p>The Flash producers announced he would not feature in the seventh series of the popular show.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, Warner Bros Television, The CW channel, Berlanti Productions and the show’s executive producer Eric Wallace said: “Hartley Sawyer will not be returning for season seven of The Flash.</p>

<p>“Such remarks are antithetical to our values and polices, which strive and evolve to promote a safe, inclusive and productive environment for our workforce.”</p>
<p>Sawyer’s Twitter account has since been deleted but alleged screenshots of his tweets have recirculated. They contained racist and homophobic language.</p>
<p>Several discussed violence against women. Sawyer shared an apology on Instagram.</p>
<p>He said: “My words, irrelevant of being meant with an intent of humour, were hurtful, and unacceptable. I am ashamed I was capable of these really horrible attempts to get attention at that time. I regret them deeply.</p>
<p>“This was not acceptable behaviour. These were words I threw out at the time with no thought or recognition of the harm my words could do, and now have done today.”</p>
<p>Sawyer joined The Flash in 2017.

TMZ has posted several over here . The graphic tweets — all made before he appeared on The Flash — included references to spying on women&rsquo;s breasts during auditions, admissions of racism and even &ldquo;jokes&rdquo; about domestic violence.&ldquo;The only thing stopping me from doing mildly racist tweets is the knowledge that Al Sharpton would never stop complaining about me,&rdquo; Sawyer wrote in 2012.The CW said that the network parted ways with Sawyer, stating: &ldquo;We do not tolerate derogatory remarks that target any race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, or sexual orientation. Such remarks are antithetical to our values and polices, which strive and evolve to promote a safe, inclusive and productive environment for our workforce.&ldquo;The Flash showrunner Eric Wallace also offered a statement:Sawyer has since apologized for his actions in an Instagram post, available below.

<p><img src="http://cdn.epicstream.com/assets/uploads/newscover/1591640768hartley_sawyer.jpg" alt="img">
If you’re a big fan of Hartley Sawyer’s portrayal of Ralph Dibny, you’re in for some bad news. Hartley Sawyer has been fired from The Flash Season 7 as offensive tweets from 2012 and on have resurfaced, showing an ugly side of the actor. While the actor’s Twitter is gone, a number of Twitter users have discovered some of his older tweets that are pretty bad, if we’re being honest.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that Hartley Sawyer was fired for these tweets that surfaced, with a statement from The CW released that speaks out against his actions. It reads as follows: &ldquo;Hartley Sawyer will not be returning for season seven of The Flash. In regards to Mr. Sawyer&rsquo;s posts on social media, we do not tolerate derogatory remarks that target any race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, or sexual orientation. Such remarks are antithetical to our values and polices, which strive and evolve to promote a safe, inclusive and productive environment for our workforce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For his part, Sawyer did apologize for the tweets he made back then on his Instagram, claiming that they were poor attempts at humor. Though old, Sawyer does feel shame for making them since they made fun of race (&ldquo;The only thing keeping me from doing mildly racist tweets is the knowledge that Al Sharpton would never stop complaining about me&rdquo;) and made light of sexual assault (&ldquo;Date rape myself so I don&rsquo;t have to masturbate&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Honestly, this is a hard situation to judge. While the tweets Sawyer made were really bad, keep in mind that they are pretty old and he could have changed already. It bears some similarities to the time James Gunn was fired from Marvel Studios when he made bad tweets over a decade ago. If Sawyer has shown a change in character since the tweets were made, this was an exaggerated move.</p>
<p>Either way, Sawyer’s Ralph Dibny will not be appearing in The Flash Season 7. It’s not yet clear if they will recast the character or simply write him off. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>In an Instagram post on May 30, he apologized, saying &ldquo;I am incredibly sorry, ashamed and disappointed in myself for my ignorance back then.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="the-flash-actor-kendrick-sampson-hit-with-rubber-bullets-during-la-protests">&ldquo;The Flash Actor Kendrick Sampson Hit With Rubber Bullets During LA Protests&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kendrick-sampson-1.jpg" alt="img">
Kendrick Sampson, an American actor best known for his roles in shows like The Flash and Insecure, was fired at with rubber bullets by policemen when he partook in protests in Los Angeles yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The civil unrest, which has since spread to other cities, including New York, Atlanta, Nashville and Chicago, is a response to the choking of George Floyd, an African American man whose slow and gruesome death at the hands of the officers who apprehended him for passing and possessing an insignificant amount of counterfeit currency, was caught on camera and has since become the epicenter of both American news and social life.</p>
<p>The actor was filming the events going on in downtown LA for his Instagram account when police forces barraged him with rubber bullets. The shooting, which was simultaneously caught on cameras by CNN, is only one of many incidents of authorities using excessive force to disperse protesters. According to actor John Cusack, who also sought to document the protests, police forces have made use of pepper spray and tear gas, too.</p>
<p>“They shot me four times already. I already got hurt and I got hit with a baton,” Sampson said. “Y’all ain’t see no police f—ing up white folks when they took guns to the statehouse. Y’all didn’t see police attacking white folks, beating em up with batons, shooting them with rubber bullets when they brought guns to f—ing state houses. We came up here with no weapons, with masks.… And we’re the ones who are not peaceful.”</p>
<p>Kendrick Sampson and Cusack are not the only celebrities who’ve gotten involved with the protests. Numerous other prominent Americans, including singers Ariana Grande and Halsey, as well as rapper Machine Gun Kelly, have been found in the street. Meanwhile, many of their showbiz colleagues, like talk show host Oprah Winfrey and pop star Beyoncé, are using their influence to aid the movement through social media.</p>
<p>In one especially extensive move, late night host Jimmy Kimmel implored his followers to remember these incidents come next election, and use their sentiment to vote President Donald Trump, whose outrageous and careless comments – including a recent one in which he gave cops permission to shoot civilians – have further divided the country along lines of race and power, out of office.
