Bihar Board 10th Result 2020 Expected Date and Time: The Bihar Board Intermediate Results 2020 were declared on March 24, 2020, and now the students who have appeared for the BSB Class 10 exams 2020 are eagerly awaiting their Matric examination results. It is expected that the BSEB Class 10 results 2020 will be declared soon. According to the source from the Bihar School Examination Board, it is reported that the Board will announce the Bihar Board class 10 results 2020 in April 2020. Although a particular date and time have not been provided by the board, it must be noted that the evaluation process for the Bihar Board class 10 exams is nearing completion.

Following the completion of the board exams, the BSEB also initiated the evaluation process for matric students, which is currently near its completion in advance stages. Therefore, it is quite likely that Bihar 10th Result 2020 can be expected in second week of April 2020.</p>

<h3 id="jharkhand-board-result-2020-jac-10th-12th-results-postponed-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic">Jharkhand Board Result 2020: JAC 10th, 12th Results Postponed Due to Coronavirus Pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2018/05/exam-illustration2.jpg" alt="img">
The Jharkhand Academic Council has postponed JAC 10th result 2020, JAC 12th result 2020 due to the Coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Informing about the development, Board chairman Arvind Kumar said, “the Jharkhand Class 10 and Class 12 results for 2019-20 have been deferred indefinitely due to the country-wide lockdown”.</p>
<p>“From March 20 onwards, the answer sheets were scheduled to be evaluated, but because of the lockdown, it couldn’t be done. If by April 14, the situation is normal then the answer scripts will be evaluated and the Jharkhand Board Result 2020 may get declared in the month of May,” Kumar added.</p>
<p>He further added that it will take a minimum of 20 days to evaluate the paper and 15 days to tabulate the marks. So it would take around 35 days to eventually declare the JAC Board Class 10 result 2020, JAC Board Class 12 Result 2020.</p>
<p>A total of 6.21 lakh students appeared for class 10 and class 12 examinations.</p>

<h3 id="cgbse-10th-and-12th-result-2020-delayed-cg-board-halts-evaluation-process-for-cgbse-board-exam-2020-amid-lockdown-over-covid-19">CGBSE 10th and 12th Result 2020 Delayed: CG Board halts evaluation process for CGBSE Board Exam 2020 amid Lockdown over COVID-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jagranjosh.com/imported/images/E/Articles/Board-results-2019-8th-May-News-10.jpg" alt="img">
CGBSE 10th and 12th Result 2020 Delayed: As per the latest update, Chhattisgarh Board Exam Results 2020 for 10th and 12th Class students will be delayed this year. Currently, CG Board has halted the evaluation process for CGBSE Board Exam 2020 which is expected to delay the declaration of results in time. CGBSE or Chattisgarh Madhyamik Shiksha Mandal was expected to commence the evaluation work for 10th and 12th Board Exam Answer Sheet from 26th March 2020. However, keeping in mind the current conditions around COVID-19 and Coronavirus epidemic in the country, the board has decided to delay the same to a future date. As the evaluation work is being postponed, it is quite imperative that the CG Board Result 2020 for 10th and 12th class students will also be delayed.</p>
<p>CG Board Exploring Work From Home for Examiners</p>
<p>As the situation around Coronavirus is still developing, the Board has refrained from giving any exact date for the start of evaluation work. However, officials have said that revised dates for evaluation will be announced soon by the Board after consulting with the Education Department and other stakeholders. On the other end, Board is also exploring the possibility of allowing Examiners Work from Home option to check the answer books of the students. In line with this, CG Board has also issued special directions for the teachers about checking of papers at home.</p>
<p>Several Board Exams Cancelled due to COVID-19</p>
<p>The number of positive cases for Coronavirus infection in India started rising in mid-March, which was the peak period for holding of board exams. However, as COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease, CBSE Board as well as several state Board, who were holding Board Exams for 10th and 12th Class students, were forced to cancel or postpone them to a later date. In addition to Board exams, several university exams, entrance exams like JEE Main April Exam, NEET UG Exam 2020 as well as Recruitment Exams such as RBI Assistant Mains Exam, have been postponed as a precautionary measure.
