APSARAS ARTS</p>
<p>Indian dance academy</p>
<p>Trying to stay up to date and yet true to its roots, Apsaras Arts has blended strict adherence to Indian classical dance techniques with contemporary storytelling.</p>
<p>Under its current director Aravinth Kumarasamy, a National Arts Council Young Artist award winner, the group has branched into schools and digital technologies to keep itself relevant.</p>
<p>The group was started in 1977 and has two main functions: One, as an Indian dance academy for performers, choreographers and teachers; and the other, as a full-time repertory company.</p>
<p>In bringing the art of Indian classical dance to the young, Mr Aravinth said Singapore has done a good job of introducing the arts in schools. But narratives still need to be relevant. &ldquo;Indian dance is about storytelling. Even if you pick a story from the age-old epics, we have to add a contemporary feel,&rdquo; said the 54-year-old.</p>
<p>This can be done through technology, which can also help with presenting the ancient art during challenging times. Sistic has chosen the group&rsquo;s performance to be streamed online.</p>

<p>Innovation, in terms of set design, lighting or fresh perspectives, adds relevance. Apsaras Arts performed the ancient epic of Ramayana in 2017 to sold-out seats, focusing not on Rama but his companion Hanuman, a divine monkey.

<h3 id="jason-gardiner-brands-holly-willoughby-and-philip-schofield-fake-after-dancing-on-ice-exit">&ldquo;Jason Gardiner brands Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield &lsquo;fake&rsquo; after Dancing On Ice exit&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/05/00/22997890-0-image-a-26_1578185644153.jpg" alt="img">
Jason Gardiner branded Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield &lsquo;fake&rsquo; amid claims they snubbed him following his Dancing On Ice exit.</p>
<p>The former judge, 48, spoke to The Sun about his disappointment and alleged that the co-hosts hadn&rsquo;t bothered to even send him a message following his departure.</p>
<p>Speaking candidly, he told the publication: &lsquo;Since it was announced I was leaving the show I&rsquo;ve had nothing from Phil and Holly. Not even a text message.</p>
<p>Hurt: Jason Gardiner BLASTED Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield for being &lsquo;fake&rsquo; as he claimed on Saturday that they snubbed him following Dancing On Ice exit</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is hurtful, especially because when Phillip was getting a lot of negative attention recently I sent him a message of support.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought they would get in touch but I&rsquo;ve learned this industry is full of fake and disingenuous people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jason also claimed that he had issues with Phil over the years, but said they dealt with things &lsquo;man-to-man&rsquo; and had quashed their differences.</p>
<p>MailOnline have contacted representatives for Dancing on Ice, Holly, and Phil for comment.</p>
<p>Snubbed: Jason claimed he&rsquo;d &lsquo;had nothing from Phil and Holly. Not even a text message&rsquo;, which made him realise that they were &lsquo;fake and disingenuous&rsquo;</p>
<p>Happier times: Jason is seen posing with Holly and Phil at the DOI press launch in December 2018</p>
<p>Jason also claimed that fellow judges, and &lsquo;idols&rsquo;, Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill also hadn&rsquo;t been in touch, but Ashley Banjo did reach out to send him support.</p>
<p>The dancer was replaced by John Barrowman on the panel, but Jason claimed that the Torchwood star is too inexperienced for the role.</p>
<p>In August, the Australian choreographer confirmed that he wouldn&rsquo;t be returning to the show after joining the programme at its inception in 2006.</p>
<p>The skating judge addressed speculation that he would be stepping down from his long-running position in an Instagram video and referenced his &lsquo;controversies&rsquo;, after it was rumoured he was leaving the show following his dispute with Gemma Collins.</p>
<p>Harsh words: The dancer was replaced by John Barrowman on the panel, but Jason claimed that the Torchwood star is too inexperienced for the role</p>
<p>Jason said: &lsquo;I know there has been a lot of speculation about me and the upcoming series of dancing on ice. I wanted to set the record straight, I&rsquo;ve been an original judge since 2006.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done every series except one, when I was replaced by my good friend and dance sister Louis Spence in 2012.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the time it was reported Jason told friends he felt &lsquo;stitched up&rsquo; by bosses&rsquo; decision to replace him with the Pineapple Dance Studios&rsquo; star.</p>
<p>This comes after it was reported that Holly and Phil have been embroiled in a so-called &lsquo;feud,&rsquo; with eight This Morning presenters breaking their silence regarding the &lsquo;toxic&rsquo; atmosphere backstage.</p>
<p>A report stated the situation behind the scenes at This Morning had become &lsquo;toxic&rsquo; in recent months, with employees too scared to speak out publicly for fear of backlash.</p>
<p>An ITV source told The Sun: &lsquo;For so long people have been silenced because they are scared for their job. If they speak out publicly about the atmosphere they fear there could be repercussions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An insider close to Holly added: &lsquo;It’s true there have been some issues. They’re like brothers and sisters - they have ups and downs but love each other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hitting back at the reports, a spokesperson for ITV said: &lsquo;It’s deeply disappointing and unfair for Phillip to be the target of this sort of malicious gossip.</p>
<p>Ignored: Jason added that fellow judges, and &lsquo;idols&rsquo;, Christopher Dean and Jayne Torvill also hadn&rsquo;t been in touch, but Ashley Banjo did reach out to send him support</p>
<p>&lsquo;Phillip is a much respected broadcaster and colleague and this is absolutely not a description of This Morning that we recognise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Holly and Phil are great friends both on and off screen and are popular among viewers and colleagues alike.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Phil also slammed the rumours as he discussed their sibling-like relationship during the Dancing On Ice launch.</p>
<p>Claims: This comes after claims Holly and Phil have been embroiled in a so-called &lsquo;feud,&rsquo; with eight This Morning presenters breaking their silence regarding the &lsquo;toxic&rsquo; atmosphere</p>
<p>The TV star said: &lsquo;Can you imagine a feud between us ever happening? It&rsquo;s not as if we have to defend anything.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a shame… we are so open on the show, we are so open online and we go on holiday together. Holly is the sister I never had, we think at the same speed. It&rsquo;s so organic… it&rsquo;s a shame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everyone who knows us, I mean, everyone at This Morning was like, &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo; The atmosphere in our studio is so wonderful, there&rsquo;s such a lovely team. Everyone is lovely.&rsquo;

<h3 id="hong-kong-actor-director-sammo-hung-looks-thin-in-recent-photos-with-singer-alan-tam">&ldquo;Hong Kong actor-director Sammo Hung looks thin in recent photos with singer Alan Tam&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/05/28/ym-alan280520.jpg?itok=o_HgA_TY" alt="img">
Was it the camera angle or has portly actor-director Sammo Hung lost a tremendous amount of weight?</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Hong Kong actor-singer Alan Tam, 69, posted on Weibo two photos of him having lunch with Hung, 68, and two unnamed friends.</p>
<p>Tam, who was a member of 1970s Cantopop band The Wynners, wrote: &ldquo;Brother Hung personally cooked some of his specialities this afternoon. They are really delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While both looked cheerful in the photos, many netizens noted that Hung, who said in 2016 that his weight was 108kg, appeared thinner in the first shot. Some netizens said that they almost could not recognise him while others asked if he had gone on a diet.</p>
<p>There were also remarks that Hung, who is a year younger than the singer, looked older than Tam.</p>
<p>Some netizens, however, reckoned it must been an unflattering camera angle because Hung looked better in the second photo.</p>
<p>The action star and stunt choreographer went for a knee operation in 2017 and has been seen in public on a wheelchair or on crutches several times.</p>
<p>The God Of War (2017) actor was formerly one of the Seven Little Fortunes, a troupe comprising Hung, Jackie Chan, Corey Yuen and four others who went to a Peking Opera school and became action heavyweights in the Hong Kong film industry.</p>
<p>Hung himself disclosed that he has suffered several minor and major injuries during his long career, saying in a 2007 interview that he has fractured his arms seven times and his legs three times.</p>
<p>Amid the concerns for Hung, his daughter-in-law, former actress Janet Chow, told the Hong Kong media that he is in good health and that he has lost weight due to a healthy diet.

<h3 id="peranakan-theatre-pioneer-popiah-shop-owner-among-winners-of-intangible-cultural-heritage-award">&ldquo;Peranakan theatre pioneer, popiah shop owner among winners of Intangible Cultural Heritage Award&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/06/06/nz_collage_060620.jpg?itok=RVRkb3ID" alt="img">
A pioneer of Peranakan theatre and the owner of one of Singapore&rsquo;s oldest popiah shops are among six winners of an inaugural award for promoting intangible forms of cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The winners were announced on Thursday. Each will receive $5,000 in cash and be eligible to apply for a project grant of up to $20,000 to further fund their work.</p>
<p>Launched by the National Heritage Board (NHB) last October, the Stewards of Singapore&rsquo;s Intangible Cultural Heritage Award recognises individuals and groups that have made excellent contributions in preserving and transmitting cultural skills or knowledge in their respective fields.</p>
<p>These groups or persons must each have had at least 10 years of experience in their vocation and be well respected by their community.</p>
<p>Mr Tan Teck Yoke, the current owner of Thow Kwang Industry, said the award recognises the hard work of three generations. His family-run business operates one of the last two dragon kilns in Singapore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been keeping this alive till now, and it is worth it. We also feel a greater responsibility to spread this cultural heritage to the next generation,&rdquo; said Mr Tan, 65.</p>
<p>Mr Aravinth Kumarasamy, 54, of Apsaras Arts, said the award represents the &ldquo;sacred responsibility&rdquo; of nurturing Indian classical dance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is so our next generations can be proud of a living tradition practised among the community and not just a museum show piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The award, said Mr Aravinth, is also a much-needed form of positive encouragement at a time when many arts groups are struggling because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>For example, Peranakan theatre veteran G.T. Lye has seen several projects shelved. An international Peranakan convention that was to be held here in November has been postponed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray hard that my health will allow me to do it next year,&rdquo; said the 81-year-old wayang Peranakan pioneer, who is known for his female impersonations.</p>
<p>ART BUILDS CHARACTER Roots are important for building up a person&rsquo;s character by inculcating values, and if you want to keep these values, then the preservation of art forms is key. MR TOH LIM MOK, Nam Hwa Opera president.</p>
<p>Other winners, including Apsaras Arts and Nam Hwa Opera, a prominent Teochew opera company, have seized the opportunity to further digitalise their work.</p>
<p>And the Sri Warisan Som Said Performing Arts group has started using videoconferencing platform Zoom to communicate while practising traditional Malay arts like bangsawan and dikir barat at home.</p>
<p>The pandemic has also provided an opportunity for the different groups to give back to the community in additional ways.</p>
<p>Mr Michael Ker, 44, the third-generation owner of 83-year-old family-run Kway Guan Huat Joo Chiat Popiah, has donated hundreds of rolls of the well-loved local dish to hospitals, as a way of showing his appreciation to front-line workers.</p>
<p>He said he has cousins and nephews in their 20s who have shown an interest in popiah-making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I can spur the younger generations to take the unconventional path. But it must come from them, you can&rsquo;t force it. It&rsquo;s not an easy thing to do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Nam Hwa Opera president Toh Lim Mok, 72, said the importance of preserving and promoting intangible cultural heritage lies in its roots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roots are important for building up a person&rsquo;s character by inculcating values, and if you want to keep these values, then the preservation of art forms is key,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Yeo Kirk Siang, director of heritage research and assessment at NHB, said the organisation looked forward to working with the winners to further raise awareness and participation in their fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our intangible cultural heritage is integral to our way of life and our multicultural identity as Singaporeans,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>It conducts programmes at kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, as well as tours of Thow Kwang&rsquo;s famous dragon kiln, said second-generation owner Tan Teck Yoke, 65.</p>
<p>His niece, Ms Stella Tan, 29, has come on board with fresh ideas to market the company&rsquo;s pottery products on social media and at art exhibits and markets.</p>

<p>At 81, veteran female impersonator G.T. Lye is still fighting for the art of wayang Peranakan.</p>
<p>The theatre form might have disappeared for good had it not been for Mr Lye, who is credited with reviving it in the 1980s.</p>
<p>His first role was that of a father in Pileh Menantu (Choosing An In-law), a play about a typical Peranakan family, commissioned by the Ministry of Culture in 1984.</p>

<p>More than just performance, Teochew opera is a conduit for transmitting traditional culture and values, such as filial piety, to the young.</p>
<p>Nam Hwa Opera president Toh Lim Mok, 72, is focusing on efforts to get to the roots of the art form even as the group tries to reach out to the younger generation.</p>
<p>It has set up a research centre to delve into the history of Teochew opera and its development, and collaborated with the National University of Singapore to encourage its students to also do so.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope it is handled correctly and with dignity. I hope it’s not made light of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To which Jason was asked if he feared it won&rsquo;t be, with the sassy former judge claiming: &lsquo;Well, it is ITV. Sorry ITV, but you know, it’s true.&rsquo;</p>
