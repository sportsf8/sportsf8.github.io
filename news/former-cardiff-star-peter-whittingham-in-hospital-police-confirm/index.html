<p>South Wales Police have confirmed that former Cardiff City midfielder Peter Whittingham is in hospital after suffering a &lsquo;head injury&rsquo; as a result of an accidental fall at a pub in Barry.</p>
<p>Reports flooded the internet on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning suggesting that the 35-year-old had passed away following an incident at his home.</p>
<p>But police have confirmed he is fighting for his life in hospital after a tragic accident in a seaside pub on the evening of March 7, the same night England played Wales in the Six Nations.</p>
<p>South Wales Police have confirmed that ex-Cardiff midfielder Peter Whittingham is in hospital</p>
<p>Whittingham featured for the Bluebirds for 10 years and made over 450 appearances</p>

<p>Whittingham played just one campaign in the Premier League, appearing in 32 games</p>
<p>PETER WHITTINGHAM&rsquo;S CAREER Born: Nuneaton, September 8, 1984 Position: Midfielder Club career Aston Villa (2003-2007) Burnley, Derby (Loans, 2005) Cardiff City (2007-2017) Blackburn Rovers (2017-2018) Total appearances: 567 Total goals: 98</p>
<p>A police statement said: &lsquo;At around 10pm on March 7, South Wales Police were called to a licensed premises in Barry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A 35-year-old man from Penarth suffered a head injury as a result of a fall and remains at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this stage there is no evidence or suggestion of a criminal act, and it appears the injury was caused by an accidental fall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Enquiries are continuing into the circumstances of the incident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whittingham has been on a life support machine in hospital for 11 days with his family at his bedside.</p>
<p>The father-of-two was out with friends watching the England v Wales clash in the Six Nations when he fell down stairs at 10pm.</p>
<p>He suffered a major head injury and was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, but it understood he has not regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Ashley Preece, who works for Birmingham Live, tweeted on Wednesday: &lsquo;Spoke to a good friend of Peter Whittingham yesterday, says ex-avfc midfielder had been in a bad way &amp; everyone&rsquo;s praying for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His loving family want their privacy respected, please leave them in peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whittingham never received a senior cap for England but did turn out for the U21 side</p>
<p>Whittingham, who last played for Blackburn in 2018, made over 500 appearances during a career that started at Aston Villa in 2002.</p>
<p>In his teens Whittingham won the FA Youth Cup with Villa, beating Wayne Rooney&rsquo;s Everton side.</p>
<p>He was a stalwart for Cardiff and played for the club for 10 years between 2007 and 2017, playing 457 times for the Bluebirds and scoring 96 goals.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the second tragedy to hit the Championship club after their new striker Emilliano Sala died in a plane crash 14 months ago.</p>
<p>Whittingham&rsquo;s assured displays in midfield and brilliant left foot saw him linked with a number of Premier League teams throughout his career.</p>
<p>He played just one campaign in the Premier League, appearing in 32 games and netting three times.</p>
<p>He has been recognised as one of the most consistent and talented players in the Championship in recent history, with one particularly prolific campaign in 2009-10 seeing him score 20 goals from midfield.</p>
<p>Whittingham also played for the England Under 21s but never made it to the senior squad.</p>

<p>He played in the FA Cup final against Portsmouth in 2008 and the 2012 League Cup final against Liverpool</p>
<p>He made 17 outings for the Three Lions youth side after making his debut against Holland in 2004.</p>
<p>He was part of the Cardiff side that reached the FA Cup final against Portsmouth in 2008 and the 2012 League Cup final against Liverpool. He started both games but the club narrowly missed out on the trophy on both occasions.</p>
<p>Later on Wednesday, Cardiff City issued a statement to thank fans for their well wishes.</p>
<p>It read: &lsquo;We&rsquo;d like to thank the football community for their messages in support of Peter and his family,&rsquo; the club said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All of our thoughts are with them, as we ask for their privacy to be respected at this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The English Football League added: &lsquo;The thoughts of everyone at the EFL are with Cardiff City legend Peter Whittingham. We&rsquo;d like to wish him a speedy and full recovery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whittingham retired from football a year ago and runs a property development business with his wife Amanda from their Â£1.5million home in the Vale of Glamorgan.
