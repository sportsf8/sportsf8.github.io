<p>THURSDAY PUZZLE — The following is a public service announcement for those solvers who might be dipping their toes into Thursday-level territory:</p>
<p>Don’t freak out.</p>
<p>Not only is there a trick to this puzzle by Joe Deeney, but there is also more than one way to plunder it. Both will be counted as correct in all online formats except for Across Lite.</p>
<p>I say this not as a spoiler, but as a way to help solvers avoid the frustration that comes from entering an answer one way and hearing the commenters talk about entering it another way. Or from not even understanding what is going on. That is also a perfectly acceptable possibility, but I will explain the theme below, so hang in there. Trust me, you will like this, because it’s good to have to fight with a puzzle once in a while.</p>
<p>I also wouldn’t blame you one bit if you read the clues to yourself in pirate talk. Arrgh.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>The best advice I can give you is to keep track of the “8’s.” The surrounding clues are not that bad, although there is a considerable amount of general knowledge required. Work those crossings.</p>

With most major cities in the United States protesting police brutality and racial injustice in recent days after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, Mets first baseman Pete Alonso spoke about the situation on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the past couple of days, I&rsquo;ve struggled to wrap my mind around what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; Alonso wrote on Instagram. &ldquo;I have a voice and I will not remain silent. My heart has been broken over the murder of George Floyd. I will never know what it feels like to be discriminated against because (of) the color of my skin. To anyone who faces this type of discrimination, I will fight for you and be an ally. I will always stand with you. There needs to be justice and change made for the better of humanity. Let words be our sword and unity be our armor. Take care of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Floyd died following his arrest in Minnesota after police officer Derek Chauvin &ndash; who was later arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter &ndash; had his knee on a prone Floyd&rsquo;s neck for roughly nine minutes while Floyd repeatedly said &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After protests began in and around Minneapolis following the death of Floyd, other protests have taken place in New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, and elsewhere.

<p>Knicks candidate Tom Thibodeau joined ESPN&rsquo;s The Woj Pod with Adrian Wojnarowski and talked about what he learned from traveling around and observing different teams over the past NBA season.</p>
<p>One aspect that stuck out to him? How teams manage practices in the era of load management.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting because the way everyone&rsquo;s managing with load management and where your team is, sports scientists, it&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; Thibodeau said on the podcast. &ldquo;If your team is young and you&rsquo;re in a rebuild, you&rsquo;re probably practicing more than an older veteran team. In some cases where the team is mixed, there&rsquo;s almost two practices going on in one, where your young guys are getting the work that they need, and the older vets might be in the weight room getting strength and conditioning and then they flip it and then the vets will get their work… and then they come together for a short period of time to do something together at the end and maybe they&rsquo;ll watch film together at the end.&rdquo;

<h3 id="latest-on-negotiations-for-2020-mlb-season-players-union-explains-why-latest-proposal-was-resoundingly-rejected">&ldquo;Latest on negotiations for 2020 MLB season: Players union explains why latest proposal was &lsquo;resoundingly rejected&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://content.sny.tv/assets/images/8/5/6/313454856/cuts/750x422/cut.jpg" alt="img">
With owners giving approval on May 11 to Major League Baseball&rsquo;s proposal to begin the 2020 season amid the coronavirus pandemic, negotiations are now ongoing between the league and Players Association.</p>
<p>The goal is to begin a second spring training of sorts around June 10 and for Opening Day to be around July 1, meaning the league and players have a finite amount of time to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the latest&hellip;</p>
<p>June 4, 8:45 PM:</p>
<p>MLBPA executive director Tony Clark issued a lengthy statement on Thursday night following a call with the union&rsquo;s Executive Board, stating that while the players &ldquo;want nothing more than to get back to work,&rdquo; the call for additional pay cuts by the league resulted in the latest 2020 season proposal being &ldquo;resoundingly rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Earlier this week, Major League Baseball communicated its intention to schedule a dramatically shortened 2020 season unless Players negotiate salary concessions,&rdquo; Clark said. &ldquo;The concessions being sought are in addition to billions in Player salary reductions that have already been agreed upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clark goes on to explain that this &ldquo;threat&rdquo; from the league came after the players&rsquo; proposed for more games and extended playoffs for two years, among other things.</p>
<p>Clark states again that the players are ready to get back on the field and play, saying &ldquo;Important work remains to be done in order to safely resume the season. We stand ready to complete that work and look forward to getting back on the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June 4, 12:33 PM:</p>
<p>Agent Scott Boras, who was blasted by Trevor Bauer last week for sticking his nose in the labor negotiations, is again weighing in on the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NFL and college football &ndash; contact sports &ndash; could be playing in November, let alone December,&rdquo; Boras told The Athletic about Major League Baseball&rsquo;s refusal to play past October. &ldquo;MLB, a social distancing sport, says it can&rsquo;t play playoffs in November. Apparently the NFL and NCAA medical experts think differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The comments from Boras come on the heels of the league&rsquo;s rejection of the 114-game proposal by the players, due in part to MLB not wanting to conduct the postseason largely in November, when a potential resurgence of the coronavirus pandemic could imperil it.</p>
<p>Rosenthal notes that financial considerations could also be &ldquo;driving&rdquo; the league&rsquo;s reluctance to have the postseason take place in November, with the league expecting a huge financial windfall due to the television rights for playoff games &ndash; and there being even more money than usual to be made due to the expectation of an additional playoff round.</p>
<p>However, it should also be noted that the other leagues Boras is citing (the NFL and college football) would not be playing their respective postseasons in November, unlike the case with MLB if it agreed to a 114-game season.</p>
<p>June 3, 1:56 PM:</p>
<p>The league has rejected the latest proposal from the players and does not plan to counter, according to multiple reports, including one from Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.</p>
<p>According to Rosenthal, the league has started talks with owners regarding potentially playing a shorter season without fans in attendance, and is &ldquo;ready to discuss additional ideas with the union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joel Sherman of the New York Post reported that the league is &ldquo;sitting on&rdquo; the option of either having a 48-to-54 game season with players receiving their full prorated salaries or a season of roughly 82 games where players take an additional pay cut.</p>
<p>SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported Monday that even if MLB and the MLBPA can&rsquo;t find common ground to start a season, it will likely be played anyway. That idea stems from the March 26 agreement between both sides, which gives commissioner Rob Manfred the ability to unilaterally begin the season &ndash; though the players can file a grievance in that scenario.</p>
<p>Martino reported Wednesday that while the sides remain at odds over pay, they are expected to reach an agreement regarding health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>The latest proposal from the union, which asked for a 114-game season, was always expected to be rejected due to the fact that it would&rsquo;ve meant the postseason going into late-November &ndash; with the league wanting the postseason to end roughly a month before that due to the potential of a second wave of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>June 2, 7:51 PM:</p>
<p>During Burns and Gambo on Arizona Sports 98.7, Diamondbacks owner Ken Kendrick dropped some news: MLB won&rsquo;t be playing in November.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to take the risk of putting our players at jeopardy and our game in peril to be playing games beyond the end of October. So our model is and will never be changed that we will not be playing baseball in the month of November or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What that means is the MLBPA&rsquo;s counterproposal that had a 114-game schedule won&rsquo;t fly for the owners &ndash; that would&rsquo;ve had the season end on Oct. 31, pushing the postseason all through November. So there will need to be a compromise on the number of games, which the league will say is trying to make 50 games, but with pro-rated salaries in its next proposal.</p>
<p>June 1, 9:20 PM:</p>
<p>Even if MLB and the MLBPA can&rsquo;t find common ground to start a season, SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino is saying that it will likely be played anyway. And it stems from the March 26 agreement between both sides.</p>
<p>Section II, Article A of that agreement stated &ldquo;the Office of the Commissioner will construct and provide to the Players Association, as promptly as possible, a proposed 2020 championship season and postseason schedule (or multiple schedule options) using best efforts to play as many games as possible, while taking into account player safety and health, rescheduling needs, competitive considerations, stadium availability, and the economic feasibility of various alternatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Martino put it in his latest article, &ldquo;construct&rdquo; and &ldquo;provide&rdquo; instead of using &ldquo;negotiate&rdquo; basically says the league can start a new schedule from that initial agreement. If that were to in fact happen, players would be pay their pro-rated salaries &ndash; the original agreed upon compensation &ndash; and it would probably be in the 50-game range, which ESPN first reported.</p>
<p>June 1, 5:20 PM:</p>
<p>In response to the MLBPA&rsquo;s proposal for a 114-game season where players would not make any further salary concessions, the league intends to propose a season potentially as short as 50-to-60 games where the players would be paid the full prorated share of their salaries, reports ESPN&rsquo;s Jeff Passan.</p>
<p>The league had initially proposed an 82-game season where players would take additional pay cuts beyond what was agreed to by the league and union on March 26. That proposal was countered over the weekend by the players when they refused any additional pay cuts and asked for the 114-game season.</p>
<p>SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino noted that MLB being willing to pay players their full prorated salary &ndash; even in a shorter season &ndash; would be a huge victory for the players and also a win for MLB and commissioner Rob Manfred, who are &ldquo;who are prioritizing saving the season over a little negotiating win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>June 1, 11:42 AM:</p>
<p>With the league having received a counterproposal from the MLBPA on Sunday that included no further salary reductions, the regular season schedule growing from 82 games to 114 games, expanded playoffs, an opt-out for high risk players, and salary deferrals in the event the postseason is canceled, the owners are holding firm on two things, per Evan Drellich of The Athletic.</p>
<p>The first is that the schedule cannot be as long as 114 games, and the second is the need for further salary concessions by the players.</p>
<p>According to The Athletic, MLB and the MLBPA had a meeting on Sunday after the proposal was submitted.</p>
<p>That the owners are refusing to budge on the need for further salary concessions is no surprise, with the agreement reached between the two sides on March 26 having language that revolved around further pay cuts in the event games are played without fans in attendance.</p>
<p>When it comes to the length of season, extending it to 114 games would almost certainly mean a postseason that takes place largely in November &ndash; when a potential second wave of the coronavirus could imperil it.</p>
<p>May 31, 10:15 PM:</p>
<p>The MLBPA sent a memo to players earlier this weekend to say it was discussing what a counterproposal to the league&rsquo;s initial 82-game proposal would contain and when it would be sent to MLB.</p>
<p>Well, according to multiple reports, the MLBPA sent its counterproposal Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>The contents contain the following, via multiple reports:</p>
<p>A 114-game season, starting June 30 and ending on Oct. 31</p>
<p>Players can opt out of the season if they don&rsquo;t want to play</p>
<p>Deferrals of salary if there are no playoffs for players making $10 million of more</p>
<p>Total $100 million in salary advance during spring training</p>
<p>Two years of expanded playoff (matches MLB&rsquo;s proposal as well)</p>
<p>MLB has yet to respond to the counterproposal, but it may not be pleased with no further salary cuts &ndash; the main reason why the MLBPA had a problem with the initial offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No progress&rdquo; is what one ownership source told MLB Network&rsquo;s Jon Heyman.</p>
<p>May 31, 11:16 AM:</p>
<p>With negotiations between the league and players seemingly at an impasse due in part to economic disagreements, the MLBPA sent a memo to the players earlier this weekend noting that it was weighing the timing and contents of a potential counterproposal to the league, according to Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.</p>
<p>Per Rosenthal, the memo discussed the league&rsquo;s economic proposal that called for additional salary cuts, saying that it &ldquo;sought additional paycuts of more than $800M that it contends are necessary to make it economically feasible to play games without fans. &hellip; Importantly, the union still awaits key documents from MLB that would support the dubious financial distress claims the league has made in its attempt to force the additional givebacks from players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the heart of the stalemate in negotiations is the players&rsquo; position that the pay cuts they agreed to on March 26 should be the final pay cuts they receive. The position of the owners and the league is that the March 26 agreement left room to negotiate further pay cuts for players in the event regular season games in 2020 were played without fans in attendance, as the restart plan calls for.</p>
<p>With an agreement still not in sight and the league seeking to begin a second spring training around June 10 and Opening Day around July 1, the two sides are seemingly getting perilously close to a point where those starting dates may not be feasible.</p>
<p>May 28, 1:47 PM:</p>
<p>Agent Scott Boras, who represents Max Scherzer (who spoke out against the league&rsquo;s recent proposal on Wednesday night) and many other high profile players, has urged his clients to refuse any additional pay cuts, according to an email obtained by the Associated Press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, games cannot be played without you,&rdquo; Boras wrote. &ldquo;Players should not agree to further pay cuts to bail out the owners. Let owners take some of their record revenues and profits from the past several years and pay you the prorated salaries you agreed to accept or let them borrow against the asset values they created from the use of those profits players generated. &hellip; please share this concept with your teammates and fellow players when MLB request further concessions or deferral of salaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cincinnati Reds pitcher Trevor Bauer lambasted Boras on Wednesday night when rumors began to circulate that the agent was sticking his nose in negotiations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearing a LOT of rumors about a certain player agent meddling in MLBPA affairs,&rdquo; Bauer tweeted. &ldquo;If true - and at this point, these are only rumors - I have one thing to say&hellip; Scott Boras, rep your clients however you want to, but keep your damn personal agenda out of union business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With it now known that Boras is seeking to influence the negotiations, the missive delivered by Scherzer on Wednesday night has lost a bit of its luster.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as negotiations continue, the expectation remains that the two sides will reach an agreement, SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported earlier Thursday.</p>
<p>May 28, 11:39 AM:</p>
<p>As the players dig in and prepare a counterproposal to the league that will ask for a longer season schedule and not include any further salary concessions, the players understand they will have to make other concessions &ndash; with deferred payments potentially being among them &ndash; in order to get the shortened season underway, reports SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino.</p>
<p>With all of the above going on in the background, teams are actively planning spring training camps and working through the logistics of what it will take to televise games, according to Martino, who adds that players are preparing under the assumption that there will be a season.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently gave clearance for local sports teams to train in the state, which gives the Mets and Yankees (who had been expected to return to Florida for spring training) the option of instead having spring training in their home ballparks.</p>
<p>May 27, 11:21 PM:</p>
<p>The latest economic proposal from MLB to the players union on Tuesday was deemed unacceptable, as SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reports, and now Washington Nationals ace Max Scherzer has spoken out publicly on the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After discussing the latest developments with the rest of the players there&rsquo;s no reason to engage with MLB in any further compensation reductions,&rdquo; Scherzer tweeted on Wednesday night. &ldquo;We have previously negotiated a pay cut in the version of prorated salaries, and there&rsquo;s no justification to accept a 2nd pay cut based upon the current information the union has received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear other players voicing the same viewpoint and believe MLB&rsquo;s economic strategy would completely change if all documentation were to become public information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martino has previously reported that the league&rsquo;s top earners would be asked to take roughly a 20-30 percent pay cut under MLB&rsquo;s proposal, with their salaries already being prorated due to the reduced number of games.</p>
<p>Martino has noted, though, that the latest proposal, and the reaction from players, &ldquo;did nothing to change the industry expectation that MLB will launch its season in July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 27, 4:40 PM:</p>
<p>After receiving a salary proposal from the league on Tuesday that they deemed unacceptable, MLB players met virtually on Wednesday to discuss the proposal and will continue to do so, reports SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino.</p>
<p>According to Martino, while the proposal on Tuesday led to some heated reactions from the players, it &ldquo;did nothing to change the industry expectation that MLB will launch its season in July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the issue of player salary, the two sides still need to hash out an agreement regarding the health and safety protocol, with the players believing the 67-page health and safety proposal shared last week by the league needs to be modified.</p>
<p>As far as when negotiations could start to get more serious and gain momentum toward an agreement? That could potentially happen by this weekend.</p>
<p>May 27, 11:17 AM:</p>
<p>The financial proposal the league shared with the players on Tuesday, calling for further reductions in player salary with the biggest hits taken by the biggest earners, was met with scorn.</p>
<p>Still, as negotiations continue, the expectation remains that a deal will get done, as SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported late Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>With the goal being for a second spring training to start around June 10 and Opening Day to be around July 1, the clock is ticking.</p>
<p>Players and teams will need time to get all their ducks in a row before a second spring training begins, meaning a deal almost certainly has to be reached before that June 10 date (and perhaps well before it) in order for things to stay on schedule.</p>
<p>According to Jon Heyman, June 1 is the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; deadline, with June 5-10 the firmer deadline. As noted above, though, it&rsquo;s fair to wonder about the feasibility of the current timeline for spring training and the season if it takes until June 10 or close to it for a deal to be agreed upon.</p>
<p>Bob Nightengale of USA Today cited June 6 as a potential date the sides would need to reach a deal by in order to start the season by the weekend of July 4.</p>
<p>May 26, 5:58 PM:</p>
<p>Sources tell SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino that MLB&rsquo;s financial proposal to the union would see the game&rsquo;s top earners taking a roughly-20-30 percent pay cut. Meanwhile, players earning the MLB minimum would still take home nearly all of their prorated salary.</p>
<p>Martino notes that this proposal pokes at the class divide among player salaries, essentially meaning that the highest-paid players are telling the lowest-paid players that they can&rsquo;t have their money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve just taken the biggest problem in the union, the pay class divide, and flipped it on its head,&rdquo; a veteran role player told Martino. &ldquo;And now they&rsquo;ll watch as the union tears itself apart as the highest paid fight back on this while the lowest paid say &lsquo;whoa whoa whoa, we like this!&rsquo; The union will try to convince those young, naive players that it&rsquo;s in their interest to stand together, but it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Martino notes that days of difficult decisions lie ahead, he maintains that &ldquo;it remains our expectation, based on months of reporting, that the sides will strike a deal of some kind and begin the season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 26, 3:02 PM:</p>
<p>The new financial proposal submitted by the league has been approved by the owners and will now be presented to the players, reports Bob Nightengale of USA Today.</p>
<p>At the heart of that proposal is the plan for how players will be paid, with Nightengale reporting that it revolves around a sliding scale where the highest-paid players would be impacted the most, while players earning less would take much smaller hits.</p>
<p>SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported Tuesday that the owners and league have had enough talks with the players to believe the latest proposal can lead to quick dialogue, with the sides &ldquo;apart, but not irresolvable&rdquo; in negotiations.</p>
<p>Martino added that with talks continuing on Tuesday, there is still no reason to expect anything but an agreement and the eventual beginning of the shortened 2020 MLB season.</p>
<p>May 26, 11:34 AM:</p>
<p>With the league and Players Association resuming talks after the holiday weekend, MLB owners are expected to vote on the league&rsquo;s new financial proposal on Tuesday before presenting it to the union, reports Jon Heyman.</p>
<p>SNY Insider Andy Martino reported this past Thursday that MLB would soon make its first economic proposal to the players, and that an agreement on resuming the season could come soon after.</p>
<p>As far as what that agreement could look like, agents speculated to Martino that it will involve a modest across-the-board pay cut that includes deferrals, with Martino noting that outcome would look better to players than the 50-50 revenue-sharing idea that has been speculated on.</p>
<p>Some players had publicly pushed back on the revenue-sharing idea, and others have come out against any type of second pay cut.</p>
<p>But the expectation has been that in order for the economics to work without fans in attendance (at least at the outset), that a second pay cut would be necessary. The two sides are also working through health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>The target date to begin a second spring training has been June 10 or so, with the target date for Opening Day around July 1. And with players and teams needing lead time to prepare, the league and the players will likely need to get a deal done at some point this week or early next week in order for those target dates to be hit.</p>
<p>May 22, 6:23 PM:</p>
<p>MLB&rsquo;s new economic proposal for the 2020 season will be delivered to the Players Association on Tuesday, sources tell The Athletic&rsquo;s Evan Drellich.</p>
<p>May 21, 5:09 PM:</p>
<p>The Players Association issued a formal response to the league on Thursday regarding the 67-page health and safety proposal that had been shared with the players.</p>
<p>Among the topics touched on in the response from the union, per Evan Drellich of The Athletic, were the frequency of testing, protocols in the event of a positive test, protection for high-risk players and their families, and player access to pregame and postgame amenities/therapies in ballparks.</p>
<p>When it comes to the frequency of testing, the initial proposal submitted by the league called for players to be tested once every three days. The players would prefer for the testing to be more frequent.</p>
<p>May 21, 3:14 PM:</p>
<p>The Players Association plans to give its first official response to the league&rsquo;s 67-page health and safety protocol document on Thursday, SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino confirmed.</p>
<p>The union said in a statement, per ESPN&rsquo;s Jeff Passan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The union has spent the past several days carefully reviewing the manual and gathering feedback from its medical experts and players across the league, including a 3 1/2-hour video conference with 100-plus player leaders on Monday night, and we expect to provide our initial feedback to the league today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 21, 1:31 PM:</p>
<p>With the clock ticking toward what likely needs to be a resolution over the next 10 days or so if the league wants to remain on track to begin a second spring training around June 10 and have Opening Day around July 1, the next week will be crucial.</p>
<p>SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported Thursday that MLB will likely make its first economic proposal to the players in the next few days, and that an agreement on resuming the season could come soon after.</p>
<p>As far as what that agreement could look like, agents speculated to Martino that it will involve a modest across-the-board pay cut that includes deferrals, with Martino noting that outcome would look better to players than the revenue-sharing idea that has been speculated on.</p>
<p>The position of some players and agent Scott Boras has been that the pay cut players agreed to on March 26 should be the final pay cut. But the position of the owners has been that the agreement reached on March 26 included a stipulation that the two sides could seek further pay cuts for players in the event games are played in ballparks without fans in attendance &ndash; something the owners argue is not economically feasible without further pay cuts.</p>
<p>May 21, 11:48 AM:</p>
<p>With the league and players still in a staring contest over the economics of the potentially shortened 2020 season, it&rsquo;s expected that the league will submit an economic proposal &ldquo;by early next week,&rdquo; reports Jon Heyman.</p>
<p>In addition to the economic situation &ndash; with there being increasing pressure on the players to accept an additional pay cut, as SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported Tuesday &ndash; there has been reported pushback from the players on the breadth of the health and safety protocols that were proposed by the league in a 67-page document.</p>
<p>Among the health and safety protocols some players are reportedly objecting to, according to Jesse Rogers of ESPN, are restrictions on the use of certain amenities at team facilities and the proposed guidelines for when teams are on the road &ndash; where they would be expected to be basically quarantined in their hotel rooms when not at the ballpark.</p>
<p>May 20, 11:12 AM:</p>
<p>Over 130 players joined in on a conference call Monday night led by the union where the league&rsquo;s comprehensive health and safety proposals were discussed, Joel Sherman of the New York Post reported.</p>
<p>According to Sherman, the union is expected to respond to the 67-page health and safety proposal at some point this week.</p>
<p>The proposal, which includes plans and guidelines for coronavirus testing, social-distancing measures, expected player behavior, and more, was submitted to the players last week.</p>
<p>May 19, 6:01 PM:</p>
<p>The league has not yet made an economic proposal to the players, and when it does, it won&rsquo;t necessarily be the revenue-sharing plan that the union considers a non-starter, people with direct knowledge of the process told SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino.</p>
<p>According to Martino, the expectation remains that the two sides will reach an agreement to play the season and that any agreement will involve a further pay cut for players beyond the one they agreed to on March 26 that involved the players receiving a prorated share of their 2020 salaries.</p>
<p>The position of the players has been that the agreement they made on March 26 is the final salary agreement. But that position has been weakened due in part to a March 26 email that was recently unearthed by the New York Post.</p>
<p>In that email, MLB officials summarized to deputy commissioner Dan Halem a conversation with Players Association deputy general counsel Matt Nussbaum and director of analytics and baseball operations Greg Dreyfuss the position of the league that playing in empty stadiums without a further pay cut for players would not work economically.</p>
<p>May 19, 2:40 PM:</p>
<p>As negotiations continue to resume the season amid the coronavirus pandemic, the league recently gave the players two options, reports Jon Heyman.</p>
<p>The first option was to &ldquo;negotiate a new financial agreement&rdquo; for the players salary-wise that would be in place if the season resumes without fans in attendance.</p>
<p>The second option was to wait until the point where it&rsquo;s safe to resume games with fans in attendance.</p>
<p>The league, due to what it says would be financial losses incurred during a potentially shortened season without fans in attendance (at least at the outset of the season) has sought to reduce player salaries further from the deal that was reached on March 26.</p>
<p>With it not seeming feasible to wait until it&rsquo;s safe to resume games with fans in attendance to begin the 2020 season, it appears something will have to give at some point soon regarding the salary issue.</p>
<p>May 19, 9:19 AM:</p>
<p>Austin Hedges, a player rep for the San Diego Padres who has been involved in the negotiations between the league and the players, told the San Diego Union Tribune Monday night that he feels the two sides have been &ldquo;getting stuff done&rdquo; over the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really do believe we&rsquo;re to a point where a decision will be made. … I feel very confident it&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; Hedges said.</p>
<p>Hedges added that decisions are now being made instead of the two sides contemplating what-ifs, and spoke about the players making monetary sacrifices this season in order to position themselves better in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to make sacrifices anyways,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make those sacrifices now with the future in mind. Everything we&rsquo;re working for is not to make this year extra special. It&rsquo;s let&rsquo;s get through this year as best we can and cut our losses but make sure 2021 and beyond the league is going to be in great shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hedges said that he believes most players are on board, despite loud opposition from some key players regarding any additional pay cuts for the players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think (most players) are on board,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We want to play and bring home money to our families. … I think it will happen. Especially with what (Gov. Gavin Newsom) said today (about sports returning to California in June), I&rsquo;m excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 17, 11:36 AM:</p>
<p>In a presentation shared by the league with players regarding projected financial losses during a potentially shortened season, the league said the players&rsquo; current prorated salaries would contribute toward an average loss of $640,000 per game.</p>
<p>The presentation, a copy of which was obtained by the Associated Press, was called &ldquo;Economics of Playing Without Fans in Attendance,&rdquo; with the league saying it would lose more money with each additional game played.</p>
<p>Other details contained in the presentation:</p>
<p>The Yankees (at $312 million in projected local losses) and Mets (at $214 million in projected local losses) would be two of the three hardest-hit teams under the current 82-game plan. The Dodgers are projected to lose $232 million.</p>
<p>MLB broke down 2019 revenue as being 39 percent local gate and other in-park sources, 25 percent central revenue, 22 percent local media, 11 percent sponsorship, and 4 percent other.</p>
<p>The league seeking a further reduction of player salaries beyond the reduction players already took on March 26 has been a major issue as players and the league continue to negotiate toward a potential return, with some players (including Blake Snell and Trevor Bauer) outspoken against another reduction and others (such as Nolan Arenado) taking a more measured approach.</p>
<p>May 16, 12:55 PM:</p>
<p>The Athletic&rsquo;s Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich obtained a copy of the 67-page health and safety document that MLB sent to the Players&rsquo; Union on Friday night. The extensive document lays out protocols for testing, spring training, facility operations, travel, and on-field operations.</p>
<p>Some of the notable protocols include:</p>
<p>Regular testing for players, managers, coaches, umpires, and a limited number of essential staff members who are in close proximity to the players. All individuals will also have to take daily temperature checks at home before coming into the team facility.</p>
<p>Spring training will be limited to 50 players per club, with staggered reporting dates. Clubs are also encouraged to use other local facilities, such as college fields, for split-squad games.</p>
<p>Limited groups of essential personnel will be permitted into team facilities. This group includes essential on-field personnel, front office employees, public relations personnel, broadcast crews, law enforcement, EMTs, and others.</p>
<p>Player lockers should be six feet apart, and clubs can use unused or outdoor space to construct temporary lockers if necessary. Players will not be permitted to high-five, fist-bump, or engage in any other physical interaction with others at team facilities.</p>
<p>Players will not need to wear masks on the field, but they will need to be worn in the dugout, with all players six feet apart, using seats in the stands if necessary. Players will not be permitted to spit or use chewing tobacco or sunflower seeds in restricted areas.</p>
<p>Pitchers will have individual baseballs for bullpen sessions. Also, a new baseball will be used any time a ball is put in play or multiple people touch it.</p>
<p>When traveling, players won&rsquo;t officially be quarantined, but they will not be permitted to leave the team hotel without further approval, and only immediate family members will be permitted to visit players. Teams are also encouraged to fly into smaller airports when possible.</p>
<p>ESPN&rsquo;s Jeff Passan notes that MLB will issue 10,000 tests per week, and will also offer free coronavirus tests to all healthcare workers and first responders in MLB cites.</p>
<p>May 15, 1:05 PM:</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging conversation with Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic, Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado touched on recent comments made by Blake Snell and explained the current stance of the players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public should know that we want to play baseball,&rdquo; Arenado said. &ldquo;As long as it&rsquo;s right, as long as it&rsquo;s fair, we want to be out there. We want to go play. The misconception is that players don&rsquo;t want to play if it&rsquo;s not perfectly set up. That&rsquo;s not the case. We understand nothing is going to be perfect this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arenado, who told Rosenthal that he&rsquo;s not personally concerned about returning to play, said he understood where Snell was coming from but also sees the other side of things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re baseball players, right? We make great money. Regardless if we don&rsquo;t make the money we want, we&rsquo;re still making great money,&rdquo; Arenado explained. &ldquo;A lot of people in this world are struggling a lot harder than us. Some people might see him as a complainer. Some people might agree with his views. At the end of the day, he made some points I agree with. But he also made some points where it&rsquo;s just going to be too hard to get everyone on our side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 14, 9:29 PM:</p>
<p>During an interview with CNN, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred outlined the league&rsquo;s coronavirus testing plan and also expressed his optimism for reaching a deal with the MLBPA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of our players would be tested multiple times a week&rdquo; for coronavirus, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred says on the efforts to bring baseball back. &ldquo;That testing would be supplemented less frequently by antibody testing as well.&quot;#CNNTownHallhttps://t.co/zU95g1FwYr pic.twitter.com/J1MKyc5AJ0 - Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) May 15, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s hopeful that we will have some Major League Baseball this summer,&rdquo; Manfred said. &ldquo;We are making plans about playing in empty stadiums, but as I&rsquo;ve said before, all of those plans are dependent on what the public health situation is and us reaching a conclusion that will be safe for our players and other employees to come back to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for reaching a deal with the players on reduced salaries for the season, Manfred said he&rsquo;s very optimistic a deal can be reached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, personally, I have great confidence that we&rsquo;ll reach an agreement with the Players Association,&rdquo; said Manfred. &ldquo;Both that it&rsquo;s safe to come back to work and to work out the economic issues that need to be resolved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manfred confirmed that the league will use a facility in Utah to test players multiple times per week, with results available in 24 hours. If a player is experiencing symptoms, instant testing will be available.</p>
<p>If a player tests positive, he will be immediately quarantined until he tests negative twice, and any other player who came in contact with that player would receive instant testing.</p>
<p>Manfred was also asked about players potentially declining to play due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope that we will be able to convince the vast majority of our players that it&rsquo;s safe to return to work,&rdquo; Manfred said. &ldquo;… At the end of the day, however, if there are players with either health conditions or just their own personal doubts, we would never force them or try to force them to come back to work. They can wait until they feel they&rsquo;re ready to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 14, 1:57 PM:</p>
<p>MLB has partnered with a Utah lab in order to provide coronavirus testing to players and support staff, in addition to &ldquo;thousands more in the general public,&rdquo; reports Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated, who says the testing plan was presented by the league to the Players Association on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The lab, The Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory, will turn its current lab (which currently performs testing for performance enhancing drugs) into a coronavirus testing facility.</p>
<p>Any return by MLB this season has been expected to include a coronavirus testing element, but there had been questions surrounding the ethics of potentially using thousands of tests on players during a time when many in the general public are still unable to get tested. It&rsquo;s fair to believe the above agreement would allay some of those concerns.</p>
<p>May 14, 9:24 AM:</p>
<p>As MLB and the Players Association continue to negotiate, one prominent agent told SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino that there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no question&rdquo; some players will sit out the 2020 season due to concerns over contracting coronavirus and/or passing it to a family member.</p>
<p>As Martino wrote Thursday, those players will look at the possibility of taking a further pay cut from an already prorated salary and conclude the risk is not worth the reward.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Rays ace Blake Snell expressed his hesitance on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gotta get my money,&rdquo; Snell said on his Twitch channel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not playing unless I get mine, okay? And that&rsquo;s just the way it is for me. Like, I&rsquo;m sorry you guys think differently, but the risk is way the hell higher and the amount of money I&rsquo;m making is way lower, why would I think about doing that? Like you know, I&rsquo;m just, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snell then texted Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times to explain further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, honestly, it&rsquo;s just scary to risk my life to get COVID-19 as well as not knowing and spreading it to others. I just want everyone to be healthy and get back to our normal lives &lsquo;cause I know I miss mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 13, 11:19 AM:</p>
<p>The league&rsquo;s proposal to implement a universal designated hitter for the 2020 season is expected to be &ldquo;easily approved&rdquo; by the players, reports Jon Heyman.</p>
<p>One of the teams that could benefit the most from the potential use of the DH? The Mets, with Yoenis Cespedes, J.D. Davis, Robinson Cano, and Dominic Smith among those who could be beneficiaries of the extra hitter in the lineup.</p>
<p>When it comes to Cespedes, who has missed the majority of the last two seasons due to lower-body injuries, he could be the Met best-suited to DH.</p>
<p>May 13, 9:31 AM:</p>
<p>With the league and Players Association speaking Tuesday about the restart proposal (with the league not yet formally proposing its economic idea), the league will soon be sharing an 80-page document with the union &ldquo;outlining potential health and safety protocols,&rdquo; reports Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic.</p>
<p>According to Rosenthal, the document will cover topics including testing protocols and what could happen if a player or other essential employee tests positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported earlier this week that the sport would not necessarily need to shut down if a player tested positive.</p>
<p>May 12, 8:57 AM:</p>
<p>The &ldquo;sentiment of several of the game&rsquo;s most prominent agents&rdquo; is that a softer tone should be used during the negotiations &ndash; not a tone similar to ones used by prominent player agent Scott Boras and MLBPA chief Tony Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not speak for all of us,&rdquo; one prominent agent told SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino regarding Boras&rsquo; aggressive public stance.</p>
<p>May 11, 8:26 PM</p>
<p>Scott Boras has called for the players to reject the league&rsquo;s initial proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The players I represent are unified in that they reached an agreement and they sacrificed anywhere from 30 to 40 percent of their salaries so that the games could amicably continue,&rdquo; Boras told Sports Illustrated&rsquo;s Stephanie Apstein. &ldquo;The owners represented during that negotiation that they could operate without fans in the ballpark. Based on that, we reached an agreement and there will not be a renegotiation of that agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May 11, 3:50 PM</p>
<p>When it comes to what would happen if a player tests positive for coronavirus after the season resumes, a league executive told SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino that the sport would not necessarily need to shut down.</p>
<p>The scenario laid out by the executive:</p>
<p>The player who tests positive would be isolated, with the entire team receiving immediate coronavirus tests. At that point, any players found to have the virus would also be isolated and replaced by a member of the team&rsquo;s large taxi squad (which could consist of roughly 20 players). Players who do not test positive would continue to play.</p>
<p>May 11, 2:21 PM</p>
<p>With the proposal agreed to by the owners, the next step &ndash; as SNY&rsquo;s Andy Martino reported earlier Monday &ndash; will be that proposal being brought to the MLB Players Association on Tuesday.</p>
<p>During the call between the league and the players on Tuesday, it is expected that the players will be asked to take additional pay cuts beyond the already agreed-upon cuts that they took in March.</p>

<h3 id="mets-dominic-smith-details-unique-way-that-luis-rojas-helped-motivate-him-as-a-minor-leaguer">&ldquo;Mets&rsquo; Dominic Smith details unique way that Luis Rojas helped motivate him as a minor leaguer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://content.sny.tv/assets/images/2/3/2/312714232/cuts/750x422/cut.jpg" alt="img">
After being selected in the first round of the 2013 MLB Amateur Draft, Dominic Smith ascended his way up through the Mets&rsquo; minor league system, while receiving help along the way.</p>
<p>One of the people who helped Smith become the major leaguer he is today is his now manager Luis Rojas, who coached Smith at multiple stops along the way to Queens.</p>
<p>Appearing as a guest on The Cookie Club presented by Insomnia Cookies, Rojas told a story of how he helped motivate Smith during his 2015 season with the St. Lucie Mets, after Smith had shown up a bit out of shape and wasn&rsquo;t hustling the way Rojas and the rest of the coaching staff wanted him to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you hit one homer in Savannah, right? So I think it was in his head a little bit,&rdquo; Rojas said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a left-handed hitter, first baseman, a strong kid. He wants to hit more homers. So the next year, he came a little bit bigger let&rsquo;s call it, right?</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first month, Dom was a little out of shape and he struggled the first month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rojas told Smith he needed to bring more energy to his game, since the level of competition was only going to increase as Smith rose through the system.</p>
<p>But the left-handed slugger needed a little extra motivation, and Rojas came up with a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this, but they had an intern film me the whole time,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;Just me, like me walking around the dugout, me walking on the field, me running out ground balls. And I kid you not, it was pretty embarrassing to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that really opened my eyes because I never saw that from that perspective. I only played a certain type of way up until that point, so I never knew how bad it really looked, and then when I saw how bad it really looked, it just changed for me and I learned a lot. Luis helped me develop into the player I am today. I can&rsquo;t thank him enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This guy was 19 years old and things were so easy for him,&rdquo; Rojas explained. &ldquo;We knew that we needed to challenge him and we needed to see things from a different perspective with how the game was going to get at some point. He responded absolutely great. He ended up being the MVP of that league that year.&rdquo;

Major League Baseball does not plan to make another financial offer to the Players&rsquo; Association. The union reiterated on Thursday night that it does not intend to make other concessions.</p>
<p>And yet, there remains a high level of confidence in the industry that not only will baseball be played, but the owners and players will reach a new financial agreement.</p>
<p>The educated guess from one trusted source is that the final deal will call for 65-80 games with a small cut from the full prorated salary but a suspension of the competitive balance tax and qualifying offer. Whether the final agreement takes that exact shape or a different one, it will have enough sweeteners for each side to sell it as a win to both the public and its members.

<h3 id="mets-yankees-employees-among-highest-positive-rates-in-mlb-coronavirus-test-report">&ldquo;Mets, Yankees employees among highest positive rates in MLB coronavirus test: report&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://content.sny.tv/assets/images/9/6/4/313247964/cuts/750x422/cut.jpg" alt="img">
In the study that had 5,603 MLB employees tested for COVID-19 antibodies, Stanford Dr. Jay Bhattacharya found that 60 cases were positive. And though that is a 0.7 percent positive rate, the two New York teams in the Mets and Yankees were among the highest positive cases.</p>
<p>According to The Athletic, it was the Angels employees who had the highest rate in this test that is the largest of its kind to date. However, the Mets and Yankees followed, though Bhattacharya said the rates recorded were lower than counties in which they play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was expecting a larger number of people to test positive,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These numbers indicate these numbers haven&rsquo;t spread very far. But at the same time, we have had a zero percent mortality rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New York City has been a hot spot for coronavirus, with about 183,000 confirmed cases as of Sunday. But this study wasn&rsquo;t to check to see which cities are worse than the others. Instead, Bhattacharya said it was designed to see how far in fact the infection has spread in our country thus far.</p>
<p>There have been 1.3 million Americans who tested positive for the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. Stay-at-home orders are continuing throughout the country, while some states have entered a &ldquo;Phase 1&rdquo; to ease citizens back into normal life.</p>
<p>As for baseball returning, The Athletic&rsquo;s Ken Rosenthal reported the league will be having a call with the owners on Monday to discuss a proposal that outlines what the 2020 season could look like. If it is approved by the owners, players will then hear it on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Among the outline is the season beginning on or around July 1 with about 80 games played (that is subject to change with 78 or 82 games among options). Also, teams will only be playing opponents in their geographical regions. So, for the Mets, it would be the NL and AL East divisions. Expanded rosters as well as an expanded playoff format is also in the cards.</p>
<p>This test wasn&rsquo;t designed specifically to see if or when the league could resume play. However, 27 teams participated to help medical professionals like Dr. Bhattacharya get a better understanding of this virus to hopefully try and solve its ever-evolving issue sooner than later.</p>
