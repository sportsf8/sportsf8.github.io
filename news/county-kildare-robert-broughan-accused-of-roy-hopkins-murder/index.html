<p>A 25-year-old man has been charged with murdering another man in County Kildare on Friday night.</p>
<p>Robert Broughan, of St Patrick&rsquo;s Park, Rathangan, appeared before a special sitting of Naas District Court on Sunday.</p>
<p>He was charged with the murder of 34-year-old Roy Hopkins.</p>
<p>Mr Hopkins was found with serious injuries beside the Grand Canal at Glenaree Bridge, near Rathangan, shortly after 21:00 local time.</p>
<p>He was taken by ambulance to Naas General Hospital where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>A Garda officer told the court Mr Broughan was charged on Sunday afternoon. When cautioned, the court was told he replied: &ldquo;Are we going to Naas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge remanded the accused in custody to appear in court again via video link next Thursday.</p>
<p>He also ordered that a full psychological assessment be carried out on the accused, as well as any treatment if necessary.

<h3 id="independent-tommy-broughan-not-standing-in-general-election">&ldquo;Independent Tommy Broughan not standing in General Election&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.breakingnews.ie/remote/media.central.ie/media/images/t/TommyBroughan2016_large.jpg?width=600&amp;s=bn-977018" alt="img">
Independent Dublin Bay North TD Tommy Broughan has announced he will not be standing for re-election to the Dáil.</p>
<p>His announcement marks the second high-profile retirement of a sitting TD from the intensely competitive constituency after the decision of Independent Minister Finian McGrath to stand down.</p>
<p>The former Labour TD announced his retirement on Wednesday ahead of the noon deadline for the close of nominations.</p>
<p>Mr Broughan said he has been thinking about whether to run again or not for some time but only made his final decision this morning when he cancelled his 10.10am appointment to submit his nomination papers.</p>
<p>Mr Broughan said: “I’d like to sincerely thank all my friends and my constituents of Dublin Bay North (and Dublin North East) for their support over the years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After lengthy discussions with my family, staff and long deliberations, I decided not to contest the upcoming General Election. It was a very difficult decision since I have been a public representative for almost 29 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish my former Technical Group colleagues, Catherine Connolly, Joan Collins and Thomas Pringle all the very best on February 8th next.”</p>
<p>First elected to the Dáil in 1992, Mr Broughan had left voters guessing as to his intentions ahead of the election with an absence of posters in the constituency in recent days noticeable.</p>
<p>Mr Broughan was a vocal opponent to his own party going into coalition with Fine Gael in 2011.</p>
<p>He was ultimately expelled from the Party after he defied the party whip on financial matters relating to the extension of the controversial bank guarantee.</p>
<p>As an Independent, he aligned himself with the Independents4Change to allow the group to qualify for speaking rights in the Dáil chamber.
