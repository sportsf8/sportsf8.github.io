Two extremely rare white giraffes have been killed by poachers in Kenya, conservationists say.

Two extremely rare white giraffes have been killed by poachers in Kenya, conservationists say.

The bodies of a female giraffe and her calf were found in a village in north-eastern Kenya, the BBC reports.

In a statement to the BBC, the manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, Mohammed Ahmednoor, said it was "a very sad day" for the community and Kenya as a whole.

"Its killing is a blow to the tremendous steps taken by the community to conserve rare and unique species and a wake-up call for continued support to conservation efforts," his statement said.

The giraffes had a genetic condition called leucism which affects pigmentation and can cause white, pale or patchy coloured skin.

Conservationists told CBS News that it was not known exactly when the giraffes were killed, but they estimated it was about a month ago.

They believe poachers were responsible for the deaths, and an investigation was under way.

The female giraffe and her calf were first pictured in 2017 and made headlines around the world at the time.

Before then the duo had been the subject of long-running rumours of their existence in Kenya.

A third white giraffe was still alive, the BBC reported. It is thought to be the only remaining one in the world.

In Kenya it is illegal to kill endangered animals and poachers can face imprisonment.
