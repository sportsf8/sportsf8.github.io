<p>Mark Noble was full of pride and relief after captaining West Ham United to a vital 3-1 Premier League win over Watford.</p>
<p>The skipper was in typically resilient form at London Stadium in a game the Hammers needed to win to put themselves on the brink of mathematical safety.</p>
<p>Noble enjoyed seeing Michail Antonio and Tomas Soucek continue their recent scoring form to put West Ham two goals up within ten minutes, before adding an assist for Declan Rice&rsquo;s outstanding long-range third.</p>
<p>As always, the No16 demanded more from his teammates, and he admitted he was not happy with the Hammers&rsquo; second-half display, which included a goal for his friend and counterpart Troy Deeney, but he told West Ham TV the overall feeling was a positive.</p>
<p>We knew that three points tonight would probably make us safe so, yeah, when the final whistle went it was a massive relief! Mark Noble</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just gutted the fans weren&rsquo;t here because it would have been electric,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I know they were at home watching and you can feel [their support]&hellip; I obviously got a load of text messages today for a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be 3-0 up at half-time, in this case it made it harder for us because, with the amount of pressure we&rsquo;ve been under, to go 3-0 up at half-time you can&rsquo;t help but sit back and try to protect that lead because you know what&rsquo;s at stake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew that three points tonight would probably make us safe so, yeah, when the final whistle went it was a massive relief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Noble, West Ham is his life and has been since he made his first-team debut against Southend United as a 17-year-old in August 2004, 500 games ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care about it so much,&rdquo; he confirmed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hard one, because unless you sit in my shoes for a day, you don&rsquo;t see how I care about the players, every staff member and the way the Club does.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the age now where as long as the Club is winning, it makes me happy. I just want us to win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I train every day and I&rsquo;m fit for 90 to 95% of the games so to win like that, having won another massive game at Norwich, after the COVID-19 lockdown and going through our wage deferrals to make sure all the staff got paid, it&rsquo;s just a relief for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Focusing on the game itself, Noble felt it was one of two distinct halves, with West Ham controlling and clinically finishing their chances in the first, then sitting back and having to soak up Watford pressure in the second, particularly after Deeney had pulled a goal back four minutes after the break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, we were playing a team in exactly the same situation as us,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fighting a relegation battle and if they&rsquo;d won, they were probably safe, so they were going to have a go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be honest, I hated the way we played the second half. I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it at all, but what we did do was we dug in, stuck at it, didn&rsquo;t play well, but it really didn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that mattered was getting the three points and I&rsquo;m pretty sure all our fans at home were absolutely buzzing and the news was out today that they might be coming back in October and that would be lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Noble was asked to reflect on becoming just the tenth Hammer to reach the 500 games landmark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll appreciate it until I finish playing and I can sit up there and watch the team play, because when you&rsquo;re involved in it so much, you care about everything and you don&rsquo;t appreciate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen or 18 years ago I was standing outside Upton Park, trying to sneak in and asking for players&rsquo; shirts and here I am playing 500 games, Club captain and I&rsquo;ve been part of this Club for many years. I&rsquo;ll never forget it.&rdquo;

WEST HAM are open to offers for Manuel Lanzini and Fabien Balbuena as David Moyes looks to rebuild his squad.</p>
<p>The Hammers all but secured their Premier League status with Friday’s 3-1 win over Watford.</p>

<p>Now boss Moyes is keen to bring in younger players this summer to freshen up his team and add some much-needed speed.</p>
<p>But with limited money, he will have to sell to finance his plans.</p>
<p>Lanzini, 27, was once a target for Liverpool and valued at around £40million but the Argentina star has been a shadow of his former self since a knee injury on the eve of the 2018 World Cup.</p>
<p>With Pablo Fornals a younger and fitter option in a similar position, Lanzini is no longer a regular starter and the club would listen to reasonable offers.</p>
<p>Centre-back Balbuena is another who has struggled for fitness and form and has not convinced Moyes he can be relied upon.</p>
<p>The Paraguayan, 28, is understood to be open to the chance to move back to South America after two years in the Premier League.</p>

<p>The Czech giant, 23, is similar in size to 6ft 4in Fellaini, whom Moyes signed for Everton and Manchester United.</p>
<p>His bullet header against fellow strugglers Watford was reminiscent of the big-haired Belgian.</p>
<p>Our physical stats were very poor, we needed to add some more legs to the midfield David Moyes</p>
<p>And Moyes can see why comparisons are being drawn to his former favourite.</p>
<p>The Hammers chief said: “When we came here in January, we needed to add some more energy to the team.</p>

<p>“Thankfully we got Tomas because not only does he give us good energy and good physicality, he’s got a great goal-scoring record.”</p>
<p>Soucek, who has 25 caps for his country, hit ten goals in 19 games for Slavia Prague before joining West Ham on loan.</p>
<p>That deal can become permanent for £13m in the summer, a move Moyes surely will want to pursue.</p>
<p>The Hammers boss added: “He’s young and going to improve. He’s a great boy to work with.</p>
<p>“I can see where you would draw comparisons (to Fellaini) because of the stature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He scored a really good goal against Watford from a cross.</p>
<p>“It was an old-fashioned centre forward’s header.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He’s got three goals already — that’s a good return for someone who has only just come to the Premier League and only played ten games.”

<p>Ben Johnson lined up for just his second Premier League start of his fledgling career on Friday night when West Ham took on Watford in a crunch relegation clash.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old right back has been thrown in at the deep end twice in his short career so far. Firstly for his debut away at Manchester City last February and then again on Friday night as he replaced the injured Ryan Fredericks at right back. The Hammers came away with a crucial 3-1 victory to effectively secure their Premier League status for another season.</p>
<p>At the Etihad, Johnson played at left back and pocketed Riyad Mahrez as Pep Guardiola was forced to bring on Raheem Sterling to try and find a result, which they eventually did through a Sergio Aguero penalty.</p>
<p>Friday night was a different kettle of fish for the defender, making his home Premier League debut in a proper relegation six-pointer against Nigel Pearson’s men. After an iffy start, the defender impressed.</p>
<p>Johnson had seen Jeremy Ngakia overtake him in the pecking order as Fredericks back-up, maybe even a starter, before the teenager decided he wanted out in east London and refused to commit to a new deal.</p>
<p>Fredericks’ injury saw Johnson handed his big chance and he’s likely to keep his place for at least the trip to Manchester United as the Hammers remain coy on Fredericks’ problem.</p>

<p>The youngster showed signs of nerves early on against Watford. A long ball down the line from Adam Masina was misjudged by Johnson, who got badly under the ball and allowed Ismaila Sarr to escape his clutches and bear down on goal before Angelo Ogbonna intercepted.</p>
<p>Johnson then gave the ball away twice in quick succession in an attacking position as he started slowly but, after that, he grew into the game. So much so that Sarr switched wings and went on to Aaron Cresswell instead, where he had a lot more joy.</p>
<p>Will Hughes became Johnson’s primary objective and with the midfielder more often than not drifting in field, Johnson actually had a rather easy time of things as West Ham’s three-goal blitz put them on their way to victory.</p>
<p>After half time, Johnson was a bit more busy. Masina had been hauled off after being mauled by Jarrod Bowen and replaced by Adrian Mariappa as Watford switched it up and Abdoulaye Doucoure and Danny Welbeck were now Johnson’s men.</p>
<p>(Image: USTIN SETTERFIELD/POOL/AFP via Getty Images)</p>
<p>And Doucoure did get the better of Johnson in the build up to Watford’s goal as the youngster was easily dribbled past by the Hornets man, as was Angelo Ogbonna, before hitting the post and Troy Deeney snaffled up the rebound to give Watford hope.</p>

<p>But that was the only real mark against Johnson’s display. Three times he followed Sarr across from the right flank to the left as he man-marked rapid wide man when he had switched wings. Johnson was solid, if unspectacular, but that is exactly what the Hammers required when they had their backs to the wall in the second half.</p>
<p>Johnson has always been highly thought of at West Ham. Manuel Pellegrini saw his potential when he called up the youngster for a training camp trip to Marbella in January 2019. A month later, Johnson was lining up for his full debut.</p>
<p>Pellegrini took Johnson on pre-season trips to Austria and then to China for the Premier League Asia Trophy, where he was the only under-23 player to head to the Far East as part of the travelling squad.</p>
<p>The right back has had to be patient for his chance. He was named in the previous five matchday squads since the restart but didn&rsquo;t get a sniff until the six game when he completed the 90 minutes. He did a stand up job for David Moyes and Friday night may well have been his big break as a senior player.

<h3 id="three-reasons-why-west-ham-manager-david-moyes-was-spotted-at-charlton-vs-wigan">&ldquo;Three reasons why West Ham manager David Moyes was spotted at Charlton vs Wigan&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.football.london/west-ham-united-fc/article18621483.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1255590687.jpg" alt="img">

<p>West Ham manager David Moyes was spotted at Charlton Athletic’s 2-2 draw with Wigan in the Championship on Saturday afternoon, but who could he have been watching?</p>
<p>Logic dictates that he will have been keeping an eye on midfielder Josh Cullen, who has had another stellar campaign out on loan and penned a new contract in east London last summer though he is entering his last chance saloon in with the Hammers.</p>
<p>The permanent signing of Tomas Soucek, which should be a formality once Premier League survival has been assured, may well push Cullen further down the pecking order and the midfielder will have a decision to make over his future this summer.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the pitch at the Valley , Moyes has been linked with swoops for two Wigan Athletic stars this summer as he looks to rebuild his Hammers squad with young, hungry and energetic talent.</p>
<p>Left back Antonee Robinson is believed to be one of those players with the Hammers very much in the market for full backs this summer. Football.London understands Moyes holds a very strong interest in the defender, who nearly joined AC Milan in January only for the move to fall through.</p>
<p>Left back has been a target area for some time with the up and down form of both Aaron Cresswell and Arthur Masuaku over the last three seasons.</p>
<p>A new name thrown into the frame recently from Paul Cook’s side is that of centre back Cedric Kipre.</p>
<p>Reports this week have claimed the Hammers have made an approach for the defender after some impressive and he certainly fits the profile of player Moyes will be looking at, as does Robinson.</p>
<p>Kipre is 23, Robinson is 22 and Moyes wants to get rid of some of the expensive and ageing players in his squad this summer. That means selling to buy and there are players such as Feipe Anderson, Andriy Yarmolenko, Jack Wilshere and others who will see their futures coming into question at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Moyes has already set his stall out by signing the likes of Jarrod Bowen and Tomas Soucek, aged 23 and 25 respectively, as he tries to bring down the average age of his quad ahead of the 2020/21 season.</p>

<p>The manager has stated previously how keen he is to change the culture in east London, saying: “I want to stop the idea that what we’re doing is just buying someone who will fill the gap,” Moyes observed. “I want it to be the vision for the Club that we’re looking to bring in young, attractive, hungry players who are saying ‘we’re going to make West Ham better’.</p>
<p>“I know about footballers and I think players who are hungry and players who are trying to climb that ladder, trying to be Premier League footballers, we have to have a mix of that. &quot;</p>
<p>The Hammers took a massive step towards survival with a 3-1 win against Watford on Friday night at London Stadium. Moyes’ side effectively secured survival thanks to a first half blitz from the hosts as they were 3-0 up at the break.</p>
<p>West Ham are six points clear of the drop zone with two games to and have a vastly superior goal difference to their relegation rivals.

<h3 id="mark-noble-the-underrated-west-ham-constant-who-plays-huge-role-on-and-off-the-pitch">&ldquo;Mark Noble: The underrated West Ham constant who plays huge role on and off the pitch&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/18/09/westhamnoble1807a.jpg" alt="img">
It was a moment marked in a manner rather befitting of the man himself.</p>
<p>With only a few hundred here to witness Mark Noble&rsquo;s 500th West Ham appearance, there was no fanfare, no presentation. All that mattered was the result, and that was enough for Mr. West Ham.</p>
<p>When this squad have faced relegation battles in the past, it is always Noble everyone has looked to. The owners, managers, players and fans all seek inspiration support from his work, his commitment, his character. The latter is spoken about more than anything when it comes to Noble, and it is a huge part of his success for his boyhood club - but it can sometimes belie his talent as a footballer. If the 33-year-old was merely good for the dressing room, that is where he would be deployed - not squeezed into the side as a No10 in one of West Ham&rsquo;s biggest games of the season on Friday night.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, different managers have each tried to ease the midfielder out, call time on a fine career and develop the side. Each and every one of them, in their own time, have brought him back in. Reflections on his time at West Ham have seen Gianfraco Zola comparing Noble to Pirlo. That may be a touch indulgent but his role is not too dissimilar.</p>
<p>Noble is the constant at West Ham, the man who allows others to flourish while he looks after the important stuff, away from the limelight.</p>
<p>Carlton Cole played more games alongside Noble than any other player for West Ham, and has no doubt over his true talent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone knows if you train with him, and you&rsquo;re in the same football pitches, you&rsquo;ll see how good he really is,&rdquo; Cole told Standard Sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you come in [from another club] and you meet him and you meet someone like Nobes, you&rsquo;ll see that you can&rsquo;t really get around the fact that this guy is good for the club and that you need him to stick around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Snodgrass has experienced it from both sides, playing against Noble and then joining to start alongside him at West Ham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he gets a lot of credit for how good he actually is,&rdquo; said the Scot. &ldquo;He is a brilliant player, a brilliant man and a brilliant captain. What a hell of a player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only is Noble a driving force in the changing room, a connection to the fans on the pitch - &ldquo;he keeps the fire burning,&rdquo; says Cole - but he takes on tasks well out of his remit as a modern captain off it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows the ins and outs, knows the people and he lives and breathes the club,&rdquo; said Snodgrass. &ldquo;To take that mantle on his shoulders week in, week out is something special. He is driving others on every day, a top man for the new signings who come into the club he is the first one there if they need anything he is there to support them and their family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Noble is a welcoming presence for new faces, and certainly one any player can turn to when in need of help. It was Noble, in the midst of the lowest moments of the coronavirus pandemic, who reached out to the local area with personal donations while also negotiating a deal between the players and the club over wage deferrals. He too was front and centre alongside Jordan Henderson when it came to captains&rsquo; meetings during the shutdown.</p>
<p>While his character does often detract from what he brings in a purely footballing sense, Noble remains the one man who can remind people what this club means to those watching in the stands - if life had turned out differently he could well have been one of those with a season ticket. That understanding is something the midfielder constantly instils in teammates and even, on occasion, managers when he feels they need a stiff reminder. His role is not one many envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust me, it is hard to do a thing like that,&rdquo; said Cole. &ldquo;Particularly when you support the club and it&rsquo;s your local team, the passion and drive, what&rsquo;s expected and when you&rsquo;re trying to give that to other players that might not be able to do that, probably don&rsquo;t get it as much as he does. It might be a little bit frustrating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s seen through the whole eras of West Ham&rsquo;s change. Some of the new players that have come in, probably doesn&rsquo;t know what it means to be West Ham or play for that shirt. So it was only him having to explain to that probably the whole team on his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The claret and blue shirts rushing towards Noble at full time against Watford as he collapsed to the floor are recognition of his standing in this club. What happens next is anyone&rsquo;s guess. He would &ldquo;never say never&rdquo; to managing one day, a role Cole has touted him for.</p>
<p>For now, he more than anyone else has kept West Ham in the Premier League once more, players are growing around him and there are shoots of hope once more. Whether they come to fruition and West Ham finally start climbing or not does not matter to Noble - he wouldn&rsquo;t have had the last 16 years any other way.

<p>West Ham United scored three first half goals to see off Watford and take a huge step towards Premier League safety.</p>
<p>Michail Antonio, Tomas Soucek and Declan Rice were all on target in a blistering first half as West Ham made it back-to-back wins.</p>
<p>Waford improved after the break and Troy Deeney pulled one back, but the Hammers saw the game out to claim the points.</p>
<p>Watch highlights in the video player above. Apologies, a technical issue means there is no commentary on the second half highlights.</p>
