<h3 id="crossword-blog-meet-the-setter--encota">&ldquo;Crossword blog: meet the setter – Encota&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3698a8a943c898dc8ae3270de82cf6b3f5e40951/0_118_4983_2990/master/4983.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=c2c72902f423395eda80f0eac7d49ff5" alt="img">
The latest in our series where we turn the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this time is Encota, AKA Tim King</p>
<p>You may have seen a very long anagram of the latest version of government advice on the coronavirus. It was written by Tim King, who sets as Encota for such tricky puzzle series as the Listener, Enigmatic Variations, the Inquisitor and in the Magpie magazine.</p>
<p>The clue was the seed for a puzzle published at Big Dave, the site that reviews Telegraph crosswords and fosters new setters, among other things. So it’s the perfect opportunity to Meet the Setter.</p>
<p>Tell us about that long anagram and how it became part of a puzzle.</p>
<p>I’ve always enjoyed creating longer anagrams and had been looking at the revised government advice, STAY ALERT. CONTROL THE VIRUS. SAVE LIVES.</p>
<p>Then a certain Downing Street adviser was in the news and I couldn’t resist. I thought I’d better get it published in a crossword and cheekily asked the owner of Big Dave’s crossword site if I might have Saturday’s slot for a topical puzzle. Luckily, he said yes and I had less than two days to create a puzzle, including review and publication – a process that sometimes takes months.</p>
<p>Oh, and the clue read:</p>
<p>Government counsel easily survives travel North to castle after liberal interpretation (4,5,7,3,5,4,5)</p>
<p>Lovely. Where do you create your puzzles?</p>
<p>Around the house or garden here in Suffolk, sometimes with a locally brewed Adnams Ghost Ship beer to hand!</p>
<p>When did you get the crossword bug?</p>
<p>When I was about 10, my mother and I started attempting to co-solve the Telegraph. It never stopped. I solve over 1,000 each year, including 200 thematics and hundreds of back-page cryptics.</p>
<p>What makes successful clues?</p>
<p>Very precise wordplay, accurate but deceptive definitions and believable but misleading surfaces. It’s as simple as that!</p>
<p>What makes for unsuccessful clues?</p>
<p>Where the cryptic wordplay is OK but the surface is drivel. We’ve all seen them – and, on a bad day, I’ve certainly written them! I was given the fantastic advice “If you can’t drop it into normal conversation down the pub unnoticed, it’s not good enough.” I use this test every day.</p>
<p>Which other setters do you admire?</p>
<p>In the blocked style of puzzles, both Nutmeg and Serpent have a superb mix of precision and misdirection and Kea’s and Elgar’s combination of inventiveness and trickiness are excellent. In the tougher thematics there are many to pick from but I love it when Sabre or Shark’s names appear, as I know I am in for a challenge!</p>
<p>You certainly are. How did you choose your pseudonym?</p>
<p>My favourite rock band, Porcupine Tree, released an album called Octane Twisted. I simply had to treat that as wordplay. The anagram I chose was ENCOTA as it sounds a little like “encoder”.</p>
<p>Do your puzzles in the journal of the Institute of Telecommunications Professionals require in-depth knowledge of telecommunications?</p>
<p>Here and there it will help, but no, that wouldn’t be fair. Just like cluing a lesser-known word in a national daily puzzle, the wordplay is almost always easier, to compensate. For example:</p>
<p>Softly ticking watches resynchronising Internet communications, for example (6,9)</p>
<p>The solver will most likely know that “softly” can be replaced with P for piano, and is likely to spot that the other 14 letters come from an anagram of TICKINGWATCHES. With a little help from crossing entries and the word lengths they’ll be able to find PACKET SWITCHING, even if they haven’t really heard of it.</p>
<p>And what sorts of things do people tend to enjoy in your personalised puzzles?</p>
<p>From the feedback I receive, it’s seeing things about themselves in print, combined with a challenging but solvable puzzle. Nicknames, children and grandchildren’s names – even favourite wines – often feature.</p>
<p>How do you imagine a solver of your crosswords?</p>
<p>I hope with a thematic puzzle that the solver will be someone who gets a real buzz from that penny-dropping moment (PDM), when an additional hidden part of the puzzle is revealed.</p>
<p>Soon after I’d written a puzzle to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Monty Python, which featured the Funniest Joke in the World sketch, someone introduced themselves at a crossword event saying it was the best PDM and most enjoyable puzzle they’d ever solved. It’s hard not to be pleasantly flattered by comments like that.</p>
<p>You set a lot for the tricky end of the crossword spectrum. What would you say to solvers who are intrigued but intimidated by barred puzzles?</p>
<p>My advice is to look out for one by the excellent setter Chalicea. And you’ll need a copy of the Chambers Dictionary to hand, as the high density of intersecting words in a barred puzzle means that a good few of them will be pretty obscure. Then check the answers once they are published and repeat!</p>
<p>You will be pleasantly surprised how quickly you will solve more clues and get faster at doing so.</p>
<p>Agreed. And our Q&amp;A with Chalicea is also recommended. Many thanks to Encota.

<h3 id="solution-to-evan-birnholzs-june-7-post-magazine-crossword-field-work">&ldquo;Solution to Evan Birnholz’s June 7 Post Magazine crossword, “Field Work”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RQZUYFZUTZEYPBTI26OP6IP7ME.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Today’s puzzle is all about every homeowner’s favorite chore, MOWING THE LAWN (59A: [Field work that’s illustrated in this puzzle]). The letters of GRASS get progressively cut out of the ends of phrases and the first letters become replaced with the letters of BLADE (38A: [Green part of a field, or what cuts it (as also shown in the circled squares)]). It even features some green squares at the bottom of the grid. Moving left to right:</p>
<p>43A: [Park sign directive] is KEEP OFF THE GRASS .</p>
<p>74A: [Copper alloy used in marine construction] is NAVAL B RASS . When I first saw this phrase, I thought it generally referred to higher-ups in the Navy like it does for ARMY BRASS. While I’m sure people do use it that way, most of the searches that turned up for me suggested it was about the alloy. Go figure.</p>
<p>76A: [Pretty woman in Scottish folk songs] is BONNIE L ASS .</p>
<p>77A: [Talking biblical beast whose name uses only one of the five vowels] is BALAAM’S A SS . I gave the one-vowel hint to help out on the crossing with TAHRIR (85A: [___ Square, site of 2011 protests in Cairo]) since I figured that might be tough to spell correctly.</p>
<p>79A: [Handheld video game console with a dual-screen feature] is NINTENDO D S .</p>
<p>49A: [One of five human antibodies, so named for its epsilon chain] is IMMUNOGLOBULIN E . More about this below.</p>
<p>To round out the theme, we have GROUNDS CREW at the top (24A: [Field work team]).</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>You may be wondering why I chose answers like NINTENDO DS and IMMUNOGLOBULIN E. Surely, there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions of answers to choose from that end in -DS and -E, right? However, I figured the theme would be made more cohesive if I limited myself to phrases where the letters of B-L-A-D-E would not only cut out the letters of G-R-A-S-S but replace them at the beginning of phrases, so you’d have a phrase where the last word starts with a letter of BLADE followed by the remaining letters of GRASS. That way it would more clearly illustrate the concept of a lawn mower blade cutting a piece of grass.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that the last phrase leaves you with a multi-word phrase where the second word is just an E, and there aren’t a ton of options. There’s VITAMIN E, but to keep symmetry, you’d have an eight-letter phrase ending with GRASS. RYE GRASS? OAT GRASS? THE GRASS? None of them really grabbed me. I guess that’s another reason I should take Francis Heaney’s advice to “set yourself free from the prison of symmetry.” Ultimately I felt KEEP OFF THE GRASS was the most evocative phrase I could find and banked on solvers figuring out that the second word decreases in length until it reaches the E of BLADE.</p>
<p>A few other clues of note:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>22A: [Funky chicken quality?] is ODOR . The funky chicken is not a dance that I will do unless I’m paid to do it, but I thought the clue was funny.</p>
<p>46A: [___ Coin, antagonist in “The Hunger Games”] is ALMA Coin. It’s good there are alternatives to the old [___ mater] standby.</p>
<p>79A: [Grp. joined by North Macedonia in 2020] is NATO . This clue cheats a tiny bit in that the N of NATO stands for North and there it is in the clue, but it’s fairly current trivia, so I felt it was worth that little infelicity.</p>
<p>115A: [Car whose sales were hurt by the Eisenhower recession] is EDSEL . Somehow this answer has shown up in several puzzles of mine lately, but I’ve managed to find what I think are original clues for it each time. There’s no reason that I should be clicking with EDSEL.</p>
<p>127A / 21A: [With 21 Across, show featuring many twists and turns?] is STARS / ON ICE . Sometimes when building crosswords … the stars align for you.</p>
<p>61D: [Save “The Last Dance” for me, say?] is TIVO. My favorite clue today. No way I wasn’t going to use that after ESPN recently aired “The Last Dance.”

• The clue for 14 across in quick crossword number 15,631 (12 June, page 12, G2) included an anagram (“coy elm”) that unfortunately did not match LOVELY, which was the required solution.</p>
<p>• The cryptic crossword clue “Former flyer reporting dull conversation” called for the answer GREAT AUK. The clue should have said “non-flyer”; while the bird has long been extinct, when it was still with us it was flightless (No 28,150, 3 June, page 8, Journal).</p>

42A: No idea who this was, as clued; although Sergeant BILKO is a classic, I don’t know about his scheming character. There’s a lot of content out there! Just in this grid, we have pop culture references like EWING, ELMO, STAN (who could have been Fran), GINA …</p>
<p>42D: … and geography trivia, too: BANFF makes for great fill, as do ANATOLIA and TROY, as clued.</p>
<p>73D: Then we have an entry that has a little bit of both, a retreat for artists like Joan Baez and Henry Miller, ESALEN.</p>
<p>Today’s Theme</p>
<p>There are five mirrored pairs of theme entries in the grid today, all running across. Each pair shares a clue: It goes with the earlier entry, and it takes the form of a sentence with two blanks to fill in. At first, it&rsquo;s easy to think that we’re dealing with punny riddles, or riddly puns; the puzzle’s title, “Making Arrangements,” isn’t much help until you’re very close to figuring out what’s going one.</p>
<p>I figured things out pretty slowly, I think; after getting half of two different pairs (CONTAMINATED and ACTS PHONY), I solved the math question at the Equator of the grid, 64A/68A: “Someone who is ____ years old now will be ____ in six years.” With some crosses, I got FORTY FIVE and OVER FIFTY; something about filling these entries in slowly made it evident that they were anagrams of each other. When I revisited 23A and its partner at 114A, knowing what to look for, things fell into place: “Sign at a chemical plant: ‘This facility is ____ — _____” solves to CONTAMINATED, and, after “making arrangements” to the letters in that entry, NO ADMITTANCE.</p>
<p>If anagrams aren’t your strong suit, you’re going to have to do some writing in the margins today and cross out letters as you go. We really don’t see anagrams this beefy very often — 18 letters long at 31A/98A? That’s pretty wild — another one for the English majors, the first half of this one a fairly well-known Poe poem. All but one of these anagrams are multi-word, certainly a necessity for entries this massive, but they’re all perfectly clean, as long as you accept half of the final set (and I do) — VACATION TIME.
