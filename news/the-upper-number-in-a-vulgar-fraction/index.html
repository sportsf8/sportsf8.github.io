<p>Fans pack the grandstand at Ace Speedway in Elon, N.C. Saturday night (Photo: MyFox8.com Video)</p>
<p>Last week Stafford Motor Speedway management announced they had received approval from Connecticut officials to open their facility for private practice sessions as part of the state’s first reopening phase in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic.</p>
<p>Stafford Motor Speedway Chief Operating Officer Paul Arute called the allowance by the state a good first step for the track.</p>
<p>Arute praised the group of state officials he has worked with for over a month to assist in getting cars back on the track at Stafford. He talked about how having that positive open line of communication with those officials gives him optimism that the track will get the opportunity at some point this season to bring competition back.</p>
<p>In short, Stafford management is trying to work to show local and state officials that they can reopen responsibly under guidelines and restrictions put in place.</p>
<p>On Saturday night a little known short track in Elon, N.C. named Ace Speedway attempted a reopening strategy seemingly 180 degrees opposite of the maneuverings of management at Stafford.</p>
<p>In defiance of North Carolina governor Roy Cooper’s current state restriction banning outside gatherings of 25 or more people, Ace Speedway opened the gates for a racing card and welcomed a packed house to the venue, which holds about 5,000.</p>
<p>Photos and videos from Ace Speedway Saturday showed fans packed shoulder to shoulder in the grandstands for last night’s racing card. The event ultimately garnered much national attention, even getting featured on the website TMZ, which attracts about 8.1 million readers monthly.</p>
<p>And the question one must ask concerning the short track racing industry as a whole is, will the quiet, behind the scenes efforts to reopen for a place like Stafford Speedway be hindered because of the attention grabbing defiance of places like Ace Speedway?</p>
<p>There’s no denying that anyone who considers short track racing to be an important part of their life is frustrated right now by the fact that so many venues are shuttered because of current government restrictions due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. That includes track operators, drivers, car owners, crew members, track employees and fans. Nobody is happy by the fact that tracks aren’t open.</p>
<p>But is blatant attention grasping rebelliousness really the answer right now? And the bigger question is how will today’s rebellion play out in the long run for the short track racing industry?</p>
<p>Today’s world of communications is built on grabbing people who have evolved to have miniscule attention spans. One hundred word instant news stories are the norm. Quick hit social media postings have become what the world wants. And then there’s the matter of how simple optics prove to be major influencing agents because of those short attention spans. Pictures tell the story in so many cases.</p>
<p>For some, the optics of a packed crowd at Ace Speedway on Saturday are seen as a reward of a job well done by a track operator who stood up to the man and said “I’m not going to take it anymore.” Many around short track racing will see what happened at Ace Speedway Saturday and wear that as a badge of honor for short track racing, a way to show their sport isn’t going to be told what to do by government.</p>
<p>But then there’s the flip side of optics. There are the state officials in Connecticut who might not have a good understanding of what short track racing is all about. Likely those people have never even been to a short track event. And yet, the decision to let a place like Stafford Speedway reopen is in the hands of those people.</p>
<p>And while Arute can tell those officials over and over that their staff is ready to responsibly take the proper measures to safely reopen, one has to wonder what those state officials might think should they see the photos or stories or videos resonating from a place like Ace Speedway Saturday? Yes the optics of a little known short track in North Carolina can ultimately matter for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>And then there’s the question of the long-term scars left by disobedience of today.</p>
<p>Here’s a reality of short track racing. Long before there were any pandemic shutdowns or regulations, in many communities around the country track operators were already constantly walking a tightrope with local officials and community leaders. You can be assured that in every place in America where this is a short track there are people that don’t want it there and would love to see local officials shut it down or put major restrictions on its operation.</p>
<p>We all know that in most communities where there are short tracks there are people in the community that implore local official constantly to put more and more walls of regulation up for track operators. They want less days of racing, less traffic, less noise, shows to end earlier, camping to be restricted. The list goes on and on. And track operators have to live the life of appeasing local officials to let them continue to do business without allowing the chatter of track enemies in the community to influence their decisions.</p>
<p>So when you’re an operator in this climate right now who has basically decided the best way forward is essentially flipping the bird to state or local officials, how does one think that’s going to play in the long run? Probably a pretty good chance that defiance today will haunt a track operator down the road.</p>
<p>Two years from now when there is no pandemic restrictions and some uppity neighbor decides to forward the next community movement to put restrictions on a track or get it shut down, will decisions made by those in power locally be influenced by the defiance shown by a track operator in May 2020? Probably a good bet that local official who could make a decision to make life miserable for a track operator will remember well when that track operator was unwaveringly uncooperative during a time of emergency.</p>
<p>Before this pandemic short track racing was already facing a laundry list of industry-wide issues and pressures of survival. Why make those pressures that much worse for the sport when this is all over?</p>
<p>We all want racing back, but the cost of making that happen today by brute force and decisions rooted in anger could ultimately be horrendous. The hurt of losing a track forever in a year or two because of a decision made today to be a rebel will hurt a lot more than the hurt now of two or three months without racing.

<h3 id="the-enduring-romance-of-the-night-train">&ldquo;The Enduring Romance of the Night Train&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ea9ff8878fed0000976e370/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/200511_r36409web.gif" alt="img">
The second reason to travel by night train is flygskam. The word means “flight shame” in Swedish, and denotes the guilt that gnaws—or should rightfully gnaw—at your vitals when you realize that, by nipping from Berlin to Ibiza on EasyJet, say, for a skull-jolting weekend on the dance floor, you will, however indirectly, hasten the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. If you can spread the shame, forcing celebrities to charter their own yachts in a fit of conscience, so much the better. The vice of flying, thus exposed, has spawned a reciprocal virtue: tågskryt, or “train brag,” as practiced by those who not only swap the skies for the railroad but, having made the sacrifice, go on Instagram and tell their friends about it.</p>
<p>The science is solid. If our Milanese broker flies to Paris (a distance of around four hundred miles), he will—not personally, of course, unless he asked for a second helping of osso buco the night before—release one hundred kilograms of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That’s not counting the taxi rides to Linate Airport at one end and from Orly at the other, probably in a fuming snarl of traffic. Should he go overnight by train, the journey will be more circuitous, and maybe thirty miles longer, but the CO 2 output will be under four kilos. That’s quite a difference, and it’s genuinely hard to spot a downside, unless it’s the annoying halo of ethical self-satisfaction atop our traveller’s head.</p>
<p>Will flygskam have any lasting effect on commercial enterprise? The signs are (or were, before the advent of COVID-19) distinctly promising. A new Nightjet train from Vienna to Brussels, established by Austrian Federal Railways, or Ö.B.B., and lauded by its C.E.O., Andreas Matthä, as “an eco-friendly travel option to the E.U. capital,” had its inaugural run on January 19th. A serious journey, at just over fourteen hours. Ö.B.B. estimates that the rest of its night network has already saved the world twelve thousand short-haul flights a year: a delicious irony, given how greedily the budget airlines have eaten into train travel in recent decades. Further resurrections lie ahead, not least new sleeper services from Vienna and Munich to Amsterdam, slated for December of this year. One can but hope that such enviable schemes, intended to address the climate crisis, will not be stopped in their tracks by the rival plight through which we currently sweat.</p>
<p>The third reason to choose a sleeper train—and the most compelling—is no more practical than the taste of a peach. At stake, you might say, is a sense of latent adventure. Although it is unlikely, as you clatter through the night, that anything of note will befall you, the prospect that it could feels ever present, just out of sight beyond the next curve of the track. To remain awake to that possibility, even as we’re meant to be sleeping, is the privilege that beckons some of us back, year after year, to this awkward and beguiling locomotion.</p>
<p>No wonder trains and movies make such cozy bedfellows—so cozy that a train zipping through the darkness, with windows illuminated, actually looks like a strip of film. Plots, laid down on rails, dash ever onward; anticipation rises like steam. Consider Claudette Colbert, in “The Palm Beach Story,” who falls in with the rowdy millionaires of the Ale and Quail Club. Sweeping her up as a mascot, and boarding the 11:58 from Penn Station with a pack of hounds, they think nothing of firing their shotguns at crackers, tossed up by a bar steward like clay pigeons. As for Hitchcock’s “The Lady Vanishes,” the lady in question is a grandmotherly secret agent, who, before she disappears, daubs her name on the misted window of the dining car. A ridiculous method, in any other time and place, of leaving your mark; on a night train, though, it seems only right and proper.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe me, you have to believe Cary Grant. In “North by Northwest” (more Hitchcock), he boards the Twentieth Century, from New York to Chicago, without a ticket. By chance—or so he thinks—he meets Eva Marie Saint, first in the corridor and then in the dining car, where he orders a Gibson and, on her recommendation, the brook trout. The two of them return to her compartment, where, during a police inspection, she conceals Grant in the foldaway top bunk. Later, as daylight fails, they lean against the wall of the compartment and kiss, over and over, her hands caressing the back of his neck. “Beats flying, doesn’t it?” he says to her. Sure does.</p>
<p>Sleeping on a sleeper is easier said than done. In “I Know Where I’m Going!,” a magical film from 1945, the heroine, played by Wendy Hiller, caught the night train from Manchester to Glasgow, heading for her wedding in the Western Isles. And she definitely slept—lying in her compartment and dreaming of tartan-shrouded hills, as her bridal dress, hung on a rack, swayed with the motion of the train. But those dreams were bustling affairs, intercut with shots of pistons and wheels, and she arrived more panicked than refreshed. Thirty years later, in “Murder on the Orient Express,” the same actress became a veiled and tremulous grande dame, plunging a blade into the murderee before the train was halted by snow. It’s as if night trains, explicitly designed to aid slumber, implied too many other activities, beginning with love and death, to be truly soporific.</p>
<p>The ideal state, I would argue, is a delirious doze, peppered with fits and starts—the doze, for instance, of Anna Karenina, who gets a seat but no bed on her journey from Moscow to St. Petersburg. The snow outside is in tumult, but the compartment is heated by a stove: “She passed the paper-knife over the window pane, then laid its smooth, cool surface to her cheek.” You can almost hear it hiss. Anna falls into a fevered reverie, from which she emerges only as the train pulls into a station. Such is the paradox that awaits the night-train novice: you sleep on the go, and you wake when you stop. (Anyone who has rocked a cradle will second this observation.) In the early pages of “Stamboul Train,” whose narrative puffs from Ostend to Constantinople, Graham Greene points out this peculiar hiccup in the laws of physics: “In the rushing reverberating express, noise was so regular that it was the equivalent of silence, movement was so continuous that after a while the mind accepted it as stillness.” Do the minds of sailors accommodate themselves, with equal ease, to a raging sea?</p>
<p>I first had a chance to test Greene’s thesis on a pre-university pilgrimage from London to Athens, by rail, with a halfway break at Salzburg. Thereafter lay terra incognita, for the Communist bloc was still intact. I was travelling solo, in a couchette of six; my fellow-coucheurs were smugglers, brazenly lugging bags of Western luxuries—lipstick, nylons, and coffee—across the frontier into what was then Yugoslavia. I assumed that they had bribed the conductor, who padded up and down the car in socks, and left us largely alone. The date must have been mid-May, 1981, for an assassin had just tried to kill the Pope: an event of such weight that the smugglers and I, who shared no common language, reënacted the crime en route. (Surprisingly, they had no gun among them, so I was shot by a lit cigarette.) Having commandeered the upper berth, I lay there, reading “Wuthering Heights,” drifting off, and lurching awake, bereft of my bearings, whenever the train paused. I recall tugging the edge of the blind, peering out into first light, and seeing an old woman, quite still, with a bundle of sticks on her back. It was as if we had taken a branch line into the world of Brueghel.

<h3 id="amit-shahs-nrc-plan-decoded--communal-division-and-a-big-lie-too">&ldquo;Amit Shah’s NRC Plan Decoded – Communal Division, and a Big Lie Too&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/03160904/termites-constitution-800x400.jpg" alt="img">
Note: This article was originally published on October 3, 2019 at 2:05 pm and is being republished on October 4, 2019 at 5:40 pm.</p>
<p>In speech after speech, Union home minister Amit Shah and other Sangh Parivar leaders like Mohan Bhagwat have been insisting that no Hindu will ever be deported from India when their plan to create a National Register of Citizens (NRC) is enforced across the country.</p>
<p>At a political rally in Kolkata on October 1, Shah said, “I want to assure all Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist and Christian refugees that you will not be forced to leave India by the Centre. Don’t believe rumours. Before NRC, we will bring the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which will ensure these people get Indian citizenship.”</p>
<p>Now, if – like me – you were brought up on the values of the Indian Constitution, you would likely be scratching your head and asking how on earth a minister could speak like this. Granted, he is talking about refugees and not Indians, but by what canon of morality, law or tradition is it okay for the home minister to say India will welcome any and every kind of refugee as long as they are not Muslim?</p>
<p>The fact is that all this talk of refugees and immigrants is classic dog-whistle politics, and is an integral part of the Narendra Modi government’s overarching strategy of dividing the Indian people on the basis of religion.</p>
<p>That is why leaders like Amit Shah are trying to scare Muslim citizens and make them feel insecure about their place in their own country, while telling Hindus that this country really belongs to them and reassuring them that they will never have to fear their citizenship or devotion to the country being questioned.</p>

<p>This kind of politics goes against not just the letter and spirit of the Constitution but marks a potentially dangerous turn – even by the violent track record of Hindutva organisations. But beyond that, Shah’s reassurance to Hindu refugees, and those who care only for them, rests on a gigantic fib.</p>
<p>Ever since the 2014 Lok Sabha election, when Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) first began playing dangerous communal politics over India’s laws governing foreigners and citizenship, the government has moved swiftly to segment and eventually even segregate the country’s residents on the basis of religion. Let us be very clear about this monstrous reality: If we take Amit Shah’s words at face value, the only people without the requisite documentation who will actually face deportation once an NRC-type exercise is run across India will be Muslims.</p>
<p>India has more than 1.3 billion residents, the overwhelming majority of whom are citizens. A tiny, tiny fraction of the country’s population comprises foreigners. Most of them are probably long-term residents and it is safe to assume the majority do not have proper entry or residence documents because successive governments simply never bothered to create a rational migration and refugee policy. Of these, the largest single group are of Bangladeshi origin, but there are also people from Tibet, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Pakistan, most of whom have been living in India for years and have children who are full-fledged Indian citizens.</p>
<p>Labour migration is a fact of life, in South Asia and around the world, and is a product of underlying economic dynamics in which labour shortages are actually transmitted from region to region. For example, economic opportunities in North America lead to Punjabis migrating out of India. Biharis then come to Punjab to work the farms. But this means there are less Biharis available to work in West Bengal and Delhi, which pulls workers in from Bangladesh. Like Indians, Bangladeshis also migrate to the West, leading to skill shortages back home. A few years ago, the World Bank published data that Indians working in Bangladesh had remitted $3.7 billion back home that year – roughly half the amount that Bangladeshi workers in India send home each year.</p>

<p>Now India and the Indian people are very sensitive to the mistreatment of Indian migrants worldwide – rightly so – including those who are undocumented. Yet when it comes to the fate of undocumented migrants in India, we behave just as horribly as the worst racists in the West. Just look at the language that the government, the media and even the courts use to describe undocumented migrants: we call them “infiltrators”.</p>
<p>An infiltrator conjures up the image of a man with a gun coming to kill people. But an undocumented migrant is someone who crosses a border in order to make an honest day’s wage. Now, we have Amit Shah calling Bangladeshi migrants ‘termites’ and promising to drive them out of India. It is not clear where he intends to send those whom his government is able to identify; into the Bay of Bengal perhaps? Because Bangladesh has said repeatedly that it does not believe the people India wants to deport are Bangladeshis and thus will not accept them. That is why Modi has been forced to reassure Sheikh Hasina that she need not worry about the NRC and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar has said the consequences of the exercise is and will remain an internal matter for India.</p>
<p>The NRC process has already turned 1.9 million into virtually stateless people. Now Shah wants to compound the problem that has arisen in Assam by replicating this dangerous exercise in West Bengal and other parts of India. Since many Hindus have also ended up in this excluded list, the home minister is busy reassuring Hindus in Bengal and elsewhere who fail to produce the proper papers that their Indianness will not be in doubt. This assurance is a blatant violation of his oath of office that obliges him to “do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.”</p>
<p>Shah’s plan hinges on communalism, fear and division but also on a lie. This is because the government’s plan to accommodate Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain and Christian refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan has a cut-off date and that date is December 31, 2014.</p>
<p>In 2015 and 2016, the government amended the Passport (Entry into India) Rules and the Foreigners Act rules to declare that migrants belonging to those specific religions from these three countries would never be considered “illegal immigrants” in law provided they came to India before December 31, 2014. The proposed Citizenship Amendment Bill will make it easier for these same groups to acquire Indian citizenship, but again provided they came in before December 2014.</p>
<p>The carve-out for all religions except Islam, the limited geographic scope of the move and the cut-off date are proof of not just the government’s communalism but total insincerity and dishonesty as well.</p>
<p>If India wants to adopt a genuinely humanitarian policy towards refugees from neighbouring countries, it should open its doors to all victims of religious persecution and not just non-Muslims. This means Hindus from Bangladesh or Pakistan should be welcomed, but so should Ahmadiyas, Hazaras or anyone else.</p>
<p>Second, either you have a policy for the neighbourhood or you don’t. Why are Modi and Shah being humane to the religiously persecuted from just Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan? Why not Myanmar and Sri Lanka? By what logic is the government excluding Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in Myanmar, or Tamil Muslims and Hindus fleeing violence or persecution in Sri Lanka, should the situation (heavens forbid) ever worsen there?</p>
<p>Now Shah and his apologists will likely scoff at these objections because – as their guru Mohan Bhagwat reminded us recently – India is a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ and must therefore open its doors to Hindus who have nowhere else to go, while Muslim refugees have dozens of Muslim countries to seek refuge in. This is, of course, idiotic but if their heart really bleeds for Hindu refugees, why do they have a 2014 cut-off date?</p>
<p>Why is there no space in their new citizenship amendment for Hindus persecuted in Pakistan or Bangladesh since 2015 who fled to – or want to flee to – India?</p>
<p>Also read: ‘There Is a Road Named After My Family. Is That Not Proof I Am Assamese?’</p>
<p>The reason Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have no place for them is because they love power more than they love refugees, even Hindu ones. They know that if they were to scrap the cut-off date – which already violates the 1971 cut-off date stipulated in the Assam Accord – voters in Assam will surely throw the BJP out of power there.</p>
<p>So how do you “appease” Assamese sentiment while also appealing to Hindu sentiments in the rest of India? Modi and Shah calculated that the 2014 cut-off date would help them strike a balance between appealing to Assamese sentiment – which is fiercely against giving Indian citizenship to any Bangladeshi, even Hindu ones – and using the citizenship and NRC process to polarise the whole country and consolidate their Hindu vote bank.</p>
<p>This is the ugly politics which Shah is engaging in; it should surprise us that this politics requires the use of ugly, vulgar words like ‘infiltrator’ and ‘termites’. Depending on how desperate the BJP is to divert the attention of voters away from the real issues, the NRC exercise could be used to polarise India in ways we cannot even imagine.</p>
<p>Sadly, as of today, no one – not even the Supreme Court – seems willing to stop them.

<h3 id="some-soles-last-1000-years-in-landfill-the-truth-about-the-sneaker-mountain">&ldquo;‘Some soles last 1,000 years in landfill’: the truth about the sneaker mountain&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900d6606c9f6568dde03829a890e0bb2360fb478/0_146_3678_2208/master/3678.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=696f86888026e8656b0bf1b1e848933d" alt="img">
Sneaker Con is an aircraft-hangar-sized convention that smells worse and worse as the day goes on. I am at the London edition of the event, but it’s just been in Las Vegas, and is soon due to be in Berlin, then New York. Thousands of sneakerheads have paid the £25 entry fee and are browsing merchandise stalls piled high with sneakers. The price tags on these shoes are not for the faint-hearted: £550, £600, £700.</p>
<p>The attendees are approximately 95% male. Of the women here, many are the mothers of young boys. One of the few women not chaperoning a child is Helen. She lives in a rented three-bedroom house on the outskirts of London with her husband, Luke, and his collection of trainers. The shoes have filled up the loft and the spare room. When they began to invade her bedroom, Helen told Luke she needed some space. The couple booked a table at Sneaker Con, where their stall is piled with trainers which cumulatively cost tens of thousands of pounds. This expense has become a source of tension. “That’s why he had to stop,” Helen tells me. “Some are quick-strike releases: we’d be on a night out and have to pull over on the motorway to follow a Twitter link to get a pair of trainers.”</p>
<p>Helen says Luke has spent a lot of time investing in “one-off” trainers that are now being rereleased and are no longer unique. Luke tells her they are an investment, but unless they can turn a profit, they have been a poor one.</p>
<p>Luke walks up to the stall shrugging his shoulders and frowning. “It’s dead for Jordans,” he says. “No one is buying Jordans.”</p>
<p>In the global marketplace, labels have come to mean everything. A shoe that is “hyped” and worth hundreds of pounds at Sneaker Con one day can become worthless the next. Basing value on symbolism, rather than usability, means it lingers for a brief moment before the shoe needs replacing, fuelling production and an environmental impact.</p>
<p>Branded labels printed or sewn on to the outside of shoes might help to construct an identity for the consumer, but they are purposely blank in terms of how and where the shoe was made. The factories where shoes are made often contain hazards: a lack of fire escapes, poor ventilation and toxic chemicals. The people who make them often subsist on shockingly low wages: a family of four homeworkers in Pakistan, for example, may earn as little as 800 rupees (around £8) per day, while Syrian refugee children as young as six have been found employed as shoemakers in Turkey.</p>
<p>Unwanted trainers are now a certified global product. For Helen and Luke, they have come at the cost of a comfortable home to live in. Scale this up to the 24.2bn pairs of shoes that World Footwear estimates were manufactured in 2018, and they represent something more: the threat not just to one home, but to the planet.</p>
<hr>
<p>After they lose their cultural value, what happens to all the shoes we don’t want any more? On an industrial estate in north-west London stands the large warehouse base of Traid, a garment recycling charity. Metal shelves laden with boxes reach far up to the ceiling; colour-coded sacks form mountains many metres high; and rank upon rank of trollies stuffed with deliveries are lined up. The volume of discarded clothes and shoes is eye-watering. This stuff has been manufactured all over the world, but is being thrown away because it developed a fault, no longer fitted, had fallen out of favour, or was no longer in fashion.</p>
<p>Overseeing collection is recycling development manager Jose Baladron. Originally from Spain, he worked in the marketing department at Zara’s parent company, Inditex, before switching sides to join Traid. He explains that as shoe consumption has increased, they have become harder to recycle. “Shoes used to be 11% of all the stock we collected, 270–280 tonnes a year,” he says. “Now this has dropped to 6%. The quality has got worse, so people just throw them in the bin.”</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pairs of donated shoes are often separated in the collection process. Photograph: Kellie French/The Guardian, assisted by Harry Brayne</p>
<p>Rose Nkore, Traid’s sorting supervisor, has spent 20 years handling the things that society has thrown away. She has seen the quality of shoes fall, and finds more and more items donated unworn, the label still attached. “We get flooded with lower quality [items]: these go mostly to discount sales.”</p>
<p>Clothes and shoes deemed not good enough for charity shops end up on a second belt. “If an item is not good enough for the shops, it goes to the recycling companies, who grade them,” says Baladron.</p>
<p>Recycling companies sort rejected donations by style, climate, cultural suitability and quality. Once sorted, items are packed into bales, usually weighing 40–50kg, and are shipped out across Europe, Africa and Asia. It is a market that fluctuates with geopolitics: Ukraine, for example, was a key destination for secondhand exports until the conflict with Russia.</p>
<p>Sometimes thieves use children to climb into textile recycling banks – drivers open them up and a kid runs out</p>
<p>Once they have arrived, bales of clothes or shoes are sold wholesale to warehouses, who sell them on to local sellers. They typically break the bales down into smaller packages weighing 5–10kg, which are sold to stallholders in markets and villages. At the Owino market in Kampala, Uganda, one of the largest secondhand clothing hubs in Africa, there are so many stalls that local safari companies offer visitor tours. The contents of each bundle is a lottery: sometimes a market trader will earn enough money to cover rent and food for the month; sometimes they make nothing.</p>
<p>This deluge of secondhand clothing has been partly blamed for the collapse of East Africa’s own clothing and shoe factories, which thrived until the 1980s. The leaders of the East African Community (EAC) decided to take action, announcing that they would ban used clothing imports in 2019; but the US government, at the behest of angry recycled clothing exporters, argued that the ban violated previous trade agreements. Some countries in the group, including Kenya, backed away from the ban, so the export of unwanted shoes from the US continues. Rwanda, however, held strong and raised tariffs on used US clothing and footwear. They were suspended from the African Growth and Opportunity Act trade agreement as a result.</p>
<p>Many shoes are deemed unsuitable for these markets. While the public are asked to tie or strap shoes together before donating, pairs are often separated in the collection process. At Traid, separated shoes are placed into boxes until it is their turn to be tipped out on to the conveyor belt and sorted. The jumbled shoes roll up on to the platform. Working quickly, the sorters’ hands fly over the piles, spotting shoes by colour and type, and matching them back together. This is a lucky run – all the shoes are matched; a single scarlet baby shoe is all that is left on the conveyor belt. “Single shoes break my heart,” Rose says. “We know they can’t have been donated as singles, but the process means they get separated.”</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cheap production means many shoes are simply not built to last. Photograph: Kellie French/The Guardian, assisted by Harry Brayne</p>
<p>Outside the warehouse sit huge, bulging white plastic sacks with “single shoes” scrawled on the side in marker pen. These white sacks are collected by businesses that have a sideline processing single shoes. From London, they will go north to Hertfordshire or Birmingham, and then east, possibly to Poland or Pakistan, where warehouses specialise in matching missing shoes. Single shoes are laid out by type, colour, brand and size. When new batches come in, the shoes are matched as closely as possible. Sometimes an exact match can be found; if not, it is paired with the closest match and sold at a significant discount. These shoes are being returned to their most practical state – to protect feet – and do not need to be identical to perform this function.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another obstacle to shoe recycling is the intensification of gang-related crime. Raiding clothing banks is a surprisingly lucrative business: a tonne of good-quality clothes can be worth several hundred pounds. Traid say that, in their worst months, two or three tonnes per week have been stolen from their clothing banks. These textile banks, often found in supermarket car parks, are solid metal boxes that seem impossible to steal from. “Sometimes they use children to climb in – sometimes our drivers open the bank and a kid runs out and away,” Baladron explains. “Or they take the lock, split it open and get a key cut by paying a bribe.”</p>
<p>Upcycling – making new shoes out of old ones – crumbled, not because of technology, but because no one bought them</p>
<p>Gangs steal the secondhand clothing and take it to their own sorting facilities, hoping to find a haul of high-end items. In 2016, a pair of shoes implanted with a tracker were placed in a clothing bank that was regularly broken into. The shoes were taken first to a farm in Dagenham, Essex. There, they sat in a shipping container for a week before being shipped to Poland, where they ended up in a vintage shop in Krakow.</p>
<p>As well as being angry that people steal from charities for profit, Baladron is annoyed by the pollution this kind of theft generates: “It really bothers me – the CO 2 , transport, petrol. A piece that could have been sold a mile from the warehouse has travelled all over the world, and maybe if it is not sold in that shop in Krakow, it will end up in Uganda or Senegal. If it’s not sold there, it might end up in Pakistan.”</p>
<hr>
<p>While organisations such as Traid are trying to stop unwanted shoes going to waste, about 90% of shoes still end up in landfill. One way to prevent this would be to recycle them. Shahin Rahimifard, professor of sustainable engineering at Loughborough University, is an expansive, generous talker, battle-hardened yet full of enthusiasm after years of arguing with shoe brands. He started work on the problem of shoe recycling 15 years ago. The first idea his team considered was making new shoes out of old ones. If only one part of a shoe had broken, why not just replace the upper or the sole and create a new pair? But the upcycling idea crumbled, not because of engineering or technology, but because no one bought them.</p>
<p>Assembling new shoes from discarded parts may come to pass one day, but for now fashion renders styles obsolete by the time they reach recycling. Then there are the difficulties of quality control and uniformity, as well as the possibility of passing on any bacteria or lingering viruses – from veruccas, for example. In short, few people want to buy and wear shoe waste.</p>
<p>The option Rahimifard settled on instead was fragmentation: dismantling a shoe into its component parts, followed by post-fragmentation separation, or splitting the parts by material type. This is not easy. “Sometimes we see 10 to 15 different types of material in one shoe, including four different types of plastic,” says Rahimifard. “Companies buy insoles and parts of shoes from different companies, and the different companies use different plastics; some of the manufacturers don’t care.”</p>
<p>While mixing materials creates a hurdle when it comes to recycling, mixing colours adds similar difficulties, and using metal as shanks or decorative studs is a calamity, because it is so difficult to shred. “The way shoes are designed and manufactured at the moment doesn’t take into account their end of life,” says Rahimifard. “The inclusion of metal components makes recycling much more difficult. We are calling for a ban on the use of metal.” Some of the problems brands are creating are deeply worrying. Put a slice of ethylene vinyl acetate, used in the shock-absorbent midsole often found in trainers, into landfill and it will still be there in 1,000 years.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest One pair of shoes implanted with a tracker went from a clothing bank to a farm in Essex to a vintage shop in Krakow. Photograph: Kellie French/The Guardian, assisted by Harry Brayne</p>
<p>The engineering processes Rahimifard is developing will help recycle some of the shoes of the future. His team has turned fragmented parts of shoes into rubber chips, bonded together with resin. The sponginess of the rubber makes it ideal for use as underlay in basketball courts, and as surfacing for athletic tracks. Though becoming an athletic track should never be seen as a shoe’s final destination: the track surface will itself eventually become waste and need to be removed, recycled and reused.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dr Kate Fletcher, professor of sustainability and design at the London College of Fashion, has coached brands on how to reduce their environmental footprint. Her conclusion is that attempts to lessen the impact of single items are no match for the endless production of stuff: “The efficiency gains of all those small-scale reductions are simply not enough to outweigh the cumulative effect of consumption,” she says. What is needed instead is a “switching of the levers”, imagining the world in a different way.</p>
<p>Fletcher is so intent on change that she thinks we should fundamentally rethink the way we walk. Sports companies market trainers as protection and enhancement for the body. Part of this message is that footwear must be replaced regularly to maintain protection of the feet: running shoes are marketed as only supportive for 500 miles. Nike boasted in 2003 that its Mayfly “race day” shoe would last only 100km before it wore out (it was named after the insect, which lives for 48 hours at most).</p>
<p>Fletcher argues that, rather than offering protection, shoes soften and weaken the body. According to paleoanthropologist Prof Erik Trinkaus, humans started to wear shoes 40,000 years ago because that is when our toes gradually began to lose sturdiness; since then, the modern human foot has become reliant on splinting. “Part of the business model is to force a replacement, partly by requiring people to depend on padding,” Fletcher explains. “A simple way to circumvent the buying of new shoes is to walk barefoot: take them off. Or develop the strength in the ligaments, ankles, and knees to protect your feet if you’re walking without a support structure. Then you don’t need to replace them.” Companies such as Vivobarefoot offer “minimal soled” shoes as thin as 3mm thick, which it argues allows greater connection with the physical world.</p>
<p>But convincing people to create less waste by walking differently, or even to buy fewer shoes, is a huge challenge. Cheap production and the dominance of fashion means many shoes, especially the cheapest ones, are not built to last. The manufacture of footwear is often shrouded in mystery, leaving shoppers unable to make truly informed decisions about which shoes will last or which can be repaired.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rigorous production standards would give us shoes designed to last. Photograph: Kellie French/The Guardian, assisted by Harry Brayne</p>
<p>To counteract this, Fletcher has developed an idea called “the craft of use” – a way of interacting with the things we wear which is not about constantly buying more; replacing consumption with action by developing skills that help us to maintain what we have.</p>
<p>This change in mindset involves acknowledging that there is satisfaction to be found within the things we already have. In practical terms, it would mean removing materials such as metal which make recycling difficult. It would mean using digital scanning so that every shoe is a bespoke object, made to augment the body. It would mean rigorous production standards and modular design, giving us shoes that are designed to last, with individual elements that can be easily repaired, at no cost, by shoe companies. It wouldn’t have to mean lack of choice: shoe libraries could exist in every community, allowing people to access a variety of shoes without the need for ownership. Some existing programmes, such as the Leeds Community Clothes Exchange, are a model of how this might work: the exchange offers a token for each good quality item of clothing donated, which can be used to buy clothes other people have donated.</p>
<p>While major trainer brands occasionally bring out product lines that are marketed as eco-friendly, these shoes represent a small percentage of their output, and a fraction of shoe production as a whole. Nike recently launched a Space Hippie shoe, parts of which are made of factory waste. But one speciality product is no match for the ecological impact of a global brand such as Nike, which produces hundreds of millions of shoes every year. It also begs the question of why, if brands have the capacity to produce less harmful shoes, they don’t apply these planet-friendly methods to everything they do.</p>
<p>Would you wear clothes made from rubbish? Read more</p>
<p>Back in his small laboratory, Rahimifard is adamant that brands should invest in solving the problem of shoe waste by financing research. For a global industry with an estimated worth of more than $200bn in 2020, this should not be a big ask. One plan being developed in the laboratory is perhaps the most fitting answer to excessive consumerism. Dr Richard Heath, a colleague of Rahimifard’s, wants people to eat their shoes. It’s not impossible – the German film director Werner Herzog once did it after losing a bet to another director; he took his shoes to a top Californian restaurant, boiled them for five hours, seasoned generously, and ate one on stage. Heath, meanwhile, has a less theatrical approach: he is investigating whether post-consumer leather could be treated like animal hide and broken down into gelatine and fibres, which could then be used as a food ingredient. Running shoe jelly, anyone?</p>

It was elegant and weird, this bipartisan gathering of two ­parties irreconcilably split over Trump’s fate, come to the Capitol to stand for him and clap for him and listen to his teleprompted musings on the state of the nation. The exterior of the House end of the building happened to be covered in plastic tarp and scaffolding for repairs, lending the affair a sort of quarantine vibe as the members and their guests filed in for the evening.</p>
<p>“My Democratic colleagues, they sat on their hands last time, even when there wasn’t an impeachment,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), posing for photos beside a sculpture of Will Rogers outside Statuary Hall. “They’ll sit on their hands this time, in spite of impeachment.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>A few paces away, Democratic members filtered out of the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and wandered the Capitol, waiting for a man many of them loathe. More than half a dozen members of Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), refused to attend. Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) boycotted the speech, too, but still made an appearance at the pre-gathering, striding through the corridors in suffragette white, which many other Democrats also wore, and a naturally bald scalp.</p>
<p>“You are beautiful and amazing,” a man called to her from the top of a stairwell.</p>
<p>None of the three senators running for the Democratic presidential nomination showed up, having jetted back to the campaign trail — though they might be back in Washington on Wednesday, when the Senate is expected to acquit Trump of abuse of office and obstruction. Rep. Ilhan Omar — a Somalia-born Democrat from Minnesota whom Trump said last year should “go back” to where she came from — sat near the back of the chamber as the president’s entourage filed in at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“My presence tonight is resistance,” she wrote in a tweet before the event.</p>
<p>At the impeachment managers’ table — there is not actually an impeachment managers’ table at the State of the Union, but the seven Democratic representatives prosecuting the case for Trump’s removal all ended up sitting together anyway — Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) intently studied a pamphlet as Vice President Pence shook hands on his way down the aisle.</p>
<p>As Trump arrived at the podium and handed his speech to Pelosi and Pence, the speaker reached out her hand to shake the president’s, and he did not reciprocate, though whether it was an intentional snub is unclear (he didn’t shake Pence’s either).</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Trump’s previous annual addresses were relatively anodyne things: forward-looking, poetic, a world away from the typo-riddled, all-caps rage that constitutes his daily public addresses on Twitter. Republicans had been fretting that he would not restrain himself this time — in the same chamber whose occupants impeached him weeks earlier. But Trump, like the impeached Bill Clinton before him, made no mention of the fact. He strode into the chamber directly past Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over his trial, and launched into the same themeless checklist of alleged accomplishments and airy promises that presidents have been soothing the nation with for decades.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“America’s enemies are on the run, America’s fortunes are on the rise and America’s future is blazing bright,” Trump began, leaving unspecific which enemies he meant as Democrats stared and Republicans cheered.</p>
<p>His speech started tinny and raspy — at least so it seemed from the upper balconies — but Trump found his volume and cadence as he proceeded through the highlights of his presidency and took veiled swipes at his opponents. “Socialism destroys nations,” he said. Omar spat something into a napkin.</p>
<p>Only a few parts of the speech brought the entire room together in applause: when Trump praised an eighth-grade aspiring astronaut, and a 100-year-old Tuskegee Airman. When the president called out the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in the balcony, and first lady Melania Trump hung a Medal of Freedom on his neck, an “Oh no!” floated from the Democratic side of the chamber at the same time as a Republican shouted “Thank you, Rush!”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>When Trump told Congress to “get a bill on my desk” that would lower prescription drug prices, Democrats held up three fingers and chanted “H.R. 3” — a reference to the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which passed the House but has not been taken up by the Senate. Fred Guttenberg, a guest of Pelosi’s who lost his daughter in the Parkland shooting, reportedly started shouting when Trump talked about gun rights and was escorted out.</p>
<p>It went like that for more than an hour — lines to thrill Republicans and leave Democrats groaning or clapping limply in their seats. Omar left her chair before the speech ended, and several Democratic members flipped through their phones as Trump recounted “the night that United States Special Forces operators ended [Islamic State leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi’s miserable life.”</p>
