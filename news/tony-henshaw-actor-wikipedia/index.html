<p>The final episode of The A Word series 3 pays touching tribute to Tony Henshaw but just who was this much-loved crew member?</p>
<p>It has been three years since The A Word last appeared on our screens and it’s safe to say that a lot has changed in that time.</p>
<p>When series 2 aired in 2017, no one could have predicted that series 3 would arrive amidst the worst pandemic in over 100 years and we’d be forced to watch the much-loved drama while in a nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>Well, that’s exactly what has happened but as a result, you could argue that series 3 couldn’t have arrived at a better time.</p>
<p>Not only that, but thanks to BBC iPlayer, all six episodes of the new series are available to watch now.</p>
<p>And for those who have binged their way to the end of series 3, they will have been greeted with a touching tribute as the final set of credits started to roll.</p>
<p>The A Word: Series 3 Trailer | BBC Trailers brid 538648 The A Word: Series 3 Trailer | BBC Trailers /static/uploads/2020/04/547438_t_1587579570.jpg 547438 center</p>
<p>The A Word series 3 on the BBC</p>
<p>Series 3 of The A Word arrived on BBC One on May 5th, 2020.</p>
<p>On top of that, all six episodes in the new series arrived on BBC iPlayer at the same time.</p>
<p>Series 3 offers up the biggest shake up in young Joe Hughes’ life as his parents, Paul and Alison, are in the midst of a split that leaves Joe travelling between Manchester and the Lake District, something that he struggles with due to his autism.</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>The ending of episode 6</p>
<p>Series 3 of The A Word ends in typically charming fashion.</p>
<p>After returning home pregnant from university earlier in the series, Joe’s sister, Rebecca, gives birth after going into labour in the middle of their journey home.</p>
<p>Following the drama of episode 6, the family regroup for a family photo and we end the series with Joe singing along to his music as he walks down a scenic Lake District road.</p>
<p>Just as the credits start to roll, a touching tribute appears in memory of Tony Henshaw but just who was this much-loved figure?</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>Who was Tony Henshaw?</p>
<p>Tony Henshaw, who passed away in late 2019, was a member of The A Word’s art department in 2016’s series 1.</p>
<p>He worked as a property manager on the show, looking after props and sets that appeared throughout the series and also ran his own company, Keystone Productions until his death.</p>
<p>Henshaw has over 20 production credits according to IMDb and worked on projects such as Citizen Khan, CBBC’s World’s End, Young Dracula, Casualty 1909 and Waterloo Road among others.</p>
<p>The A Word series 3 is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer while episodes are also airing weekly on BBC One.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-milly-alcock-age-instagram-and-roles-before-upright-on-sky--hitc">&ldquo;Who is Milly Alcock? Age, Instagram and roles before Upright on Sky – HITC&rdquo;</h3>

<p>Upright is heading to Sky Atlantic on November 29th. Say hello to its up-and-coming star Milly Alcock.</p>
<p>Tim Minchin is a bit weird. In a good way of course. After all, it is sort of his act.</p>
<p>As a result of Tim Minchin’s weirdness, it’s always fascinating to see what the Australian actor, comedian and musician gets up to as it’s usually pretty darn good.</p>
<p>His latest project to hit our screen is the Australian comedy-drama series Upright, which Minchin both co-wrote and stars in.</p>
<p>The Aussie actor isn’t alone in the series and is joined by actress Milly Alcock as his partner in crime.</p>
<p>The story of Upright and how to watch</p>
<p>Upright follows two unlikely companions, brought together by chance, as they embark on a quest to transport a precious upright piano from one side of the massive Australian desert to the other without being eaten by crocodiles, snakes, spiders or koalas – except maybe not that last one.</p>
<p>Upright arrives here in the UK on November 29th at 10pm on Sky Atlantic whereas for those Down Under, the series arrives on Fox Showcase on December 1st.</p>
<p>If you can’t catch the series on Sky, the streaming service Now TV will no doubt be showing the series as well.</p>
<p>Meet Milly Alcock</p>
<p>Milly Alcock is a 19-year-old Australian actress with a hugely bright future ahead of her.</p>
<p>Despite her young age, she’s already appeared in plenty of TV series with 12 acting credits to her name so far according to IMDb.</p>
<p>In Upright, Milly Alcock plays the character Meg who gets dragged into the story after a chance meeting with Lucky Flynn (Tim Minchin).</p>
<p>The young actress has not shied away from sharing her excitement about the show and took to Instagram last month to gush about the upcoming series.</p>
<p>What else has Milly Alcock been in?</p>
<p>Milly Alcock’s acting career began in earnest back in 2014 with a single-episode appearance in the TV series Wonderland.</p>
<p>Since then, she’s gone on to appear in some fairly major roles in TV with the likes of Les Norton, The School and Netflix’s Pine Gap among her filmography to date.</p>
<p>Starring alongside Tim Minchin is no mean feat and should propel the 19-year-old to bigger and better things to come.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-liam-mccheyne-harrison-actor-steals-the-show-in-last-tango-in-halifax--hitc">&ldquo;Who is Liam McCheyne? Harrison actor steals the show in Last Tango in Halifax – HITC&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/hitcn/1789/20001786_low__1521640.jpg" alt="img">
The fifth series of Last Tango in Halifax came to a dramatic conclusion on March 15th with Liam McCheyne stealing the show.</p>
<p>It’s always fascinating to watch the rise of an up and coming actor.</p>
<p>For certain young stars, fans will follow their careers from their first childhood to acting roles as an adult.</p>
<p>The BBC comedy-drama series Last Tango in Halifax may star an ageing cast for the most part but series 5 has a new addition that has certainly rocked the boat.</p>
<p>That new addition is Liam McCheyne as Harrison but just what do we know about this rising star?</p>
<p>Harrison in Last Tango in Halifax</p>
<p>We’re introduced to Harrison in Last Tango in Halifax’s fifth series.</p>
<p>He’s a foster child who has abandoned his foster family and has been living in Celia’s shed.</p>
<p>In episode 4, Harrison emerges from his shed and comes across Ted and the pair get to talking and decide to go on an impromptu adventure to Bridlington.</p>
<p>Meet newcomer Liam McCheyne</p>
<p>Taking on the role of the young and mischievous Harrison is Liam McCheyne.</p>
<p>Liam has been acting since 2011 when he was a toddler.</p>
<p>In 2011 he appeared alongside his twin brother, Connor, as Dylan Wilson in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street.</p>
<p>Since then, he’s appeared in the TV series Moving On and The Bay as well as the TV film Mother’s Day.</p>
<p>Liam’s exact age isn’t known but if we take a look at his acting career to date we can make a good estimate.</p>
<p>His character in Coronation Street, Dylan Wilson, was three years old when Liam played him in 2011.</p>
<p>So if Liam was the same age as his character in 2011, he would be around 12 or 13 years old now.</p>
<p>Fans are hugely impressed</p>
<p>Following the fourth and final episode of Last Tango’s fifth series, fans have been left hugely impressed by the acting on display from Liam McCheyne.</p>
<p>Many have taken to social media to heap praise on the upcoming actor.</p>
<p>One fan on Twitter wrote: “Liam brilliant. The series was superb, let’s have another one soon.”</p>
<p>While another added: “Loved your scenes with Timothy West tonight on #LastTangoInHalifax Good Luck with your career young man.”</p>
<p>And finally, fellow Last Tango co-star Rachel Leskovac was also full of praise.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-david-stakston-ragnarok-stars-age-instagram-and-previous-roles--hitc">&ldquo;Who is David Stakston? Ragnarok star’s age, Instagram and previous roles – HITC&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/hitcn/1738/ragnarok_1476182.jpg" alt="img">
Move over Thor, David Stakston is bringing the thunder.</p>
<p>Ragnarok fans are already obsessed with David Stakston!</p>
<p>Netflix has given us so many great shows over the years, there’s no doubt. Sure, there are some that have us patiently waiting for new seasons, but arguably, the biggest thrill is when you stumble across a complete gem that was off your radar.</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve had the likes of The Stranger which suddenly surfaced and secured our total and undivided attention. Similarly, many audiences have just dived into Ragnarok.</p>
<p>This Norwegian-language drama arrived late January and was written by Adam Price.</p>
<p>Set in the fictional town of Edda, the series tackles the overarching issue of climate change, but in such an imaginative and entertaining fashion. We’re introduced to a teenage protagonist who has been bestowed with the powers of the mighty Thor to help protect the planet. Obviously, it draws from Norse mythology in a very refreshing way, but let’s look deeper into the cast for a moment.</p>
<p>David Stakston in Ragnarok</p>
<p>In Ragnarok, 20-year-old (according to Wikiking) David Stakston does a superb job in the role of Magne.</p>
<p>The character and David’s performance have already drawn praise across social media. Check out a selection of tweets below:</p>

<p>David Stakston: Movies &amp; TV</p>
<p>According to IMDb, David first appeared on screens back in 2015 in the TV series Skam.</p>
<p>Playing the part of Magnus Fossbaken/David, he reprised the role for a couple of years across an impressive nineteen episodes.</p>
<p>It’s a romantic drama centred upon teenagers at a school in Oslo dealing with the inconveniences and issues of everyday life. It boasts an incredible 8.7 audience score on IMDb, and yes, it’s definitely worth a watch.</p>
<p>As for his next project, we have Ragnarok!</p>
<p>So, he’s not been in a great deal, but what he’s been in has seriously impressed audiences. We expect to see him back on screens pretty soon thanks to Ragnarok, but as of yet, his IMDb suggests that he’s only set to star in a short called Vill ni åka mera so far.</p>

<p>If you’re a fan of his work in Ragnarok and want to keep up to date with him, it’s definitely worth following him on Instagram.</p>
<p>You can find him over at @david.stakston; he currently has just over 1,600 followers.</p>
<p>There are some great snaps and selfies on there to check out, including a bunch of Ragnarok-related posts. Let’s hope it scores a second season!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/hitcn/1738/19428853_low_res_call_the_midwife_1476119.jpg" alt="img">
We expect to see him appear on many more hit shows in the years to come.</p>
<p>It’s back, but who plays Reggie in Call the Midwife?</p>
<p>What a series!</p>
<p>So far, the ninth batch of episodes has gone down an absolute treat with fans. This year, we’ve already been treated to some expertly crafted new dramas, but sometimes you just can’t beat being reunited with some friendly and familiar faces.</p>
<p>Created by Heidi Thomas and based on the memoirs of Jennifer Worth, this period TV series centres in on midwives working in London in the 1950s and into the 1960s. Since 2012, audiences haven’t been able to get enough!</p>
<p>In the beginning, an ensemble cast accompanied us into the year 1957, and since then we’ve grown and followed these characters through so much, chronicling the years.</p>
<p>Obviously, not all of the beloved characters were there from the very start. Some joined later, but nevertheless, they’re just as loved as the key players…</p>
<p>Who plays Reggie in Call the Midwife?</p>
<p>Reggie in Call the Midwife is played by Daniel Laurie.</p>
<p>Call the Midwife boasts so many wonderful screen talents and Daniel has proven that he’s up there with the very best.</p>
<p>The phenomenal actor – who is in hid mid-twenties – has cemented himself as somewhat of a fan-favourite over the years, having been on the show since as far back as season 6.</p>
<p>Since then, his performance has attracted so much praise, especially on social media, with one Twitter user tweeting out in December 2019: “I love Reggie on Call the Midwife. He is one of the strongest men, the goodest souls, portrayed on television. He happens to have Down syndrome and everything he brings to his character, every episode, makes me emotional bc he is a superb actor. More Down syndrome rep please!”</p>

<p>According to IMDb, Daniel first appeared on screens back in 2016 in the TV series Stella. He plays the role of Jamie across a number of episodes of the comedy-drama, which is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<p>Next up… it’s Call the Midwife!</p>
<p>As you know, he’s been working on the show for a good few years now.</p>
<p>He also recently starred in the much-loved series Vera starring Brenda Blethyn! If you head over to his Twitter there’s some great content there (see below post).</p>
<p>That’s not all though, as he’s also lent his talents to the 2020 TV pilot for an adaptation of Stephen King’s The Dark Tower (he plays Sheemie), as well as drama series Finding Alice (Zack).</p>

<p>Daniel Laurie opens up</p>
<p>As highlighted by Lynn News, Daniel has opened up about his experiences working on the show: “I’ve loved playing Reggie and showing everyone everything that people like Reggie and I can bring to others’ lives.”</p>
<p>He continued: “I love being an actor and I would certainly recommend it as a job, they say all you have to do is speak up, but really most of the hard work comes before the audition. Preparation is vital, preparation is everything, be prepared… I have had to work hard to learn my lines, make my speech clearer and my body stronger, but when I’m actor, I’m appreciated, when I’m acting, I’m the same as everyone else.”</p>
<p>Inspirational stuff!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/hitcn/1716/white_house_farm_1456582.jpg" alt="img">
The ITV series has swiftly established itself as the one to beat in 2020.</p>
<p>Audiences are curious as to what happened to DCI ‘Taff’ Jones after watching the fascinating new series White House Farm.</p>
<p>Last year was a great one for television, but 2020 is already off to a tremendous start thanks to the likes of Netflix and ITV. The latest series to have audiences glued to screens is White House Farm, which arrived on ITV on Wednesday, January 8th.</p>
<p>The six-episode drama has already attracted significant praise for its tackling of shocking real-life events. Writers Kris Mrksa and Giula Sandler turn their lens to the White House Farm murders which took place in August 1985, along with a stellar ensemble cast.</p>
<p>June and Nevill Bamber were shot and killed inside the farmhouse, as was adopted daughter Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons, Daniel and Nicholas. The only survivor was the 24-year-old Jeremy Bamber, who said he was in the surrounding area while the tragedies took place. The series dives into the investigation which ensued.</p>
<p>White House Farm: DCI ‘Taff’ Jones</p>
<p>One of the people on the case was DCI Thomas ‘Taff’ Jones.</p>
<p>He was the senior investigating officer on the case but was actually removed as a result of “operational reasons”, as noted by the Mirror.</p>
<p>As confirmed by the Evening Standard, when he first inspected the crime scene he thought there had been a murder-suicide, weighing in that Sheila did it before claiming her own life. Judge Lord Justice Kay later asserted that this had a substantial impact on the way the case was navigated.</p>
<p>Many have taken to social media to critique the choices he made shown in the show, such as the burning of evidence. But, what happened to him?</p>
<p>What happened to DCI ‘Taff’ Jones?</p>
<p>According to the Mirror, DCI Thomas ‘Taff’ Jones passed away.</p>
<p>Before the Bamber case went to trial in October 1986, Taff died as the result of a freak accident at his home. The same source notes that the cause of death is believed to be a fall from a ladder.</p>
<p>Although he died ahead of the trial, the East Anglian Daily Times notes that Jones believed that Bamber was innocent.</p>

<p>Also, the original documents from the first case number (murder/suicide) are still withheld.https://t.co/6HK1fjKzcm#WhiteHouseFarm pic.twitter.com/XIK6KB6rD5 — JB Campaign LTD (@jbcampaignltd) December 4, 2019</p>
<p>Who played DCI ‘Taff’ Jones?</p>
<p>DCI ‘Taff’ Jones is played by Stephen Graham.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old English actor is best known for playing the character of Andrew “Combo” Gascoigne in both the This is England film and TV series from Shane Meadows.</p>
<p>However, he has also starred in the likes of Snatch (Tommy), Gangs of New York (Shang), Public Enemies (Baby Face Nelson), Hyena (David Knight) and the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise (Scrum).</p>
<p>Most recently, he was also in Martin Scorsese’s mob-epic The Irishman, in which he played Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano. It’s currently available to stream on Netflix.</p>

BBC Two’s Trigonometry is one of the most unique shows in years and features a host of upcoming talent.</p>
<p>The BBC has always been one to push the boat out with its comedy-drama series and BBC 2’s new addition, Trigonometry, is no different.</p>
<p>Something else the BBC has been famed for is giving lesser-known acting talent a chance to shine and, once again, Trigonometry excels here as well.</p>
<p>The series stars Gary Carr, Ariane Labed and Thalissa Teixeira in one of the most unique series in years.</p>
<p>Thalissa Teixeira takes on the role of Gemma in the series but what do we know about the up and coming actress?</p>
<p>Trigonometry on BBC Two</p>
<p>Trigonometry tells the story Kieran and Gemma, a pair of London residents who are struggling to get by financially.</p>
<p>To keep their heads above water, the pair are forced to take in a lodger but, Ray, their new roommate shakes up their lives more than they could have thought.</p>
<p>Meet Gemma actress Thalissa Teixeira</p>
<p>Starring in the role of Gemma is Thalissa Teixeira.</p>
<p>According to What’s On Stage, the actress spent her early years in the Brazillian state of Espírito Santo before returning to the UK at the age of seven.</p>
<p>Now, approaching her 30s, the actress is starting to make a name for herself and in Trigonometry she appears in her first major starring role on TV.</p>

<p>Since then, she’s appeared in 12 acting roles, the biggest of which have come in the likes of The Musketeers TV series, Midsomer Murders and even Fast and Furious: Hobbs and Shaw.</p>
