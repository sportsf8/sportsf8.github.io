Willem DaThicc indeed.

The year was 2002. Spider-Man was released in cinemas and Willem Dafoe’s extremely fat ass graced our screens.

In case you need reminding, Willem Dafoe played Green Golbin in the 2002 version of Spider-Man alongside Toby Maguire.

As Spider-Man’s archnemesis, a huge, destructive superhuman showdown where lots of civilians were at risk — but none ever actually die — was a given. For Green Goblin, this happened when he attacked a bunch of New Yorkers during a festival in Times Square.

Of course, ol’ trusty Spider-Man managed to save everyone, but the scene was great for a number of reasons. First we had MJ’s absolutely useless attempt to get up and save herself and then we had the kid who was just so ready to get crushed by the falling debris.

However, the best shot was easily the one of Green Goblin’s fat booty on his glider, chasing Spider-Man as he ran down the street.

The shot was so memorable that @rottingvale‘s tweet of the scene went viral. Rei tweeted the photo along with the caption: “This frame is making me have a breakdown in the bathroom.”

Even though Willem Dafoe is pretty well-known for having *ahem* large assets (I’m talking about his alleged huge penis), the shot was still unexpected. So Dafoe’s tight spandex suit and big booty quickly became a meme with over 18,000 retweets and 98,000 likes.

While not the first Spider-Man meme to crop up in recent times, there’s just something about a round ass in a green spandex suit that gets the internet going. People started the meme off simply — by relating the photo to the very situation that Rei tweeted about: Having a breakdown over the Spider-Man frame in her bathroom.

From there, people followed the same format and likened it to the “Floating Boy Chasing Running Boy” classic from two years ago. Soon the replies to Rei’s tweet were filled with Green Goblin Booty memes about lingering germs, shredded cheese, and dogs eating things they definitely shouldn’t.

In conclusion, we stan Willem DaThicc and his fat booty in this house.
