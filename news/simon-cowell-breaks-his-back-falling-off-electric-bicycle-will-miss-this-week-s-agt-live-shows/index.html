<p>Kim Willis and Bill Keveney</p>
<p>USA TODAY</p>
<p>MALIBU, Calif. – Simon Cowell broke his back Saturday while putting his new electric bicycle to the test at his home.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old entertainment mogul broke his back in several places while trying out his bike with family in the courtyard of his home in Malibu, Syco Entertainment confirmed to USA TODAY in a statement provided by Ann-Marie Thomson.</p>
<p>Cowell was taken to the hospital where he underwent six hours of surgery overnight that included placing a metal rod in his back.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s under observation and doing fine, the statement said. NBC said Cowell will not appear in this season&rsquo;s first live &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent&rdquo; episodes, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Fellow judges Heidi Klum and Sofia Vergara shared photos on Instagram of the socially distant &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent&rdquo; set, pointing to the empty seat meant for Cowell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We miss our boss!! Come back fast simoncowell!! wrote Vergara.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wishing you a speedy recovery @simoncowell,&rdquo; wrote Klum.</p>
<p>Klum gave a shout-out in an Instagram stories video she shot while approaching Cowell&rsquo;s trailer. &ldquo;I just wanted to say I miss you Simon,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Cowell has been in quarantine at home during the COVID-19 pandemic with his girlfriend Lauren Silverman and their young son Eric, 6.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We watch movies in the evening, play together, read books, comics, everything,&rdquo; he told People in May.</p>
<p>Exclusive:How &lsquo;AGT&rsquo; is adjusting to COVID-19, from no-audience auditions to drive-in Judge Cuts</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s who advanced on &lsquo;AGT&rsquo;:Competition cut in half during &lsquo;difficult&rsquo; drive-in Judge Cuts</p>
<p>Cowell, the creator of &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent,&rdquo; serves as a judge on the show. He has also been a judge on &ldquo;Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent,&rdquo; &ldquo;The X Factor&rdquo; and &ldquo;American Idol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent&rdquo; went back into production in June, taping a socially distanced Judge Cuts episode outdoors that aired July 28.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As bad as it is, you always have to find a solution to get back to work,&rdquo; Cowell told USA TODAY via email in June. &ldquo;I have sympathy for so many people in this situation, but if our show is an example, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. It’s different, but hopefully it will still be as popular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he was pleased with the resulting episode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was surreal, like being in a movie,&rdquo; Cowell wrote. &ldquo;As we drove onto the lot, everyone is walking around with masks and we go into this room and we’re told what we can do, what we can’t do and I’m thinking this is going to be a tough day. But there was this real buzz of excitement that we were all back together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;AGT&rdquo; will return Aug. 11 (NBC, Tuesday, 8 EDT/PDT) with the first 11 of 44 quarterfinalists.</p>

Simon Cowell has surgery for broken back after bike accident Simon Cowell is recovering after having surgery to repair a broken back</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES &ndash; Simon Cowell underwent surgery to repair a broken back, the result of an electric bicycle accident, and was recovering at a hospital, a spokesperson said Sunday.</p>
<p>“Simon has broken his back in a number of places&rdquo; after falling from the new bike he&rsquo;d been testing in the courtyard of his Malibu home Saturday, the representative said. Family members were present.</p>
<p>The entertainment mogul was “doing fine” and remained under observation after the operation at an unidentified hospital, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Cowell&rsquo;s partner, Lauren Silverman, accompanied him to the hospital and has been able to see him briefly. Cowell&rsquo;s overnight, six-hour surgery included placement of a metal rod.</p>
<p>Despite the ordeal, he mustered the strength to post a “massive thank you” to doctors and nurses treating him. Cowell, known for his tart-tongued comments about contestants, also shared some advice.</p>
<p>“If you buy an electric trail bike, read the manual before you ride it for the first time,” he tweeted Sunday night.</p>
<p>The couple&rsquo;s son and Silverman&rsquo;s child by a previous marriage were with Cowell when the accident happened.</p>
<p>Cowell&rsquo;s injury will force him to miss the beginning of this season&rsquo;s live shows on NBC&rsquo;s “America’s Got Talent.” The live shows will begin Tuesday and Wednesday without him, the network said.</p>
<p>He created the talent show, now in its 15th season, and serves as a judge. The show&rsquo;s other judges are Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel and Sofia Vergara, with Terry Crews as host.</p>
<p>Cowell also has been a judge on “Britain’s Got Talent,” “The X Factor” and “American Idol.”</p>

<p>This story corrects Lauren Silverman&rsquo;s relationship to Cowell.

<p>Simon Cowell Recovering From 5-Hour Back Surgery in Wake of Bike Accident Simon Cowell Hospitalized With Broken Back Following Electric Bike Accident</p>
<p>Simon Cowell will not surprisingly be skipping America’s Got Talent‘s first two live shows this week as he recovers from back surgery. An NBC rep confirms to TVLine that Cowell will be MIA during AGT‘s inaugural live episodes on Tuesday Aug. 11 and Wednesday Aug. 12.</p>
<p>Cowell broke his back on Saturday while testing his new electric bike in the courtyard of his Malibu, Calif. home. He was rushed to the hospital, where he underwent a five-hour surgery. He is currently recovering at home.</p>
<p>“Simon had surgery overnight and is doing okay this morning. It was a five-hour surgery and he has had to have a number of fusions and metal rod put into his back,” a source told People. “He landed on his back when he fell from the bike. The injuries are bad but he’s also been told he was lucky.”</p>
<p>Late Sunday, Cowell took to Twitter to thank fans “for your kind messages” and also offer “some good advice” about using electric bikes (see below).</p>
<p>Some good advice…</p>
<p>If you buy an electric trail bike, read the manual before you ride it for the first time.</p>
<p>I have broken part of my back.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for your kind messages. — Simon Cowell (@SimonCowell) August 10, 2020</p>
<p>This is the latest setback to befall Americas’s Got Talent‘s current 15th season. After a months-long shutdown due to COVID-19, the summer smash resumed production in late June — albeit with a host of new changes. As a safety precaution, AGT relocated from its lavish Hollywood auditorium venue to an outdoor setup in Simi Valley designed to resemble a drive-in movie theater, with judges Cowell, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum and newcomer Sofia Vergara now seated an appropriate distance from one another. Additionally, the number of Judge Cuts episodes was trimmed from four to just one.

One thing we love about the ‘Got Talent’ franchise is that there is no shortage of laughs. When the comedian who goes by the stage name Lost Voice Guy came to Britain’s Got Talent, the world of comedy changed forever. This comedian whose real name is Lee Ridley may not have a voice, but he is incredibly funny, winning over the hearts of millions of people all over the world. Check out his audition below.</p>
<p>Lost Voice Guy Won ‘Britain’s Got Talent’ By Making The World Laugh</p>
<p>Lee has a neurological form of cerebral palsy making him unable to communicate verbally. He uses a communication aid to express his thoughts in his comedy routines. He brought this technology with him to season 12 of Britain’s Got Talent in 2018. His comedy routine in his audition joked a lot about being handicapped and made light of his condition. It sent the audience into a pool of laughter, and the judges absolutely adored him from the start. He received a standing ovation from the judges and was sent into the lives shows. Lost Voice Guy was constantly praised for pushing boundaries and poking fun at himself to make the audience laugh each and every week. He was voted by the public as the winner of the show, going against comedian Robert White. He was the first comedian to ever win the show a tremendous feat in itself.</p>

<p>Where Is He Now?</p>
<p>After winning Britain’s Got Talent, he performed on the show Live at the Apollo. He toured around Europe before heading to compete on America’s Got Talent: The Champions. Unfortunately, he was up against some stiff competition and was eliminated in the preliminaries.</p>
<p>Lost Voice Guy also competed on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions but did not advance past the first round.</p>
<p>He also released a book called “I’m Only In It For The Parking” and began a touring show of the same name. Most recently, he launched a campaign to help save live comedy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The initiative is to help venues and comedians who are struggling make money so they do not have to lose out on business.</p>
<p>Lee is currently participating in the Save Live Comedy online fundraiser which will feature a virtual audience. You can find more details about that here if you are interested in participating. The website says “We need YOU to make this work on a truly tremendous scale, and raise a handsome sum of money to support some of Britain’s comedy clubs and promoters that are currently going through hard times, as well as showcasing performers and collectives.”</p>
