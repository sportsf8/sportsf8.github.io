<p>As the lockdown continues, the Duchess of Cambridge has reached out to one of the most vulnerable sectors of the community as part of her pledge to continue her virtual charity efforts during the pandemic.</p>
<p>To mark what would have been Addiction Awareness Week, which has been postponed because of COVID-19, Kate has carried out her first virtual visit to an addiction treatment centre in Wiltshire, England run by one of her most long standing charities, Action on Addiction.</p>
<p>Kate visited Clouds House last Thursday via a video conference call where she got to meet staff and clients who have been going through the charity’s program. A spokesman for the charity said that the Duchess was keen “to get involved, and also wanted to do something to help during lockdown.”</p>
<p>In a video released Monday evening by Kensington Palace Kate met virtually with Action on Addiction’s CEO Graham Beech, who said that the royal’s involvement with the charity was helping break down the stigma about addiction.</p>
<p>Dressed in a red shirt, the Duchess, who is still self-isolating at Anmer Hall in Norfolk, was shown around the newly refurbished Clouds House, which has been running rehabilitation programs during the lockdown. Speaking with staff and clients who have been through the program, Kate described it as “a lifeline to so many people,” adding that Action on Addiction was providing “life-changing support.”</p>
<p>Clouds House, which Kate last visited in 2012, has been able to stay open during lockdown thanks to its team of dedicated staff who have been practicing rigorous infection control and following government guidelines. Beech spoke about the importance of reaching out for help during the pandemic and described Kate’s visit as timely.</p>
<p>Addiction is often not recognized as an illness. It carries a stigma – that somehow individuals are to blame for the situation in which they find themselves,” he said, adding that Kate “has supported us in improving understanding of this life-stopping condition, and her timely digital visit to Clouds House, our residential treatment centre in Wiltshire in response to this issue will do much to remove that stigma. It will also hopefully raise awareness of how to access support, treatment and specialist help so that more people can move on from addiction and lives can be saved.”</p>
<p>Action on Addiction has carried out a recent survey into the rising rate of addiction during lockdown. The charity commissioned a national poll which indicates that addictive behaviours are rising as a result of the pandemic. On her virtual visit, The Duchess talked to staff about the results of the survey and how they are coping with the new COVID measures.

<p>You might have heard the saying that life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. If that saying were a person — well, have you met Rachel Hollis? Hollis, now a successful blogger, speaker, and author of the mega-best-selling book Girl, Wash Your Face, has come a long way from where she started: the tiny town of Weedpatch, California, an unincorporated community southeast of Bakersfield that’s one of the poorest parts of Kern County, with 2,394 residents and a median household income of $28,451. You might remember that name from a scene in The Grapes of Wrath, in which a watchman at the migrant worker camp in Weedpatch tells the Joad family about the “Holy Rollers” — Pentecostal ministers — who had been coming through town. They kept asking for money, so the camp’s Central Committee decided that “‘Any preacher can preach in this camp. Nobody can take up a collection in this camp.’ And it was kinda sad for the old folks, ’cause there hasn’t been a preacher in since.’” Hollis is herself the daughter and granddaughter of Holy Rollers whose family migrated from Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas to end up in Weedpatch. She writes in the book about leaving home after high school and striking out for Los Angeles, where an obsession with Matt Damon led her to apply for (and get) a job at Miramax (which had produced Good Will Hunting). That job led to Rachel meeting her husband and eventually starting a wildly successful event-planning company, Chic Events, which morphed into a lifestyle blog called the Chic Site, which in turn has led to the creation of a nebulous, evolving business empire — first the communications and branding company Chic Media, now the Hollis Company, through which Hollis and her husband Dave (now the company’s CEO) oversee her motivational speaking circuit and podcast as well as “Rise” conferences for women and couples. And did I mention the books? At 35, now living outside of Austin, Hollis has written three novels, two cookbooks, and, as of this year, the #1 New York Times best-selling book Girl, Wash Your Face.</p>
<p>AP Rachel Hollis with her husband Dave during an interview.</p>
<p>Girl, Wash Your Face, which was published in February 2018 by Thomas Nelson, a HarperCollins imprint devoted to “Christian content,” is an amalgam of stories, tough-love advice from a woman who has been there, and vaguely biblical encouragement. This is structured by tackling the various “lies” that Hollis believes have held her back — and maybe you too? — which she deconstructs chapter by chapter: “I Am Bad at Sex,” “I Should Be Further Along by Now,” “I Am Defined by My Weight,” and so on. “Recognizing the lies we’ve come to accept about ourselves is the key to growing into a better version of ourselves,” Hollis writes. Promotional copy from the publisher’s website describes it thusly: “With unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity, Girl, Wash Your Face shows you how to live with passion and hustle — and how to give yourself grace without giving up.” It’s simple, according to Hollis: Stop breaking promises to yourself. You, after all, are the only one in control of how your life goes. It is hard to overstate the popularity of this book. Since its release in February, according to Publishers Weekly, Girl, Wash Your Face has maintained a spot in the top 10 best-selling books in the country for seven months, has held the No. 1 spot for 12 of those weeks (it is now No. 8), and has sold more than 880,000 total copies in the US. The book has almost 7,000 Amazon reviews, the vast majority of them five stars; as of the week of Nov. 4, it remains the No. 1 best-selling nonfiction book on Amazon, and currently the site’s second-most popular book of the year (outsold only by Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury). But if you aren’t already familiar with the book, or Hollis, you might be forgiven for wondering: What, exactly, is she saying that people are so eager to hear?</p>
<p>Hollis is all of us — only she doesn’t have to try at all. Or is she trying the hardest?</p>
<p>Hollis also uploads a steady trickle of videos to her 71,000+ YouTube subscribers, with topics ranging from chatty family life updates (“Say Hello to Dave’s New Bronco!”) to, recently, inspirational montages pieced together from her speaking engagements (“Do you feel like giving up?”). The homepage of the Chic Site, as of mid-October, featured a recipe for slow-cooker pumpkin spice latté, a post about how to incorporate Spanx leggings into your fall look, and a video on how to host a “Girls Night In,” sponsored by Rubbermaid. Even as the core of Hollis&rsquo;s business shifts away from being, as she puts it, “a lifestyle influencer,” this lifestyle is still largely what Hollis is selling. She wants to be relatable, and she is, to many thousands of women, in her blog posts and her speeches and her best-selling book. “I’m not an expert. I’m not a guru,” Hollis told the AP in September. “Anything I’ve ever done, the work I’ve done, has always been like your girlfriend telling you what worked for her.” Hollis is all of us — overloaded, exhausted, smiling through the long days of work, child care, meal prep, and relationship highs and lows. Only she doesn’t have to try at all. Or is she trying the hardest? Hollis “vowed to be authentic and sincere” in her online life, which is why, she writes, “for every gloriously styled cupcake picture we produced, I shared a photo of myself with facial paralysis.” (She at one point suffered from stress-related Bell’s palsy.) In the book’s first chapter, Hollis describes getting dressed up and attending the Oscars with her then-Disney executive husband. “In these instances, photos show up on Instagram and Facebook of us looking well coiffed and ultra glam, and the internet goes wild.” Note the use of the passive voice here: “photos show up.” Not “photos are strategically posted at just the right time of day by my social media team for maximum engagement.” But even the “messy” pictures of Hollis are adorable, so maybe it doesn’t matter whether she’s wearing sweatpants or a designer brand so much as that her audience believes it’s real. Authentic. Sincere. Is that dishonest? What is honesty when your life is your brand? Hollis’s vow of authenticity doesn’t seem to extend very far into difficult political conversations, which isn’t surprising for someone with a popular lifestyle brand to maintain. In one YouTube video from August 2016, she referenced the “terrifying” state of politics in the US — just before saying, “I’m not going to talk about my beliefs or my political affiliation, because I know that we’re gonna some of us disagree, and I’d rather not know if you disagree.” But to my mind, her core philosophy itself is emblematic of a huge division in American thought that dominates our national discourse: Are people who have problems responsible for fixing them themselves? Or is there some collective responsibility that we are shirking — does a society owe something to all its members? There are dark implications in making everything a matter of personal responsibility, which is Hollis’s bias. She asks us to interrogate and deconstruct the lies that we’ve believed about ourselves, and I wonder how that lens would function if we turn it on the lies she promulgates in Girl, Wash Your Face.</p>
<p>There are dark implications in making everything a matter of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>The lie: “You, and only you, are ultimately responsible for who you become and how happy you are.” In good faith, I think that what Hollis (who declined to be interviewed for this story) means here is some “I am the captain of my soul,” “Invictus” stuff: I have to make the decision to be happy; no one else is going to do that for me. And to a degree, that makes sense. Your mental, physical, and emotional well-being are influenced by your mindset. But mindset isn’t the only thing that influences your well-being. Not everyone has enough money to let them take the kind of professional and financial risks that might lead to greater happiness, for example. Things like systemic racism can wear on a person to the point that it degrades her health at the same time it restricts her access to good health care, resulting in higher rates of chronic disease and shorter life expectancies for black women than white women. Can you tell a woman who has lost her hoped-for child as a result of state officials turning a blind eye to a water-poisoning crisis in a predominantly black area, or a mother seeking asylum whose child was taken away from her at the border, that “you are ultimately responsible for who you become and how happy you are”? You can, but you would be wrong. And cruel. Hollis doesn’t address the possibility that for some people, obstacles to happiness are outside their control. And it is proof of her hard-earned privilege that she doesn’t have to.</p>

<p>In a recent Instagram post thanking her followers for helping her sell over 1 million total copies of Girl, Wash Your Face, Hollis gives us some insight into whom she considers to be her target demographic, and who makes up the small army of readers that has helped build word-of-mouth buzz for her book: “Thank you for writing a review! Thank you for hollering at the other girls on your MLM team to read it! Thank you for telling the other wives on base that it’s worth their time!” I spoke with more than a dozen women for this story — friends of friends, people who responded on social media, and at least two women I spotted out in the wild — to try to understand exactly what it is about Hollis’s gospel that appeals to them. “I think the adversity she’s been through gives her a lot of credibility,” said Alex Ethridge, a 27-year-old marketing professional in Missouri. (Hollis had a difficult family upbringing — she calls it “traumatic” — and was just 14 years old when she found her older brother, Ryan, after he had killed himself.) Elissa Johnson, a 35-year-old mom in St. Louis who co-owns a small business with her husband, told me she appreciates Hollis’s tough-love approach: “There’s something refreshing in a post-truth world about rooting out some lies you might be telling yourself … It feels like so many things are out of our control in the world today, but there’s so much within our reach.” One of Hollis’s videos was particularly helpful for Chrissy Malson. A student and part-time teacher’s aide near Peoria, Illinois, Malson told me she always put herself “last on the list” and put her career on hold for her husband’s. She decided to go back to college last year to get a degree in occupational therapy. “This is terrifying for me,” Malson said. “Going back to college is scary.” But watching Hollis’s video about taking control of her life has inspired Malson. “It’s a reminder that &hellip; I can do hard things. I can do things that scare me. Yes, I have a family, a special needs kiddo, a husband who travels internationally, but I can do this. I define my reality.”</p>
<p>Rachel Hollis / YouTube / Via youtube.com</p>
<p>The video includes an image of Hollis running through a crowded room, high-fiving the people who have gathered to hear her speak. “You get to decide, right now, who you want to be,” the voiceover says. There is something to this, and something to hearing it from a woman, at least in a way that trades on a certain kind of privilege. I do get to decide, I want to tell myself. And I can decide. I am writing this on the outdoor patio of the $250/month coworking space I belong to in San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world, where, thanks to my husband’s salary from his tech-sector job, I can afford to live. Being empowered to let go of my anxiety or self-criticism as a wealthy white woman is certainly helpful to me, and I appreciate that message from Hollis on a certain level. But my anxiety is largely rooted in unrealistic fears, whereas many women don’t have the opportunity to go back to college or own a house from which to be liberated. Hollis’s book is in many ways a return to the kind of second-wave feminism that privileged the liberation of middle-class straight white women from the domestic sphere while at the same time completely ignoring — or actively opposing — the rights and needs of poor and queer and nonwhite women. Hollis, who has four children, doesn’t mention child care at all in the book until the acknowledgments, when she thanks her nanny: “People ask me how I do it all, and the honest truth is, I absolutely don’t,” she writes. “Behind the scenes is an incredible, loving friend and sister who takes care of my kiddos when work or travel takes me away from them.” In one anecdote about the power of setting goals, Hollis recounts her obsession with buying a Louis Vuitton Speedy bag, which cost a thousand dollars. “I wanted it because it represented the kind of woman I dreamed of becoming,” she wrote. The day she got her first $10,000 consulting check, Hollis drove to the Louis Vuitton store at the Beverly Center and walked out with her bag. Hollis makes no attempt to interrogate her desire for an expensive designer bag here, just as there is no effort to interrogate her desire to own a vacation home in Hawaii by the time she’s 40. “Honestly, I think it’s kinda shameful and not something to be proud of,&rdquo; said Amber Cessac, a 32-year-old mother of five in Austin. The book caught Cessac’s eye at a local Target, and she found a few “nuggets of inspiration” in it. But she was turned off by what she saw as Hollis’s constant push for bigger and more expensive things. “She just comes off as so incredibly tone-deaf,” Cessac said.</p>
<p>Hollis equates having “made it” with being able to drop a lot of cash on a status-symbol bag, using purchasing power as a path to self-realization.</p>
<p>There is more than a hint of #Girlboss corporate feminism at work here, as Hollis equates having “made it” with being able to drop a lot of cash on a status-symbol bag, using purchasing power as a path to self-realization. And she takes that brand of feminism a step further by marrying it with Christianity, in what is essentially a Pinterest-worthy version of the prosperity gospel. This attitude has a historical context in the Pentecostal religious tradition in which Hollis was raised. Pentecostalism has always been the slightly embarrassing uncle at the evangelical family reunion — its unfiltered and emotional expressions of faith can make it look a little unseemly to outsiders. And Pentecostals have long associated spiritual blessing with material wealth, which may help explain why there is something talismanic about the Louis Vuitton bag for Hollis: It showed that her hard work and strategic goal-setting channeled the kind of earnest faith that God rewarded in the form of $10,000 consulting checks. A patina of racial diversity has been another hallmark of Pentecostalism, although during the civil rights era, racism from white leaders of the church caused a division that lasted through the 1960s, and well into today in some parts of the country. In the United States, the movement gained momentum in the early days of the 20th century with several well-known revivals, the most famous of which was the Azusa Street Revival in 1906, led by a black preacher named William Seymour. And as far back as the Azusa Street Revival, white Pentecostals displayed a religious version of black cultural appropriation. Charles Fox Parham, a preacher and early proponent of Pentecostalism, heard reports that “white people [were] imitating the unintelligent, crude negroisms of the Southland, and laying it on the Holy Ghost.” Interestingly, this kind of appropriation echoes throughout Girl, Wash Your Face. It is impossible to read the book and not notice Hollis’s frequent use of African American Vernacular English, beginning with the title. The book’s introduction is called “Hey Girl, Hey,” and Hollis uses a popular mangled version of a Maya Angelou quote (“when you know better, you do better”) to explain why she wants to become a better hip-hop dancer. Osheta Moore started following Rachel Hollis when Moore was living in Los Angeles. “I was going through this season of isolation after a cross-country move, and I wanted some inspiration,” said Moore, a pastor and author. “There was a time when she was more open about some of her family struggles and things that were going on, and I just found that really refreshing.” Moore was so inspired by Hollis’s work that she ended up getting an internship at Chic Media for several months in 2016, just before she published her own book. After working at Chic and following Hollis more closely, Moore started to notice that Hollis was influenced by “prosperity teachings” and people like Tony Robbins.</p>
<p>Rachel Hollis / YouTube / Via youtube.com</p>
<p>When Moore, who is black, interned at Chic, she said “it was a very diverse workspace.” She felt that Hollis had a blind spot around race, but liked the diversity of the team she worked with. There came a time, though, when Moore — as a woman who at one time hoped to work her way down to a size 14, a size Hollis said she was when she was her highest weight ever — “realized that either I had to kind of adjust some of my expectations in order to continue working there or change some of my views about my own body.” “For me, the point where it became really dangerous was when I noticed a fat-shaming component to her platform,” Moore said. “There’s a lot of talking about how being overweight is hindering you from achieving your dreams, or, ‘If you don’t stick to your diet, then you’re not a person of integrity.’ That shaming component is really harmful.” “You get one and only one chance to live, and life is passing you by,” Hollis writes in the introduction to Girl, Wash Your Face. “Stop beating yourself up, and dang it, stop letting others do it, too.” But anyone reading her book may find it hard to follow that last bit of advice. The trouble with, and the appeal of, curated imperfection is the assumption that all imperfections lie in the past — they have supposedly been understood, integrated, and learned from in order to create a present that is blissfully free from earlier mistakes. And at her worst, Hollis refashions her own (apparently resolved) struggles into astonishingly harsh instruction for other women, under the guise of women’s empowerment and tough love.</p>
<p>At her worst, Hollis refashions her own (apparently resolved) struggles into astonishingly harsh instruction for other women.</p>
<p>In a chapter of Girl, Wash Your Face about her “emotional eating” and desire to lose weight, Hollis warns the reader, “This is where I should tell you that I am worthy and loved as I am. This is absolutely true, but that’s not where I’m headed with this chapter.” For the next several pages, she continues to shame fat people: “Humans were not made to be out of shape and severely overweight. You can choose to continue to abuse your body because it’s all you know … You can choose to settle for a half-lived life because you don’t even know there’s another way … But please, please stop making excuses for the whys.” Hollis spends a lot of time on body image in Girl, Wash Your Face, but perhaps nowhere is it as harmful and ignorant as when she is berating people who do not “keep their commitments,” especially when using the example of dieting. “[D]iets do not work,” Michael Hobbes wrote in a recent HuffPost article on harmful misperceptions around obesity among medical professionals as well as civilians. “Not just paleo or Atkins or Weight Watchers or Goop, but all diets. Since 1959, research has shown that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight fail and that two-thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost.” Yet, according to Hollis, we shouldn’t respect women who don’t stick with their diets because we cannot rely on them to keep their word. She imbues fatness with the shame of moral failure and demeans women who struggle to — or do not want to — lose weight. This is perhaps the clearest encapsulation of the cruelty baked into Hollis’s philosophy. But it’s certainly not the only example.</p>
<p>Hollis and her husband went through a difficult time before adopting their daughter Noah, now about a year and a half old, in 2017. They signed up to be foster-to-adopt parents, and Hollis talks throughout the book about their wrenching experience with the adoption process. It was in the middle of these tumultuous few years, full of long days spent in survival mode, that Hollis started drinking more. “Vodka was my copilot, and I was grateful for its presence in my life,” she writes. But she has little to no empathy for the birth parents or family of the children she and her husband thought they would permanently adopt. When Hollis recounts waiting for the birth parents of one child to show up, her attitude of superiority and willful ignorance is almost breathtaking: How do you keep taking babies to see parents who aren’t parenting? How do you give up half a Saturday to wait in a McDonald’s playland for addicts who may or may not show up, then hand over an innocent baby and watch them erase whatever progress you’ve made with their daughter? How do you do all of this KNOWING that they’ll be reunited at the end of it all, and there’s nothing you can do about it? If you’re like me, you find a way. But at night, when no one is looking, you drink, and when it gets really bad, you take a Xanax, too. Hollis has made no secret of her past drinking issues; in an interview in September, she said, “I was abusing alcohol. I was making really poor choices, and I thought, gosh, I don’t want to go through the rest of my life like this.” But in her book, it’s clear that Hollis is the one readers are supposed to empathize with, and the “addict” parents are the bad guys. She’s bold enough to blame them not just for their parenting, but also, indirectly, for her own substance abuse. Which begs the question: When two people have similar struggles but one is white and one is not, when one is wealthy and one is not, when one writes books and blog posts and hosts conferences and the other goes to McDonald’s hoping to see their child for an hour a week — who gets to be the good mom?</p>

<p>Despite its undeniable popularity, Girl, Wash Your Face has not been met with universal acclaim. One indication of how polarizing it is is how many of the book’s Amazon reviews rated “most helpful” — despite an overall rating of 4.8 stars — give the book just one star: at last count, 43 out of the top 50. “I don’t understand all the hype about this book,” one such review begins. “Rachel Hollis’s life experience is so near perfect and so far removed from that of the average woman, that there is almost nothing in this book that is actually relatable.” (This review garnered more than 50 comments, nearly all of them agreeing.)</p>
<p>“What about women that have lost a child? Those that have been beaten, verbally abused, raped, or shot at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another popular review called the book “sanctimonious twaddle” and asked what Hollis could possibly offer women who have been through real hardships: “What about women that have lost a child? Those that have been beaten, verbally abused, raped, or shot at? What about those forging their way through life in male-dominated careers instead of party planning?” A third reviewer says that Hollis “lost me when she spends an hour talking about her super emotionally abusive relationship and then reveals that the abuser is now her husband.” One top Amazon review describes the book as “page upon page of her repeatedly tooting her own horn and every so often throwing God a bone,” and plenty of dissenters can be found within the Christian online community too. “Reading Girl, Wash Your Face exhausted me,” wrote Alisa Childers, a Christian blogger and singer-songwriter. “Make no mistake, sisters. This book is all about YOU … Jesus offers us true joy and peace, but only after we realize that we are not the center of our own lives and we are no longer in charge.” Another Christian blogger wrote that Hollis “fails to identify the ‘lies’ as a secular worldview with all that entails, and her solutions are self-sufficient and not Jesus-oriented.” I was struck by how liberally Hollis interpreted Bible verses to suit her message, like in a chapter about sex where she quotes Hebrews 13:4 (“Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled”) and says, “what I take away when I read that line is that the things that happen in my bed with my husband cannot be weird or bad or wrong.” No Biblical scholar on Earth would read that passage to suggest what she says, but to Hollis, traditional theology doesn’t seem to matter as much as finding Bible verses that seem to prop up the message she is communicating.</p>
<p>Hollis’s star seems to be on the rise — her next book, called Girl, Stop Apologizing, will be published in March — and her popularity shows no signs of waning; her next Rise conference, in June, is already sold out. From the ashes of her former life as a lifestyle influencer, Hollis is rising to lead an army of inspired women as a motivational speaker, media guru, business consultant, and tough-talking best friend, all in one. She has become a semi-secular preacher, and she has found her flock. Following in the footsteps of tough-love doyens before her, Hollis’s audience of mostly white, middle-class women will probably be glad to have someone to tell them what to do, how to follow their dreams, to give them permission never to break a promise to themselves. But, in what many people would consider to be a moment of full-blown cultural crisis in the United States, are white, middle-class women the people who most need a champion telling them to prioritize themselves above all others? There are so many systems in place to ensure that the people who are already down stay down: mass incarceration, voter disenfranchisement, rising health care costs, lack of public education, a narrowing path to citizenship for immigrants — the list goes on. And yet so many working and middle-class white people (not to mention billionaires) seem increasingly gripped with anxiety over the idea that what they have is not enough, or that what they deserve is somehow being taken from them by the undeserving. “You are in charge of your own life, sister, and there’s not one thing in it that you’re not allowing to be there,” Hollis writes. But Hollis’s glibness makes clear that her “sisters” are only such if they look like her, share her padded bank account (and her priorities), and don’t venture too far into the real and wrenching difficulties of life. The book never quite explains what it means to “wash your face,” but you get the idea that it’s a euphemism for toughening up, taking a good, hard look in the mirror, and getting out into the world with a kind of clear-eyed resolve. Rachel Hollis writes about that really well. I just wish she would actually do it. ●

<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Wakfu-Season-4-1.jpgfit800450ssl1.jpeg" alt="img">
Because not quite enough about The Last of Us Part II has leaked yet, a new source is claiming to know what’s in the game’s day-one patch.</p>
<p>Though still not releasing until June 19, the contents of a day-one patch for The Last of Us Part II have allegedly already leaked, reportedly bringing a photo mode and more to the bleak revenge tale. What gameplay and story elements players have seen thus far (and many of them have seen much, much more than developer Naughty Dog intended) show that the post-apocalyptic sequel will be even more visceral in its violence and a graphical capstone for what’s possible on current-gen consoles, and players may capture the moment for posterity before jumping ship to the PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Of course, many prospective players haven’t been concerned with The Last of Us Part II‘s inevitable day-one patch so much as they’ve been in a fluster over the game’s actual content after a massive leak supposedly exposed the unreleased game’s entire story. Beyond the game’s brutal depiction of violence bordering on gratuitous for its own sake rather than serving as a cautionary tale against perpetual revenge, fans of the first game were upset by the way protagonists Ellie and, particularly, Joel are treated in the leaked material. The backlash from the leaks (some of which was, of course, in bad faith and based in hate rather than genuine substance) grew so great that publisher Sony and Naughty pushed back the game’s release date a month and is began running extensive damage control to assuage put-off players.</p>
<p>Related: The Last Of Us Part II: Everything We Know So Far About The Upcoming Game</p>
<p>However, none of that is going to stop the The Last of Us Part II from selling like hot cakes, and those who adopt early will be met with a day-one update containing a few features that players didn’t previously know they’d be getting. According to the oddly named PlayStation Brahs, the patch notes for the game’s “1.01 version” have been leaked, which are rumored to add a “photo mode,” “concept art gallery,” and “model viewer,” according to an unnamed source. As with any day-one patch worth its salt, the purported update will also introduce further bug fixes and polish, as well as “additional accessibility options.”</p>
<p>Although the source is unidentified and uncorroborated, the above additions don’t sound very uncommon for what’s ordinary for the standard AAA fare, especially when considering that Naughty Dog was given an extra month of development time despite the game already being completed. Really, it’s almost hard to imagine a Sony-published third-person action game not shipping with a photo mode by this point, and the free camera control feature’s always a great way to capture in-game moments both candid and laughably unintended. A concept art gallery would simply be icing on the blood-soaked, spore-dusted cake, while a character model museum sounds almost too good to be true without quite stepping out of the realm of possibility (again, the product should have shipped a month ago).</p>
<p>With the high technical draw The Last of Us Part II reportedly puts on the PS4 Pro, giving one’s beleaguered console a break to look more closely at the broken world and complex characters and enemies that Naughty Dog has painstakingly crafted using a photo mode sounds like a great way to appreciate the Clicker-infested world. No matter in which state the polarizing game ships this June 19, there’s no questioning that the best way to play The Last of Us Part II likely isn’t much further off.</p>

Mantel’s Trophy</p>
<p>Hilary Mantel has the #2 book in the country with The Mirror &amp; the Light, the “magisterial conclusion to the Wolf Hall trilogy,” our starred review said. Just ahead of the book’s publication, PW asked Mantel why she thought her nearly 1,800–page trilogy chronicling 16th-century English politics was so popular in the U.S., where the first two books have sold 798K print copies. Her reply: “Perhaps it shows that it’s about more than 16th century politics—that it addresses certain lasting truth about power and sex and love, public image and private dreams.”</p>
<p>Wild at Heart</p>
<p>Glennon Doyle has the #1 book in the country with Untamed, her third memoir. “Motivational speaker Doyle writes of divorcing her husband, finding love with Olympic soccer player Abby Wambach, and coming out to family and fans in this inspirational memoir,” our review said, predicting the book “will delight readers.” Doyle first gained popularity as a confessional Christian mom blogger, and her candor continues in the new book: “I will not stay, not ever again—in a room or conversation or relationship or institution that requires me to abandon myself,” she writes.</p>
<p>Into the Dark</p>
<p>My Dark Vanessa, Kate Elizabeth Russell’s debut novel, “offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement,” our starred review said. It was slated to be an Oprah Book Club pick and then dropped after a Twitter controversy; nonetheless, it lands at #8 in hardcover fiction. The plot, in which a 15-year-old girl has a relationship with her 42-year-old teacher, is based on the author’s experience as a teenager. “I do not believe that we should compel victims to share the details of their personal trauma with the public,” she wrote on her blog. “The decision whether or not to come forward should always be a personal choice.”</p>
<p>NEW &amp; NOTABLE</p>
<p>GET OUT OF YOUR OWN WAY</p>
<p>Dave Hollis</p>
<p>#2 Hardcover Nonfiction, #3 overall</p>
<p>Prescriptive book titles run in the family for the author, a life coach: his wife is Rachel Hollis, author of the blockbuster Girl, Wash Your Face. Together, they run the Hollis Company, a lifestyle brand focused on personal growth.</p>
<p>DEACON KiNG KONG</p>
<p>James McBride</p>
<p>#13 Hardcover Fiction</p>
<p>“McBride (The Good Lord Bird) delivers a sharply compassionate shaggy dog tale of a heavy-drinking Baptist deacon who shoots a drug dealer and becomes a ‘walking dead man,’ ” our starred review said of this “generous, achingly funny novel.”

Sidra Saba Zaidi and Sean Michael Galvin met while at N.Y.U., from which each received a law degree.</p>
<p>In June 2016, Ms. Zaidi, who had gone on a steady run of “extremely bad dates,” decided to organize a “girls’ night out” at a karaoke bar in Manhattan with one specific request attached to her invitation: no men allowed.</p>
<p>“I was done with the dating scene,” she said. “I was mostly meeting people on dating apps, and going on first dates every week in the hope of meeting someone special and getting married and starting a family.”</p>
<p>Much to Ms. Zaidi’s chagrin, one of her friends brought along three men to the celebration. The friend, sensing a potential connection, introduced Ms. Zaidi to Mr. Galvin, who was born and raised in Anchorage and also happened to be one of Ms. Zaidi’s classmates at N.Y.U. Ms. Zaidi and Mr. Galvin had many mutual friends and had once even studied for finals together.

<p><img src="https://e3.365dm.com/19/11/1600x900/skynews-celebrity-deaths-2019_4850142.jpg?20191128160521" alt="img">
Prodigy star Keith Flint, actors Luke Perry, Peter Fonda and Doris Day, chef Gary Rhodes and sporting legends Gordon Banks and Niki Lauda are just a few of the stars we said goodbye to in 2019.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look back at the careers and the legacies left behind following the deaths of famous faces from the worlds of music, film, TV, fashion, sport and politics.</p>
<p>January</p>
<p>Dick Miller was a star of 1980s classics such as Gremlins and The Terminator.</p>
<p>The character actor rose to prominence playing Walter Paisley in cult classic A Bucket Of Blood in 1959, and went on to appear in Fame, The Howling, The &lsquo;Burbs and scores of other films in a career spanning more than 60 years.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Director Joe Dante, who worked with Miller on many of his films, including Gremlins, paid tribute to a &ldquo;dear friend&rdquo; and said he &ldquo;loved watching him act&rdquo; following his death at the age of 90.</p>
<p>Grammy award winner James Ingram was an R&amp;B artist who had two US number ones - Baby, Come To Me (1983) and I Don&rsquo;t Have The Heart (1990) - and also co-wrote Michael Jackson&rsquo;s Pretty Young Thing with Quincy Jones.</p>
<p>The American singer-songwriter also wrote Look What Love Has Done, sang by Patty Smyth, from the movie Junior in 1994.</p>
<p>He died at the age of 66, with Jones among those paying tribute to a &ldquo;simply magical&rdquo; performer.</p>
<p>Michel Legrand was an Oscar-winning composer who worked with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Miles Davis, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Liza Minnelli, Edith Piaf and Barbra Streisand (pictured above).</p>
<p>The Frenchman wrote more than 200 film and TV scores during a career spanning more than 50 years - winning Academy Awards for the much-covered hit The Windmills Of Your Mind and for his music for Summer of &lsquo;42 and Yentl, as well as five Grammys from 17 nominations.</p>
<p>He died aged 86 with his wife, the actress Macha Meril, by his side.</p>
<p>Windsor Davies was best known for starring as Battery Sergeant Major Williams in It Ain&rsquo;t Half Hot Mum, which followed the adventures of a Royal Artillery concert party.</p>
<p>Before securing his most famous part, the actor appeared in an episode of Doctor Who in 1967, and would later play a starring role in Carry On Behind in 1975, Carry On England in 1976, and rugby comedy Grand Slam in 1978.</p>
<p>The father of five died peacefully at the age of 88 - just four months after Eluned, his wife of 61 years, passed away.</p>
<p>Broadway star Carol Channing played the role of Dolly Levi in the musical Hello, Dolly! almost 5,000 times during her stage career, which also included performances in Gentleman Prefer Blondes and Lend An Ear.</p>
<p>The League of Professional Theatre Women described the singer, dancer and comedian as &ldquo;a gift of inspiration to so many&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She died of natural causes, aged 97, at her home in California after suffering two strokes in 2018.</p>
<p>Bob Einstein was best known for playing Marty Funkhouser in Curb Your Enthusiasm, but also played stuntman Super Dave Oborne in Super Dave, and had roles in Arrested Development and Ocean&rsquo;s Thirteen.</p>
<p>The actor started his career as a writer, working on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour alongside Steve Martin. He was a two-time Emmy winner and had been nominated a further four times for his comedy writing.</p>
<p>He died aged 76, shortly after being diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p>He was &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s cutest dog&rdquo;, a Pomeranian called Boo who had been pictured with celebrities including former One Director star Liam Payne and actor Seth Rogen, and even had his own book.</p>
<p>In an emotional post to his 17m social media followers, his owners in the US said he died in his sleep, aged 12, and that they were &ldquo;heartbroken&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Boo had been suffering heart problems since the death of Buddy, his companion of 11 years, in 2017, they said.</p>
<p>February</p>
<p>As a composer, Andre Previn worked on films such as Gigi, Porgy And Bess, My Fair Lady and Irma La Douce - and he won best music Oscars for all four.</p>
<p>He later left Hollywood to conduct orchestras and was principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra from 1968 to 1979.</p>
<p>For many, he is probably best known for trying to help Eric Morecambe as the British star attempted to perform Grieg&rsquo;s Piano Concerto during a sketch.</p>
<p>He died at his home in New York aged 89, with Mia Farrow and Stephen Fry among those paying tribute.</p>
<p>Drummer Andy Anderson was best known for his time with The Cure in the 1980s, but also worked with Iggy Pop, Peter Gabriel, the Sex Pistols&rsquo; Glen Matlock and Mike Oldfield during his career.</p>
<p>Anderson died aged 68 after announcing he had been diagnosed with terminal stage four cancer just a few weeks before.</p>
<p>Former The Cure bandmate Lol Tolhurst paid tribute to a &ldquo;true gentleman and a great musician with a wicked sense of humour&rdquo;, while Iggy Pop said he was &ldquo;one of the nicest people&rdquo; he had worked with.</p>

<p>Born in Tottenham, north London, Mark Hollis worked in factories and as a laboratory technician before becoming a musician and fronting Talk Talk.</p>
<p>He wrote or co-wrote most of the band&rsquo;s music in the 1980s, including singles It&rsquo;s My Life and Life&rsquo;s What You Make It.</p>
<p>Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet&rsquo;s Gary Kemp were among those paying tribute to a &ldquo;genius&rdquo; after his death at the age of 64 following a short illness.</p>
<p>Peter Tork (second left) was one of the founding members of 1960s pop band The Monkees, famed for hit songs such as Daydream Believer and I&rsquo;m A Believer.</p>
<p>A made-for-TV group who formed in Los Angeles and starred in their own self-titled series from 1966 to 1968, Tork played bass guitar and keyboards and sang vocals in the band.</p>
<p>He later went on to collaborate with several musicians including George Harrison, for whom he played the banjo.</p>
<p>Tork died aged 77, with his fellow Monkees bandmates, The Beach Boys&rsquo; Brian Wilson, Blur guitarist Graham Coxon and singer Carole King among those paying tribute.</p>
<p>Best known for his roles in The Sopranos and Casino, Vinny Vella starred in dozens of films throughout the 1990s and 2000s, often playing a gangster.</p>
<p>Known as the mayor of Elizabeth Street in New York&rsquo;s Little Italy, he was the subject of a 2000 documentary, Hey Vinny, in which he recounted his colourful stories of growing up in the city.</p>
<p>He died at home in New York due to liver cancer aged 72.</p>
<p>Instantly recognisable for his distinctive white ponytail, black sunglasses, gloves and high starched collars, Karl Lagerfeld (pictured on the runway with supermodel Claudia Schiffer in 1995) was one of the world&rsquo;s most famous fashion designers.</p>
<p>Chanel&rsquo;s creative director since 1983, he had also worked for Chloe and Fendi, collaborated with labels such as Diesel, Hogan and H&amp;M, and designed costumes for theatrical productions and singers including Madonna and Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>Known for his muses, stars including Schiffer, Vanessa Paradis, Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne were among those who inspired his creative vision.</p>
<p>He died in hospital in Paris aged 85.</p>
<p>England&rsquo;s World Cup-winning goalkeeper of 1966, Gordon Banks made 73 international appearances during his footballing career.</p>
<p>He played just under 300 times for Leicester City before moving to Stoke in 1967, where he made 194 appearances in six years at the club.</p>
<p>Despite playing in every game during the World Cup triumph, it was a save four years later from a Pele header that catapulted him to global stardom. Widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, the England hero was made an OBE in 1970.</p>
<p>He died aged 81 after revealing in 2016 that he had been diagnosed with kidney cancer for a second time.</p>
<p>Jan-Michael Vincent rose to prominence in the 1980s, playing pilot Stringfellow Hawke in US TV series Airwolf, about a high-tech military helicopter and its crew.</p>
<p>The show, about a hi-tech military helicopter and its crew, ran from 1984 until 1986. Vincent reportedly became one of TV&rsquo;s highest-paid stars at the time, earning up to $200,000 per episode. He also appeared in 1972&rsquo;s The Mechanic, alongside Charles Bronson, and in 1978&rsquo;s Hooper with Burt Reynolds.</p>
<p>He died at the age of 73 after suffering a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>British rapper Cadet, real name Blaine Cameron Johnson, was an up-and-coming artist from south London and the cousin of Krept, of duo Krept and Konan.</p>
<p>The music star had built up millions of views on YouTube with songs including Letter To Krept, Instagram Girls and Advice.</p>
<p>He died in a car crash in Staffordshire as he was on his way to a gig at Keele University.</p>
<p>A five-time Oscar nominee, British film legend Albert Finney was known for playing many different characters, with his list of films including Erin Brockovich, Big Fish, Scrooge, Annie and Murder On The Orient Express.</p>
<p>Known for his versatility, he played a huge range of characters during a screen career spanning more than 60 years, from Winston Churchill to Pope John Paul II, and most recently starred in the James Bond film Skyfall and the Bourne films.</p>
<p>He died aged 82 following a short illness, his family said.</p>
<p>Clive Swift (pictured with Dame Patricia Routledge) was best known for playing Richard Bucket, the long-suffering husband of Hyacinth Bucket, in the classic comedy Keeping Up Appearances.</p>
<p>The series mocked British class obsessions and ran for five years in the 1990s, with Swift appearing in 42 episodes alongside Routledge, who became known for her pronunciation of her surname - &ldquo;bouquet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He died at home aged 82 following a short illness, his family said.</p>

<p>He died of cancer aged 57, with Bremner and fellow comedians Jack Dee, David Baddiel and David Schneider paying tribute to a &ldquo;ground-breakingly brilliant, off-the-register funny&rdquo; performer.</p>
<p>March</p>
<p>Indie duo Her&rsquo;s, from Liverpool, had played a gig in Phoenix and were travelling to California when they were involved in a head-on car crash in Arizona.</p>
<p>Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading were killed in the crash alongside their tour manager, Trevor Engelbrektson, with officials saying the collision was caused by another driver travelling the wrong way.</p>
<p>They had recently performed at the influential South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, and were named as ones to watch by The Guardian in 2018.</p>
<p>Roger Charlery, better known as Ranking Roger, was a member of bands The Beat and General Public, and also played with acts including The Specials, The Police and Dexys Midnight Runners in a music career that spanned almost 40 years.</p>

<p>“The cliches about moments like this are true, it turns out. The one about life forever changing in a split second, about the fact that we are all bound up in a web of love and loss, about the primacy of community in times of unfathomable tragedy.</p>
<p>“Charlie was 20-years-old and a junior at Columbia. He studied philosophy and economics and Chinese. He loved Bob Dylan, George Saunders and Hayao Miyazaki. He was questioning, irreverent, curious and kind.</p>
<p>“There are no words. But words are what we’ve got right now, along with tears and hugs and massive quantities of baked goods and deli platters.</p>
<p>“He was absolutely adored by his parents, Jenji Kohan and Christopher Noxon, and his siblings, Eliza and Oscar.</p>
<p>“Charlie had a beautiful life of study and argument and travel and food and razzing and adventure and sweetness and most of all love. We cannot conceive of life without him.”
