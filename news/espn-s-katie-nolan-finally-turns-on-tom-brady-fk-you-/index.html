It’s been over a week since Tom Brady announced his decision to leave the New England Patriots and sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and it’s still all anyone in the sports world is talking about.</p>
<p>That includes on ESPN’s “Highly Questionable,” with the panelists taking a light-hearted approach to the subject centered around Katie Nolan’s Patriots fandom. Tuesday’s discussion focused on Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw’s comments citing “ego” as the reason for Brady’s departure from the Patriots. This sparked an interesting discussion among Dan Le Batard, Mina Kimes and Nolan.</p>
<p>It ended with Nolan, a lifelong Patriots fan who has struggled mightily with the news, admitting she had cursed Tom Brady out loud for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>“He gave discount after discount to that team and I understand why he would feel underappreciated,” Le Batard said of Brady. “I don’t think it’s ego, as much as, the dude was just hurt at the end that the people he should’ve had the most value for, he didn’t have the kind of value that he had in some place like Tampa. That’s human to be hurt by that, no matter how superhuman you think he is, it is very human to find that a vulnerable position to be in.”</p>
<p>Kimes added that she believed the Buccaneers roster should tell you all you need to know about Brady’s decision, insinuating the Patriots’ squad doesn’t have the talent it once did. But Nolan said she felt that they were looking too far into Bradshaw’s comments.</p>
<p>“We have just put more thought into the words that come out of Terry Bradshaw’s mouth than Terry Bradshaw ever has,” Nolan said. “He’s just saying words, he’s just being Terry Bradshaw. We’re overanalyzing it.</p>
<p>see also Katie Nolan&rsquo;s Tom Brady pain was great ESPN entertainment Patriots fans who are mourning the departure of Tom Brady&hellip;</p>
<p>“Of course it’s ego. Everything everybody does has a little bit of ego in it. Dan, you call it being human, most people would call that kind of your ego. Whatever. I’m at the point now, I’m mad at Tom Brady. Can we talk about that? I’m upset.”</p>
<p>Nolan said she was listening to Brady’s introductory conference call for the Buccaneers on Tuesday when she first revealed her suppressed feelings.</p>
<p>“Today was the first day in my life I ever said the phrase … ‘Eff Tom Brady.’ I said it out loud,” she said. “I was listening to the press conference, the conference call, and I said, ‘F–k you.’ And then I was like, ‘Oh my God, that’s Tom Brady.’”
