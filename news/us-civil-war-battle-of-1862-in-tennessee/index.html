<p>AD</p>
<p>On Sunday, Irene Triplett died at Accordius Health, a long-term-care facility in Wilkesboro, N.C., at the age of 90. A relative said she’d broken her hip a few days earlier and died of complications. She never married, and her only brother had died in 1996.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Triplett’s story is a powerful reminder that the Civil War wasn’t that long ago, said Columbia University historian Stephanie McCurry. “Just like the Confederate monuments issue, which is blowing up right now, I think this is a reminder of the long reach of slavery, secession and the Civil War,” she said. “It reminds you of the battle over slavery and its legitimacy in the United States.”</p>
<p>Many more widows and children of other long-ago soldiers are still alive. According to VA, there are 33 surviving spouses and 18 children receiving pension benefits related to the 1898 Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Triplett’s status as a Civil War pensioner began gaining attention in 2011, when the Wilkes Genealogical Society in Wilkes County, N.C., displayed her photograph on its quarterly publication and featured her in a story. The article noted she was one of only two people in the country still reaping a Civil War pension.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>One of the piece’s researchers, Jerry Orton, of Syracuse, N.Y., a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, first discovered that Triplett was earning the benefit in the late 1980s, after he’d embarked on a research project on surviving widows and children of Civil War soldiers. He’d gotten her name from the Veterans Administration. Eventually, he traveled to North Carolina and interviewed her about her life.</p>
<p>“Irene could not recall much of her childhood and has no recollection of Mose,” the historical society’s article said. “She has virtually no memories of fun, presents, friends, neighbors or such, as they lived so isolated, and she had to work on the farm each day, where they primarily raised chicken[s] and kept some hogs and cows as well.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In 2013, an Associated Press story reported that more than $40 billion a year was being spent to compensate veterans and survivors from the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan war. Then the wire service dropped this nugget: “The Civil War payments are going to two children of veterans — one in North Carolina and one in Tennessee — each for $876 per year.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But the AP story didn’t name Triplett or the Tennessee recipient. That’s when the tabloid Daily Mail got involved, identifying Triplett for the first time in a major news publication. The headline: “EXCLUSIVE: Revealed, America’s last living link to the Civil War.”</p>
<p>Relying partly on military records, Orton’s research for the genealogical society and an interview with her nephew, the Daily Mail piece included a photo of Triplett and painted a colorful portrait of her father: Mose first joined a Confederate regiment in North Carolina in 1862, then defected to the Union Army in 1864. He once held a rattlesnake around his neck and sported a Wyatt Earp-style mustache that extended below his chin. He sat on his porch and shot acorns out of trees.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The next year, the Wall Street Journal published its own story on Triplett, a lengthy front-pager that recounted how Mose chose to abandon the Confederacy at exactly the right time — just as he and his regiment were marching through the Shenandoah River Valley on their way to Gettysburg, Pa. The Journal noted that Mose went to a hospital in Danville, Va., with a fever and that state records said he “deserted” on June 26, 1863.</p>
<p>For his future daughter, the timing of his decision could not have been more significant. About a week later, of the 800 men in Mose’s Confederate regiment, 734 died at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Journal said.</p>
<p>On Aug. 1, 1864, Mose joined the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry, known as “Kirk’s Raiders,” a regiment that laid waste to Confederate depots, railroads and bridges.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Four months after the war ended in 1865, Mose was discharged, and he eventually moved back to his native North Carolina, settling on farmland in Wilkes County. Twenty years later, the Journal article said, he applied for his Civil War pension. He and his first wife, Mary, had no children.</p>
<p>After Mary died in the 1920s, Mose married Elida Hall. He was 78. She was 27. Their 1924 marriage, according to the Journal, was rough. They lost three babies. Then Irene was born on Jan. 9, 1930, but had mental disabilities, according to the newspaper. She was 8 when her father died on July 18, 1938, at the age of 92. His headstone reads: “He was a Civil War soldier.”</p>
<p>When the Journal interviewed Triplett, she said her teachers beat her with an oak paddle, and her parents also hit her.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Other children teased her about her father, “the traitor,” one of her relatives told the newspaper. She dropped out of sixth grade. According to the Journal, she and her mother lived for years in a county “poorhouse,” which was infested with rats and mice, before she and her mother later moved into a private nursing home.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“I didn’t care for neither one [of my parents], to tell you the truth about it,” she said. “I wanted to get away from both of them. I wanted to get me a house and crawl in it all by myself.”</p>
<p>After her mother died in 1967, Triplett eventually found her own friends at various nursing homes, especially at her most recent stay at Accordius Health. She chewed tobacco from her pouch of Star tobacco. She loved watching the news on television and reporting back to other residents about the latest goings-on.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Jamie Phillips, the home’s activities director, said she spent most days with her playing bingo and watching her use a red Solo cup as her spittoon. She loved gospel music. Listening to the Bill Withers song, “Lean on Me.” Cream cheese cheeseballs. Fried potatoes and onions. Fried chicken and pinto beans. Laughing. This is what she was known for.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Even if you tripped or dropped something, she’d laugh,” Phillips said. “She was set off by anything. I never saw her angry. Everything was funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if anyone asked her about her father or, in the aftermath of all the news stories, why she was getting a Civil War pension check, she’d demur. “A lot of people were interested in her story,” Phillips said, “but she’d always deflect the conversation to something different going on in the news.”</p>

<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/293618c93039b9f8c829a2c3fb9377f0ad3ee025/0_261_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=b43e81d1f51d434005582e2679462f2e" alt="img">
Daughter of private who fought for both sides and had children in his 80s lived for years in a North Carolina nursing home</p>
<p>The last person to receive a US government pension from the American civil war has died.</p>
<p>Confederate statue to be removed from Virginia&rsquo;s Monument Avenue Read more</p>
<p>Irene Triplett was 90 when she died last Sunday in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Her father, Mose Triplett, fought for the Confederacy and the Union in the civil war, which began in 1861 and ended with the defeat of the slave power in 1865. He applied for his Union pension 20 years after the war and in 1930, when his daughter was born, he was 83.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, which spoke to Irene Triplett for a story in 2014, reported that she died “from complications following surgery for injuries from a fall, according to the nursing home where she lived”.</p>
<p>Dennis St Andrew, a commander of the North Carolina Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, told the Journal Triplett was “a part of history”.</p>
<p>“You’re talking to somebody whose father was in the civil war,” he said. “Which is mind-bending.”</p>
<p>But to Stephanie McCurry, a historian of the civil war and Reconstruction era at Columbia University in New York, Triplett’s death acquired a deeper resonance by occurring in the midst of national civil unrest over the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd, an African American man.</p>
<p>“Just like the Confederate monuments issue, which is blowing up right now, I think this is a reminder of the long reach of slavery, secession and the civil war,” she told the Washington Post. “It reminds you of the battle over slavery and its legitimacy in the United States.”</p>
<p>Each month, Triplett collected $73.13 from the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), a total of $877.56 a year. Her father earned the sum by defecting north in 1863 after missing the battle of Gettysburg, the turning point of the war.</p>
<p>“Pvt Triplett enlisted in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment in May 1862,” the Journal reported, citing Confederate records which showed he was then 16.</p>
<p>And Triplett “transferred to the 26th North Carolina Infantry Regiment early the following year”, “fell ill as his regiment marched north” then “ran away from the hospital … while his unit suffered devastating losses at Gettysburg”.</p>
<p>A deserter, Triplett “made his way to Tennessee and, in 1864, enlisted in … the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry”, Kirk’s Raiders, which “carried out a campaign of sabotage against Confederate targets”.</p>
<p>Mose Triplett was unsurprisingly not popular in post-war North Carolina but eventually, in 1924, still childless, he married a second time. He was nearly 80. His new wife, Elida Hall, was 34. As the Journal put it, “such an age difference wasn’t rare, especially during the Great Depression when civil war veterans found themselves with both a pension and a growing need for care.”</p>
<p>Triplett and Hall had five children but only two survived: Irene, who like her mother suffered from mental disabilities, and Everette, a son born when Mose Triplett was 87. As the Journal wrote in 2014, “Irene and Everette Triplett were born in tough country during tough times. The forested hills ran with white lightning from illegal stills. Ms Triplett said she didn’t drink moonshine, but she got hooked on tobacco in first grade.”</p>
<p>“I dipped snuff in school, and I chewed tobacco in school,” Triplett said then. “I raised homemade tobacco. I chewed that, too. I chewed it all.”</p>
<p>In 1938, aged 92, Mose Triplett attended a reunion at Gettysburg. In his remarks, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt referred to the Gettysburg Address, delivered in November 1863: “Lincoln spoke in solace for all who fought upon this field; and the years have laid their balm upon their wounds. Men who wore the blue and men who wore the gray are here together, a fragment spared by time.”</p>
<p>Newsreel footage posted to YouTube by CSPAN tells of “2,500 veterans, north and south”, black and white, marking “the 75th anniversary of America’s Armageddon”.</p>

<p>Housed in the Confederate camp, Triplett reportedly kept quiet about the double service that placed him in rarefied company. The Victorian journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley, for example, also fought for both sides.</p>

<p>Triplett died shortly afterwards. His gravestone, in Wilkes county, says only: “He was a civil war soldier.”</p>
<p>In 1943, Irene and her mother moved to the Wilkes county poor house. In 1960, they moved to a care home. Elida Hall died in 1967. Everette Triplett died in 1996. Irene lived on, her care paid for by Medicaid and the civil war pension.</p>
<p>The Journal reported that though Irene “saw little of her relatives … a pair of civil war buffs visited and sent her money to spend on Dr Pepper and chewing tobacco”.</p>
<p>Jamie Phillips, the home’s activities director, told the Post Triplett liked gospel music, cream cheese cheeseballs and laughing.</p>
<p>“A lot of people were interested in her story,” Phillips said, “but she’d always deflect the conversation to something different going on in the news.”

<h3 id="these-are-the-army-bases-named-for-confederates">&ldquo;These are the Army bases named for Confederates&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/bea4f623-c16c-414e-9a05-ab6ea43386ab/ba7af02d-e0d4-4a08-a5a2-da52e95918ff/1280x720/match/image.jpg" alt="img">
After some high-profile generals floated the idea of renaming Army bases named after Confederate generals, President Trump said that his administration would “not even consider” such legislation.</p>
<p>Those comments came after it was learned U.S. Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy will seek bipartisan support to change the names of the 10 Army bases named after confederates after protests against police brutality and racial injustice have given them new spotlight.</p>
<p>TRUMP SAYS HIS ADMINISTRATION &lsquo;WILL NOT EVEN CONSIDER&rsquo; RENAMING MILITARY BASES NAMED FOR CONFEDERATES</p>
<p>An Army spokesperson told Politico that Defense Secretary Mark Esper also supports the decision.</p>
<p>Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus penned an opinion piece for The Atlantic saying, “it is time to remove the names of traitors like Benning and Bragg from our country’s most important military bases.”</p>
<p>“The irony of training at bases named for those who took up arms against the United States, and for the right to enslave others, is inescapable to anyone paying attention,” Petraeus wrote.</p>
<p>But President Trump tweeted Wednesday: “These Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom,” Trump tweeted. “Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations. Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!”</p>
<p>Here are the 10 Army bases named after Confederate officers:</p>
<p>Fort Benning, Georgia</p>
<p>Gen. Henry Benning was a secessionist an ardent defender of slavery. Benning presided over Georgia’s secession convention, and even helped write the state’s Ordinance of Secession. When Georgia seceded in 1861, Benning headed to Virginia, where he argued separation from the Union was the only way to preserve slavery.</p>
<p>Benning helped recruit men to form the Seventeenth Georgia Infantry and was chosen as colonel in August 1861 and fought most of his battles in Virginia. He was with his troops in April 1865 when the confederacy surrendered in Appomattox.</p>
<p>Fort Bragg, North Carolina</p>
<p>Gen. Braxton Bragg was unpopular with Confederate troops and known as a poor military tactician, though he was the military adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>In the words of Petraeus, “Bragg’s inability to cooperate diluted his effectiveness until his resounding defeat at the Battle of Chattanooga, in November 1863, precipitated his resignation from the Confederate army.”</p>
<p>Fort Hood, Texas</p>
<p>Gen. John Bell Hood was a well-regarded field commander during the Peninsula Campaign and the Battle of Bull Run in 1962, but his reputation was marred by defeat leading an Army in the Atlanta Campaign and the Franklin-Nashville Campaign.</p>
<p>Fort Lee, Virginia</p>
<p>Gen. Robert E. Lee was the renowned commander of the Confederate States Army. He commanded the Army of Northern Virginia from 1862 until its surrender in 1865 and earned a reputation as a skilled tactician.</p>
<p>TRUMP SAYS HIS ADMINISTRATION WILL &lsquo;NOT EVEN CONSIDER&rsquo; RENAMING MILITARY BASES AFTER CONFEDERATES</p>
<p>Fort Gordon, Georgia</p>
<p>Lt. Gen. John Brown Gordon was known as one of Lee’s most trusted generals.</p>
<p>Fort Polk, Louisiana</p>
<p>Lt. Gen. Leonidas Polk was a planter and slave owner before the war, but was killed during the Battle of Atlanta. He was also the second cousin of President James K. Polk.</p>
<p>Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia</p>
<p>Gen. Ambrose Powell Hill was killed in action at the Third Battle of Petersburg. He was a career U.S. Army officer who fought in the Mexican-American and Seminole wars before joining the Confederacy.</p>
<p>Fort Pickett, Virginia</p>
<p>Also a career U.S. Army officer before joining the Confederacy, Gen. George Pickett led Pickett’s Charge, a bloody and futile Confederate offensive on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg. He fled to Canada when the war was over.</p>
<p>Fort Rucker, Alabama</p>
<p>Col. Edmund Rucker joined the Confederate States Army as the Civil War broke out and was the only officer who was not a general with an Army installation bearing his name.</p>
<p>Camp Beauregard, Louisiana</p>
<p>Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard rose to prominence early in the Civil War, and was one of the leaders who convinced Confederate President Davis that the war was lost and needed to end.</p>
