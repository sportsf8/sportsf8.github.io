Image copyright Family picture Image caption Chloe Middleton, 21, had no underlying health issues, according to her family</p>
<p>A 21-year-old woman with no underlying conditions has died after contracting coronavirus, according to her family.</p>
<p>Chloe Middleton, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, died last week.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post, her aunt Emily Mistry said Ms Middleton &ldquo;had passed away from Covid-19&rdquo; and urged others to &ldquo;do your bit&rdquo; to stop the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>According to government figures, most patients who have died with coronavirus had pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
<p>There have been concerns that younger people were ignoring warnings over its spread, believing the contagion was only a danger to the elderly.</p>
<p>But in a series of Facebook posts, Ms Middleton&rsquo;s family urged the public to heed safety advice and take the virus &ldquo;seriously&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shattered&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her mother, Diane Middleton, wrote: &ldquo;Please think again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking from a personal experience, this so-called virus has taken the life of my 21-year-old daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Mistry added: &ldquo;My beautiful, kind-hearted 21 year old niece has passed away from Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had no underlying health conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said the family was &ldquo;shattered beyond belief&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reality of this virus is only just unfolding before our very eyes,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Please, please adhere to government guidelines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do your bit. Protect yourselves and protect others. The virus isn&rsquo;t spreading, people are spreading the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Middleton&rsquo;s sister, Amy Louise, added that it was &ldquo;about time people took this seriously, before too many people end up in this devastating position&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An 18-year-old man who died in hospital at the weekend after testing positive was being treated for &ldquo;significant underlying health issues&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How deadly is the coronavirus?</p>
<p>The elderly and the unwell are more likely to die if they contract coronavirus.</p>
<p>But even among older people, &ldquo;the great majority will have a mild or moderate disease&rdquo;, according to the UK&rsquo;s chief medical advisor, Prof Chris Whitty.</p>
<p>He also pointed out some young people have ended up in intensive care, and should therefore not dismiss it as a &ldquo;trivial infection&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Current estimates from Imperial College London are that the death rate is almost 10 times higher than average for those over 80, and much lower for those under 40.</p>
<p>As well as age, those with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart or breathing problems are also deemed more at risk.</p>

<p>A family have spoken of their heartbreak after a 21-year-old carer with no underlying health conditions died suddenly at home of Covid-19.</p>
<p>“Beautiful and caring” Chloe Middleton is thought to be the youngest British victim with no pre-existing healthcare problems.</p>
<p>Chloe was not in any of the high-risk groups for coronavirus, but was mildly asthmatic.</p>
<p>She had been visited by ambulance crews in the early hours of Thursday morning suffering with breathing difficulties but was told to rest at home.</p>
<p>However later that day she rapidly deteriorated.</p>
<p>Another ambulance was called but never arrived, with overstretched medics explaining that she was not a priority.</p>

<p>(Image: Facebook)</p>
<p>Tragically at around 6.30pm she went into cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Despite ambulance crews efforts to revive her, she was pronounced dead at home with her boyfriend by her side.</p>
<p>Tests have subsequently confirmed she was positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Now her shattered family have issued a plea for the public to “do their bit” and stay at home.</p>
<p>Her grieving aunt Emily Mistry, 37, told the Mirror: “She didn’t get the care she needed at the time she needed it because of how much strain the system is under. That’s the reality.</p>
<p>“She was young and had no underlying health problems. It just hits home that it’s going to affect so many more people.</p>
<p>“This virus is only just getting started and that’s what scares me. Already they were unable to prioritise my 21-year-old niece for needing medical treatment. We are not even in the thick of it and already the systems are struggling to cope.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of coronavirus? The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cough</p>
<p>a fever If you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS 111 unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“People need to take note of the government’s advice. Even if you think you might not die, you might give it to someone else.”</p>
<p>In a moving tribute, her parents added: “Our darling daughter Chloe will be missed by everyone who knew her.</p>
<p>“She was a beautiful caring free spirited young lady who could light up any room with her gorgeous smile and infectious laugh. She will forever be in our hearts.”</p>
<p>Chloe, from High Wycombe, Bucks, had stopped going to her job at a care home and started self-isolating ten days earlier, when she came down with coronavirus symptoms including a temperature, cough and aches and pains.</p>
<p>Emily, a nurse, spoke to her the day before she died.</p>
<p>“I spoke to her on the Wednesday before she passed to offer her reassurance,” she added. “She had all the symptoms – achey, pain in the chest, coughing and a high temperature.”</p>
<p>When an ambulance crew checked her over in the early hours of the following morning for breathing difficulties, they said it was likely Covid-19 and she was told to continue resting at home.</p>
<p>“Then as the day went on she deteriorated further,” Emily added.</p>
<p>“Another call was made to NHS 111, who said they would send somebody but it wouldn’t be immediately because of the high demand they were under.</p>
<p>“In a short space of time they called back to say they wouldn’t be sending an ambulance because she wasn’t high priority enough.”</p>
<p>She was not in any of the high-risk groups for coronavirus, but was mildly asthmatic.</p>
<p>The sudden death has left her parents, two siblings and her young niece and nephew in shock.</p>
<p>They have requested privacy while they come to terms with her loss.</p>
<p>Emily added: “We are not coping at the moment. It’s so shocking it doesn’t feel real.</p>
<p>“She was just the most fun-loving, kind-hearted, free spirited young girl you could want to meet.</p>
<p>“She always lit up the room – she had the most infectious giggle.”</p>
<p>In a warning to others, she pleaded: “Please, please adhere to government guidelines. Do your bit. Protect yourselves and protect others.”
