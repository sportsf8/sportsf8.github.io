<p>Andy Lonergan has signed a short-term contract extension to continue his Liverpool stay until the end of the season.</p>
<p>Longeran has been with the European and world champions this season having signed a year-long deal in August.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old had originally been drafted in to help with training as Liverpool were short of options for their pre-season tour to the US last July.</p>
<p>He continued to work at Melwood and, with Caomhin Kelleher and then Alisson Becker struck by injury, Liverpool moved to make the switch official on a free transfer.</p>
<p>While yet to make an appearance for the senior team, Lonergan has been on the bench eight times this season, including the last three games before action was suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak on March 13.</p>
<p>His picked up a winners&rsquo; medal in both the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup triumphs as an unused substitute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fits in really well with the team, with all the players in the team,&rdquo; said Liverpool head of goalkeeping John Achterberg to liverpoolfc.com.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gives advice to Caoimhin along with the goalkeeper coaches and that’s good. He works well with the other keepers - with Ali and Adri - and is well liked by all of the players.</p>
<p>“He has a great mentality and has been a good help for us, so from that side he deserves the extension.</p>
<p>“You start the season with all the players, so you want to finish the season with all the players. He has been one of us, so he should be here too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The season was extended because of the current situation, so it’s good and deserved for him to stay here until it’s complete.”

<p>Adrian has clarified has future at Liverpool, insisting he remains focused on remaining at Anfield for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The Spaniard was signed on a free transfer last summer, following the departure of Simon Mignolet who departed for Club Brugge.</p>
<p>The Reds stopper penned a two-year deal at Anfield, with his contract due to expire in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Liverpool, Adrian was training with Real Betis, the club he where began his playing career.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old insist that he sees himself at Liverpool, and is keen to remain on Merseyside for as long as possible.</p>
<p>“I see myself in Liverpool at the moment,” he told Radio Sevilla, quoted by by El Desmarque. “I still have many years of football left, and we will see. I have one more year and another optional one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now I wouldn’t change anything to be here in Liverpool and enjoy this beautiful moment. After this moment I honestly don’t know, football is a lot of fun. In the summer, I saw myself, being free, the possibility of returning to Betis was there, but it vanished.</p>
<p>“You have to live the present, and we’ll see what happens next. Having to leave home was complicated but looking at it now with perspective it’s clear that I’ve grown as a professional and as a person.”</p>
<p>Adrian made 32 appearances for the Real Betis first team before signing for West Ham in 2013.</p>
<p>Speaking about a potential move to his old club, the Spaniard feels it is &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; to picture a return at this moment in time.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth, now I see it a little more difficult (to return to the Betis),” Adrian added.</p>
<p>“After six seasons at West Ham and being free this past summer, it is true that I saw myself closer to returning home or to Spain and continuing my career there.</p>
<p>“Here I signed two seasons plus an optional one and this has been my first year, which has been fantastic.</p>
<p>“We hope to finish the season if possible, with total security, in the field, but then we don’t know anymore.</p>
<p>“The future is very uncertain; we can’t plan much more about tomorrow and what we have now. If the opportunity is given in the future, God will say.”

<h3 id="alisson-becker-captures-why-chelsea-arent-yet-ready-to-challenge-liverpool">&ldquo;Alisson Becker captures why Chelsea aren&rsquo;t yet ready to challenge Liverpool&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The transfer window isn&rsquo;t yet technically open, but Chelsea are demonstrating a clear desire to challenge Liverpool and Manchester City as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The London club have already secured the signature of Hakim Ziyech ahead of next season and recently, they appear to have struck a deal to sign Reds target, Timo Werner.</p>
<p>Despite those two sizeable investments, Chelsea&rsquo;s spending looks set to continue if rumours are to be believed, with Kai Havertz next on the list.</p>
<p>The Bayer Leverkusen attacker is just 20 years-old but he&rsquo;s showcased why he&rsquo;s deserving of a level above in recent times, posting 15 goals and eight assists in all competitions this season while also playing in a variety of different positions.</p>
<p>His acquisition would be a real statement of intent for Frank Lampard, especially considering Leicester&rsquo;s Ben Chilwell is also linked, but they are unlikely to challenge for major honours just yet for one specific reason that the Reds will be all too aware of.</p>
<p>Simply, regardless of the outfield stars that move to Stamford Bridge, Kepa Arrizabalaga remains as the club&rsquo;s first-choice goalkeeper.</p>
<p>The Spaniard moved to England two years ago for a record sum of £72m, but he&rsquo;s since proved to be below average in comparison to Europe&rsquo;s best.</p>
<p>Kepa has faced 71 shots on target in the Premier League this season, with those from open play pictured below, saving only 43 of those which leaves him with a save percentage of just 57.7% - the worst in the division. For perspective, Alisson Becker&rsquo;s is the best, posting 80.4%.</p>
<p>Post-shot Expected Goals - which offers an insight into whether a goalkeeper has an above average ability to stop shots - captures Kepa in a negative light.</p>
<p>This season, he&rsquo;s been expected to concede 4.1 goals fewer than he&rsquo;s actually shipped, with only Southampton&rsquo;s Angus Gunn underperforming by a greater amount.</p>
<p>Football is a low scoring game, meaning that one small error can drastically alter the course of a match - especially when that mistake is made by the man between the sticks.</p>
<p>Listen to the latest Analysing Anfield podcast by clicking HERE</p>
<p>Liverpool have suffered drastically over the course of the past decade due to poor goalkeeping, which changed significantly once Alisson Becker moved to Merseyside.</p>
<p>In 2017/18, for example, Liverpool&rsquo;s xG for and against was notably better than Manchester United&rsquo;s and the Reds also exceeded their rivals according to various other performance indicators.</p>
<p>However, Jose Mourinho&rsquo;s outfit finished second in the table while Jurgen Klopp&rsquo;s men placed fourth, and much of that was due to how David De Gea&rsquo;s shot-stopping ability secured results for United that seemed undeserved.</p>
<p>The Spanish international was expected to concede around 43.5 goals, but he shipped only 28.</p>
<p>Goalkeepers are prone to taking a back seat when their team is performing well, but they are crucial when competing for the most prestigious honours.</p>
<p>Regardless of the strength of Chelsea&rsquo;s attack - if they are willing to persist with deficiencies in goal, they will suffer from sporadic moments and their results will continue to fluctuate more so than a title-winning side can afford.</p>
<p>Lampard&rsquo;s men are almost certainly set to improve but until they resolve their goalkeeping problem, they shouldn&rsquo;t be considered as a legitimate threat to Liverpool&rsquo;s dominance.

<h3 id="liverpools-rarely-seen-dream-midfield-needs-to-be-unleashed-by-jürgen-klopp-to-protect-dynamic-duo">&ldquo;Liverpool&rsquo;s rarely-seen dream midfield needs to be unleashed by Jürgen Klopp to protect dynamic duo&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.liverpool.com/incoming/article18396900.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1177818473.jpg" alt="img">
There&rsquo;s an argument that if Jürgen Klopp and Pepijn Lijnders were sat down and asked which individual goal represents Liverpool&rsquo;s identity more than any other this season or beyond, the answer would be Andy Robertson&rsquo;s against RB Salzburg at Anfield on 2 October 2019. After a sublime and perennially understated team opener by Sadio Mané, Robertson started and ended a move on 24 minutes to make it 2-0, with Trent Alexander-Arnold the provider (of course). It was a goal which epitomised the importance of Liverpool full-backs who are anything but. They are Liverpool playmakers, pacesetters and creative fulcrums in two, and now they need protection.</p>
<p>Liverpool will return to action in just over ten days time against Everton, a game confirmed at Goodison Park. It will be as blood and thunder as you could imagine, given that supporters will be notably absent and it is the first competitive encounter for both in three months. Liverpool are back in group training and preparing for the remainder of the biggest Premier League season in 30 years. Klopp and Lijnders will have plenty to ponder, and among the most pressing will be the avoidance of injury and over exertion in certain ares, particularly at full-back.</p>
<p>Robertson and Alexander-Arnold have a staggering 58 assists in all competitions since the 2017/18 season. More than that, they regularly feature highest in successful crossing percentages (61 for Trent so far this season) and open plat xG assisted (0.21 Trent and 0.18 Robertson). Furthermore, the team is now seeped in their own playing styles and traits. Their regular switches of play have become a feature in how the Reds patiently dissect opponents and stubborn approaches. But it perhaps cannot be expected to place too much responsibility on anyone for the remainder of the season, and therefore the two will need help.</p>
<p>They will get it from centre-backs and goalkeeper, but midfield is where the burden can be most shared at Anfield going forward. The likelihood is that reliable stalwarts such as Jordan Henderson, Gini Wijnaldum and James Milner will be entrusted once again when the games commence, but there are those who still pine for what they term the &ldquo;dream midfield&rdquo;. One which is born in a Football Manager type simulation and pays no mind to the practicalities of Liverpool&rsquo;s tactical setup. Yet now, there could be that opportunity afforded from Klopp in order to protect his dynamic wide men.</p>
<p>(Image: Photo by Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)</p>
<p>To ensure Liverpool don&rsquo;t overburden anyone they will need to ensure they do what they do best: defend from the front. When looking at the midfielder&rsquo;s who do this best at the club, there are certain surprises in the statistics. The most obvious to many will be Naby Keita. Keita is a statistical enigma at times, and this is no different. Yet in the cold, hard numbers when drilling down - the Guinean has averaged 2.55 interceptions and 5.56 tackles so far this season. Comparing him to Wijnaldum, for example, who has 1.51 and 0.78 respectively, the difference is stark.</p>
<p>Liverpool will need such traits to retain possession. Also when on the ball, the 25-year-old has a pass completion percentage of 91 percent (same as Wijnaldum) which shows he&rsquo;s anything but wasteful. Similarly, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain&rsquo;s strengths are worth factoring in this argument. The Englishman is known to work tirelessly in defensively wide areas, and could be a perfect buffer for Trent going forward. To date this season, Chamberlain has only a 17.9 percent rating for losing the ball in his own half, with 67.7 percent for ball recoveries in the opposition half. This is up slightly on someone like Milner, who managed 22.4 percent of own half losses and 51.4 percent of opposition half recoveries.</p>
<p>There is perhaps less conversation around Jordan Henderson. The Liverpool skipper has been monumental to the cause this season and will surely play a key role in the run in, fitness prevailing. However, where Henderson fits into the team and to who&rsquo;s expense will be fascinating. Fabinho will be pushing for his number six berth on the return, and the Brazilian&rsquo;s ability to carry and progress the ball from deep (6.84 per game) as well as pressured regains of the ball (3.74 per game) would all help his full-backs.</p>
<p>One example of the trio being seen together was against Genk away in the Champions League this season, where Chamberlain scored twice in a 4-1 win. Interestingly when viewing Robertson, who was the only one of the normal pairing to start that night, completed just 19 final third passes all evening, with only three touches in the opposition box. He was also spared most of his defensive duty having not been required to make a interception, block or clearance all evening, which could say something for what was happening in front of him.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;dream midfield&rdquo; is unlikely to be seen as the solution for the remainder of the season, but it may well be seen in different stages, especially if the Reds tie up the title early on when football resumes. What is clear is that Klopp will need the majority of his midfield to function as a protection to other areas of the pitch. With how crucial Alexander-Arnold and Roberston both are to the cause, the impact of rotation elsewhere might just be key.

<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;Klopp made me think I&rsquo;m the coolest!&rsquo; - Former Dortmund keeper praises inspirational powers of Liverpool manager</p>
<p>Zlatan Alomerovic hailed the impression the coach made on him with his legendary man-management skills</p>
<p>Former goalkeeper Zlatan Alomerovic has praised the motivational prowess of Jurgen Klopp, the manager who was in charge of BVB as the shot-stopper threatened to make inroads in the first team.</p>
<p>Alomerovic signed on with BVB as a teenager in 2006 and spent nine years at the club, and although he would never featured for the first team, he was a regular with the reserves and spent time among the substitutes for the side.</p>
<p>Now 28 years old and on the books of Lechia Gdansk in ’s top flight, the Serbian-German has recalled what an inspiration Klopp, who was in charge at Signal Iduna Park from 2008 until 2015, was on his career.</p>
<p>“He is an exceptional trainer and person who can give you incredible self-confidence,” he told Goal and Spox. “From time to time, he would shout and could reprimand you. He is extremely good at saying the right things at the right time - and with that he grabs the players.</p>
<p>“I can still remember my first friendly game in a training camp. I came on at half-time. He didn&rsquo;t tell me to do this or that, just: &lsquo;You are so good, you have a lot of strengths. Go out and show them to people. '</p>
<p>“Then I went to the box and thought: ‘I&rsquo;m the coolest!’”</p>
<p>While the plan was to develop into Dortmund’s second-choice goalkeeper as he signed fresh terms committing him to the club until 2016, he revealed that he was not rated by Thomas Tuchel, the man who replaced Klopp, nearly so highly.</p>
<p>“He immediately made it absolutely clear that he wanted a new goalkeeper,” he recalled. “That was Roman Burki, so it was obvious that two goalkeepers would be leaving. Roman Weidenfeller, Mitch Langerak and I still had a contract.</p>
<p>“That&rsquo;s why sports director Michael Zorc came up to me and said: ‘We respect your contract, but if an inquiry should come, we would not put any obstacles in your way.’</p>
<p>“At that time, I was one of the best goalkeepers in the 3rd league, so the move to Kaiserslautern was actually logical.”</p>
<p>The move to the second tier did not work out and after a year out of the game, Alomerovic found his way to Poland, where he is currently second choice with Lechia Gdansk.

<p>Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker has showed off a sharp new look.</p>
<p>The Reds number one took to social media to share a moving image of his fresh haircut.</p>
<p>Alisson, among many other Liverpool players, returned to training last month with a longer looking hairstyle.</p>
<p>But the Brazilian shot-stopper has now been given a new look thanks to wife Natalia Becker.</p>
<p>In a boomerang post to Instagram, Natalia can be seen chopping away at Alisson&rsquo;s hair which is now noticeably shorter.</p>
<p>The post which was shared on Wednesday night with the 27-year-old&rsquo;s 6.9million followers gave a unique glimpse of his new hairdo.</p>
<p>Alisson, who was injured when football was suspended in March, has now returned to full fitness.</p>
<p>Following the government&rsquo;s backing of the Premier League&rsquo;s plans to return under Project Restart the Reds could be back in action later this month.</p>
<p>With Jurgen Klopp&rsquo;s side currently sat just two wins from a first top flight title triumph in 30 years.

<p>Liverpool youngster Harvey Elliott will sign his first professional contract at the beginning of July, with the teenager set to be given a chance to impress in Liverpool&rsquo;s remaining games of the season.</p>
<p>Elliott only turned 17 at the beginning of April, but he already has seven senior Reds appearances under his belt having joined from Fulham last summer.</p>
<p>The winger remains the youngest player in Premier League history having figured for the Londoners in a match against Wolves at the age of 16 years and 30 days in May last year, and his development has impressed Jurgen Klopp ever since he switched Craven Cottage for Anfield.</p>
<p>Elliott is set to sign a three-year deal at the beginning of July, and he will then be able to extend the contract by a further two seasons once he turns 18 next year.</p>

<p>Klopp has included the England under-17 international in first-team training whenever possible, and he made his Premier League debut when coming on as a substitute for Mohamed Salah in a 2-0 win over Sheffield United in January.</p>
<p>He would need four more Premier League appearances to be eligible for a title winners&rsquo; medal, and he could be set to feature towards the end of the season should the Reds have already wrapped up the Premier League title.</p>

<p>Liverpool&rsquo;s first game back is a Merseyside derby at neighbours Everton on June 21, where a win would be enough to crown them champions should Manchester City have lost to Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on June 17.</p>
<p>It was announced on Tuesday that midfielder Adam Lallana has extended his contract until the end of the current campaign, when he will leave on a free transfer.</p>
<p>Backup goalkeeper Andy Lonergan has also extended his deal until the end of July, while full-back Nathaniel Clyne will be allowed to depart.
