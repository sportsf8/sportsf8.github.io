<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1flTolpjGZDNTNj0qWGuPg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz02MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cbc.ca/914e3086fc0ee5cd550a5d774795c52f" alt="img">
The decision by Canadian authorities to lay terror charges in the case of a deadly stabbing believed to be fuelled by a hatred of women could finally force a reckoning of the country&rsquo;s definition of terrorism, with legal minds on various sides grappling with exactly what counts as an ideological motive, national security experts say.</p>
<p>The charges announced Tuesday in connection with the killing of 24-year-old Ashley Noell Arzaga at a Toronto erotic massage parlour represent the first time police have treated an alleged incel-inspired attack as an act of terrorism.</p>
<p>Since Criminal Code offences for terrorism were first introduced in 2001, 56 out of the 57 terror charges laid in Canada have been in cases of Islamist-inspired extremism, Leah West, former Department of Justice lawyer and national security expert at Carleton University, told CBC News.</p>
<p>Until now, just one has been laid in connection with another ideology ‚Äî in 2008, when a Toronto-area man was charged with raising funds for a Tamil militant group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ideology is not defined in the Criminal Code and this will be one of the interesting things that prosecutors have to face in bringing these charges, because they&rsquo;re trying to prove that the incel movement is an ideology,&rdquo; West said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So how they choose to define that and prove that will be the real interesting element of this prosecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>WATCH | Homicide at Toronto massage parlour an act of incel terrorism, police say:</p>
<p>One day after the terror charges were laid in the alleged incel-inspired stabbing, Canada&rsquo;s spy agency released its latest annual report identifying &ldquo;violent misogyny&rdquo; as a form of ideologically motivated extremism.</p>
<p>The report makes explicit reference to two violent incidents in Ontario as examples of violent extremism: the 2018 Toronto van attack and a June 2019 stabbing in Sudbury, Ont., in which the attacker referred to himself as incel and said he drew inspiration from the van attack.</p>
<p>Terror charges were not laid in either case. Nor were they laid in the 2014 Moncton shooting that killed three RCMP officers ‚Äî also explicitly listed in the CSIS report as ideological extremism of the &ldquo;anti-authority&rdquo; variety.</p>
<p>The Criminal Code defines terrorism as an act carried out, &ldquo;for a political, religious or ideological purpose, objective or cause&rdquo; meant to intimidate the public by causing or attempting to cause death or serious bodily harm through violence, endangering health and safety, or disrupting an essential service.</p>
<p>West says she believes Tuesday&rsquo;s move marks a recognition that the incel movement is in fact an ideology that can drive terrorism and is &ldquo;just as repugnant&rdquo; as other forms of extremism that lead to violence.</p>
<p>Could van attacker face terror charges?</p>
<p>In late February 2020, police were called to a massage parlour in Toronto&rsquo;s north end for a stabbing that left Arzaga dead and another woman and man suffering multiple stab wounds. A 17-year-old was charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder.</p>
<p>Shortly after the incident, Toronto police contacted the RCMP&rsquo;s Integrated National Security Enforcement Team (INSET), &ldquo;after uncovering that this crime was potentially a &lsquo;terrorist activity,'&rdquo; the RCMP said in a news release.</p>
<p>An investigation found that the, &ldquo;crime was in fact one in which the accused was inspired by the ideologically motivated extremist movement commonly known as incel,&rdquo; the release said.</p>
<p>The charges against the 17-year-old, who cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, were subsequently upgraded to terror-related charges.</p>
<p>Incel, or &ldquo;involuntary celibate,&rdquo; is a misogynistic subculture that began online and remained relatively obscure until it was linked to cases of violence and murder in the mid-2010s. Self-identified incel followers share a frustration over their inability to find a romantic or sexual partner, often blaming women for their feelings of rejection.</p>
<p>The term gained newfound attention two years ago following the Toronto van attack, after Alek Minassian tore through a stretch of a Toronto sidewalk in a rented van, killing 10 people and injuring 16 others. Minassian would later vent his sexual frustrations to police, saying in an interview he was inspired by incel ideology.</p>

<p>Sadiya Ansari is Toronto-based writer and professor of journalism at Centennial College.</p>
<p>Last week, two words‚Äî‚Äúterrorist activity‚Äù‚Äîattached to a murder charge against a 17-year-old who fatally stabbed a woman, signalled a massive shift in Canada‚Äôs national security framework. The teen, who can‚Äôt be named because of his age, allegedly wielded a machete against 24-year-old Ashley Noelle Arzaga at a Toronto massage parlour in February, killing her and injuring two others.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTerrorism comes in many forms and it‚Äôs important to note that it is not restricted to any particular group, religion or ideology,‚Äù the RCMP recently wrote in its press release, which came out this week.</p>
<p>The terror charge represents two shifts. First, out of some 60 charges of terrorism laid since 2001 in Canada, all but one have been related to Islamic terrorism. Second, it‚Äôs the first time the incel ideology, which stems from an online community of men who feel they are denied sex by women, has been criminally recognized as terrorism since the movement of ‚Äúinvoluntary celibates‚Äù surfaced in 2014. According to a police source who spoke with Global News, ‚Äúthe accused in the massage parlour case said he wanted to kill as many women as possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>This charge represents a reimagining of what national security means in this country. It signals that law enforcement agencies have finally expanded who they think is a threat. Mass murders like the Toronto van attack and Quebec mosque shooting are often referred to as terrorism, but the reality is, the perpetrators of these crimes have not been prosecuted for charges based on terrorism.</p>
<p>While this shift is worth celebrating, why has it taken so long? Terrorism laws have long been used against brown and black bodies. When will they be used to protect them against a growing white supremacist threat?</p>
<p>The double standard is well-documented.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRealistically, we‚Äôve only ever charged brown people, or people who ascribe to Islamic faith as terrorists before, [while] white people got charged with hate,‚Äù says Leah West, an expert in national security law and lecturer at Carleton University.</p>
<p>But West sees this case as an important shift: ‚ÄúThey are finally applying the law equitably.‚Äù Under Canadian law, a crime is considered terror if its motive is ‚Äúin whole or in part for a political, religious or ideological purpose, objective or cause.‚Äù And there are other indications there‚Äôs movement on who law enforcement agencies view as terrorists‚Äîextreme right-wing groups like Blood and Honour and Combat 18 were listed as ‚Äúterrorist groups‚Äù last year, for instance, and a recent Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) report cites violent misogyny and xenophobic ideologies as ‚Äúthreats‚Äù.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge in prosecuting a crime as terrorism is proving the act was motivated by ideology. It may not impact the sentencing outcome, so other than sending a signal to society that the violence was motivated by extremist ideas, there‚Äôs little incentive for prosecutors to add a complex layer to a case, says West. Motivation is usually determined by a number of factors‚Äîstatements made by the accused, associations with groups, online posts, and what the suspect read or watched. When dealing with terrorism cases related to religiously-motivated violence, West says that to establish someone‚Äôs ideology a prosecutor might show a jury ‚Äúwhether or not their faith was uber conservative and not aligned with mainstream Islam.‚Äù</p>
<p>While we know how law enforcement determines who is considered a terrorist in individual cases, what we often don‚Äôt know is how they determine who isn‚Äôt a terrorist.</p>
<p>The oft-repeated line after mass murders is that motivation was too difficult to determine. In the case of Alexandre Bissonnette, who walked into a Quebec City mosque and fatally shot six men, a Crown psychiatrist who evaluated the shooter described his act as one ‚Äútoo egotistic to be a terrorist act. But it is a crime steeped in racism even if he doesn‚Äôt see it.‚Äù It‚Äôs a confusing way to say the crime was a racist act but not one motivated by ideology.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is unfounded bias; who society deems capable of holding a certain ideology. ‚ÄúWe are much more inclined to think that brown people are more prone to ideological thinking whereas white people are ideology-free or kind of structurally incapable of having an ideology,‚Äù says Amarnath Amarasingam, an extremism researcher and assistant professor at Queen‚Äôs University.</p>
<p>Amarasingam believes the massage parlour case as a step in shifting that thinking, one that will force conversations about how ideology is recognized in crime.</p>
<p>While the incel movement is a relatively new expression of violent misogyny, I asked Amarasingam why white supremacist movements have been so difficult for authorities to identify, given their history and organizing power in this country, from the Ku Klux Klan making its way into Canada in the 1920s to the Heritage Front in the 1990s, to the Canadian Nationalist Party qualifying as a political party in the last election. Amarasingam attributes part of the problem to living in a society centred around what he calls ‚Äúwhite structural privilege‚Äù.</p>
<p>While groups like the Ku Klux Klan are over a century old, there are newer white supremacist groups, particularly those with strong online communities, that don‚Äôt fit the image of a traditional terrorist group. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for the powers that be to fully understand the movements within their own racial group,‚Äù he says.</p>
<p>A 2018 internal report unearthed by a Montreal radio station CHMP-FM revealed that 37 members of the Canadian Armed Forces belonged to hate groups or made racist statements between 2013 and 2018. Sixteen were linked to six extreme right-wing groups that espoused ‚Äúspecifically anti-Islam and/or white supremacy‚Äù beliefs, including the Proud Boys, the Soldiers of Odin, and Quebec-based La Meute, which was founded by two former members of the armed forces.</p>
<p>Last year, the Department of National Defence came under fire for lack of transparency after it didn‚Äôt share how these cases were handled with the public. It then revealed that seven people who belonged to hate groups were no longer with the armed forces and 16 were subject to ‚Äúcounselling, warnings and disciplinary measures,‚Äù according to a CBC report.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImagine if someone said there were five ISIS supporters in the Canadian Armed Forces,‚Äù says Amarasingam. The institutional reaction to discovering neo-Nazis and extreme right-wing elements in the military should be the same, but in this case, Amarasingam says it amounted to a bit of a shrug: ‚ÄúEveryone is like, ‚Äòhuh, cool, interesting.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>This nonchalance reveals how central whiteness is to our understanding of national security. Who is seen as a danger to society depends on who you think is worth protecting. The lack of prosecution of white supremacist violence as terrorism is particularly depressing given that most terrorism charges are handed to brown and black men.</p>
<p>These laws been used to subject brown and black men to surveillance and prosecution over two decades, resulting in devastating damage like the wrongful detention of Canadian Muslims in foreign prisons like Maher Arar. Surveillance has also impinged on the everyday lives of Muslims, with reports of CSIS agents being sent into mosques to look for informants and also turning up at the homes of university students who appear to have one thing in common‚ÄîMuslims names. This heightened scrutiny goes hand-in-hand with rising Islamophobia, feeding stereotypes that spike hate crimes against Muslims year after year.</p>
<p>While Canada‚Äôs terror law itself defines ideology and motive broadly, it‚Äôs clearly applied differentially. In the case of Bissonnette, a 2018 public safety report on the threat of terrorism plainly states ‚ÄúBissonnette was motivated, at least in part, by his self-admitted fear of Muslims,‚Äù yet it was not prosecuted as an act motivated by white-supremacist ideology.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really troubling and puzzling why the court would conclude in Bissonnette‚Äôs case that his hatred of Muslims was irrelevant to the fact that he shot Muslims,‚Äù says Reem Bahdi, an associate law professor at the University of Windsor.</p>
<p>In a recent paper on racial profiling for the Osgoode Hall Law Review, Bahdi writes about the practice of reading the ‚Äúsilences‚Äù in the law: ‚Äúthe unsaid can reveal as much about legal values, priorities, imaginations and possibilities as the stated word.‚Äù</p>
<p>I asked where she thinks the ‚Äúsilences‚Äù are in Canadian terrorism laws. ‚ÄúThat terrorists are Muslims,‚Äù she notes. ‚ÄúThat violence associated or perpetuated by Muslims is terrorism. Violence perpetuated against Muslims is not as easily identified as terrorism.‚Äù</p>
<p>The new use of terror charges against an alleged incel is being celebrated as a sign this will change, that we‚Äôre already seeing a more equitable application of the law. But the legacy of law enforcement‚Äôs use of these charges leaves me cautious. This case raises an interesting question, but one that remains unanswered: Can a law rooted in racist application ever be applied equitably?</p>
<p>CORRECTION, Jun. 1, 2020: When it comes to prosecuting a crime as terrorism, the original version of this article states that Leah West said that ‚Äúevidence is collected to show ‚Äòwhether or not their faith was uber conservative and not aligned with mainstream Islam‚Äô.‚Äù This is factually incorrect. In fact, Leah West says that to establish someone‚Äôs ideology, a prosecutor might show jury whether or not whether or not their faith was uber conservative and not aligned with mainstream Islam.

Social Justice What really is antifa? Effie Baum, an ‚Äòeveryday anti-fascist,‚Äô talks about President Trump‚Äôs threat to designate the movement as a terrorist organization, and corrects the record.</p>
<p>As cities across the United States entered a sixth day of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers on May 25, President Donald Trump did something no other president had done before: He attempted to make a terrorist designation via tweet. ‚ÄúThe United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization,‚Äù he wrote, referring to an anti-fascist movement that has gained momentum during his administration.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, speaking from the White House Rose Garden, Trump reiterated that promise as flash-bang grenades echoed nearby. Peaceful protesters, demonstrating against nationwide police brutality against people of color, were sent screaming and sprinting away. ‚ÄúIn recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, or, arsonists, looters, criminals, rider rioters, antifa and others,‚Äù Trump told reporters.</p>
<p>Experts called Trump‚Äôs designation an ‚Äúempty threat‚Äù that would be challenged in court. But it wasn‚Äôt a new idea: Last year, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, R, co-sponsored a bill to brand anti-fascists as terrorists. In Washington, Republican state Rep. Matt Shea ‚Äî who has himself participated in far-right domestic terrorism, according to a bipartisan investigation last year ‚Äî introduced a bill to investigate antifa. Neither gained traction.</p>

<p>Two years ago, tired of seeing anti-fascists portrayed as only masked, black-clad protesters breaking windows or getting into fistfights, an ‚Äúeveryday anti-fascist‚Äù group formed in Portland, Oregon. Popular Mobilization ‚Äî or PopMob ‚Äî was a response to the rallies continually being held in the city by far-right agitators like the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer. As PopMob spokesperson Effie Baum told High Country News, the group‚Äôs goal was to send a clear message: Fascists aren‚Äôt welcome here.</p>
<p>PopMob also wanted to reframe the media‚Äôs image of antifa. The group coined the term ‚Äúeveryday anti-fascist‚Äù and turned counter-protests into dance parties, circuses and, most famously, free milkshake giveaways. HCN recently caught up with Baum to talk about Trump‚Äôs threat and the fact that not all anti-fascists wear black. Some, in fact, wear banana costumes.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>HCN: Let‚Äôs start with a very basic question: What is antifa?</p>
<p>Effie Baum: ‚ÄúAntifa‚Äù is short for anti-fascist. It is not a unified organization. Anybody can use (the term), and anybody who identifies as an anti-fascist could also say they are antifa. You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äújoin‚Äù antifa. It is a self-designated thing. If you are anti-fascist, you are antifa.</p>
<p>Where it gets muddy is that the media representation of ‚Äúantifa&rdquo; is often images of people utilizing a tactic known as ‚Äúblack bloc,‚Äù which is big groups of people dressed all in black that you see on television. And the issue with that is that, in addition to equating antifa only with that specific tactic, it does a huge disservice to all of the work that anti-fascists do besides that one very small thing, which is community defense. Ninety-eight percent of the work that anti-fascists do does not happen in the streets. Black bloc is a tactic ‚Äî it is not an organization or a group.</p>
<p>The stereotype is that (people in black bloc are) disruptive, that they‚Äôre just troublemakers, but the fact of the matter is they are our front lines of defense from state violence and from violence that would be inflicted on us by the right.</p>
<p>One of the other things that anti-fascists do is expose fascists and people that are engaging in white nationalist and far-right ideologies and violent activity. A lot of it is also, like, internet research and looking at pictures from things like Charlottesville, and identifying the people in those photos and then posting their information as a way to raise that cost of participation.</p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to ‚Äújoin‚Äù antifa. It is a self-designated thing. If you are anti-fascist, you are antifa.</p>
<p>HCN: My mind goes to the way that KKK groups were more visible in the 1960s, and those people were socially shamed out of participating in outwardly racist activities. Is that the logic of that practice, too?</p>
<p>EB: That‚Äôs exactly what it is. We want these people to be exposed because we know that the majority of people don‚Äôt share their ideology, the majority of people are not white supremacists or active, organizing, white nationalists, and don‚Äôt support that far-right violent rhetoric. So, by exposing them ‚Äî yes, it makes them uncomfortable, because then all their co-workers know that they‚Äôre engaged in that work, their landlords, their spouses, because sometimes not even their family knows. And it is a way of making them be shamed by their community.</p>
<p>HCN: Yesterday, Trump reiterated the tweet that he sent out on Sunday, that he intends to designate antifa as a terrorist organization. How do you understand what he‚Äôs trying to do?</p>
<p>EB: Right now, in this moment, the people are a real threat to the power of the police and the power of the state and basically all of the authoritarianism that Trump has been utilizing in his time in office. And so (he is) desperate to discredit what is happening by any means necessary. Because it is growing and spreading so rapidly, they cannot contain it. So, given the public perception and stigma that already exists against anti-fascists, anti-fascists are an easy scapegoat.</p>
<p>It also works to delegitimize the movement, because if they say, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs just a bunch of white kids or white supremacists, or these out-of-towners or outside agitators‚Äô ‚Äî what that does is it delegitimizes the real issues that we are dealing with and (why) these marches and protests are happening: the murder of George Floyd, the rampant murder of Black men and women across the country by police, and the violence that the state and the police inflict on Black and brown bodies every day.</p>
<p>An authoritarian administration is always going to villainize those that are the most opposed to this rising tide of fascism and authoritarianism that we‚Äôre seeing both in the U.S. and internationally. By shifting the narrative away from the police brutality, they do get that public support from both sides that are clutching their pearls over broken windows, instead of focusing on the police violence that we‚Äôve been seeing.</p>
<p>HCN: Legislators around the country, as well as Portland city and Oregon state officials, are talking a lot about broken windows right now.</p>
<p>EB: Well, I think it is just business as usual for the police, because the police basically protect property and the wealth of the ruling class. The entire purpose of the police is largely property protection, and capitalism prioritizes the safety of property and capital over people.</p>
<p>It is really absurd that people are more concerned about broken windows, which can be fixed, than the fact that we have an entire culture of policing that gets away with murder every single day. And the issue shouldn&rsquo;t be whether or not Target got its windows broken, because Target is a multi-bajillion dollar organization that can afford to replace some windows. But people like George Floyd and all of the people that have been murdered by the police are never gonna get their lives back. Those family members are never going to get their sons and daughters, and sisters and brothers and spouses, back. Those people are gone forever. Windows can be fixed. Graffiti can be painted over or washed off. All of that is just stuff.</p>

<p>HCN: Popular Mobilization started two years ago. Tell me how your role has shifted from when you formed then to what it is today.</p>
<p>EB: When we originally formed, our main goal was trying to encourage as many people as possible to show up and stand against these far-right groups that were having these rallies in Portland. We wanted to create an environment where it was more accessible and more welcoming for a larger, diverse group of people to show up and participate. The idea is that it would hopefully dissuade the police from using a lot of violence and crowd control.</p>
<p>The other thing that we do is try to make it fun as a way to invite more people to participate. And, you know, all of this stuff against anti-fascism and standing up against the violent far-right is so serious. And the thing is, one of the ways that you can really take away the power from those guys is to laugh at them.</p>
<p>Some Proud Boy-affiliated loudmouth from Florida named Joe Biggs was organizing, and they were busing and flying in far-right dudes from all over the country for this ‚Äúwar on antifa‚Äù in Portland (in August 2019). And so we decided we did not want them to have the capability of making what I refer to as ‚Äútoxic masculinity riot porn,‚Äù which is the videos that they will post of themselves engaging in street fights. ‚Ä¶ So we encouraged people to be as ridiculous as possible and, like, dress up in banana costumes or the giant poop emoji and unicorns and dinosaurs so that any opportunity they had to try to make some video of them looking all macho would have something completely ridiculous in the background. We had an entire brass band dressed as bananas. That was the Banana Bloc ‚Äî like, 50 people dressed in banana costumes.</p>
<p>It was also the largest coalition we‚Äôve ever had around an action. We had more than 30 organizations signed on. It was a very broad-based, diverse coalition that ranged all the way from more militant organizations like Rose City Antifa, all the way to the NAACP, interfaith organizations, Buddhist Peace Fellowship, Portland United Against Hate ‚Äî a very, very diverse group of organizations coming together united around one idea, which is we don‚Äôt want these fucks in our city.</p>
<p>There are a lot of organizers in this town that have been doing this work for a really long time that are seasoned and (have been) working on police accountability for a long time.</p>
<p>HCN: What is your role in the current rallies ‚Äî to back up Black and brown leaders?</p>
<p>EB: Yes. &hellip; It is not appropriate for us to take center stage in planning these; instead, we should be supporting the groups that are organizing events ‚Äî amplifying, boosting, uplifting the voices of our local Black organizers. There are a lot of organizers in this town that have been doing this work for a really long time that are seasoned and (have been) working on police accountability for a long time.</p>
<p>HCN: A lot of our readers live in small communities or small cities. What do you say about being anti-fascist in places like that?</p>
<p>EB: Well, that‚Äôs part of our everyday anti-fascist thing. Anybody who is opposed to fascism, you are an anti-fascist. And you don‚Äôt have to show up in the streets or fill some role or be an organizer or a protester to identify as anti-fascist. You know, 75 years ago, everybody in this country was an anti-fascist. When we were at war with fascists in Europe, everyday people, everyone would have been an anti-fascist. Being an anti-fascist should not be a controversial thing. It should be controversial to be a fascist.</p>
