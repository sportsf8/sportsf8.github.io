<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202008/cricketbatrep-647x363.jpeg?YxUyVb_kRYyFzOT9SOWE2IsaT4LA.DJ7" alt="img">
Mumbai club cricketer, Karan Tiwari, was found dead in his residence in Malad, Mumbai on Monday night. Karan was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his room.</p>
<p>Karan Tiwari was suspected to be under depression due to concerns over his professional career. Not getting a proper platform to showcase his talent and an elusive Indian Premier League (IPL) contract did not help his mental situation.</p>
<p>Kurar police reportedly filed an accidental death case and the cause for the death is yet to be ascertained. No suicide note was found at his residence wherein he lived with his mother and brother.</p>
<p>Police said Karan had called one of his friends in Rajasthan and discussed the lack of opportunities and his struggles with mental health. The friend in question immediately called Karan&rsquo;s sister, who also lives in Rajasthan, and informed her about the same. While his sister passed on the message to his mother in Malad, it was too late as Karan locked himself up inside his room after dinner on Monday.</p>
<p>Karan Tiwari was referred to as &lsquo;Junior Steyn&rsquo; in the Mumbai club cricket circle due to the resemblance of his bowling action to that of South Africa great Dale Steyn. Karan did not play for the Mumbai senior men&rsquo;s cricket team but had been bowling at nets against Mumbai batsmen over the years.

<p>Mumbai’s net bowler Tiwari wanted to joinif he didn’t achieve success as cricketer, says his brother.Failure to win a place in the IPL or even find mention in Mumbai’s Ranji probables drove Karan Tiwari to despair and he took the extreme step of ending his life Tuesday night. The 27-year-old medium-pacer, whose bowling action bore a striking resemblance to that of South Africa’s bowling legend Dale Steyn, was anet bowler for Mumbai’s Ranji net sessions.Vinayak Samant, former coach of Mumbai’s senior Ranji team, had spotted him at Cross Maidan two years ago. Taken in by Tiwari’s enthusiasm, Samant invited him to bowl to the once Ranji giants.Tiwari’s cricketing ambition obviously didn’t end there. Like many starry-eyed youngsters, he aspired to play in the IPL, but bar a few notable performances in the Kanga League, including a hat-trick for United Friends, he didn’t quite rise through the ranks. This paper understands that while Tiwari would bowl manfully and was always an eager learner, he didn’t quite have the skillsets to be instantly fast-tracked to a big team.His elder brother Avinash Tiwari told Mirror that Karan was visibly glum after failing to impress IPL’s Delhi franchise, apparently during a selection trial before the lockdown.“The spark had gone out of his life,” Avinash said. “He would shut himself in his room and barely speak.”It was Hindi cinema’s popular villain Jeetu Verma, fondly called Jojo, who kept Tiwari’s spirit up when he had withdrawn into a shell. Verma invited Tiwari to bowl to, a franchise of, and encouraged him to partake of a novel experience of horse-riding at the actor’s farmhouse.Verma also directed him to bowling coach Pradeep Sundaram, who fine-tuned Tiwari’s bowling action by watching his videos.But Tiwari couldn’t make the quantum leap. He would often tell Verma that his family wasn’t convinced of his career choice. He implored Verma to recommend him to any big actor, so that he could make the cut for the Celebrity Cricket League.However, Avinash insists that his brother did contemplate an alternative career. He said, “NSG Commandos were keen to hire him. They suggested he meet them after the lockdown. But he wasn’t able to crush his cricketing ambitions entirely. He would often tell mother that if he made it as a cricketer, they would shift to a better place. And he had substance. The great Steyn also gifted him a watch at a.”He recapped the dark Tuesday night. “My brother didn’t drop a hint to our mother [Hemlata Tiwari] that he was about to do something drastic. They had dinner together, he helped her finish the usual chores in the kitchen, and soaked nuts in water to have the next day before leaving for practice. I wish I knew what thoughts consumed him when he went into his room. Ten minutes before he ended his life, he messaged his friends saying he became a laughing stock and had let his family down. He shared a picture of the rope he had planned to hang himself with. One of the friends he messaged stays in Udaipur. He instantly alerted the family. By the time we broke into his room, he was gone. No one cared when he was struggling to make his mark.”

In an unexpected revelation Mumbai cricketer, Karan Tiwari on Monday night died by suicide at his house in Malad, Mumbai. The 27-year-old was presumed to be dealing with depression due to his career. Karan who was not the part of the professional Mumbai team but was a net bowler for them was depressed due to his career which was ruined due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>An accidental death case was filed by Kurar police and so far, no death note has been found. Karan belonged to a middle-class household and lived in Mumbai with his mother and brother. According to the police, Karan called one his closest friend and revealed how he was troubled about his career as he was not receiving a proper chance to showcase his skill.</p>
<p>Karan Tiwari dies by suicide</p>
<p>This led to him getting discouraged and on Monday the aspiring cricketer locked his room and did suicide. By the time the door was broken, he was found dead. Karan desired to represent Mumbai in domestic cricket and have a thriving cricketing career. However, the 27-year-old tried his level best but was unable to find a spot in the senior team.</p>
<p>Also, Karan’s friend talked and informed his sisters that live in Rajasthan. They told their mother but it proved to be too late. Several players also paid their condolences on learning the news about the tragic death.</p>
<p>Actor Jitu Verma, who was Karan’s closest friend, said that Karan had been striving in the game for many years. Mumbai senior team coach, Vinayak Samant also acknowledged he had been trying to find a good local club for the 27-year-old.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, due to the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, all professional cricket in India was indefinitely postponed. This was a new experience for everyone as no cricket has been played in the country for to six months now. The suspension to cricket has surely affected the lives of upcoming cricketers who always dream about representing their team at the highest level.</p>

Jul 18th, 2020</p>
<p>Jul 18th, 2020</p>
<p>Former Australian Test player Barry Jarman has tragically died at the age of 84.</p>
<p>It is understood Jarman lost his private battle with leukemia.</p>
<p>The cricketer played 19 Test matches for Australia and was a stand-in captain during the 1968 Ashes series in England when Bill Lawry was injured in the Headingley Test.</p>
<p>Before he retired in 1969, Jarman played 13 first-class seasons, debuting with South Australia in 1955.</p>
<p>Former teammate Ian Chappell fondly recalled his memories with the man nicknamed &lsquo;Jar&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent a lot of time with Barry because I was at first slip when he was wicketkeeping for South Australia and Australia,&rdquo; Chappell told Wide World of Sports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my early days when I first came into the South Australian side as a young guy, I&rsquo;d just started working so I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of money. Barry was very generous. He would take not only myself but a few of the younger guys to and pay for our meals. The only thing was you&rsquo;d have to have the steak done the same as Jar and you&rsquo;d have to have the same hot mustard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a wicketkeeper he was a very solidly-built guy, but very agile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a good teammate. He was a big part of the spirit of that South Australian side in the &rsquo;60s that had a lot of success. Jar was always at the forefront and making sure everyone got on well together.</p>
<p>Barry Jarman in 1969 (Nine)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was 18 when I came into the South Australian side. There were two or three of the senior players in that side including Jar who looked after the young blokes. They made sure that you didn&rsquo;t have too much to drink, they&rsquo;d keep an eye on you at a party. They&rsquo;d make sure you were only drinking beer and then they&rsquo;d come over at 11 o&rsquo;clock and say &lsquo;Righto, finish that beer then you&rsquo;re off to bed&rsquo;. So they really looked after you when you were on tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Apart from being a very good wicketkeeper he was a very good batsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He performed better in Shield cricket than he did in Test cricket. He seemed to get over-anxious in Test cricket, but his top score in first class cricket I remember his innings well. He got 196 for South Australia against a strong NSW team and I&rsquo;ve never seen a bloke cramp up in every muscle in his body. But he was a tough guy and still got wickets after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barry Jarman has passed away (Nine)</p>
<p>Chappell said it was the honesty with which Jarman played the game that he really appreciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I&rsquo;ll remember him most for as a wicketkeeper - it was a rarity - he always used to say you should only appeal when you think it&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; Chappell recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of players might say that, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve heard any other wickekeeper say that, but Barry, in all the years I stood next to him, he lived up to that mantra.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very fair and would only appeal when he thought it was out. That was a good lesson for me and something I tried to carry on when I became captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jarman was also a talented footballer, playing for West Torrens juniors in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) as a teenager, but a leg injury forced him to focus solely on cricket.</p>
<p>His Test debut for Australia came in 1959 in India after an injury to first-choice &lsquo;keeper Wally Grout, and in 19 appearances in the Baggy Green he amassed 400 runs, 50 catches, and four stumpings, with a batting average of 14.81.</p>
<p>The South Australian cricket Association added their tributes to Jarman after the news of his passing, describing him as a &ldquo;monumental figure&rdquo; in the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The burly wicketkeeper played in 13 seasons for South Australia, and he sits third in the all-time dismissals list with 250, including an impressive 58 stumpings,&rdquo; SACA said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His enviable record was surpassed by Tim Nielsen in the 1998/99 Sheffield Shield season, some 30 years after he retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jarman has a total of 560 dismissals, including 129 stumpings from the 191 first-class matches that he played.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barry was one of South Australia&rsquo;s internationally known names,&rdquo; SACA President Andrew Sinclair said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a great competitor and gentleman, who appreciated the way the game should be played and always had a terrific sense of humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last Summer, Barry and wife Gaynor attended day 3 of the Adelaide Test Match which happened to be their wedding anniversary, a partnership of well over 50 years. When Barry was asked, being a cricketer, how could you get married in Summer? His reply – &lsquo;Well play finished at 6.00pm, so there was plenty of time for the wedding!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lived his life to the full and was not afraid to share his opinion; you were never left in any doubt as to his view. He was a delight to be around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our thoughts are with his family: wife Gaynor, and children Kristen, Gavin, Jason, Erin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Jarman&rsquo;s retirement, he moved into cricket administration where he was appointed one of the ICC&rsquo;s first Match Referees in 1995. Until 2001 in this role he oversaw players and officials during 53 international matches.</p>
<p>Chappell said Jarman&rsquo;s strong stance against incorrect bowling action was one of the issues of the game he passionately wanted to stamp out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had strong views on a number of things, probably the most prominent was chucking. He was very down on anybody he thought had an illegal action and he certainly thought a few of them did. I think he wanted to do a lot more in that regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But generally I looked upon him as a very fair man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Australian cricket team on their way to England. Barry Jarman on the right in the second row. (Nine)</p>
<p>Jarman was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 &ldquo;for service to sport as a cricket player, coach and international cricket referee, and to horseracing in South Australia&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He also opened a sports store, and Chappell said his work in the Adelaide community was another valuable contribution Jarman made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barry Jarman along with David Rowe had a sports store and Barry &lsquo;Nugget&rsquo; Rees and Robert &lsquo;Swan&rsquo; Richards, he gave both of them a start there,&rdquo; Chappell said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nugget had a life expectancy of about 30. Now Barry is roughly the same age as me and still going and a lot of that is thanks to Barry Jarman. Because he gave him a job and encouraged him and now Nugget is one of the best known and most loved figures in Adelaide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swanny Richards went on to become Australia&rsquo;s leading batmaker with Gray-Nicholls. And I&rsquo;m sure without the encouragement that Barry and David gave those two guys, they wouldn&rsquo;t have enjoyed the life that they have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a very generous-spirited man, Barry Jarman.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/08/09/18/31747912-0-image-a-13_1596993607145.jpg" alt="img">
Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting has opened up on his son&rsquo;s terrifying near-death experiences.</p>
<p>Fletcher Ponting, five, has almost died twice in his short life, with his former Test captain father forced to watch on helplessly on both occasions.</p>
<p>When Fletcher was just six weeks old he fought and won a desperate battle with meningitis - spending weeks clinging to life in ICU.</p>
<p>The Ponting family&rsquo;s world was turned upside down when at eight months old Fletcher contracted an infection during a hernia surgery.</p>
<p>Ricky Ponting is pictured with wife Rianna and children Matisse, Fletcher and Emmy</p>
<p>Ponting recalled the night the infection shut down his son&rsquo;s body as the cricket great stood by while more than 15 doctors and nurses battled to save the boy&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was just limp. I thought to myself, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; Every nurse and doctor from the level rushed into the room at the same time - it was like a code red,&rsquo; Ponting told The Herald Sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s where your mind goes. Your body goes numb. You are helpless. There&rsquo;s nothing scarier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The MRSA infection took hold of Fletcher within days of his operation and left him in agony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought he was going to come out with his whole right side cut out. Luckily, they got it before it got into his flesh and took over his body,&rsquo; Ponting said.</p>
<p>Ponting said he was glad his wife Rianna wasn&rsquo;t in the room that night because it would still be &lsquo;haunting her to this day&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The family know how lucky they were Fletcher overcame two potentially fatal situations - especially after their experiences with the Ponting Foundation.</p>
<p>When he was just eight months old Fletcher (pictured centre) caught a hospital borne MRSA infection which was about to start eating the flesh from his stomach</p>
<p>Ponting (pictured with his family) described standing by his son&rsquo;s hospital bed helplessly as doctors and nurses rushed to save his life</p>
<p>They started the foundation in 2008 when they paid a life-changing visit to the Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Sydney after being invited by former Wallaby Phil Kearns.</p>
<p>Ponting remembered one of the moments which changed him forever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We got to the chemotherapy ward where there was a 13-year-old boy&hellip; and he&rsquo;s attached to all these machines and tubes are coming out of him,&rsquo; he told The Howie Games.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He must have been a cricket fan … I got up close to the glass, he saw me by the window and he sat up in bed and his face lit up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Through his excitement the teenager tried to stand, but was in so much pain he collapsed and vomited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once we got out the front both of us just started bawling our eyes out at what we&rsquo;d just seen,&rsquo; Ponting said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was the line in the sand. It was, &ldquo;Right, now we&rsquo;ve got to help these people.&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ever since the Ponting Foundation has been dedicated to supporting families who are battling cancer by providing emotional support and financial assistance.</p>
<p>Most recently the foundation announced $50,000 in new funding for Tasmanian cancer services.

<h3 id="womens-cricket-trophy-named-after-rachael-heyhoe-flint">&ldquo;Women&rsquo;s cricket trophy named after Rachael Heyhoe Flint&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/VkcrSUV7eJ5RUpxC9PbmkI9Y0Rw=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/expressandstar.mna/JS465BZCCNDZZJ7C3MOCEYDXSI.jpg" alt="img">
The Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy will be played for by eight domestic teams, beginning on the August Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Baroness Heyhoe Flint – who died in 2017, and was affectionately known as ‘Our Rachael’ in her home city of Wolverhampton – captained England to the first-ever Cricket World Cup title in 1973 while off the field her tireless determination for equality laid the foundations for the opportunities presented to modern-day players.</p>
<p>ECB managing director of women’s cricket Clare Connor said: “I’m delighted that, despite the obvious challenges of Covid-19, we have been able to continue to build the new women’s elite domestic structure to the point that we’ll see the eight regions playing 50-over cricket this summer.</p>
<p>“Off the back of appointing the eight regional directors of women’s Cricket and awarding regional retainers, we have worked closely with colleagues across the men’s domestic game to ensure we are able to stage domestic women’s cricket safely and at high-quality venues.</p>
<p>“Rachael Heyhoe Flint would have been proud to witness the professionalisation of the domestic women’s game. She did so much for our sport and without her work, passion and dedication, we wouldn’t be where we are today.</p>
<p>“It’s therefore fitting that this special edition of the competition will be played in her honour. I’d personally like to extend my thanks to Rachael’s son, Ben, with whom we collaborated on the logo for the competition.”</p>
<p>Heyhoe Flint – who was also vice-president at Wolves – played 22 Tests and 23 one-day internationals during a 19-year England career and is a member of the ICC Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>The Women’s Cricketer of the Year award was created and named after Heyhoe Flint in 2017 as a tribute to her following her death, aged 77, that year.</p>
<p>Rachael Heyhoe Flint’s son, Ben Flint, said: “Mum has provided our family with so many reasons to be proud and we are grateful that her determination to give women’s cricket the platform it deserves continues to be recognised.</p>
<p>“We are honoured that this competition has been named after her, but I know mum would only have cared that female cricketers had yet another opportunity to play the game they love in difficult times, which is something she was very used to.”
