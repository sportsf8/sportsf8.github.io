<p>To the editor: Despite publishing multiple articles on calls to defund the Los Angeles School Police Department, the Los Angeles Times has failed to adequately convey the points of view of many in our school community, including our principals, school clerical staff, maintenance workers and other support staff. They are an important voice in this complex debate about how best to keep our schools safe.</p>
<p>The Associated Administrators of Los Angeles, which represents our principals, have been openly critical of the call by the teachers union to defund the department that serves the Los Angeles Unified School District.</p>
<p>Similarly, the newspaper has failed to inform readers about the stance of other large urban districts, such as Atlanta and Chicago, that have determined that their school police departments are an essential part of maintaining a safe environment for students and staff in their schools. Instead, the paper mentioned a much smaller district — Oakland — that has decided to eliminate its police department.</p>
<p>It is deeply disappointing to see such unbalanced coverage on a story that is important to so many people.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Gil Gamez, Los Angeles</p>
<p>The writer is president of the Los Angeles School Police Officers Assn.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>To the editor: Calls for the elimination of the Los Angeles School Police Department need to be heard if for no other reason than to eliminate the oppression Black students feel at school.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Instead of feeling safe as I did, they “expressed pain and fear” and that school police officers make students feel “criminalized” during interactions, according to The Times. Maria Parra, though, a member of the parent group Padres Unidos, said at a recent school board meeting that she had seen campus police work as mentors to students.</p>
<p>Our precious young people need to know we value them. They and their teachers must feel safe at school. Discussions and actions need to happen so desired objectives are met. Maybe students, teachers, school police, and Black Lives Matter should be involved to find a solution.</p>

<p>Source: Xinhua| 2020-06-19 19:32:29|Editor: huaxia</p>
<p>Video Player Close</p>
<p>PHNOM PENH, June 19 (Xinhua) &ndash; Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn said playing the &ldquo;blame game&rdquo; will only diminish global efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic and called for international solidarity, according to a statement from the foreign ministry released Friday.</p>
<p>He made the remarks Thursday at the High-level Video Conference on Belt and Road International Cooperation: Combating COVID-19 with Solidarity, the statement said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any politicization of the outbreak or resorting to a blame game will only diminish the benefits of the international anti-pandemic efforts,&rdquo; Sokhonn said. &ldquo;Without international cooperation and solidarity, we cannot win the fight against this pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said that countries need to focus on strengthening their collective capacities to address this public health crisis through exchanging technical expertise and experience, good practices, and exploring joint research and development of medicines and vaccines.</p>
<p>In this regard, Cambodia supports the creation of a Health Silk Road initiative, he said, adding that to build the Health Silk Road, it is vital for countries to share information and best practices, and enhance equitable and affordable access to health products, including vaccines, which should be recognized as global public goods.</p>
<p>Sokhonn, who is also Cambodia&rsquo;s deputy prime minister, highly commended China&rsquo;s contribution to fighting the pandemic worldwide.</p>
<p>He noted that in the current context, countries should reaffirm their commitment to supporting the role of the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The WHO must be given the means to better fulfill its normative mission,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>While the COVID-19 curve has been flattened in some parts of the world, it is time to start exploring and securing ways and means to create a conducive environment for a post-pandemic economic recovery, Sokhonn said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerging markets and developing countries are critical, both as suppliers and markets. Ensuring unfettered connectivity amongst us will strengthen our economies,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He added that as a firm believer in multilateralism and an active actor in the Belt and Road cooperation framework, Cambodia is calling for deeper engagement of all state and non-state actors in various Belt and Road cooperative programs.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers or officials at ministerial level from 25 countries took part in Thursday&rsquo;s video conference, with WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UN Development Programme Administrator Achim Steiner also participating. Enditem

<p>COVID-19-Themed Phishing Campaigns Diminish</p>
<p>Microsoft: Even at Peak, Pandemic Themes Used in Small Percentage of Fraud Campaigns</p>
<p>COVID-19 phishing emails spotted in the UK (Source: Microsoft)</p>
<p>The surge in phishing campaigns and other types of fraud using COVID-19 themes has diminished in recent weeks, according to the Microsoft Threat Protection Intelligence Team, which asserts in a new report that such campaigns were never a dominant threat.</p>
<p>See Also: Live Webinar | 2021: A Cybersecurity Odyssey</p>
<p>The Microsoft researchers found that despite the sudden and substantial increase in fraud campaigns that used the COVID-19 pandemic as a lure, these types of malicious campaigns accounted for only a small percentage of the overall threats observed over the last four months.</p>
<p>Analyzing online fraud trends since February, Microsoft researchers found that cybercriminals and fraudsters first started using COVID-19 as a theme in their malicious campaigns after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a global health emergency on Feb. 11.</p>
<p>COVID-19-themed campaigns compared to other malware attacks (Source: Microsoft)</p>
<p>These COVID-19 themed campaigns then saw an eleven-fold rise in the week following the WHO declaration. But such attacks still accounted for less than 2% of all cyberattacks Microsoft observed each month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cybercriminals adapt their tactics to take advantage of local events that are more likely to lure victims to their schemes. Those lures change quickly and fluidly while the underlying malware threats remain,&rdquo; the Microsoft researchers note.</p>
<p>Correlation to Local News</p>
<p>As people around the world tried to learn more about the pandemic in February and March, fraudsters actively exploited the situation. The Microsoft report notes that COVID-19-themed attacks reached a peak globally in the first two weeks of March, coinciding with governments introducing travel restrictions and other measures to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals and fraudsters are always looking for new and easy ways to gain victims, and targeting key industries is typical of the global threat landscape, according to the report. Microsoft adds that &ldquo;what was peculiar in this case was how the global nature and universal impact of the crisis made the cybercriminal&rsquo;s work easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fraudsters also took advantage of the situation by tailoring lures to the location of their targets, mimicking the developments in their area, according to the report (see: Phishing Campaigns Tied to Coronavirus Persist).</p>
<p>Spike in COVID-19-themed camapigns (Source: Microsoft)</p>
<p>For example, the U.K. saw a rise in attacks around the time the nation reported its first death from the virus, then again when the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index, or &ldquo;Footsie,&rdquo; crashed on March 9. A third spike happened when the U.S. announced a travel ban to Europe, according to the report (see: US, UK Authorities Crack Down on Suspicious COVID-19 Domains).</p>
<p>U.K. attacks also rose considerably in the second week of April, when there was extensive media coverage on the pandemic, with Queen Elizabeth II making a rare televised address and Prime Minister Boris Johnson being treated in an intensive care unit after testing positive for COVID-19, Microsoft notes.</p>
<p>In the U.S., COVID-19 themed attacks rose at the end of February, coinciding with the first reported death due to the virus, and reached a peak in mid-March, at the time of the international travel ban, according to the report. Other campaigns saw a drop in volume as countries began to recover from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Malicious campaigns targeting citizens of the South Korea did not follow the global patterns, according to the report. Themed-attacks rose in early March, but instead of reducing as the country lifted restrictions, they seemed to increase, reaching a peak on May 23, the report notes.</p>
<p>Not Gone, Yet</p>
<p>The Microsoft report, however, says that these themed attacks are likely to continue as long as COVID-19 persists.</p>
<p>Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at security firm Proofpoint, tells Information Security Media Group that the company also has observed that fraudsters have decreased their use of COVID-19 themes over the last several weeks, shifting to other lures.</p>
<p>In campaigns that still leverage COVID-19, she says: &ldquo;Threat actors are using more specific COVID-19 language around layoffs, furloughs and payouts to make their attacks tailored to current events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proofpoint found that fake landing pages attached to pandemic-themed phishing campaigns were heavily deployed in March, but the use of these landing pages began to drop off in April (see: Spoofed Website Templates Help Spread COVID-19 Scams: Report).</p>
