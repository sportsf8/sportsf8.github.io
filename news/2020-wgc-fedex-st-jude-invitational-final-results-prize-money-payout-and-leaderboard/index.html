Enough of the messing around and mulligans - the tournaments are getting serious on the PGA Tour this August and nowhere is that clearer than at TPC Southwind, where today&rsquo;s final round of the 2020 WGC-FedEx St Jude Invitational sees a leaderboard packed with some of the world&rsquo;s best and most talented golfers. It&rsquo;s the warm-up event for the first Major of the year, the PGA Championship, so it&rsquo;s no surprise the likes of Koepka, Fowler and Mickelson have brought their A-game to Memphis. Wherever you are in the world, simply follow our guide to watch the PGA Tour online and get a WGC St Jude Invitational live stream the easy way.</p>
<p>2020 WGC St Jude Invitational As usual, coverage is split between NBC&rsquo;s Golf Channel and CBS in the US - and is exclusive to Sky Sports in the UK. That means. Rounds 1 and 2 get under way at 12pm ET/9am PT, or 5pm BST, this Thursday and Friday - while over the weekend play starts at 9am ET/6am PT/ 2pm BST.</p>
<p>New world no.1 Jon Rahm, who unseated Rory McIlroy with a win at the Memorial, entered as pre-tournament favorite for the first time. Last year&rsquo;s winner Brooks Koepka is faring considerably better, though - as are perennial soccer mom crush Phil Mickelson and the always enjoyable Rickie Fowler.</p>
<p>Yep, the field is absolutely stacked this week - Justin Thomas is also lurking dangerously, but Rory McIlroy&rsquo;s slump looks set to continue as he&rsquo;s not really in contention in the final round this Sundy.</p>
<p>The only big name player missing out this week is Tiger Woods, who&rsquo;s resting up ahead of the the first Major of the year - next week&rsquo;s 2020 PGA Championship. With a purse in excess of $10.5 million, there&rsquo;s sure to be plenty of drama over the weekend as the world&rsquo;s top golfers compete for a winner&rsquo;s cheque of nearly $1.75 million.</p>

<p>How to watch WGC St Jude: live stream the PGA Tour in the US</p>
<p>In the US, coverage of the FedEx-WGC St Jude Invitiational and PGA Tour golf in general is shared by CBS and NBC&rsquo;s Golf Channel. The Golf Channel will broadcast rounds 1 and 2 from 2-7pm ET (11am-4pm PT) on Thursday and Friday, as well as providing early coverage of round 3 (12-2pm ET) and round 4 (1-3pm ET) this weekend. Streaming coverage is hosted on its website, where you&rsquo;ll need to log-in with details of your cable provider for access. CBS will then pick things up for the heart of the action on Saturday (2-6pm ET /11am-3pm PT) and Sunday (3-7pm ET / 12pm-4pm PT) so CBS All Access has your streaming needs covered and can be had commitment-free from just $5.99 a month. If you don&rsquo;t have those channels as part of a pay TV package, then YouTube TV has both the Golf Channel and CBS as part of its comprehensive offering, which costs more than some of its rivals at $64.99 a month, but represents a genuine cable replacement service. If you&rsquo;re a US resident out of the country and want to access one of the above options just like you normally would, then you can use a VPN to effectively transport your computer, phone or tablet&rsquo;s IP back home - ExpressVPN being our current favorite.</p>
<p>WGC St Jude Invitational live stream: how to watch PGA Tour golf online in the UK</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a UK-based golf fan, you&rsquo;ll likely know that Sky Sports has the rights to most events on your side of the Atlantic - and that includes the 2020 Memorial Tournament. Sky&rsquo;s live coverage is comprehensive throughout, starting on Sky Sports Golf at 6pm BST on Thursday and Friday, while at the weekend it&rsquo;s 5pm for round 3 on Sunday and 4.30pm for Sunday&rsquo;s final round. Sky subscribers can use the Sky Go app to live stream the PGA Tour golf this week, while anyone else can take advantage of a Now TV Sky Sports pass - the best value of which is the Now TV Sky Sports month pass. It&rsquo;s the top option for golf and general sports fans, but anyone just after the golf could also consider international golf streaming service GOLFTV, which offers live and on demand PGA Tour coverage from £4.99 a month Those who might find themselves outside of the UK for this tournament can follow our instructions above to get a VPN and watch the golf via a live stream just like they would at home.</p>

<p>2020 WGC St Jude live stream: watch PGA Tour golf online from Canada</p>
<p>Golf fans in Canada will find that NBC&rsquo;s Golf Channel has a Canadian twin airing the same coverage that&rsquo;s available in the US That means broadcasting rounds 1 and 2 from 2-7pm ET (11am-4pm PT) on Thursday and Friday, as well as providing early coverage of round 3 (12-2pm ET) and round 4 (1-3pm ET) Thereafter, it&rsquo;s all down to where you live and your TV provider. Most people should be able to watch the final two rounds on Saturday and Sunday on either CTV or TSN, while select areas will get a direct CBS feed. Those without cable can subscribe to TSN on a streaming-only basis from just CA$4.99 a month. Otherwise, a GOLFTV pass can be bought in Canada from $9.99 a month and it&rsquo;s a great one-stop-shop for golf fans who don&rsquo;t want to have to constantly flit between channels and services. Remember that if you can normally access golf coverage in Canada, you can make use of a VPN to access all the services and content you would back home.</p>
<p>How to watch a PGA live stream in Australia</p>
<p>In Australia, the most comprehensive golf coverage around is available through Kayo Sports - a great over-the-top streaming service that offers access to over 50 sports live and on-demand, courtesy of partnerships with big name pay TV channels like Fox Sports, ESPN, and beIN Sports. However, WGC events are included in this,and having checked Australian TV guide listings, we&rsquo;ve come up empty in this instance. Never mind It should be back to business as usual next week for the PGA Championship and Kayo even offers a free 14-day trial, so you can watch the first Major of the year without paying a penny!

15 DFS Golf Picks for the 2020 WGC-FedEx St.Jude Invitational</p>
<p>Daily Fantasy Golf Tips</p>
<p>Before you benefit from this article&rsquo;s insights to improve your fantasy golf picks for the 2020 World Golf Championships - FedEx St.Jude Invitational, I encourage you to check out FantasyData&rsquo;s PGA Optimizer to enhance the builds for your daily fantasy lineups. Good luck this week!</p>
<p>Last week&rsquo;s 3M Open featured a weak field so it should have been a great opportunity for the best golfers to finish high and cash in, right? In theory, yes but the likes of Paul Casey, Brooks Koepka, Bubba Watson, Tommy Fleetwood, and other superb players missed the cut and screwed over many DFS lineups in the process. Congrats to Michael Thompson for winning last week&rsquo;s 3M Open with a score of -19. The great aspect of this week is that we have a WGC event where every player gets to play all four rounds, barring withdraws, of course. The PGA Tour moves from Blaine, Minnesota, to Memphis, Tennessee, for the WGC-FedEx St.Jude Invitational - an event that has taken over from the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational which was held from 2006 to 2018. Much like last week&rsquo;s 3M Open, this week&rsquo;s tournament will be just the 2nd installment of the WGC-FedEx St.Jude Invitational - last year&rsquo;s champion was Brooks Koepka who won by three strokes over Webb Simpson.</p>
<p>Earn more success: Improve your odds to win more PGA DFS contests with these powerful fantasy sports tools.</p>
<p>Tournament purse: The purse is way up from last week&rsquo;s 3M Open at $10.5M with the winner getting just under $1.8M in prize money and earning himself 550 FedEx Cup points.</p>
<p>Course and key stats: This event will be again played at the TPC Southwind course in Memphis, TN - the track is 7,238 yards, is a par 70, and the greens consist of Bermudagrass. Some of the key stats to focus on this week are Strokes Gained: Approach, Good Drives Gained, Scrambling Gained, Proximity Gained: 150-200 yards.</p>
<p>The field: We have a world-class field on tap for this week with many of the best players on the globe competing. On a scale ranging from A to D, I rank the field strength to be an A even though the field size is small. 78 golfers are in the field this week for this prestigious event, and as previously mentioned, every player will play all four rounds and collect a paycheck.</p>
<p>Betting strategy this week: The nice thing about WGC events is that you can be riskier with your lineups as each one is guaranteed 432 holes to be played between your 6 players. With that being said, be open to a stars and scrubs approach by going after two or three elite players and adding solid low-cost depth players to your arsenal.</p>
<p>Best of luck for capturing some lucrative contest wins this week - here are my 15 picks which feature my top 3 players from each tier on DraftKings (DK) in no particular order, plus I include player salaries for DK as well. I consistently provide recent and seasonal finishes for each of my picks, their performance at this event over the last 5 years (when available), and add in some helpful pieces of information as well.</p>
<p>The $10K+ Range</p>
<p>Bryson DeChambeau (Salary: DraftKings - $11K) - DeChambeau was on an absolute tear before missing the cut at The Memorial two weeks ago by securing a win and seven straight top 8&rsquo;s along the way. With him now capable of bombing balls more than 400 yards he&rsquo;s making long courses look awfully short now, and I sense at least one more win coming this season. He finished T48 here a year ago but his game is at a whole new level now and is the top threat to win in my opinion.</p>
<p>Justin Thomas (Salary: DraftKings - $10.7K) - Thomas already has two wins on the season and has 9 top 10&rsquo;s in 14 starts. He was T12 at this event last year and I see no reason why he&rsquo;s not a regular on the leaderboard this week.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy (Salary: DraftKings - $11.2K) - Ousted from being the world&rsquo;s top golfer two weeks ago at The Memorial by Jon Rahm, McIlroy will be hungry to get back his top golf ranking back ASAP. It&rsquo;s shocking that he doesn&rsquo;t have a top 10 since the PGA Tour has returned from action, but I don&rsquo;t expect that to last much longer - it should come to an end this week. He was the leader after 3 rounds last year but faltered in round 4 to settle for a T4. He shot a 62 in the third round a year ago so he knows how to attack this course and I fully expect him to go after it hard this week.</p>
<p>The $9K Range</p>
<p>Webb Simpson (Salary: DraftKings - $9.9K) - Simpson has been one of my favorite golfers to use in DFS this season and why not as he has two wins and 7 top 10&rsquo;s in 10 starts. He&rsquo;s coming off a missed cut at The Memorial but was runner up here last year thanks to his best round of the week in the final round where he scored a field low 64.</p>
<p>Tyrrell Hatton (Salary: DraftKings - $9.7K) - Hatton has been guns-a-blazin&rsquo; this season with 5 top 6&rsquo;s in just 6 starts and his other finish was a 14th. His game is better than ever and I expect a massive improvement on his T43 from a year ago at this tournament.</p>
<p>Tony Finau (Salary: DraftKings - $9.1K) - Finau has been stripping the ball very well the last couple of tournaments with a T8 at The Memorial and a T3 last week at the 3M Open. He has 6 top 10&rsquo;s in 16 starts this season and finished T27 here in last year&rsquo;s edition - moving up 10 spots in the final round where he closed out with a 68.</p>
<p>The $8K Range</p>
<p>Patrick Reed (Salary: DraftKings - $8.8K) - Reed is an absolute grinder and plays hard every time he tees it up. He&rsquo;s coming off a T10 at The Memorial, has 7 top 10&rsquo;s this season, and was T12 here in 2019.</p>
<p>Gary Woodland (Salary: DraftKings - $8.6K) - Woodland has seen his golf game return to fine form over his last two starts with a T5 and a T22 at Muirfield Village. He has 7 top 10&rsquo;s this season and should see a big improvement on his T55 from a year ago.</p>
<p>Billy Horschel (Salary: DraftKings - $8.5K) - Horschel sharpened up his game at Muirfield Village with a T7 and a T13 at the Workday Charity Open at The Memorial, just in time for the most important stretch of the season with the playoffs coming up next month. Billy-Ho was T12 here last year and I believe will see a similar result this time around as well.</p>
<p>The $7K Range</p>
<p>Matthew Wolff (Salary: DraftKings - $7.9K) - Wolff has been howling lately with a 2nd, a T12, and a T22 over his past four starts. He finished T24 here last year and shot a 65 in round 3 so he can certainly score on this track.</p>
<p>Marc Leishman (Salary: DraftKings - $7.7K) - Leishman won the Farmers Insurance Open this season, has a runner up finish, and a 3rd. He consistently scored well here last year and those efforts propelled him into a solo 3rd finish.</p>
<p>Ian Poulter (Salary: DraftKings - $7.4K) - Poulter finished 5th two starts ago and is consistently in the 20&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s for finishes at tourneys. He missed a rare cut at The Memorial in his most recent start but his game plays well on this track and finished solo 8th here last year.</p>
<p>The $6K Range</p>
<p>Brendon Todd (Salary: DraftKings - $6.6K) - I don&rsquo;t really recommend digging too far into the $6K range but do like Todd at his price, especially considering he has two wins this season.</p>
<p>Kevin Streelman (Salary: DraftKings - $6.9K) - Streelman has a runner up finish and a T7 in his last three starts, so he makes for a decent value play this week. He has 4 top 10&rsquo;s this season and the rookie at this event should fare just fine this week.</p>
<p>Ryan Palmer (Salary: DraftKings - $6.7K) - My final pick for the $6K range was challenging but I got to go with Palmer as he&rsquo;s coming off a runner up finish at The Memorial and has 4 top 10&rsquo;s this season.</p>
<p>Recapping my 15 pick&rsquo;s finishes from last week&rsquo;s 3M Open</p>
<p>The $10K+ Range</p>
<p>Dustin Johnson - Withdrew after round 1 with a sore back</p>
<p>Paul Casey - Missed the cut</p>
<p>Tony Finau - T3</p>
<p>The $9K Range</p>
<p>Lucas Glover - Missed the cut</p>

<p>Henrik Norlander - T23</p>

<h3 id="2020-3m-open-final-results-prize-money-payout-and-leaderboard">&ldquo;2020 3M Open final results: Prize money payout and leaderboard&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thegolfnewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/3m-open-logo.jpg" alt="img">
The 2020 3M Open final leaderboard is headed by winner Michael Thompson, who picked up a big PGA Tour win at TPC Twin Cities in Blaine, Minn.</p>
<p>Thompson closed with 4-under 67 on Sunday to earn a two-shot win over fellow Tour winner Adam Long, posting a total of 19-under 265. Needing a par at the last to secure the win, he made a punctuating birdie.</p>
<p>Behind Long, there was an insane nine-way tie for third place, including Tony Finau, Max Homa and Charl Schwartzel among those on 16-under total.</p>
<p>Thompson won the $1,118,000 winner&rsquo;s share of the $6,600,000 purse.</p>
<p>3M Open recap notes</p>
<p>Thompson earned 38 Official World Golf Ranking points with the win. He also gained entry into the 2020 US Open, with modified qualifying criteria to account for a lack of qualifying events.</p>
<p>A total of 68 players made the cut on 2-under 140, with every player finishing the tournament.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour has two events next week, with the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational and the Barracuda Championship.</p>

<h3 id="2020-the-memorial-tournament-final-results-prize-money-payout-and-leaderboard">&ldquo;2020 the Memorial Tournament final results: Prize money payout and leaderboard&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thegolfnewsnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/memorial-tournament-logo.jpg" alt="img">
The 2020 Memorial Tournament final leaderboard is headed by winner Jon Rahm, who picked up a big PGA Tour win at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio.</p>
<p>Rahm became the No. 1 player in the Official World Golf Ranking for the first time in his career with a three-shot win over Ryan Palmer, finishing on 9-under 279. After the round, Rahm was penalized two shots on the 16th hole after he saw his ball had moved when addressing a chip shot he ultimately holed for birdie.</p>
<p>Matthew Fitzpatrick finished alone in third, with Jim &ldquo;Bones&rdquo; Mackay on the bag as a temporary caddie.</p>
<p>Rahm won the $1,674,000 winner&rsquo;s share of the $9,300,000 purse.</p>
<p>Memorial Tournament recap notes</p>
<p>Rahm earned 76 Official World Golf Ranking points with the win. He now has four PGA Tour wins, and it&rsquo;s his first since teaming up with Palmer in 2019 to win the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.</p>
<p>A total of 74 players made the cut on 3-over 145, with every player finishing the tournament.</p>
<p>Matt Wallace and Jason Day finished in a tie for fourth place, with Day earning enough world-ranking points to get into the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational in two weeks.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour moves to Minnesota for the second 3M Open, with TPC Twin Cities hosting the tournament once again.</p>
