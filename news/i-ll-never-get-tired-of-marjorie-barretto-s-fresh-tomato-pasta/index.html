<p>I&rsquo;m convinced Marjorie Barretto is a genius in the kitchen because: 1) Every time you finish watching a cooking vlog, you can&rsquo;t think of anything else (I literally went to the grocery just to buy beef after watching her salpicao vlog) and 2) every dish seems easy to make! Take her fresh tomato pasta, for example. I first saw it in Dani Barretto&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day vlog. It looked <em>amazing</em> so you can imagine how happy I was to learn the recipe.</p>

<h3 id="watch-claudia-barretto-interviews-youngest-sister-erich">&ldquo;WATCH: Claudia Barretto interviews youngest sister Erich&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2020/news/06/18/erich.jpg" alt="img">
MANILA – Erich Barretto, the youngest child of Marjorie Barretto, looks like she has what it takes to also be in the spotlight one day.</p>
<p>This after Erich joined her sister Claudia for the third episode of the latter’s YouTube vlog.</p>
<p>In the 10-minute clip, Claudia asked Erich about what’s keeping her busy during the quarantine period.</p>
<p>“When it’s school days, it would be like school. Before my Zooms, I would eat my food. When I’m done with some of my work, when I need help, I need to call my tutor,” Erich delightfully shared.</p>
<p>While saying it’s sometimes stressful in school, Erich said she has to bear it because she knows it is important.</p>
<p>She also agreed that although schooling during the lockdown is hard, it is still fun sometimes.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we can do fun activities. I needed to do PE with you and that was so fun. And then I did an experiment, it was about cookies. So after, I ate all the cookies,” Erich told Claudia.</p>
<p>Aside from school, Claudia also asked her younger sister to describe her relationship with each of her sisters.</p>
<p>As for Dani and Julia, Erich said: “When Dani comes, we can play together with Millie. When Millie cries, I can support her. [With Julia, we enjoy] baking and having fun. [We bake] some yummy cookies and sometimes we would bake donuts. It tastes like Krispy Kreme.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Erich said she enjoys swimming and watching movies with Claudia when they are at home.</p>
<p>Of course, the vlog would not be complete without the youngest Barretto talking about their mom Marjorie.</p>
<p>“Sometimes we fight, sometimes we don’t. Tonight we are going to sleep in her room. I wanted to make a surprise for her but I couldn’t do it because she already saw,” she shared.</p>
<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, Erich said she appreciated the fact that her mom would always bring her to school even if it meant she would wake up early on weekdays.</p>
<p>“I really felt bad that she couldn’t sleep too much but she wanted to do it for me. She would even buy for me surprise merienda and I love it. Sometimes we would go to Shangri-La and eat some yummy cookies and hot chocolate and croissants,” she said.</p>
<p>Erich is Marjorie’s daughter with former Caloocan City mayor and former congressman Enrico “Recom” Echiverri.</p>
<p>Watch Erich and Claudia’s adorable interview below.

<p><img src="https://asset-ent.abs-cbn.com/updates/entertainment/2020/06/17/walangforever-kilig-memories-of-former-love-teams-that-thrilled-us_.jpg" alt="img">
Whether you are single or in a relationship, love teams fuel everyone’s daily dose of kilig. Unfortunately, even for these on-screen couples, “walang forever.” Former tandems KimErald, CarGel, ElNella, JoshLia, and JaDine are proof.</p>
<p>KimErald</p>
<p>Kim Chiu and Gerald Anderson met as housemates on Pinoy Big Brother back in 2006. In fact, their first date was sharing sorbetes inside Kuya’s house. After the reality show, KimErald starred in the 2008 movie My Girl. Later in 2017, the two appeared on Gandang Gabi Vice as friends and talked about the gifts they gave each other. She bought him a 65-inch television. He bought her a cellphone. Gerald jokingly asked, “Ba’t mo binigay?” She candidly responded, “Mahal, dati.”</p>
<p>CarGel</p>
<p>Carlo Aquino and Angelica Panganiban were both in the 90s hit G-Mik. This was decades ago but fans got to relive the romance between CarGel thanks to their television reunion for the 2018 morning show Playhouse . During an interview on GGV , Vice Ganda asked Carlo the big question, “Mahal mo pa ba?” His short response was, “Hindi nawawala ‘yun.”</p>
<p>ElNella</p>
<p>Elmo Magalona and Janella Salvador established their tandem on Wansapanataym . They both appeared on “Christmas Witch”, “Holly and Mau”, and “Jasmin’s Flower Power”. By 2016, ElNella starred in their own teleserye, Born For You . When asked about the true status of their relationship on Magandang Buhay , the two tiptoed around a label. Although, they confessed to treating each other special.</p>
<p>JoshLia</p>
<p>Joshua Garcia and Julia Barretto first worked together on the 2016 hit movie “Vince, Kath, and James”. In 2018, their primetime series Ngayon at Kailanman was also a success. During the “Tanong Mo, Mukha Mo” segment of GGV , JoshLia talked about their physical displays of affection when Marjorie Barretto’s photo was shown.</p>
<p>JaDine</p>
<p>James Reid and Nadine Lustre joined the cast of the 2015 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) entry “Beauty and the Bestie”. That same year, JaDine starred in the popular teleserye On the Wings of Love where they shared a lot of on-screen kisses. On GGV , James shared that he tends to show physically affection. This was perfect because Nadine enjoyed being held.

<h3 id="look-marjorie-barretto-enjoys-quiet-priceless-46th-birthday-with-children">&ldquo;LOOK: Marjorie Barretto enjoys ‘quiet, priceless’ 46th birthday with children&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://entertainment.inquirer.net/files/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-21-at-12.31.45-PM.png" alt="img">
Actress and former politician Marjorie Barretto marked her recent birthday with the simple joy of spending it with her family.</p>
<p>Barretto turned 46 last Tuesday, May 19. Despite the quarantine, the mom said her kids did what they could to make her day special, as per her Instagram post yesterday, May 20.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>“[My] kids went all out to make me feel EXTRA special in every way,” she said, “[From] treating me to all the food that [I’ve] been craving for, and gathering video greetings from my family and close friends that made me laugh and cry so much.”</p>
<p>Barretto declared that this year’s birthday celebration was “different, quiet and intimate,” which made it “priceless” for her. She also expressed her gratitude towards those who went out of their way to greet her and send her gifts and messages. The actress said she “felt so loved.”</p>
<p>“It is during these times that one realizes who and what really matters in our lives. I will remember each one of you, [I] will keep you in my heart,” she added.</p>
<p>The actress also showed some snippets of her birthday celebration through a series of photos. Barretto posed between two giant white balloons while donning a white dress and carrying a bouquet of white roses. She also bonded with her five children Dani, Julia, Claudia, Leon and Erich. Dani’s husband, Xavi Panlilio, was also present.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>Majorie’s kids expressed their love for their mom through their separate birthday greetings on Instagram.</p>
<p>“Happy Birthday to my mom, my confidant, my voice of reason, my hero,” Dani wrote on May 19. “I love you endlessly.”</p>
<p>“You are strongest when you have to pretend you are strong for the people who could not imagine themselves enduring what you’ve endured,” Claudia said on her own page. She also appreciated her mom’s vulnerable side and commended her for always putting the people she cares about at the forefront of her life.</p>
<p>“Happiest birthday, mom. I know we don’t always see eye to eye… But amongst all our differences are the smallest of similarities that have a much more profound impact on who I am as a person,” Claudia added. “I love you.”</p>
<p>Last year, the Barretto clan was involved in some public feuds. This came after the death of Miguel, the father of the Barretto sisters Claudine, Marjorie and Gretchen, in October. During this time, Marjorie admitted that former Caloocan City mayor Enrico “Recom” Echiverri is the father of her youngest child. Marjorie was previously married to fellow actor Dennis Padilla.

With a new year comes new strength to face challenges. Actress Marjorie Barretto said the past year has been one of the hardest for her life, but she is still filled with hope that the year 2020 will be better.</p>
<p>Marjorie took a step back from to reflect on everything she and her family had been through in 2019 via her Instagram account last Saturday, Jan 11. The former actress said that through the course of the year, the Barrettos attended a wedding and two funerals, but they also welcomed a new baby into their family. Marjorie said her family learned valuable lessons, as she and her kids stood by each other “in sickness, in scandals and in faith.”</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>“2019 was by far the most challenging year of [my] life,” Marjorie said.</p>
<p>Aside from her eldest daughter Dani who is already starting a family, Marjorie took note of her other children who are moving into their own new homes last year. She also said that each of her five children still needed her to be their mother, which pushed her to be stronger for all of them.</p>
<p>“It was all happening so fast, [I] did not have enough time to process each situation carefully,” Marjorie stated. “I did not have the luxury to break down.”</p>
<p>She thanked the people closest to her for loving her. Marjorie said her children are her strength and her “reason to keep going.”</p>

MANILA, Philippines – Marjorie Barretto said she was proud of her daughter Julia, as she turned 23 on Tuesday, March 10. The celebrity mom talked about all the struggles Julia&rsquo;s been through the past year.</p>
<p>On Instagram, Marjorie said: &ldquo;You have grown so much the past year. I learned so much about you and the person you have become, just by witnessing you overcome trials and judgements, pain of losing a loved one (Pikey) with so much strength and grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pikey is Miguel Barretto, Marjorie&rsquo;s dad and Julia&rsquo;s grandfather who died last year.</p>
<p>Marjorie added: &ldquo;You shut off from the outside world, worked harder than ever, focused on the goal, stayed close to me and your siblings, chose your battles and became wiser in choosing your circle of friends. You are STRONG, BRAVE, DETERMINED, HARDWORKING, PRAYERFUL, GENEROUS, LOVING and KIND and so ready to take on the world. I am blessed to have you as a daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for loving me so much. May you always continue to find comfort in the arms of our family. God bless you more this year, Jul. Your siblings and i are so PROUD of you!&rdquo;</p>
