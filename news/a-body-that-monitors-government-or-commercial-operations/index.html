<p>Canadian telecom operator Telus Corp said on Wednesday the federal government has not asked it to remove Huawei equipment from its 4G infrastructure in the national capital region, in response to a report by the Globe and Mail.Telus had never entered into an agreement, voluntary or otherwise, with the government on the use of Huawei equipment, Chief Technology Officer Ibrahim Gedeon said.The Globe and Mail on Tuesday reported that Telus was being pressed by the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development to remove Huawei equipment from its 4G in the capital region, where most of Canada&rsquo;s federal government offices are located.Huawei did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while the department said it did not comment on specific companies, and is committed to the security of the country&rsquo;s telecom network.Canadian telecom operators are moving away from Huawei in the race to build their 5G network as authorities review security implications of the Chinese company that has been blacklisted in the United States.In late May, a Canadian court dashed Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou&rsquo;s hopes for a swift end to her house arrest in Vancouver as she fights to avoid extradition to the United States to face bank fraud charges.

All health and care workers should be tested for coronavirus once a week, Labour has said.</p>
<p>Routine testing of staff would help minimise the transmission of Covid-19, the party said.</p>
<p>Shadow health and social care secretary Jonathon Ashworth said routine testing for all staff - and not just symptomatic ones - must be an &ldquo;urgent priority&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Professor Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, told MPs on the Health Select Committee on Tuesday that staff should be tested regularly.</p>
<p>He said it would be &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; for NHS staff to be tested up to twice a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Regular testing of all NHS staff must now be an urgent priority,&rdquo; Mr Ashworth said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weekly testing of all healthcare workers reduces the spread of the virus and helps protect NHS staff and patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually resetting the NHS to continue treating Covid and non-Covid patients is going to have to take priority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This should include putting in place infection control measures to make sure patients can continue to safely receive their care, and routine testing of all staff should be a part of this.&rdquo;

New Delhi: India can replace China as a leading low-cost, high-technology telecom and technology equipment supplier, provided it gets the right amount of government incentives and funding to compete with global players in the world market, said top business leaders.The feeling that the government needs to strengthen the industry by helping it to come out of the financial depression, to make India a strong competitor to China was a dominant reflection by a panel in an ongoing series of webinars being organised by Foreign Correspondent Club South Asia ( FCC ).The FCC organised a special webinar on India&rsquo;s campaign towards self-reliance with three leading business leaders &ndash; CP Gurnani, MD and CEO, Tech Mahindra; Rajan Mathews , DG, COAI (Cellular Operators&rsquo; Association of India); and senior government official Dr Dinesh Tyagi, CEO, CSC e- Governance Services India Limited.They also felt that policy initiatives, public-private partnership and an enabled entrepreneurship ecosystem down to the last mile are needed to leapfrog India towards an AtmaNirbhar Bharat (Self-Reliant India) with a $5-trillion economy.&ldquo;AtmaNirbhar Bharat does not mean turning away from international trade. In fact, we want to become the enabler of international trade by taking lead in supply chain,&rdquo; Gurnani said, while opening the session at the webinar.&ldquo;India can adopt and change but we need leadership from the government in making AtmaNirbhar Bharat a reality. I am glad the Modi government has given a clarion call. We need to convert this into a momentum and increase consumption for India to be self-reliant now,&rdquo; the Tech Mahindra MD &amp; CEO said.As the world faces an unprecedented crisis, India has chosen a renewed path of a self-reliant economy, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing a Rs 20-lakh crore stimulus package &ldquo;AtmaNirbhar Bharat&rdquo; which is 10 per cent of its economy.&ldquo;We have talent and we must monetise our capacity to create value. There is a tremendous amount of opportunity in terms of creating value within the country. We do not invest heavily in R&amp;D and hence have been left behind in the IPR (Intellectual property rights) game,&rdquo; Mathews of COAI said.&ldquo;We have to incentivise R&amp;D if we want to make AtmaNirbhar Bharat a reality. We must also consider Open Source as a serious business opportunity and become smarter at trade negotiations.&ldquo;There is a need to prioritise two-three specific industries as other countries have done. We must make credit cheaper and get money into the hands of people who can create value. We need to empower start-ups and individuals to develop our capacities,&rdquo; he said.Tyagi of CSC e-Governance Services said that various initiatives of Common Service Centres (CSC) are today empowering the country&rsquo;s farmers are being empowered through and for those who are unable to earn their livelihood and are dependent, digital literacy has proved to be a boon by empowering them to be self-dependent.&ldquo;Our Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) from various parts of the country are doing wonders and they have done great work during Covid-19. We have created ICT-enabled rural enterprises in the country.&ldquo;We are working on all the services for rural people towards building an empowered and digitally inclusive society. &lsquo;Digital literacy&rsquo; through CSCs has emerged as a ray of hope for the life of villagers&hellip; With the help of technology, we are building AtamNirbhar Bharat,&rdquo; Tyagi said.The Foreign Correspondents&rsquo; Club of South Asia is a group of more than a thousand journalists and photographers covering India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Maldives, Afghanistan and Tibet.

New Delhi: Riding on the success of iPhone 11, Apple led the global premium segment with 57 per cent market share, followed by Samsung and Huawei , according to a new report.While most of the brands declined, OPPO grew 67 per cent (from a low base) driven by Reno 3 and Reno 3 Pro 5G series, and Xiaomi also grew 10 per cent from a small base driven by the Mi 10 5G and Mi Note 10 series.The top 3 players together captured 88 per cent of the segment during the quarter globally, according to Counterpoint Research &ldquo;Within regions, Apple and Samsung remained in the top two spots in all the regions except China, where Huawei was the market leader in the premium segment,&rdquo; said Varun Mishra, Research Analyst at Counterpoint Research.Driven by the popularity of OnePlus 7 series, OnePlus also featured in top 5 players in the premium segment in all the regions except LATAM and China.The overall contribution of the premium segment within the global smartphone market remained resilient at 22 per cent, similar to the previous year.&ldquo;The segment remains key as while it accounts for 22 per cent of total smartphone sell-through, it contributed close to 57 per cent of total global smartphone revenue during the quarter,&rdquo; Mishra noted.Within models, iPhone 11 continued to do well and was the highest-selling model in the premium segment for Q1. Top four out of five highest selling models in the premium segment were from Apple.5G devices cornered one-fifth of the total premium segment during the quarter.Huawei with its strong push in China captured close to 42 per cent of the total 5G device sell-through in the premium segment.&ldquo;Going forward, the launch of 5G devices by Apple will play a key role in the growth of the premium segment. We also think the premium segment is likely to remain the most resilient from the COVID-19 impact,&rdquo; said Mishra.

SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc&rsquo;s Google on Wednesday announced a new hiring goal and security policy to address racial issues at its offices, as protests over police brutality against African Americans have carried into discussions about corporate culture.Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said that by 2025, the company aims to have 30% more of its leaders be from underrepresented groups. About 96% of Google&rsquo;s U.S. leaders are white or Asian, and 73% globally are men.Pichai said all leadership openings now will be shared externally. Silicon Valley companies have often hired for top positions using secretive recruiting firms or internal promotions, making it difficult for people not connected to an employee to know of opportunities.In addition, Pichai said Google would strive to be more inclusive, with steps such as eliminating an office security procedure that may have led to racial profiling.Google and other tech companies have long instructed employees to ask for identification from &ldquo;tailgaters,&rdquo; or people who sneak through secure doors behind employees who just unlocked them.But black employees had raised concerns about being unfairly checked, and Pichai acknowledged the system was &ldquo;susceptible to bias.&ldquo;&ldquo;We will end the practice of Googlers badge-checking each other and rely on our already robust security infrastructure,&rdquo; he said.Pichai also announced $150 million in funding for black business owners and an internal task force to work on projects that &ldquo;help black users in the moments that matter most.&ldquo;For years, civil rights groups have pressured Silicon Valley companies such as Google to recruit more racial minorities, contending greater diversity would lead to products that do not perpetuate racial and gender stereotypes.Google is still pursuing a goal announced in 2018 to increase overall U.S. workforce diversity by this year to match what it describes as &ldquo;market supply.&quot;(Reporting by Paresh Dave; Editing by Chris Reese and David Gregorio)

<p>5G road: Auction getting delayed while government nods Huawei&rsquo;s participation</p>
<p>Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.</p>
<p>Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.</p>
<p>In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners&ndash;China and the US.
