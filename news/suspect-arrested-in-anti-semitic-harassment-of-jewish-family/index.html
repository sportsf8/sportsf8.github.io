<p>LONDON — A suspect has been arrested after a man was videotaped reading Bible passages to a Jewish man and a boy in the London Underground and accusing them of being “impostors,” in an episode of anti-Semitism that drew outrage.</p>
<p>The British Transport Police said on Saturday that the man, who was not named, was detained on suspicion of having committed a racially aggravated public order offense. Video of the harassment emerged on social media on Friday afternoon, a few hours after the encounter on the Northern Line of London’s subway system.</p>
<p>Video footage posted by another passenger and retweeted more than 18,000 times shows a man reading a section from the Bible to the Jewish man and boy, who are both wearing skullcaps. Witnesses said they were father and son.</p>
<p>The man with the Bible is shown leaning into the boy, quoting Scripture and pointing from the text to the family. The boy stares ahead, looking bewildered, while the man presumed to be his father, one arm wrapped around his son, speaks to him calmly. The man and boy have not been identified.

<h3 id="german-official-warns-jews-against-wearing-kippahs-in-public">&ldquo;German official warns Jews against wearing kippahs in public&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/17921014_304.jpg" alt="img">
The German government&rsquo;s anti-Semitism commissioner on Saturday warned the country&rsquo;s Jewish community to avoid donning yarmulkes, the traditional Jewish head coverings for males, in some public spaces due to a rise in anti-Semitic crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot advise Jews to wear the kippah everywhere all the time in Germany,&rdquo; Felix Klein said in an interview carried by the Funke media group, using another word for yarmulke.</p>
<p>The official said he had &ldquo;changed his mind (on the subject) compared to previously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The number of attacks against Jews in Germany increased from 1,504 in 2017 to 1,646 in 2018 — a rise of 10%. The number of reported violent cases against Jews rose from 37 to 62 over the same period, according to official figures.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Katarina Barley told the Handelsblatt newspaper the increase was &ldquo;shameful for our country&rdquo; but added that the police were &ldquo;vigilant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For those wearing the yarmulke, political reassurances aren&rsquo;t enough. Sigmount Königsberg, the anti-Semitism commissioner of Berlin&rsquo;s Jewish congregation, said he found Klein&rsquo;s statement lacking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would&rsquo;ve expected him to add that he&rsquo;ll do everything in his power to make sure Jews can wear their kippa everywhere in Germany and at all times of the day and night,&rdquo; Königsberg told DW.</p>
<p>He hopes that Klein&rsquo;s warning works as an alarm signal to society and that politicians will take action so that &ldquo;Jewish people can openly wear their kippa in public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last year, a man wearing the Star of David was beaten down and kicked right in the center of Berlin. Some weeks earlier, a similar incident in Germany&rsquo;s capital caused public outrage and sparked a nationwide debate on anti-Semitism when a 19-year-old Syrian attacked an Arab-Israeli and his companion with a belt in broad daylight. Both victims wore yarmulkes in what was an allegedly anti-Semitic attack.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Deep-rooted&rsquo; prejudice</p>
<p>After several high-profile incidents of anti-Semitic violence, Germany&rsquo;s Jewish community appealed to the government to institute an anti-Semitism oath for groups seeking public funding.</p>

<p>Germany&rsquo;s anti-Semitism commissioner, Felix Klein, suggested that police, teachers and lawyers should be better trained to recognize what constitutes anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>Read more: 2,000 Berliners wear skullcaps to protest anti-Semitism</p>
<p>According to Klein, &ldquo;the lifting of inhibitions and the uncouthness which is on the rise in society&rdquo; are factors behind the recent anti-Semitic wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The internet and social media have largely contributed to this — but so have constant attacks against our culture of remembrance,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>A few weeks earlier, Claudia Vanoni, Berlin&rsquo;s top legal expert on anti-Semitism, said that anti-Semitism remained deeply rooted in German society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anti-Semitism has always been here. But I think that recently, it has again become louder, more aggressive and flagrant,&rdquo; Vanoni told the Agence France-Presse news agency.</p>
<p>Analysts say the rise of far-right political groups in Germany has also contributed to anti-Semitism in the country. Parties like Alternative for Germany (AfD) openly question Germany&rsquo;s culture of atonement for World War II. Some experts also attribute the new wave of anti-Semitism to the arrival of millions of asylum-seekers, mainly from Muslim-majority countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Yarmulke European Jews started wearing the yarmulke, or kippa, in the 17th and 18th centuries, turning the skullcap into a religious symbol. Pious Jews are expected to cover their heads, but the fabric isn&rsquo;t that important, and a hat or scarf is acceptable, too. Jewish Halacha law requires men and boys to cover their head when they pray, visit a synagogue or a Jewish cemetery or study the religion.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Miter The miter is the ceremonial headdress worn by bishops, mainly in the Roman-Catholic Church. It goes back to the 11th century, with the tall, peaked hat deeply cleft on the sides and adorned with two ribbons at the back symbolizing the Old and the New Testaments.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Dastar Members of the Sikh faith, a monotheistic religion founded in India&rsquo;s northern Punjab region in the 15th century, wear a dastar. A dastar is usually worn by men, with orange being a popular color. Underneath the cloth headwear, which is re-knotted every morning, Sikh men let their hair grow freely.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Chador In Farsi, the word chador means &ldquo;tent,&rdquo; and that is what this garment worn by observant Muslim women in some parts of the Middle East resembles. Usually black, it covers a woman from the head down, hiding the shape of the body, revealing only the face. The chador is worn over a woman&rsquo;s regular clothing.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Nun&rsquo;s veil Nuns almost always wear a distinctive veil to complete their religious garment, the habit. Novices&rsquo; veils are white, while professed nuns usually wear a black veil, or one in their habit&rsquo;s color. Depending on the religious order, veils come in different sizes and shapes. Some are elaborate and cover the woman&rsquo;s entire head; others are simply pinned to the sister&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Headscarf Is a woman&rsquo;s headscarf a religious headdress, or a symbol of oppression? In the West in particular, that continues to be a matter of heated debate. It is certainly the most well-known female head covering. Turkish women (as in this photo) tie headscarves differently from women in Arabic countries.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Sheitel The ultra-Orthodox Hasidic Jewish community in New York has strict rules for married women, who are required to shave their hair and wear a wig, the &ldquo;sheitel.&rdquo; In her 2012 bestseller memoir &ldquo;Unorthodox,&rdquo; US author Deborah Feldman describes growing up in the ultra-religious group.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Birett A bit of cloth, strips of cardboard and a tassel — voila, the birett, a head covering worn by Roman Catholic priests since the 13th century. In the Netherlands, Germany, Britain and France, the hat has four corners. In many other countries, it has three.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Birett A bit of cloth, strips of cardboard and a tassle — voila, the birett, a head covering worn by Roman Catholic priests since the 13th century. In the Netherlands, Germany, Britain and France, the hat has four corners. In many other countries, it has three. If you remember the character Don Camillo (played by French actor Fernandel in a series of films in the 1950s and &rsquo;60s), you know the hat!</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Tagelmust The cotton scarf that can be up to 15 meters long is worn by Tuareg Berber Muslim men throughout western Africa. The tagelmust covers the head and is pulled over the mouth and nose against wind-born sand in the desert. The turban-style headdress is worn by adult men only. When indigo blue, the tagelmust&rsquo;s dye can rub off on the skin, hence the Tuareg being called the &ldquo;blue men of the desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Shtreimel The Jewish shtreimel hat is made of velvet and has a wide fur trim, usually sable. Married men wear the hat on Jewish holidays and for religious festivities. The eye-catching headgear originated in Hasidic communities in southeastern Europe, a tradition that became nearly extinct in Europe after the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Yarmulke, mitra or veil: religious head coverings across the globe Hats and bonnets The Amish are a conservative Christian group in North America that originated in the tradition of the Anabaptist movement in Switzerland and southern Germany. The first Amish fled to the US in the early 18th century to escape religious persecution. They live simple lives, and shun modern technology and conveniences. The women wear plain bonnets; the men wear straw or felt hats. Author: Klaus Krämer (db)</p>

<h3 id="germans-urged-to-wear-jewish-skullcap-ahead-of-anti-israel-protests">&ldquo;Germans urged to wear Jewish skullcap ahead of anti-Israel protests&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190526085759-germany-antisemitism-3-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Germany&rsquo;s anti-Semitism commissioner has asked all citizens to wear the kippah in solidarity with the Jewish community, in the run-up to planned anti-Israel protests Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call on all citizens of Berlin and across Germany to wear the yarmulke (as the skullcap is known in Yiddish) next Saturday if there are new, intolerable attacks targeting Israel and Jews on the occasion of Al-Quds Day in Berlin,&rdquo; said Felix Klein in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By doing this we can show a great sign of solidarity with the Jewish community and make a statement for the freedom of religion and the diversity of our society,&rdquo; Klein told CNN via email.</p>
<p>Al-Quds Day is an annual event marked by protests against Israel, on the last Friday of Ramadan, with attendees expressing support for Palestinians.</p>
<p>Demonstrations, parades, and seminars are held in various countries, but are especially large in Iran, where Al-Quds Day was established in August 1979. Al-Quds is Arabic for Jerusalem.</p>

A Jew in the outback</p>
<p>Updated</p>
<p>Australia is home to 91,000 Jews. But in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, there is just one. His name is Josh.</p>
<p>Josh Chiat likes to joke that he is the only Jew in town.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no way to know for sure if it&rsquo;s true, but that&rsquo;s not really the point.</p>
<p>In Kalgoorlie, a mining settlement of roughly 30,000 perched on the lip of Australia&rsquo;s largest open-cut gold mine, there is no synagogue nor any discernible Jewish presence.</p>
<p>People describing themselves as Jewish number so few in the region that they fall under &lsquo;other religions&rsquo; in the census.</p>
<p>For Josh, who grew up in an orthodox Jewish household in Noranda, a leafy, middle-class suburb of Perth, the move to regional Western Australia immediately posed a pressing question: How do you practise Judaism in a town with no Jews?</p>
<p>The 27-year-old lives in a small unit overlooking the town&rsquo;s main street.</p>
<p>Opposite is an evangelical church where on Sundays Josh watches from his balcony as churchgoers spill out into the winter morning, their coats wrapped tightly around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard that there are Jewish people around the place,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Four years ago Josh created a Facebook group called Blazing Saddles: Jews of the Goldfields after the 1974 Mel Brooks movie.</p>
<p>Today, he remains the only member.</p>
<p>310 of your closest friends</p>
<p>Cut to Melbourne, where 24-year-old Clara Klein is getting married surrounded by 310 guests in a chaotic expression of life in Australia&rsquo;s most populous Jewish community.</p>
<p>The bride sways momentarily on her feet, then regains her balance.</p>
<p>It could be the fasting, customary before a Jewish wedding. Or it could be the hakafot, the tight circles she&rsquo;s being led in around her husband-to-be.</p>
<p>The marriage brings to six the number of Gilly Klein&rsquo;s seven children who are now successfully partnered, all to Jewish spouses.</p>
<p>She says even within the Jewish community it&rsquo;s hard to find someone whose values, and whose interpretation of the religion, align with yours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara wanted someone who was proud of being Jewish, who was happy to wear a kippah on his head but who at the same time would watch a movie with her at night and some men wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very orthodox Jews don&rsquo;t watch movies because they&rsquo;re seen to promote secular values like promiscuity and immodesty.</p>
<p>Menny Overlander proposed after the commissioning of a shadchan, or matchmaker, blood tests to rule out genetic disease, vetting of references and 11 dates.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d flown to New York — where Clara was living at the time — to take her out, and they were engaged before he boarded the flight home three weeks later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first time they went out wasn&rsquo;t so crash hot, but I always say you have to give it a chance,&rdquo; says Clara&rsquo;s mother, who was matchmade herself to her husband of 38 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We pay the matchmaker really serious money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both sides of the family pay. The tradition says if you don&rsquo;t give a big acknowledgement it could hinder the couple having children or cause problems later in the marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three months after the New York engagement, the wedding is an orthodox affair.</p>
<p>Men and women mill at opposite ends of the house.</p>
<p>For most of the ceremony the bride&rsquo;s head is covered by a square of white lace affixed with a bobby pin.</p>
<p>Beneath the bedeken her face is solemn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite intense,&rdquo; explains her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see people joking around at weddings but we say that the bride&rsquo;s future is predestined under that canopy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is really very serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And love?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We strongly believe in the divine providence in this process. We believe that love will definitely come if we all have the right values.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Kalgoorlie</p>
<p>By night, Josh Chiat and a group of his friends are regulars at the Criterion Hotel on the main street, where a crowd turns out on Fridays for a Kalgoorlie take on karaoke.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a boozy but comfortable environment. No heckling.</p>
<p>Most sing country or crooner favourites, but Josh prefers the oscillating rhythms of R&amp;B and soul: D&rsquo;Angelo, Al Green, Prince.</p>
<p>Occasionally he picks songs from the Disney films of his childhood. A Whole New World from Aladdin, or Hakuna Matata from The Lion King.</p>
<p>Standing between the screen displaying lyrics and the pool table, he cuts a slightly gawky figure. But his voice turns heads at the bar, where the rusted-on regulars perch, nursing stubbies.</p>
<p>Contrary to orthodoxy, Josh has never dated someone of the Jewish faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My parents have never had a conversation with me saying they want me to marry a nice Jewish girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jewishness is carried through the woman, so if a Jewish man marries a non-Jewish woman, the children are not considered Jewish.</p>
<p>But Josh isn&rsquo;t bothered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[It&rsquo;s been a] flicker in the back of my mind from time to time,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I have that much in common with someone just because they have the same religion as me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His girlfriend grew up agnostic in Esperance on Western Australia&rsquo;s south coast.</p>
<p>The pair don&rsquo;t observe the Sabbath, a period stretching from Friday evening to Saturday evening when Jews abstain from work. More orthodox interpretations ban using certain electrical devices too.</p>
<p>During one stay with Josh&rsquo;s extended family for Passover, his girlfriend quietly confessed the matzah ball soup, a traditional dish made from congealed bread soaked in a chicken broth, wasn&rsquo;t quite to her taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a bit of a blow,&rdquo; says Josh with a wry smile. &ldquo;I really like it and everybody in my family really likes it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This year, Passover fell over the Easter long weekend and the couple spent it apart, each with their own family.</p>
<p>There were no hard feelings.</p>
<p>The rabbi&rsquo;s daughter</p>
<p>At 12 years old, Hannah Steinberg pivots seamlessly between talking about the Babylonian empire, FaceTiming her two oldest sisters in Israel and calling out a journalist on a clunky question.</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;If you were to explain to an alien what it means to be Jewish, what would you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah: &ldquo;I would tell them it&rsquo;s an Earth thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deadpan delivery.</p>
<p>She effortlessly flips and splits her way around the backyard, somersaulting off the trampoline and the ground with equal buoyancy. You can see her dream of going to the Commonwealth Games as a rhythmic gymnast coming true.</p>
<p>But an astroengineer is what Hannah wants to become.</p>
<p>For now, this daughter of a rabbi and a speech pathologist attends a girls-only religious school in Melbourne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel lucky to have a proper Jewish education. One of my subjects is Jewish history and I learn something every day. Sometimes it&rsquo;s really scary and sometimes it&rsquo;s really gross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us Jewish people, stuff that has happened to us is not normal. We&rsquo;re not like any other religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ask if she means the Holocaust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Everything. The splitting of the Red Sea. God split the sea for us. There&rsquo;s so much. It&rsquo;s very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At school, teachers have Hannah and her classmates take detours to avoid seeing the boys on the neighbouring campus.</p>
<p>But outside of school hours, Hannah doesn&rsquo;t feel restricted in her socialising. There is synagogue and there are bar mitzvahs. Right now there&rsquo;s this boy…</p>
<p>Interfacing with non-Jewish society can be an exercise in logistics and planning.</p>
<p>Like recently, when Hannah went on a non-Jewish camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to bring my own food, my own cutlery and plates. I couldn&rsquo;t have their bowls because we have a process of making crockery kosher where you dip your ceramics and metal and hard plastics into rainwater and you say a special prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had people sitting next to me having bacon, and cheese on toast. That was a bit weird for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was really interesting to see people&rsquo;s different cultures but for a whole week I was just longing to see one Jewish person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are other disconnects with secular Australian society.</p>
<p>Take the concept of tziniut, or modesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in the city and your elbows and knees are covered with like a skirt and a three-quarter sleeve top and everyone around you is just wearing a singlet top and shorts, that&rsquo;s a bit tricky. Because you might get influenced and you don&rsquo;t want to get influenced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah&rsquo;s mother Rochelle elaborates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea is that women and girls should be seen not for their physical beauty but their spiritual beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochelle has recently started wearing a wig in a further gesture of modesty so that her husband is the only one to see her hair.</p>
<p>The Steinbergs live in the heart of Melbourne&rsquo;s Jewish community, in Caulfield North.</p>
<p>The neighbours on one side are Jewish. On the other, not.</p>
<p>In the front hall, earlier versions of husband and wife smile out from a wedding photo, bride and groom posed in sea of red poppies. The St Kilda Botanical Gardens in October.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither of us was religious at the time,&rdquo; Rochelle says. &ldquo;We had a different perspective on life back then. We didn&rsquo;t observe everything we do now. The focus was more on high holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early on in our marriage we decided to keep one Shabbos (Sabbath) and we just loved it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no more driving, no more TV, no more phones, no more going out to breakfast and it turned our life around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our way of life now,&rdquo; she says, laying challah bread on the table. &ldquo;We look forward to it every week. It&rsquo;s just 25 hours of being with family and friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compromises</p>
<p>Josh works as a soccer administrator, running school clinics and outreach programs. Until recently he was a reporter with WA&rsquo;s last regional daily newspaper, The Kalgoorlie Miner.</p>
<p>Three years covering the mining industry and local sport means he&rsquo;s known to just about everyone in town, and slips as naturally into conversation with an acquaintance he passes on the street as he would an old friend.</p>
<p>Leaving his office on a lunch break, Josh catches the eye of the local MP. &ldquo;Hi Rick,&rdquo; he calls out across the car park. At a busy cafe on a Saturday morning, customers tap him on the shoulder to congratulate him on his new job. Spotting someone else on a different night, a passing hello turns into a lengthy discussion on the ups and downs of the gold prospecting industry.</p>
<p>According to Josh, people are always surprised to learn he&rsquo;s Jewish.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s the absence of any obvious signs - he wears no kippah or yarmulke, the small cloth skullcap worn by orthodox Jews. He attends no synagogue. (There is none to attend.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon there&rsquo;d be people I know who I&rsquo;d be the first Jew they&rsquo;ve ever met. Certainly the first practising Jew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But most of that practice goes on in private.</p>
<p>On Yom Kippur, the holiest occasion on the Jewish calendar, when Jews atone for their sins, Josh uses his annual leave to take the day off work and spend it in bed, fasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does mean something to you to maintain your culture in a place where it is difficult to,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to make compromises. But it&rsquo;s important to keep up those small aspects of your culture so that it doesn&rsquo;t die off over generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No danger of that in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Epicentre of Jewishness</p>
<p>In the countdown to Shabbos on a Friday afternoon, the Flowers from Gan Eden florist is an ebb and flow of men in kippahs plucking dripping bouquets from buckets.</p>
<p>Melbourne&rsquo;s Jewish population spans the gamut from ultra-orthodox to completely disassociated.</p>
<p>Perhaps a majority identify strongly as Jewish but are not religious.</p>
<p>Even the wearing of the yarmulke can be more cultural touchstone than religious observance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s meant to be a humbler and a reminder there&rsquo;s something above you,&rdquo; says Rabbi Ephraim Lever from the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the theology of it. But we live in a superficial day and age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can be like a brand, like if someone walks down the street carrying a Louis Vuitton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>60 synagogues</p>
<p>Light is just seeping into the sky above the copper dome as congregants filter in, wrapping themselves in prayer shawls.</p>
<p>At one time Melbourne&rsquo;s only synagogue, the imposing edifice of Toorak Shule is now one of 60 across the city.</p>
<p>A guard mans the gate during services, the sense of threat an inextricable part of the Jewish identity.</p>
<p>The synagogue&rsquo;s security budget last year was $30,000. This year, after the Christchurch mosque attacks, it&rsquo;s $100,000.</p>
<p>A certain expectation</p>
<p>Melbourne&rsquo;s oldest Jewish creche is teeming with youngsters. 60 children under three-and-a-half run glorious riot, Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>To be childless is not really a choice Jewish couples make, says educator Talli Kimelman, herself a mother of 11 and, at 60, grandmother to more than 30.</p>
<p>The playground is Jewish socialisation at work. Most of the children here interact entirely with other Jewish youngsters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It goes way past the kids,&rdquo; says Kimelman of the tight-knit nature of Jewish communities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always been foreigners, always lived in ghettos. We&rsquo;ve always had to exist that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To kosher or not to kosher</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 4:00am and colder inside than out.</p>
<p>A mashgiach, or rabbinical supervisor, hums a tune as he tosses handfuls of salt over a side of beef, part of a koshering process that takes hours.</p>
<p>This meat will end up in Coles, Woolworths and IGA supermarkets as well as Jewish schools, nursing homes and restaurants all over Melbourne.</p>
<p>Places like Ravit Gabai&rsquo;s kitchen, where a huge pot of amber broth simmers on the stove. In the cold room a vat of eggplant marinates. Jars of turmeric and paprika cluster on a countertop.</p>
<p>Nowhere are the recipes written down. You won&rsquo;t see a measuring cup here.</p>
<p>In the back of a disused restaurant Ravit is cooking by feel, from memory.</p>
<p>She opens the doors once a week, selling take-home kosher dishes to a clientele grown by word of mouth.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s food that transports you to the homeland.</p>
<p>This is the traditional home cooking that Ravit grew up eating in Haifa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a kid I was attached to my mum&rsquo;s apron, wanting to learn. It comes naturally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandparents on my father&rsquo;s side came from Yemen. Mum&rsquo;s side came from Persia, from Tehran. We had a Moroccan neighbour and we learned from them. My ex was Iraqi so I picked up from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Kalgoorlie, where typical fare is a chicken parmy as big as a hubcap or a miner&rsquo;s breakfast of sausages, bacon and eggs, eating out is — well — a minefield. But Josh has learned to cope.</p>
<p>A recent menu change at Paddy&rsquo;s, a popular bistro, touched a slight nerve. The duck bao entree was pulled in favour of a version with pork. One less kosher favourite, Josh thought.</p>
<p>Jewish dietary rules are complex, and among other things, forbid the eating of mammals unless they have cloven hooves and chew their cud. Seafood without scales and fins is also off the menu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always want cheese on my burgers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So I never hold the [kosher] meat and dairy principle too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think everyone makes that bargain with their religion or their cultural background if you&rsquo;re not going to be really strict about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When it came to recreating the kosher paella his father cooked throughout his childhood, the local butcher couldn&rsquo;t supply the right chorizo. It would need to be ordered from Perth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the idea of cooking up kosher food,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Or as kosher as you can get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t really have a kosher kitchen when you&rsquo;re living in a sharehouse out in Kalgoorlie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Jew apart</p>
<p>On weekends, Josh plays for Boulder City Soccer Club, the local league&rsquo;s defending champions. This season they aren&rsquo;t doing so well, but he still turns up early and stays back late.</p>
<p>The sport offers its own rituals: the pre-match shaving of his head, the donning of the uniform.</p>
<p>There is belonging here.</p>
<p>In these moments, on the soccer field, Josh becomes a different person. His voice is sharper, more direct.</p>
<p>Training finishes and the softly spoken charm returns. Josh is wearing his patent grin once more, asking about plans for the weekend. Cracking jokes.</p>
<p>The sport now occupies most of Josh&rsquo;s waking hours in one way or another. The obsession began as a child in Perth while a student at a Jewish day-school.</p>
<p>Then his parents moved him to a totally new environment: an Anglican school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pretty much only really knew Jewish people until I was nine or ten years old,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went from being one Jew in a sea of Jews to the only Jew in my school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the four years Josh has called Kalgoorlie home, he&rsquo;s heard rumours of other Jews in town. Maybe a Jewish teacher at one of the local high schools. Or perhaps the grandmother of a friend of a friend. But he&rsquo;s yet to meet any of them.</p>
<p>In his isolation, Josh has learned a lot about his own faith.</p>
<p>At times, elements of the town can feel alien and uncomfortable. Like when a swag of Nazi paraphernalia went on sale at a community auction earlier this year, drawing a lot of interest.</p>
<p>Or when a car bearing a homemade swastika appeared at a local car show, and no-one seemed to bat an eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the ignorance is a big concern,&rdquo; say Josh. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s probably a lot of people living in this community who don&rsquo;t understand why that might be hurtful to Jewish people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in spite of the challenges, his essential Jewishness — a part of how he sees himself in the world — has remained intact since moving to Kalgoorlie.</p>
<p>If anything, it&rsquo;s grown stronger in the outback.</p>

<h3 id="repositioning-a-heros-cape-hijabi-defends-jewish-family-from-hate-in-london">&ldquo;Repositioning A Hero&rsquo;s Cape: Hijabi defends Jewish family from hate in London&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://stepcdn.com/assets/2019-11/27/14/juywg/muslim-woman-london-tube-625x395.jpg" alt="img">
A Muslim woman was dubbed a &ldquo;hero&rdquo; for defending a Jewish family that was under verbal attack by a man on a London train last week. It isn&rsquo;t only Islamophobia that&rsquo;s rampant in the West; anti-Semitism makes appearances from time to time as well.</p>
<p>A passenger on the Northern Line of the London Underground pulled out a copy of the Old Testament and took it upon himself to educate a young Jewish boy using &ldquo;God&rsquo;s words.&rdquo; The boy, who was wearing a kippah - a skullcap traditionally worn by Jewish men - was accompanied by his father and what seems like his brother, as foreign media reported.</p>
<p>Chris Atkins, a passenger on the tube, realized the words being said were &ldquo;really, really anti-Semitic&rdquo; and so her shared a video of the incident with his Twitter followers. As one commuter attempted to intervene in a bid to put an end to the man&rsquo;s ranting, the abuser began yelling at him and threatening him with physical abuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of my face or I will smack you right in your nose, man. Back up from me. I&rsquo;m not no Christian pastor. Back the f**** up from me,&rdquo; the abuser can be heard saying to the commuter in the video.</p>
<p>This is when the Muslim woman, Asma Shuweikh, took it upon herself to step in. &ldquo;Come on man, there are children,&rdquo; she said in an attempt to calm the man down. As Shuweikh successfully turned his attention away from the Jewish family, he blamed the Jews for &ldquo;taking my [Christian] heritage&rdquo; and then attempted to turn things on her by asking, &ldquo;Do you care about your people?&rdquo;

<p>An eight-year-old boy wearing a Jewish skullcap, or kippa, has been attacked in a suburb of the French capital, Paris, in what officials suspect is the latest case of anti-Semitic violence.</p>
<p>Two teenage suspects, who fled the scene, did not shout any insults or steal anything from the boy, who also wore a traditional Jewish belt.</p>
<p>President Emmanuel Macron has condemned it as &ldquo;an attack on the republic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s Jewish community has voiced fears over rising anti-Semitism.</p>
<p>The suspects - believed to be around 15 - were hidden behind rubbish bins and attacked the boy as he walked to a tutoring class on Monday evening in the northern suburb of Sarcelles, which has a large Jewish community, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>They pushed the boy to the ground and beat him, they added. The boy was said to be well physically, but shocked.</p>
<p>In condemning the attack, Mr Macron said on Twitter (in French) that &ldquo;every time a citizen is attacked because of their age, appearance or religion, the whole republic is attacked&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Also on Twitter, Israel&rsquo;s ambassador to France, Aliza Bin Noun, said she was &ldquo;disgusted by the resurgence&rdquo; of anti-Semitic violence.</p>

<h3 id="jew-vs-jew-is-america-ready-for-bloomberg-or-sanders">&ldquo;Jew vs. Jew: Is America Ready For Bloomberg Or Sanders?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/jewishwdev/uploads/2019/11/37-1024x640.jpg" alt="img">
In Wallace Markfield’s 1974 novel “You Could Live If They Let You,” a character jokes, “The time is at hand when the wearing of prayer shawl and skullcap will not bar a man from the White House — unless, of course, the man is Jewish.”</p>
<p>Maybe that’s no joke: 35 years later we still haven’t had a Jewish president, although an observant Jewish man is both the president’s son-in-law and one of his chief advisers.</p>
<p>If we ever hope to see a Jew gain entrance to the Oval Office without the benefit of marriage, our best hope may be between now and 2020, with Michael Bloomberg in the presidential race and Bernie Sanders sitting among the top tier of candidates.</p>
<p>But the set-up to the joke is still the same: Is America ready for a Jewish president?</p>

<p>The question was asked, but maybe with less intensity, when Bernie became the first major-party Jewish candidate to win a primary state. Yes, “Uncle Bernie” is unmistakably Jewish (except, perhaps, to the kinds of Jews who hold him to their own pro-Israel and religious standards). But questions about Sanders’ electability focused less on his Jewishness than his politics. Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Gallup found that less than half of Americans would vote for a candidate who is a socialist. By contrast, more than 90 percent of Americans said they would vote for a qualified presidential candidate who is Catholic, a woman, black, Hispanic — or Jewish.</p>
<p>That wasn’t always the case. In 1937, Gallup found that fewer than half of Americans would support a Jewish candidate. That number rose steadily through the decades, to where a Jewish background is no longer seen as a liability. When Pew measures feelings toward various ethnic groups, Jews receive the warmest ratings, right in there with Protestants and Catholics — and well ahead of Muslims, Mormons and Hindus.</p>
<p>No doubt people may tell pollsters what they think they want to hear. Nevertheless, Gallup’s recent polls show that 92 percent of Americans say they would be willing to support a Jewish presidential candidate.</p>
<p>But what kind of candidate? Sanders, 78, and Bloomberg, 77, seem almost overdetermined in the ways they embody two distinct Jewish types: the left-wing city boy who studied at Brooklyn College and the University of Chicago and made a firebrand’s life in crunchy Vermont; the suburban kid who went to Johns Hopkins, made a fortune in media and ran successfully for mayor of New York as a Republican.</p>
<p>Their speaking voices lend themselves to ethnic parody: Bernie’s dropped R’s, emphatic T’s, and loudest-man-at-the-seder-table inflections; Bloomberg’s nasal intonations and a Boston-meets-Manhattan accent that mimics tend to make more “Jewish” than it actually is.</p>
<p>Yes, that’s rich material for anti-Semites, who portray Jews as either communist infiltrators or greedy capitalists, foreign-sounding caricatures or sneaky assimilationists. But even when you throw in anti-Zionists on the far left, anti-globalists on the far right, and the white supremacists behind a rash of attacks on Jews, the anti-Semitic voting bloc isn’t very big.</p>
<p>The polls suggest voters are going to accept or reject Sanders and Bloomberg for the same reasons they’ll judge the other Democratic candidates: on their policies, their likeability and their electability. And that last factor will have less to do with their Jewishness than their opposing visions for America.</p>
<p>If anything, the case could be made that Bloomberg and Sanders, both largely secular, would lose votes among some people — especially religious Christians who might have had enough of Trump — because they are not “Jewish” enough. This has a history: Evangelical Christians were especially excited when an Orthodox Jew, Joe Lieberman, ran as Al Gore’s running mate in 2000. Just as some say Donald Trump is a poor person’s idea of a rich person, Joe Lieberman appeared to be an Evangelical’s idea of a Jew: devout, virtuous, socially conservative.</p>
<p>Although a Democrat at the time and pro-choice, Lieberman was happy to speak about what one admiring evangelical radio host described as “the moral and spiritual decline of American culture, particularly in the entertainment industry.” Christian clergy were ecstatic with his 1998 Senate speech denouncing President Clinton’s “disgraceful” marital infidelity.</p>
<p>The New York Times wrote at the time that “Lieberman is seen by some Christians as a kindred spirit for his willingness to wear his religion on his sleeve.”</p>
<p>There are still Evangelicals, especially in the Hispanic community, whose views on immigration, criminal justice reform and the environment might tempt them to vote for a Democratic kindred spirit.</p>
<p>Lieberman’s candidacy also suggested that if anyone was likely to hold a candidate’s Jewishness against him or her, it was the Jews themselves. Many liberal Jews found Lieberman’s rectitude insufferable, especially when he suggested lowering the wall between church and state. The Anti-Defamation League worried at the time that his regular appeals to religious faith on the campaign trail were “contrary to the American ideal.” Orthodox Jews, meanwhile, also soured on Lieberman, questioning his stance on abortion, his statement in which he appeared to soften the traditional taboo on interfaith marriage, and (no kidding) his diet on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>History suggests what kind of Jewish candidate America wants: neither a billionaire nor a socialist, but a business-friendly moderate who can unify America and is no religious fanatic but is very much at home in the language of faith, Torah and Jewish ritual.</p>
<p>In other words, Cory Booker.
