Luka Romero and her father Diego Romero, who played in Argentina, Slovenia, Ecuador, Mexico and Spain</p>
<p>It has hardly 15 years, 7 months and 6 days. His name has been part of the journalistic notes for several years, when he was much younger and already aroused the passions of Barcelona or Real Madrid. Luka Romero –Descendant of Argentines, with Mexican nationality and Spanish passport– is the young talent who once again dominated the covers of the world from his historic debut with Mallorca Spanish and is the end product of a family heritage riddled with roots in football of all kinds.</p>
<p>its father he was a professional player, his grandfather a historical trainer from Quilmes and his uncles They also trampled this sport in different modalities. The talent they speak about all over the world is mainly the result of a family whose main language is ball.</p>
<p>Brothers Luka and Tobías Romero in Almeyda’s arms</p>
<p>Diego is the father of the twins Luka and Tobías – who stands out as a promising archer in the lower ones of the Penya Arrabal. The history of the former midfielder in this sport quickly became a focus around the world after the early irruption in first of the jewel of the inferiors of the Mallorca team, but little is known that the family tree is full of footballing fruits.</p>
<p>The former midfielder landed in the bottom of Quilmes He was 8 years old and remained there until the end of the 90s, where he even became the companion of a young Chapu Braña. The Brewer, who is at the backbone of his family, was the springboard to guide him towards Atlético de Rafaela at the beginning of the new millennium and then abroad: it passed through the divisional maximums of Slovenia, Mexico and Ecuador.</p>
<p>Luka Romero with one of the Quilmes jerseys that his dad used as a player and his brother Tobías tackling the underside of Penya Arrabal</p>
<p>The adventures outside the limits of his homeland of this midfielder with route and goal arrival were those that transformed little Luka into a Mexican citizen: was born in the 2004 while his father defended the shirt of the Scorpions of Durango. The third leg of his nationality was developed in the epilogue to Diego’s career, when the Romeros decided to strengthen the structures in Spain where he highlighted the vice in the deep ascent of that country. Slowly, he ceased to be the main name in soccer canopies to become the father of the little star.</p>
<p>By then, Luka had already been probed by Barcelona and Real Madrid and a video playing ball with Dani Alves on the beach it had gone viral on networks. « Take the photos of him, it’s Leo Messi, » said the talented Brazilian winger of the long-haired little boy who juggled with the ball next to him from the bright sands of Ses Illetes in Formentera, the island where Romero took his last steps as a professional and which was the fortuitous event that brought Luka closer to Mallorca despite the insistent contact from Blaugrana or Merengue.</p>
<p>However, in the streets of the southern Buenos Aires suburbs it was already an open secret that little Romero was a projection star from before raising sighs to the powerful of Europe or surprising Alves himself. It is no coincidence that whisper that was heard and not everything has to do with Diego’s past in the city club. A part of the roots of that leafy tree are named after Pepe Rosemary, Luka’s grandfather. Anyone who has walked through the youth venues of the Brewer who today plays in the second division of Argentina knows Pepe. He promoted the creation of the youth field in that entity, was leader of the lower structures and coach of the minor categories.</p>
<p>The man who previously commanded for five years at youth from Guatemala –Where Gustavo, Diego’s older brother, also had a step in inferiors– is a reference in Quilmes, either as a promoter of futsal (a discipline that was dissolved) or on a field of 11, where he currently has the club’s branch in his orbit in Berazategui.</p>
<p>Leo and Pepe Romero, Luka’s uncle and grandfather, during a futsal match in Quilmes</p>
<p>In futsal, another of the Romero ramifications was formed: Leonel, Diego’s brother, was in the 11-a-side youth teams but did much of his career as a pivot with the Quilmes de futsal until becoming the captain of that club’s first team and youth technical director. Then he migrated to the first division with Independent and had his farewell with the shirt of Union of Ezpeleta, when a vehicular accident forced him to abandon sports practice.</p>
<p>But the seed was not germinated only from a family side: the Bezzana, the branch of his mother Vanina, also contributed theirs. Grandfather, Alfredo, came to the reservation of Quilmes in the 60s before continuing with his sports life in San Juan. His mother’s two brothers, Flavio and AlfredThey were also part of the Brewer’s reserve before walking to other destinations.</p>
<p>Alfredo, central marker, was also on the campus of the Climbing Remedies Workshops, which achieved promotion to the National B in 1988. While Flavio, a midfielder on the right, stood out for his skills in Atlético de Trenque Lauquen once he left the beer club.</p>
<p>Alfredo Bezzana, one of Luka’s uncles, in Quilmes’ clothes</p>
<p>The young man, who grew up between Mexico, Ecuador and Spain, chose to wear the youth shirt of the Argentina team: He was part of Sub 15 and is now under Pablo Aimar’s orbit in Sub 17. Those who know him know that all years he spends his holidays in the country with his relatives and he is a fan of Argentine football. The fruit, it seems, never falls too far from the tree.</p>
<p>« A lawyer from Mar del Plata, Lelo Rodríguez, who informed me about the existence of Luka, told me about the existence of Luka, explained a little about how his family’s hand came, and I was surprised: Of course, with good reason he wants to play for Argentina! It has a familiar weight behind that must be cute« He commented to Infobae Alejandro Saggese, the coach who put him in the youth team in Argentina.</p>
<p>“He is a boy, he is still a boy. He merged with the guys here, he was so good, that it was undeniable that he was comfortable, that he likes. As much as he was born in Mexico, it is undeniable that he has Argentine roots ”, he added in his appreciation of the boy who makes noise in world football after becoming the youngest player to debut in the Spanish League. And that he met the profesinoalism just on the day of the 33rd birthday of that certain Messi with whom Dani Alves compared him on the beach.</p>

<p>Liverpool were back at their lethal best to beat Crystal Palace 4-0 at Anfield on Wednesday, moving within two points of securing the Premier League title.</p>
<p>The victory, with goals from Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mohamed Salah, Fabinho and Sadio Mane, ensured Juergen Klopp&rsquo;s side could be crowned champions on Thursday if second-placed Manchester City fail to win at Chelsea.</p>
<p>Should Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s side win at Stamford Bridge, Liverpool could finish the job with a victory in their next game, against defending champions City, on July 2.</p>
<p>It was such a dominant performance from Klopp&rsquo;s side, who had been held to a 0-0 draw by Everton on Sunday, that Palace did not have a single touch in Liverpool&rsquo;s penalty area – the first time that has occurred in the Premier League since Opta began collating such stats in 2008.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Anthony Martial scored Manchester United&rsquo;s first Premier League hat-trick for seven years to inspire a 3-0 home win over Sheffield United and maintain their hopes of a top-four finish.

<h3 id="jalani-debut-dan-cetak-sejarah-begini-reaksi-luka-romero">&ldquo;Jalani Debut dan Cetak Sejarah, Begini Reaksi Luka Romero&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.football5star.com/2020/06/Luka-Romero-sangat-senang-menjalani-debut-dan-mencetak-rekor-di-LaLiga-bersama-Real-Mallorca-diariodemallorca.es_.jpg" alt="img">
Football5Star.com, Indonesia – Momen istimewa didapatkan Luka Romero saat Real Mallorca menyambangi kandang Real Madrid, Kamis (25/6/2020) dini hari WIB. Pemain muda Mallorca itu menjalani debut dan menahbiskan diri sebagai debutan termuda dalam sejarah LaLiga.</p>
<p>Turun menggantikan Iddrisu Baba pada menit ke-83, Luka Romero mengukir rekor baru. Dalam umur 15 tahun 7 bulan 6 hari, dia menjadi debutan termuda. Dia melewati rekor Francisco Bao Rodriguez “Sanson” yang menjalani debut saat berumur 15 tahun 8 bulan 11 hari pada 31 Desember 1939.</p>
<p>Romero menyambut gembira momen istimewa tersebut. “Ini momen yang tak akan terlupakan. Terima kasih kepada seluruh staf kepelatihan dan Mallorca yang memberiku kesempatan ini. Aku tak akan pernah melupakan hari ini,” ucap dia seperti dikutip Football5Star.com dari akun Twitter-nya.</p>
<p>Ha sido un momento inolvidable. Gracias a todo el cuerpo técnico y al @RCD_Mallorca por haberme dado esta oportunidad.</p>
<p>Nunca olvidaré este día.</p>
<p>Fue una lástima perder, pero seguimos creyendo 🧗🏽 #HastaLaÚltimaGota pic.twitter.com/WuHsy1N22Y — Luka Romero (@lukaromero_) June 24, 2020</p>
<p>Satu-satunya hal yang jadi noda adalah kekalahan 0-2 yang ditelan Mallorca dalam laga di Stadion Alfredo Di Stefano. Hanya diberi kesempatan main 7 menit, Romero tak dapat berbuat banyak. “Sungguh disayangkan kami kalah. Namun, kami harus terus percaya,” kata dia.</p>
<p>Luka Romero menjadi sorotan saat diikutkan dalam latihan tim senior Mallorca pada 1 Juni silam. Dia digadang-gadang jadi bintang masa depan dan dijuluki Lionel Messi dari Meksiko. Meskipun membela timnas U-15 Argentina, dia memang lahir di Meksiko.</p>
<p>Romero Sempat Dites Barcelona</p>
<p>diariodemallorca.es</p>
<p>Romero bergabung dengan Mallorca saat berumur 10 tahun. kabar yang beredar menyebutkan, anak Diego Romero itu sempat diincar Real Madrid dan Barcelona. Dia memesona dalam sebuah laga bersama Penya Esportiva Sant Jordi. Saat berumur 7 tahun, dia pernah menjalani tes di Barcelona.</p>
<p>Manajemen Mallorca yakin Romero adalah permata yang sangat berharga. Bukan hanya Mallorca, perusahaan apparel Nike pun berpandangan begitu. Buktinya, mereka berani mengontrak pemain yang akan berulang tahun ke-16 pada 18 November nanti itu.</p>
<p>Luka Romero punya latar belakang menarik. Orang tuanya berasal dari Argentina, tapi dia lahir di Meksiko. Lalu, dia tumbuh dan berkembang menjadi pemain sepak bola berbakat di Spanyol. Saat ini, meskipun baru berumur 15 tahun, dia sudah dipantau serius Pablo Aimar, pelatih timnas U-17 Argentina.

<p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0624%2Fr712291_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg" alt="img">
A vitória do Real Madrid sobre o Mallorca por 2 a 0 registrou um episódio memorável do lado do time derrotado. No dia 13 de junho, Luka Romero, que já ganhou a alcunha de &ldquo;Messi Mexicano&rdquo;, entrou em campo aos 38min do segundo tempo para se tornar o jogador mais jovem a atuar em LaLiga, com 15 anos e 219 dias,</p>

<p>O garoto é natural de Durango, no México, e uma das grandes apostas para o futuro do Mallorca, onde joga há cinco temporadas. Não à toa, depois de brilhar nas categorias de base com jogadas habilidosas e gols dignos de aplausos, Luka foi integrado ao elenco principal nas últimas semanas, tendo ficado no banco também nas duas partidas anteriores da equipe, mas sem entrar em campo.</p>
<p>A semelhança de estilo com o camisa 10 do Barcelona anima quem já teve a chance de assistir a jogos de Romero. Canhoto, o meia-atacante costuma jogar na mesma faixa do campo e, como Messi fazia nos seus primeiros passos no futebol, também acumula gols bonitos. Alguns, inclusive, estão em sua conta oficial de Twitter (veja dois abaixo).</p>
<p>Outra similiaridade com Messi é a escolha por defender a seleção argentina. Enquanto Lionel teve a oportunidade de atuar pela Espanha, já que foi para a Europa logo aos 13 anos, Luka Romero teve um leque maior de escolha.</p>
<p>São três nacionalidades: mexicano (onde nasceu, na época em que o pai, Diego Romero, jogava no Alacranes), argentino (por causa da família) e espanhol (já que mudou-se para a Europa com dois anos). Apesar das possibilidades, Luka sempre deixou claro o seu desejo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toda minha família é argentina. Meu sonho é vestir a camisa albiceleste&rdquo;, comentou o garoto, em entrevista publicada pelo site da Associação de Futebol Argentino (AFA), em julho de 2018.</p>

<p>O sonho de defender a seleção aconteceu no Sul-Americano Sub-15, em novembro de 2019.
