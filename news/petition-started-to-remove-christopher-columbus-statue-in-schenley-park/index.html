<p>He said the city took down the Stephen Foster statue in 2018. It showed the Lawrenceville composer with a black man seated below him. And in Rajgopal’s mind, the Columbus statue is just as racist. He’s been fighting to have it removed since last year but says the recent civil unrest here and across the country renewed his determination.

<p>Indian community from Karnataka, specially our own Tulunadu who live abroad are known for their unity and helping hands. But the situation after Covid-19 has made them weak in their connectivity to their homeland. As per the reports published in various media, the NRI community is facing a lot of issues and is going through a very tough time. When they were well secured in their jobs and earning, they generously helped various activities in their native and home town. But the situation has changed now. They need support from the people of their native and home town. This programme will be dedicated all those NRIs to boost their morale and show our unity and strength during this extremely difficult time.</p>
<p>Walter Nandalike, Daijiworld founder said, “At this difficult juncture, our artistes here need some stress busting activity as they are idle since three months without performing live. Many have no livelihood due to total ban on public entertainment shows. If anyone wants to support financially, the amount will go directly to the needy artistes who are in difficulties. The show is an initiative of Rajgopal, top musician from Tulunadu. Also, there have been several requests from NRI friends to organise a virtual show.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thebetterindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Rajgopal_fbJPG.jpg" alt="img">
We have come a long way in orthopaedics with robots assisting in complex joint surgeries, precisely fitting implants, giving a second lease of life to our knees. But there’s one thing we must not forget—that nothing is as good as the joints that we were born with.</p>
<p>Promotion</p>
<p>Health Heroes – This article is part of a series to celebrate some of India’s most amazing doctors and to understand the incredible work they are doing.</p>
<p>You and I are privileged to walk on two legs, thanks to the tireless working of our knees that extend and lock day in and day out. Knees are the largest joints in the human body, but also the most complex ones. What happens when this critical machine gets worn and torn or suffers swelling?</p>
<p>In a one-on-one with 2014 Padma Shri awardee Dr Ashok Rajgopal, Dr Priyamvada Chugh discusses everything about the life of the knee.</p>
<p>Dr Ashok Rajgopal is the Group Chairman of the Medanta Institute of Musculoskeletal Disorders and Orthopaedics, The Medicity, Gurugram. An internationally renowned orthopaedic surgeon, he holds a track record of over 30,000 total knee replacement surgeries and more than 15,000 arthroscopic surgeries for ligament repairs and reconstructions.</p>
<p>Born in 1953, Dr Rajgopal pursued his M.B.B.S from the Armed Forces Medical College in Pune, and his masters from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi and the University of Liverpool, UK.</p>
<p>With an increase in the average lifespan of humans in all parts of the world, arthritis has become a household name for many. But what is “arthritis”?</p>
<p>Originating from ancient Greek, the word ‘arthritis’, which means “pertaining to the joint, limb”, is a scientific term used for hundreds of types of joint pains or joint diseases.</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis, the most common type of joint disease, occurs when the knee cartilage—the cushioning surface on the ends of the knee bones—wears away. This results in bone rubbing against bone, causing pain, swelling, and stiffness.</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis primarily affects the elderly population and is a major cause of disability in older adults worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation, 9.6 per cent of men and 18 per cent of women above the age of 60, worldwide, have symptoms of osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>“In fact, by 2050, people over 60 will account for 20 per cent of the world’s population. Of them, nearly 20 per cent will have osteoarthritis, with a third being severely disabled. This means that 130 million people worldwide will suffer from osteoarthritis by 2050, 40 million of whom will be severely disabled,” says Dr Rajgopal.</p>
<p>What are the available treatments for osteoarthritis?</p>
<p>Physiotherapy is always tried for at least 3-4 months to treat knee disorders. However, if these exercises don’t work, then invasive surgical options are considered. The two most common approaches are arthroscopic surgery and arthroplasty.</p>
<p>Arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure in which examination, and if possible, the treatment of damage in the joint is performed using an arthroscope, a small fibre optic camera. The camera is inserted into the joint through an incision of about 4 mm. Classically, arthroscopy is performed to look at, diagnose, and treat problems inside a joint.</p>
<p>Arthroplasty, on the other hand, is an open surgical procedure performed by an orthopaedic surgeon. It is a replacement surgery performed to restore normal motion and relieve pain in a diseased/disabled joint. Based on the need, either the entire knee (all three parts) are replaced as in total knee replacement, or only the affected compartment of the knee is removed and replaced with artificial components as in partial knee replacement. Replacement is usually advised only in severe end-stage disease.</p>
<p>“35 years ago, when I started my practice, both arthroscopic, as well as arthroplasty surgeries, were more of a novelty than the norm. In the late 1980s and early 90s, we would see fewer patients and operate even less! Maybe 100-150 patients underwent surgery annually. These numbers have gone up dramatically in the past two decades. Now, annually, about 2,000 knees are replaced, and a similar number of people undergo arthroscopic surgeries for sports or other knee-related injuries,” shares Dr Rajgopal.</p>
<p>He shares the example of the badminton legend Pullela Gopichand, recalling, “When the sporting world had all but written him off because of his knee injury, he came to me. I performed his surgery and supervised his rehabilitation. The results are there for all to see. He went on to win the All England Badminton Championship after his surgery and is India’s most successful badminton coach today.”</p>
<p>We have come a long way in orthopaedics with robots assisting in complex joint surgeries, precisely fitting implants, giving a second lease of life to our knees. But there’s one thing we must not forget—that nothing is as good as the joints that we were born with. Thus, keeping problems of the knee at bay must always be our primary goal.</p>
<p>To protect the knees, Dr Rajgopal shares the mantras:</p>
<p>Eat right</p>
<p>Although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis, certain nutrients like Omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin D have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease.Omega-3 fatty acids are known to reduce joint inflammation and can be found in certain plant and nut oils, including walnut, soybean, flaxseed and olive oil. Vitamin D supplements are known to decrease knee pain in osteoarthritis. Your body makes most of the Vitamin D it needs in response to sunlight. You may supplement it by including eggs, cheese, fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel and tuna, as well as through foods fortified with vitamin D such as soy milk and cereals.</p>

<p>A study at the Johns Hopkins Medical School found that people who injured a knee in adolescence or young adulthood were at considerably increased risk of developing osteoarthritis in that knee, compared to those who had not suffered an injury. And, if you do sustain an injury to your knees, then get it treated in time to avoid further damage.</p>

<h3 id="better-water-management-systems-focus-on-domestic-species-of-flora-fauna">&ldquo;Better Water Management Systems, Focus on Domestic Species of Flora, Fauna&rdquo;</h3>

A reality check on India’s position in the environmental ranking suggests India fares 168th out of 180 countries in the 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) as per a research conducted by Yale and Columbia universities. Unpacking the research further, the analysis is done as per the degree of broad-based sustainability efforts made by the countries. India’s rank henceforth suggests a disproportionate amount of effort needs to be put in the given direction.</p>
<p>When it comes to effort, very few people stand out like Kalpana Ramesh, Founder, The Rainwater Project. She states: connecting people to water is her mission. Cities’ dependence on tankers and water cans always troubled her. She believes people should be taking responsibility for their water. When he started to dig deeper into the problem, she realized the solution is rainwater harvesting. Henceforth, the Rain Water Project came about which provides services relating to rainwater harvesting and other water solutions.</p>
<p>Kalpana also believes in water conservation, the government has an active role. She argues municipal water should be given reduced subsidies. Arguably, this could provide an incentive for people to adopt water conservation strategies for themselves. Gauri Sarin, Founder, Bhumijaa &amp; Living Without Medicine too argues that it is people like them who can put pressure on the government to have the priorities in order. She also asserted that observing great works being done at the ground level, it is conclusive that real transformation is possible. (Kalpana Ramesh&rsquo;s view on the impact of Covid-19 - it has caused people to connect to their various resources)</p>
<p>BW Businessworld recently organized BW Sustainability Dialogues virtual event where industry experts in the field of environment and sustainability discussed on how the country can move ahead towards making the living habitats more sustainable.</p>
<p>“A lot of people come to me and ask how they can be part of the sustainability movement. This has kept me going despite all the challenges faced on the way,” said Kapil Madawewala, Founder &amp; CEO, Edible Routes. Founded in 2015, The Edible Routes has been helping more and more people grow their own food. Madawewala also informed of the mindset change happening in people towards the farmers. “When people try to grow something and realize how difficult it is, they have greater respect for the farmers,” Madawewala said. Similarly, another great initiative The Prodigal Farms, started back in November 2016, is impacting local communities profoundly. The company practices natural farming techniques using cow-centric traditional farm inputs to grow local and seasonal produce and share it with the local communities. The Co-Founder of The Prodigal Farm Neha Bhatia enlightened that there was a missing dialogue between the real issues faced by the farmers and what is needed by the urban communities.</p>
<p>Further, as argued by many experts, there needs a different perspective on how we view our domestic species. Aparna Rajgopal, Founder, Beejom brought to notice that we rarely talk about the usefulness of our domestic species of flora and fauna. Rajgopal thinks a majority of our issues stem from the factor farming systems, which are not great systems for production. The lawyer turned farmer has been running an animal sanctuary and a sustainable farm since 2014.</p>
<p>Arguably, in order to address the issues faced by the country at a broader level, there needs to be proper classification and analysis of these issues. Patanjali Jha, Pr. Chief Commissioner of Income Tax, Karnataka &amp; Goa Region &amp; Founder, Vanya Natural strongly believes in building awareness about the pitfalls of conventional, chemical fertilizer-aided farming. According to his analysis: there are five major problems faced by the people in the country: Cancer, Temperature, Soil, Water, and Unemployment. Arguably, it is critical to address each one of them individually and develop a strategy to mitigate the critical issues – to further India’s movement towards a better sustainable future.
