<p>Elvis Presley’s grandson Benjamin Keough has died, a representative for his mother, Lisa Marie Presley, said. He was 27.</p>
<p>Keough died in Calabasas, California, Roger Widynowski told CNN Sunday.</p>
<p>The representative said he did not have further details on the circumstances of Keough’s death, including the date.</p>
<p>Presley is “entirely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated,” Widynowski said in a statement, “but trying to stay strong for her 11 year old twins and her oldest daughter Riley.”</p>
<p>“She adored that boy. He was the love of her life,” Widynowski said.</p>
<p>Keough’s father was the musician Danny Keough.</p>
<p>Keough had a striking resemblance to his singer/actor grandfather. Priscilla Presley was his maternal grandmother.

Benamin Keough, the son of Lisa Marie Presley and grandson of rock legend Elvis Presley, has died. He was 27.</p>
<p>Presley’s representative, Roger Widynowski, said in a statement Sunday to the Associated Press that she was “heartbroken” after learning about the death of her son.</p>
<p>TMZ reports that Keough died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday morning in Calabasas. The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office confirmed that Keough was the man found by deputies in the 24800 block of Alexandra Court but did not say how he died.</p>
<p>“She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter, Riley [Keough],” Widynowski said in the statement. “She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Presley had Keough and Riley, now 31, with former husband Danny Keough. She had the twins from another marriage.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department initially reported that Keough’s body was found in the street and characterized the death as a possible homicide.</p>
<p>Nancy Sinatra tweeted her condolences to Presley. “I have known you since before your mama gave birth to you,” she wrote, “never dreaming you would have pain like this in your life. I’m so very sorry.”</p>

<p>The Associated Press and CNSNews contributed to this report.

<p><img src="https://bnonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/8212012LisaMariePresleyBenjaminKeough.jpg" alt="img">
Benjamin Keough, the son of singer-songwriter Lisa Marie Presley and the grandson of Elvis Presley, was found dead Sunday in an apparent suicide in Southern California, officials say. He was 27 years old.</p>
<p>Benjamin was found on early Sunday morning in the 24800 block of Alexandra Court in Calabasas, a city in Los Angeles County. He suffered a single gunshot wound to the upper torso and was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
<p>“[Lisa] is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter, Riley,” her representative said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said detectives are investigating Sunday’s shooting.</p>
<p>Benjamin, who resembled his grandfather, was born on October 21, 1992, during Lisa’s first marriage to musician Danny Keough. It was reported in 2009 that he scored a $5 million record deal to make up to five albums, but they were never released.</p>
<p>Other than that, Benjamin kept a low profile throughout his life and little was known about him despite his famous family, which included not only Elvis and Priscilla Presley but also Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage through Lisa’s second and third marriages. His sister is actress Riley Keough.</p>
