Ricky Gervais is mourning the loss of a furry friend.

The comedian shared Tuesday that his beloved cat, Ollie, has died a few months shy of her 17th birthday.

YOUTUBE Ricky Gervais was first gifted Ollie on TV in 2003. This week, he's had to farewell his furry friend.

"Just had to say goodbye to the sweetest little soul I've ever known," Gervais tweeted, along with two photos of Ollie.

Gervais, 58, had often shared photos of the feline on his social media pages, and a separate Twitter account with the handle @myleftfang was devoted entirely to Ollie.

On Monday, the British comic — and creator and star of the original The Office — tweeted a picture of Ollie laying on the ground and wrote, "Absolutely kippered. Sweet dreams."

Gervais' longtime girlfriend, author Jane Fallon, also paid homage to Ollie on Tuesday.

"My smart, funny, feisty, beautiful sidekick of the last 16 & a half years @myleftfang has passed away after a sudden down turn in her health at the weekend," Fallon tweeted. My heart is broken in two. I have no idea what I'm going to do without her by my side."

Following Tuesday's announcement, Gervais thanked his followers for all of their "lovely tributes."

"I can't quite bring myself to respond at the moment, but your kindness is very much appreciated," he tweeted.
