<p>AUSTIN (KXAN) – Nearly all the people arrested during protests over the weekend — and looting sprees that occurred nearby — were in their 20s or teens, according to booking records reviewed by KXAN.</p>
<p>KXAN’s analysis found more than 60 people charged with crimes possibly related to the protests. Of those, just six were over the age of 30. Police arrested 36 people in their 20s, as well as 20 teenagers.</p>
<p>The Austin Police Department provided the records of the individuals, and KXAN cross-referenced those with information from county booking files.</p>
<p>On Monday, APD said its officers made roughly two dozen protest-related arrests in the previous 24 hours on charges including “burglary of buildings, interference with public duties, theft of property, theft of firearm, graffiti, engaging in organized crime, assault and participating in a riot,” according to a department tweet.</p>
<p>The Austin protests erupted in response to recent incidents of black men dying while being arrested. George Floyd, a 46-year-old Houston native, died May 25 in Minneapolis, while being arrested by an officer who knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Another man, 42-year-old Michael Ramos, had no firearm when he was shot on April 24 in a car in southeast Austin during an arrest.</p>
<p>The protests swept through downtown on Saturday and Sunday. While the protests were mostly peaceful, there were some clashes with officers. Protesters moved several times onto Interstate-35, blocking traffic. There were also instances of looting and several businesses inside and outside of downtown damaged.</p>
<p>Local criminal defense attorney Tycha Kimbrough told KXAN she would represent people pro bono that were charged with crimes while protesting peacefully.</p>
<p>“I felt like it is my duty to give back to people who are out there protesting,” Kimbrough said in a previous interview with KXAN’s Erin Cargile. “We are just fed up and tired of the continued injustices that black people and brown people often face.”</p>
<p>Protest surveillance</p>
<p>Arrest affidavits and remarks from one top law enforcement official show how police have monitored the protests for illegal activity.</p>
<p>APD officers said they caught a 25-year-old man on an overhead HALO camera appearing to mix a Molotov cocktail during a protest outside the department’s headquarters at Eighth Street and I-35 on Saturday. The man was charged with possession or manufacture of a prohibited weapon.</p>
<p>HALO cameras, short for High Activity Location Observation, are perched strategically around downtown, with many on Sixth Street where looters broke windows and stole merchandise from businesses, including Private Stock Premium Boutique and Lone Star Souvenir &amp; Food Mart over the weekend.</p>
<p>Steve McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said Tuesday his agents have been placed within the protests to watch for criminal behavior.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind advertising this. We do have special agents embedded trying to identify criminals that are leveraging these or using this as an opportunity — exploiting these demonstrations,” McCraw said. “We’re going to identify them, and we already have identified some of them and we will be arresting them, but not at this particular moment.”</p>
<p>McCraw said most of the people at the protests were peaceful, and his department should allow them to peacefully protest. He also said there are individuals coming from outside the state and using the protests as an opportunity to incite violence.</p>
<p>KXAN checked the backgrounds of numerous individuals charged with participating in a riot and all except one, who could not be located using standard background searches, were from Austin or nearby cities.</p>
<p>KXAN only found one woman, who was arrested for obstructing a highway, who gave police an address from outside the state in Chicago.

<h3 id="lawmakers-say-puff-bar-used-pandemic-to-market-to-teens">&ldquo;Lawmakers Say Puff Bar Used Pandemic to Market to Teens&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/01/science/01PUFFBAR1/01PUFFBAR1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
House lawmakers asked the Food and Drug Administration this week to ban Puff Bar, the fast-growing e-cigarette that has quickly replaced Juul as the vape of choice among young people.</p>
<p>The disposable devices come in more than 20 flavors, among them piña colada, pink lemonade, watermelon and a mysterious blend called O.M.G. Although the Trump administration banned fruit, mint and dessert flavors in refillable cartridge-based e-cigarettes like Juul earlier this year, it carved out an exemption for brands that are used once and thrown away.</p>
<p>Puff Bar, which launched last year, has been the key beneficiary of the loophole. It has built on its early success by adding a line of flavor pods called Puff Krush that are compatible with the Juul device, upsetting that company, whose own business has sunk since it restricted sales in the United States to tobacco and menthol varieties last fall. Based on data used only for tracked channels, which include convenience stores and some other retailers but not online sales or vape shops, Puff Bar sales have consistently been over $3 million a week since April, with volumes now over 300,000 sticks per week.</p>
<p>“Puff Bar is quickly becoming the new Juul,” Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, wrote in a letter to the F.D.A. on Monday. Mr. Krishnamoorthi, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, accused the e-cigarette company of exploiting the coronavirus to sell its products to schoolchildren.

<h3 id="teens-at-dallas-cafe-make-meal-kits-for-needy-amid-covid-19">&ldquo;Teens at Dallas cafe make meal kits for needy amid COVID-19&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Virus_Outbreak_One_Good_Thing_Dallas_Restaurateur_83533.jpg" alt="img">
DALLAS (AP) — Chef Chad Houser opened his downtown Dallas restaurant five years ago to help give teens coming out…</p>
<p>DALLAS (AP) — Chef Chad Houser opened his downtown Dallas restaurant five years ago to help give teens coming out of juvenile detention stability, and a push toward success.</p>
<p>When the coronavirus pandemic threatened that mission, he found a way to not only keep the teens working — and also give them a chance to help others.</p>
<p>“Our kids need us to begin with,” Houser said, “but they need us even more now.”</p>
<p>Within a week of Cafe Momentum closing to dining in March because of the pandemic, the teens who normally cycle through every job at the upscale restaurant — from cooking to dishwashing to busing tables to serving to hosting — had started building meal kits for needy families. Houser scrambled to raise funds so he could keep paying the teens and keep them engaged in the nonprofit’s program that offers everything from counseling to education.</p>
<p>De’Monica Dean, 19, said thinking about the families getting the boxes she packs with everything from cans of soup to fresh vegetables and fruits motivates her each morning.</p>
<p>“That’s my everyday wake-up. It’s like, do you want to get up today? OK, we know a family has to eat, so let’s get up,” Dean said.</p>
<p>Sais Daniel, the cafe’s curriculum coordinator, helps teach the teens skills ranging from restaurant work to life skills like how to create a resume. They’re also learning the joys of helping others.</p>
<p>“Sometimes they get lost in how small their world is, but being able to sit down and pack boxes, they’re like: ‘Man, I’m able to see someone else struggling and I’m a blessing to them. I’m able to help them,’” Daniel said.</p>
<p>Cafe Momentum has been delivering 1,550 meal kits a week to families in the area through various groups. Most of the kits, which include four meals for a family of four, are being distributed in the Richardson Independent School District.</p>
<p>Tabitha Branum, the district’s deputy superintendent, said the partnership with Cafe Momentum is “game changing” for their community, noting that over half of the district’s students qualify for free and reduced lunches.</p>
<p>She said that with school closed, the district is able to provide breakfasts and lunches during the week though a state program, but Cafe Momentum lets them also cover weekends.</p>
<p>As Texas reopens, Gov. Greg Abbott is allowing restaurants to welcome a limited number of diners inside after being restricted to takeout orders. But for now, Cafe Momentum — a restaurant that served entrees like sweet tea-brined pork chops and coffee-rubbed steak in its sleek dining area — will stick with providing meal kits.</p>
<p>Houser said he has raised enough money to keep making the kits through June. He’s not sure of the next move, but he said that when it’s safe and financially viable, the restaurant and catering business will resume.</p>
<p>The teens are ready to get back to preparing meals and serving guests. “They miss all the pats on the back and hugs that they get from guests,” he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, 18-year-old Anthony Aleman said preparing kits feels good, as does knowing he still has a steady paycheck from Cafe Momentum.</p>
<p>“They got my back,” Aleman said.</p>

<h3 id="tear-gassing-of-teens-in-don-dale-youth-detention-centre-was-unlawful-high-court-rules">&ldquo;Tear-gassing of teens in Don Dale Youth Detention Centre was unlawful, High Court rules&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/12315250-16x9-large.jpg?v=2" alt="img">
The High Court has found the tear-gassing of four teenagers in Darwin&rsquo;s Don Dale Youth Detention Centre was unlawful.</p>
<p>Key points: The four teenagers were tear-gassed while in NT youth detention in 2014</p>
<p>The four teenagers were tear-gassed while in NT youth detention in 2014 The High Court found the teenagers were entitled to damages</p>
<p>The High Court found the teenagers were entitled to damages It found exemptions allowing for the use of tear gas in adult prisons did not apply in the youth detention centre</p>
<p>Lawyers for the teenagers had appealed against lower-court findings that adult prison officers were authorised to use the gas during a night of unrest in August 2014.</p>
<p>In a majority ruling, the High Court found exemptions allowing the guards&rsquo; use of the gas, which is classified as a prohibited weapon, did not apply in the youth detention centre.</p>
<p>The decision opens the way for the teenagers to claim damages for battery.</p>
<p>The group had previously been awarded limited damages for some aspects of their treatment on the night, including the use of spit-hoods and leg shackles.</p>
<p>But Northern Territory Supreme Court Judge Judith Kelly ruled that the tear-gassing was reasonable and necessary.</p>
<p>The High Court today sent the matter back to the Northern Territory Supreme Court for another judge to assess what damages should be awarded.</p>
<p>It has also ordered that the Northern Territory cover the legal costs of the detainees, who were represented by high-profile barrister Bret Walker SC.</p>
<p>The four detainees, who were aged between 15 and 17 at the time of the incident, were locked in their cells when tear gas was sprayed into a surrounding enclosed area to subdue another detainee who had escaped his cell.</p>
<p>The tear gas was sprayed by prison guards called in from the nearby adult jail to respond to the disturbance.</p>
<p>High Court Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justice Patrick Keane wrote that was not allowed under the laws of the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no part of a prison officer&rsquo;s function to use a weapon in a youth detention centre,&rdquo; they wrote.</p>
<p>Footage of the tear-gassing was shown in a Four Corners expose that sparked a royal commission into the Northern Territory&rsquo;s youth justice system.</p>
<p>In 2017 the royal commission&rsquo;s report recommended that the use of tear gas in youth prisons be banned.

Maya began with four friends. Now, they&rsquo;ve got more than 60 volunteers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really enthusiastic about the response we&rsquo;ve received from our volunteers because there&rsquo;s so much of an effort from them,&rdquo; said volunteer Andrea Thomas of Albany. &ldquo;I can feel the energy that they want to give out into the community by doing these deliveries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a little talk with our customer because we still want to have a personal connection with them especially during this crisis,&rdquo; said Itzel Garcia of Niskayuna.</p>
<p>Seniors call or email to sign up and give their grocery list.</p>
<p>The teens go shopping with an adult and make a delivery, calling on their way so the client can leave a check.</p>
<p>They also work with the Teresian House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just do deliveries,&rdquo; said volunteer Rajani Nimma. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll send us requests of specific items specific people want and we&rsquo;ll do deliveries for that. If they have any events going on, we&rsquo;ll do deliveries for that as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We meet with our founders in Maryland every week and then we meet with our volunteers in New York every two weeks,&rdquo; said volunteer Amira Salem of Rexford.</p>
<p>They even try to clean the items upon delivery, wiping down groceries or using a UV wand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want people to know that we are trying our best to help as many seniors out as possible with grocery deliveries and let them know that they are not alone during this pandemic. That we are here to help them,&rdquo; said group founder Maya Dhinesh of Niskayuna.</p>
<p>Andy Foster also gets his groceries through Instacart or with the help of neighbors, but he says Teens Helping Seniors makes life easier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; said Foster. &ldquo;It does two things: gets them involved in the community and it&rsquo;s a genuine service. It really is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are so many volunteers, they wish that more people would take advantage of the service. They are eager to help.</p>

This is one in a series of profiles showcasing some of Harvard’s stellar graduates.</p>
<p>When Tom Osborn arrived at Harvard as a first-year from Kenya, he’d already been named one of Forbes Magazine’s top 30 under 30 Social Entrepreneurs for a startup he’d launched back home.</p>
<p>A year later, personal events and a couple of classes had spurred Osborn to change his concentration from economics to psychology. As he graduates this spring, he’s already developed a successful mental health intervention for teens in Kenya called Shamiri (Swahili for “thrive”).</p>
<p>“I grew up in a small farming village where the emphasis was on everyone doing something to help the community and each other,” he said.</p>
<p>Osborn did this in a big way in high school when he founded a company that provides a clean fuel alternative for cookstoves, a common mode of preparing food in Africa, after his mother had fallen ill with a respiratory infection caused by burning wood particles.</p>
<p>Osborn reached out to David Sengeh ’10, whose organization, Global Minimum, supports young African innovators. Through this organization, Osborn connected with engineers from MIT who helped him and two high school friends launch GreenChar, which transforms sugar cane waste from village farms into a clean burning fuel.</p>
<p>“I came to Harvard with an open mind as it’s a place to experiment and try new things, and I tried whatever I possibly could.” — Tom Osborn &lsquo;20</p>
<p>Around the end of Osborn’s first year at Harvard, his brother, who had served in peacekeeping efforts in Ethiopia and Somalia, was experiencing emotional difficulties. It got Osborn thinking about ways to increase mental health awareness in Kenya.</p>
<p>Then two classes Osborn took sophomore year changed his perspective about how he might make a difference in his home country: “Science of Living Systems 20,” the introductory psychology class taught by Dan Gilbert, and Doris Sommer’s “Contemporary Developing Countries: Entrepreneurial Solutions to Intractable Problems.”</p>
<p>Osborn reached out to Professor John Weisz’s Laboratory for Youth Mental Health, seeking expert help for building evidence-based mental health interventions.</p>
<p>The resulting Shamiri project envisioned a group therapy model for high school students that would allow for dialogue and emotional awareness.</p>
<p>Supported with research grants from the Center for African Studies and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Osborn launched the pilot program during the summer of his sophomore year, in Kibera, a slum in Nairobi. His personal experience in the public school system in Kenya helped him gain buy-in from the local community. He returned the following summer to scale up the project tenfold.</p>
<p>Osborn said that teachers and parents were elated with the results: higher grades and declines in student depression and anxiety. He has since founded the nonprofit Shamiri Institute to continue interventions in East Africa.</p>
<p>While Osborn was busy making a difference in communities from his home country, he also found time to get involved at Harvard, hosting a stand-up comedy event in the Eliot Grille, mentoring international students, leading the Africa Business and Investment Club, serving on the arts editorial board for the Harvard Advocate, and even DJing some events on campus.</p>
<p>“I came to Harvard with an open mind as it’s a place to experiment and try new things, and I tried whatever I possibly could,” he said.</p>
<p>Osborn is mulling graduate school in the near future, but also continues to work on lifting at-risk youths through the Shamiri Institute.
