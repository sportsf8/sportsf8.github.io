<p>After six seasons, Viola Davis‚Äô Emmy-Award winning portrayal of the brilliant yet sometimes deceitful lawyer in How to Get Away With Murder, Annalise Keating, came to an end. In an interview, the actress shared the main thing she wanted for her character to find before death.</p>
<p>Viola Davis as Annalise Keating | Mitch Haaseth</p>
<p>Annalise Keating and her relationships</p>
<p>While a student at Harvard Law, Annalise Harkness met and began dating Eve Rothlo (Famke Janssen). However, the two broke up after Annalise fell for her therapist, Sam Keating (Tom Verica).</p>
<p>They later married, and she became a successful yet ruthless defense attorney. Later, Annalise pursued a career teaching at Middleton Law, where she chose a few students annually at her firm.</p>
<p>In 2014, Wes Gibbins (Alfred Enoch), a Keating 5 member, killed her abusive and cheating husband. Due to her history with Wes, she chose him and covered up his murder, and blamed it on Nate Lahey (Billy Brown), a police officer she was having an affair with at the time.</p>

<p>While Annalise didn‚Äôt tell Eve the truth, she convinced her ex-girlfriend to take the case. After she won, the two nearly rekindled their romance, but Eve had a girlfriend ready to move in with her.</p>
<p>In the final season, Annalise had a short-lived relationship with Caplan &amp; Gold attorney Robert Hsieh (Cas Anvar) before another C&amp;G lawyer Tegan Price (Amirah Vann) revealed her true romantic feelings for the former professor.</p>
<p>Although Annalise rejected her at the time, many believe the two ended up together.</p>
<p>Did Annalise Keating end up with Eve Rothlo or Tegan Price?</p>
<p>At Annalise‚Äôs funeral, Eve gave a beautiful eulogy for her ex-girlfriend while a series of flash-forward clips played. In one, it showed Annalise joyfully dancing with Tegan before showing the former professor holding hands with several different people.</p>

<p>RELATED: ‚ÄòHow to Get Away With Murder‚Äô: Did Annalise Keating End up With Tegan or Eve? Fans Are Divided</p>
<p>Although it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed, many fans believe she ended her life with Tegan, but the C&amp;G lawyer died of old age before her. Others think the hand belonged to Eve and that she rekindled her romance with her first love after revealing her bisexuality to the jury and turning down Tegan.</p>
<p>What Viola Davis wanted for Annalise Keating</p>
<p>In a Good Morning, America interview taken as the How to Get Away with Murder cast filmed their series finale; actress Viola Davis noted she wanted her character to ‚Äúfind love‚Äù and end up with ‚Äúsomeone who really loved her.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Annalise was a child, her uncle raped her, resulting in a vulnerability that her therapist Sam Keating zeroed in on. In the final season, it‚Äôs revealed that Sam had an incestual relationship with his sister that resulted in a child.</p>
<p>Therefore, Annalise believes he targeted women like her and Bonnie because he went through a similar situation. The only true relationship she seemingly had was with Eve, which partly ended because Annalise wasn‚Äôt comfortable with her sexuality.</p>

<p>Additionally, Annalise spent nearly her entire life helping everyone else. Therefore, fans wanted someone to finally be there for her, and romantically end up with her number one cheerleader, Tegan.</p>
<p>Instead, the creator left the ending ambiguous, so those who wanted Annalise to get back with Eve also had their happy ending. Ultimately, it doesn‚Äôt matter who Annalise ended up with; the point was that she lived a long, happy life and finally found love.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn‚Äôt clearly defined, Davis did get what she wanted for her character as Annalise died of old age and was truly happy with whoever she chose.

<p>The ABC drama airs its series finale Thursday night, bringing Annalise Keating&rsquo;s (Viola Davis) story to a close.

<p>&ldquo;Love you @PeteNowalk. Love that you wrote boldly, fearlessly without constriction. For the disabled, LGBTQ, people of color, women of a certain age who have ALWAYS been on the periphery, always being written for tentatively&hellip;.we THANK YOU from the bottom of our hearts!!&rdquo; Davis wrote. &ldquo;You are an innovator. &lsquo;There is only one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come.&rsquo; #HTGAWM ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ü§úüèøü§úüèø.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is everything that you need to sew it up in your heart, in your mind,&rdquo; she said of the show&rsquo;s swan song. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost a love song that [creator and executive producer Peter Nowalk] wrote.

From vintage windup robots to murder gloves, here&rsquo;s what the stars are keeping for themselves as the series ends.</p>
<p>How to Get Away With Murder cast reveal the mementos they&rsquo;re keeping from set</p>
<p>How to Get Away With Murder type TV Show network ABC genre Crime</p>
<p>Mystery Where to watch Close Streaming Options</p>
<p>After six seasons, How to Get Away With Murder is drawing to a twisty close.</p>
<p>The show leaves a legacy of shocking reveals and a startling body count, but for its cast, it also leaves behind more tangible items as part of its legacy. Catching up with the cast during their final days on set, they were all plotting ‚Äî not how to get away with murder, of course, but how to keep a memento or two from their time on the ABC drama.</p>
<p>Star Viola Davis earned an Emmy for playing formidable defense attorney Annalise Keating, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from trying to get her hands on any hardware they might share with her. &ldquo;Everything they give me I‚Äôm gonna keep. Every coat, every dress, every pair of shoes,&rdquo; she told EW. &ldquo;I wish I could take my trailer but that‚Äôs not going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the Keating Four kept a token from the house they shared as roommates on the series. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already stolen a couple keepsakes from the Keating Four house. I&rsquo;ve been planning ahead so I&rsquo;ve been stealing stuff all season,&rdquo; Jack Falahee, who played Connor Walsh, joked. &ldquo;There might be continuity errors, which is my fault. [When we] wrapped the Keating Four house, [they] said that if we wanted to take a small token, we could. I had been slowly stealing these little vintage windup robots that are on the bookshelf. So then all of us went and got them. Now we all have little Keating Four robots in our houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Falahee&rsquo;s onscreen partner Conrad Ricamora took a similarly nostalgic item from the house their characters shared as a couple. &ldquo;For some reason Colliver always had dog statues wherever they lived,&rdquo; Ricamora said, using the popular couple name for Connor and Oliver. &ldquo;I took two of the little dog statues that probably the audience could never see. But from day one, they were always in my apartment and then in the K4 house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karla Souza, who has had a daughter in the time since starting on the show as fierce law student Laurel Castillo, took a more practical approach to items, gathering props from her onscreen son Christopher&rsquo;s nursery. &ldquo;I went into the Keating Four house, and I took some things for my daughter,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Christopher has a little ukulele and then some counting, wood vintage games and then this robot that you would not have seen on the show, but I knew that they were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still managed to nab one piece from her own character&rsquo;s collection though. &ldquo;Laurel&rsquo;s got some awesome Alexander McQueen boots that I&rsquo;ve used like all of the seasons and I feel like they&rsquo;re so emblematic. Shoes are so important in terms of character and that&rsquo;s something else that I want to take,&rdquo; she mused.</p>
<p>Rome Flynn, who joined in season 5 as Gabriel, the secret son of Sam Keating, also opted for wardrobe items for his collection. &ldquo;I‚Äôll keep some jackets,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It‚Äôs really hard to find jackets that fit and this wardrobe department has been amazing with bringing everything together for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some members of the cast were more sentimental than others. Aja Naomi King, who portrayed Michaela, said she might take a few wardrobe items as tokens, but for the most part, she&rsquo;ll just watch the show if she ever finds herself feeling wistful.</p>

<p>Charlie Weber, the man behind sometimes hitman Frank Delfino, opted for a more sinister costume piece. &ldquo;The one thing I need to take with me is Frank‚Äôs gloves. His murder gloves,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That‚Äôs the one thing I have to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Tom Verica, frequent guest star as murder victim number one, Sam Keating, has even more gruesome items in his collection.&ldquo;I have one of the puddles of blood that I spent most of the first season laying on the ground [with],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Laying in blood, some of it was real and some of it was liquid and there&rsquo;s this one small plastic puddle. I did keep that because I spent so much time with that puddle.&rdquo; Verica also has a framed version of the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; Sam Keating poster that went around when his body disappeared.</p>

<p>The majority of the cast opted for wardrobe items or small props, and while Liza Weil did keep some of Bonnie&rsquo;s bright, cheery suits, she also went big, bringing home a piece of artwork from her character&rsquo;s home. &ldquo;There is a painting in Bonnie&rsquo;s house that I really love,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I just find it this haunting image; it makes me think so much of Bonnie. I&rsquo;m going to try to photograph it and print it on canvas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How to Get Away With Murder concludes its six-season run on Thursday at 10 p.m. on ABC.</p>

<h3 id="the-how-to-get-away-with-murder-cast-who-are-the-hottest-actors">&ldquo;The ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äô cast: Who are the hottest actors?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://filmdaily.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/murder-lede.jpg" alt="img">

<p>The ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äô cast: Who are the hottest actors?</p>
<p>After six long, successful seasons, ABC‚Äôs legal thriller series How to Get Away with Murder recently concluded. Following the story of a sharp, criminal defense lawyer and professor and her squad of prodigious law students, How to Get Away with Murder has given us endless thrills &amp; intrigue over the years.</p>
<p>The series showcases the careers of many promising actors who have delighted us with their amazing performances. Now that the series is over, take a look at some of the actors who really caught our eye (and not just because of their superb acting skills.)</p>
<p>Aja Naomi King (Michaela)</p>
<p>Aja‚Äôs character, Michaela, is definitely the Hermoine Granger of the Keating Five. Always the one raising her hand and vying for the professor‚Äôs approval, Michaela is the familiar overachiever that we can all root for.</p>
<p>With her beautiful dark hair and eyes, Aja plays the bright Michaela with elegance. Graduating from Yale School of Drama, Aja has beauty &amp; brains that make her the full package.</p>
<p>Alfred Enoch (Wes)</p>
<p>Speaking of Hermoine Granger, do you recognize this Hogwarts student? Alfred Enoch who plays Wes in How to Get Away with Murder, also plays Dean Thomas in the Harry Potter series. An aspiring student in both, Alfred is definitely the kind of classmate crush anyone could have.</p>
<p>With that boyish charm and bewitching smile, Alfred is definitely one of the biggest heartthrobs on How to Get Away with Murder. We were all crushed when his character Wes died ‚Äì mostly because we wouldn‚Äôt be able to see his beautiful face on the show anymore.</p>
<p>Jack Falahee (Connor)</p>
<p>Jack Falahee plays the sexy law student Connor in How to Get Away with Murder. Always showing off his intelligence &amp; loyalty, Connor will do anything for his professor (no matter how shifty the deed may be.)</p>
<p>Jack has that mysterious bad boy look that is extremely irresistible. If you‚Äôre dying to see more of Jack, he also plays Frank Stringfellow on the PBS historical drama Mercy Street.</p>
<p>Liza Weil (Bonnie)</p>
<p>Debuting in Gilmore Girls as Paris Geller, Liza Weil has always had that intense, erudite look down. Always dressed professionally, Liza‚Äôs How to Get Away with Murder character Bonnie is visually and mentally sharp. An extremely hard-worker, Bonnie is extraordinarily reliable and helpful.</p>
<p>Liza Weil‚Äôs characters always have that confident, take-charge attitude that makes her a total bombshell. Plus, no one can rock a pixie cut like Liza Weil. She even looks amazing when she‚Äôs covered in blood.</p>
<p>Karla Souza (Laurel)</p>
<p>Karla is the lovely actor who plays Laurel, a quiet &amp; passionate student who has hidden talents. Killing us with those sharp eyebrows and emerald eyes, Karla is gem up on the screen. Her beauty has a kind of Brook Sheild-Esque grace.</p>
<p>Beyond her role in How to Get Away with Murder, Karla has been in a number of other productions like The Noble Family and Instructions not Included.</p>
<p>Viola Davis (Annalise)</p>
<p>Viola Davis plays Annalise Keating, the star of How to Get Away with Murder. A fantastic lawyer &amp; criminal law professor, Annalise is the powerhouse of the show. All of her students respect her ‚Äì and for a good reason ‚Äì she‚Äôs the best of the best.</p>
<p>Viola has to be on this list because she‚Äôs damn gorgeous. Even though she‚Äôs not the youngest cast member, she‚Äôs still hot and no one can deny it. Viola is a major star for a reason ‚Äì she‚Äôs wonderfully talented &amp; pretty dang easy on the eyes too.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll miss seeing her killing it in How to Get Away with Murder but she has a long career ahead of her (and a compendium of marvelous performances already!)

<h3 id="emmy-spotlight-viola-davis-stunning-turn-in-how-to-get-away-with-murders-series-finale-is-to-die-for">&ldquo;Emmy spotlight: Viola Davis‚Äô stunning turn in ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äôs‚Äô series finale is to die for&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/violadavis.jpg" alt="img">
Viola Davis has accrued four Emmy nominations in Best Drama Actress (2015-17, ‚Äô19) for her portrayal of Annalise Keating on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow to Get Away With Murder‚Äù ‚Äî of which her first translated into a win ‚Äî and one in Best Drama Guest Actress (2018) for bringing Annalise to ‚ÄúScandal.‚Äù On May 14, ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù ended its six-season run with ‚ÄúStay‚Äù ‚Äî or as I prefer to call it, the episode that will help Davis get away with her sixth Emmy bid.</p>
<p>Since the finale, Davis has moved up from 10th to seventh place in our combined odds, where, as of this writing, she trails Olivia Colman (‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äù), Laura Linney (‚ÄúOzark‚Äù), Jennifer Aniston (‚ÄúThe Morning Show‚Äù), Jodie Comer (‚ÄúKilling Eve‚Äù), Elisabeth Moss (‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale‚Äù) and Nicole Kidman (‚ÄúBig Little Lies‚Äù). Among those forecasting a nomination are Gold Derby editors Chris Beachum, Marcus James Dixon and Zach Laws; Emmy experts Thelma Adams (Gold Derby), Tim Gray (Variety) Lynette Rice (Entertainment Weekly) and Robert Rorke; and seven of our top 24 users.</p>
<p>The finale centers on the conclusion to Annalise‚Äôs trial on multiple murder charges, including those of her former student Asher Millstone (Matt McGorry) and husband Sam Keating (Tom Verica). Before Annalise gives her closing argument, she gets two pep talks from Nate (Billy Brown) and her mother, Ophelia (Cicely Tyson), which allow for moments of calm before the storm.</p>
<p>In the first season, Annalise frames Nate for Sam‚Äôs death to protect her students, but now when Nate has the chance to reciprocate, he takes the high road by testifying in Annalise‚Äôs favor and giving her Wes‚Äô (Alfred Enoch) confession letter, which would have been a liability to her trial. After years of tension between the once on-and-off couple, they make peace. For most of the scene, Davis is silently reacting to Brown, but with gratitude dawning on her face as Nate offers Annalise forgiveness, an act of kindness to which she isn‚Äôt accustomed. So much so that you instantly see excuses as to why she doesn‚Äôt deserve it begin to brew in her head, which Nate torches, telling her to take responsibility for how she ended up in this situation. Davis fuses these contrasting emotions into a single perfect tear that Annalise sheds as Nate is on his way out.</p>
<p>SEE I rest my case: ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äôs‚Äô Viola Davis could have the latest Emmy-winning closing argument [WATCH]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Annalise doesn‚Äôt know how to defend herself in court when she doesn‚Äôt even believe she‚Äôs worthy of such defense. But Ophelia has a few words for her daughter: What happens isn‚Äôt her decision but God‚Äôs, so she better get it together and fulfill her one duty: ‚Äúshow up.‚Äù This elicits another little-seen reaction from Annalise: vulnerability. She‚Äôs spent most of her life protecting and defending other people, so when she‚Äôs called on to defend herself, she wavers. Opposite Tyson, Davis‚Äôs eyes water, but she never breaks into full sobbing. Annalise is caught between a rock and a hard place, but is well aware that she has to keep it together, not just for her mother but for herself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve worn a mask every day of my life [‚Ä¶] all to create a version of myself that the world would accept. But I‚Äôm done.‚Äù In her closing argument, Annalise takes Nate‚Äôs words to heart and confesses her true faults and crimes to the court. And because her mask is off, she admits to, yes, being a bad person (having done many unvirtuous things), but a murderer she is not. She concludes: ‚ÄúWho I am is a 53-year-old woman from Memphis, Tennessee, named Anna Mae Harkness. I am ambitious, black, bisexual, angry, sad, strong, sensitive, scared, fierce, talented, exhausted ‚Äî and I am at your mercy.‚Äù</p>
<p>As Annalise, Davis has given many gigantic courtroom speeches, either as a lawyer burning witnesses at the stake or vice versa, but, ironically, never before in such a calm, collected manner as in her closing argument. After years of constant self-blame and self-loathing, Annalise reflects on the mistakes she made, but also on the ones she didn‚Äôt make, and in doing so, finds a way to be at peace with herself. The visceral effect of her character development might not have been as palpable had Davis delivered the speech in a more flamboyant fashion. At the same time, Annalise‚Äôs words are amplified because they express not only her own hardships, but those of marginalized groups, including African-Americans and the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>SEE Will Viola Davis and Cicely Tyson bid goodbye with Emmy noms for ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äôs‚Äô final season?</p>
<p>It isn‚Äôt just Annalise‚Äôs arc that comes full circle here. Davis has discussed how mortified she was when she first slipped into Annalise‚Äôs shoes. Not only because she was playing a sexualized, complicated and messy character of her age, color and physique, but because she was concerned that few people would believe her in this role, with her wig, high heels and fake eyelashes ‚Äî in other words, her character‚Äôs fa√ßade. She broke ground in Season 1‚Äôs ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get to Scooping,‚Äù in which Annalise takes off her wig, eyelashes and makeup before going to bed ‚Äî something we rarely see on the big and small screens ‚Äî revealing Davis‚Äô (and thus Annalise‚Äôs) true self. And here Annalise is, at the end of her journey, in her truest and most natural form, coming to terms with who she is below her surface.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the jury finds Annalise not guilty of all charges. But during a press conference on the courthouse steps afterwards, Frank (Charlie Weber) shoots Governor Birkhead (Laura Innes), and both he and Bonnie (Liza Weil) are killed in the crossfire to Annalise‚Äôs devastation. In a matter of minutes, Annalise loses two important people in her life. But after being put through the wringer one last time, the show‚Äôs final sequence reveals that she eventually dies of old age (and isn‚Äôt murdered) after living her life to the fullest. In her final scene, she walks down a beach, alone but at peace, and although it‚Äôs very brief, you can see all Annalise‚Äôs peaks and troughs because Davis wears them on her face, like she‚Äôs been through them all herself.</p>
<p>With this being the final season ‚Äî which concluded much later in the Emmy cycle than its preceding installments did ‚Äî Davis might be able to capitalize on goodwill from her peers. The first African-American to take home the award for Best Drama Actress, she only ever missed the lineup once for ‚ÄúMurder,‚Äù in 2018 for the fourth season, but that‚Äôs also when she snuck in for ‚ÄúScandal‚Äù in guest. She was able to return last year, which saw the show unexpectedly amass its most nominations for a single season thus far, with guest bids for Tyson and Glynn Turman. Since both Davis and Tyson had already been nominated for the show before, their inclusions weren‚Äôt all that surprising, but Turman ‚Äî a drama guest actor winner for ‚ÄúIn Treatment‚Äù (2008) ‚Äî was all the way down in 13th place in our odds. His bid might have been an indication that ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù was on voters‚Äô radar, and if it was last year, it‚Äôs probably on there this year as well.</p>
<p>Davis‚Äôs competition is stiff though. Many of 2018‚Äôs big players sat out last year‚Äôs cycle, but are back now. ‚ÄúThe Crown,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale‚Äù and ‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù are among those returnees with viable contenders in the lead actress race, all of whom currently place in the top 10 in our odds (‚ÄúWestworld‚Äôs‚Äù Evan Rachel Wood is in ninth). Apple TV+ is looking to secure two spots for rookie ‚ÄúThe Morning Show‚Äù with Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, the latter of whom also contends alongside Kidman for ‚ÄúBig Little Lies,‚Äù which competed as a limited series in 2017 (and racked up eight statuettes, including for Kidman), but is now considered a drama.</p>

<h3 id="emmy-spotlight-its-time-to-give-living-legend-cicely-tyson-her-due-for-how-to-get-away-with-murder">&ldquo;Emmy spotlight: It‚Äôs time to give living legend Cicely Tyson her due for ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äô&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cicelytyson.jpg" alt="img">
Cicely Tyson has already claimed three Emmys, two for ‚ÄúThe Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman‚Äù in 1974 (Best Movie/Mini Actress and Actress of the Year) and one for ‚ÄúOldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All‚Äù in 1994 (Best Movie/Mini Supporting Actress). But despite four Best Drama Guest Actress (2015, 2017-19) nominations for ‚ÄúHow to Get Away with Murder,‚Äù she has yet to triumph for her turn as Ophelia Harkness. Might she, at long last, bag one for the show‚Äôs sixth and final season?</p>
<p>A 15-time nominee, Tyson looks safe to scoop up her 16th career bid, currently topping our early combined odds. The only year she was left out for ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù was 2016 for its second installment ‚Äî but she was on the same ballot that year for ‚ÄúHouse of Cards.‚Äù Considering the latter netted eight acting citations that year, five of which were for guest actors, it‚Äôs probable that Tyson split her own vote. This is reinforced by the fact that she returned for ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù the following three years ‚Äî even when the show‚Äôs star Viola Davis was dropped from the Best Drama Actress category for the first time in 2018.</p>
<p>The last time Tyson was the frontrunner in our odds was on her first ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù bid in 2015, but she was beaten by ‚ÄúThe Americans‚Äô‚Äù Margo Martindale. Her most recent three go-arounds have coincided with ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale‚Äôs‚Äù domination in the category, with wins for Alexis Bledel in 2017, Samira Wiley in 2018 and Cherry Jones in 2019. Bledel and Jones are back in the running for ‚ÄúHandmaid‚Äôs‚Äù (Wiley has moved up to supporting), and are in second and fifth places in our odds, respectively. Rounding out the top six are Phylicia Rashad for ‚ÄúThis Is Us,‚Äù Jones for ‚ÄúSuccession,‚Äù and Julie Dretzin for ‚ÄúHandmaid‚Äôs.‚Äù</p>
<p>SEE I rest my case: ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äôs‚Äô Viola Davis could have the latest Emmy-winning closing argument [WATCH]</p>
<p>Tyson had a lot going for her on her first try ‚Äî ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù was a red-hot new show, and it‚Äôs the only year Davis won for it ‚Äî so her loss to Martindale, who was just in a few minutes of her submitted episode, is still rather surprising. But the legendary star could now capitalize on collective goodwill and ride an overdue narrative (for ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù specifically) to a win, boosted by the fact that it‚Äôs voters‚Äô last shot at rewarding her for this role. If she makes the lineup, she‚Äôd set a new record as the category‚Äôs most nominated actress with five bids, a title she currently shares with Shirley Knight, Martindale, Diana Rigg and Alfre Woodard. And if she wins, at 95, she would become the oldest winner in this category; if she doesn‚Äôt, she‚Äôd hold the unfortunate record for the most nominations without a win.</p>
<p>She faces stiff competition from ‚ÄúHandmaid‚Äôs,‚Äù which has never lost this category. She could have a leg up over, at least, Bledel and Jones since they‚Äôve already prevailed. Plus, if ‚ÄúHandmaid‚Äôs‚Äù runs this category (Clea DuVall also contends for it), the actresses risk splitting the vote. Tyson might then have to then duke it out with another overdue thespian, Rashad, who has four career bids and was the projected winner for ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù last year, but lost to Jones ‚Äî who, ironically, was also just in a few minutes of her episode.</p>
<p>In ‚ÄúMurder‚Äôs‚Äù sixth season, Tyson appeared in the 11th and final episodes, ‚ÄúThe Reckoning‚Äù and ‚ÄúStay,‚Äù respectively, of which she‚Äôs likely to select the former as her submission, given that she has significantly more screen time in it. Ophelia visits Annalise (Davis), who‚Äôs been put under house arrest after being accused of possessing false documentation and falsifying her passport. Ophelia unloads a handful of sassy one-liners that, by now, we‚Äôve certainly come to expect, during which Tyson continues to effortlessly channel her character‚Äôs wicked sense of humor and no-nonsense mentality.</p>
<p>For the very first time, Annalise reveals to her mother that she‚Äôs had relationships with women ‚Äî to be exact, Eve (Famke Janssen) ‚Äî at which Ophelia‚Äôs face contorts. This reaction isn‚Äôt driven by discrimination, but guilt ‚Äî an expression that quickly, but subtly, dawns on Tyson‚Äôs face. In a heart-to-heart with her daughter in bed, Ophelia expresses concern that Annalise‚Äôs interest in women might be an unfortunate result of her being raped by her uncle Clyde when she was a child. When Ophelia asks whether she loved Eve, Annalise answers in the affirmative (and says Eve loved her, too), to which Ophelia responds with a loving squeezing of her hands. This intimate interaction highlights Tyson‚Äôs warm, comforting presence, as well as her undeniable chemistry with her onscreen daughter.</p>
<p>SEE Emmy spotlight: Viola Davis‚Äô stunning turn in ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äôs‚Äô series finale is to die for</p>
<p>In a later scene, Ophelia refers to her absence during her daughter‚Äôs childhood as the main source of Annalise‚Äôs rage. Tyson‚Äôs raw delivery of ‚ÄúWhere was I?!‚Äù encapsulates the regret she feels for leaving Annalise at home with Clyde while she went off to work multiple jobs ‚Äî which Annalise reminds her that she only did to keep them afloat. But Ophelia fears that because Annalise has never felt properly protected, she now feels as though she has to rely solely on herself. She calls on her daughter to stop protecting the people around her and finally start protecting herself.</p>
<p>Tyson‚Äôs appearance in the series closer should only further propel her chances, as her brief presence is thoroughly felt. Annalise has been charged with multiple counts of murder, including that of her husband Sam (Tom Verica). Tyson shines in her scene opposite Davis, in which Annalise spells out her fear that she won‚Äôt be able to defend herself in court as she doesn‚Äôt consider herself worthy of such defense. Ophelia, concerned but more honest than ever before, tells her daughter it isn‚Äôt her decision to make, but God‚Äôs, so all she needs to do is fulfill her one duty: ‚Äúshow up.‚Äù In a final sequence, it‚Äôs revealed that Ophelia dies soon after, presumably of old age.</p>
<p>Concluding on May 14, ‚ÄúMurder‚Äù ended a season in the final month of eligibility for the first time (it usually ended in March), which could put it top of mind for Emmy voters. Last year, it managed to get away with three nominations ‚Äî its highest total for a single season thus far ‚Äî when no one expected it. In addition to Tyson‚Äôs fourth nom, Davis returned to the drama actress lineup, while Glynn Turman snagged a guest bid for his portrayal of Nate Sr. If the show was already on voters‚Äô radar last year, then it might especially be this year ‚Äî its season having not only aired at the perfect time, but it being the final one.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-away-with-murder-after-the-finale-whats-next-for-the-cast">&ldquo;‚ÄòHow to Get Away With Murder‚Äô After the Finale: What‚Äôs Next for the Cast?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/HTGAWM-Souza-Webber-Davis.jpg" alt="img">
How to Get Away with Murder took viewers on a six-season thrill ride before taking its final bow on May 14. Now that the series is over, most of the stars are moving on to new projects. Here‚Äôs what is next for the How to Get Away with Murder alums.</p>
<p>‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äô stars Karla Souza, Charlie Weber, and Viola Davis | Byron Cohen via Getty Images</p>
<p>Viola Davis</p>
<p>Hollywood veteran, Viola Davis, led the cast of How to Get Away with Murder. As legal eagle Annalise Keating, Davis stretched her dramatic muscles with powerful performances and dynamite monologues. Before and during her stint on the ABC drama, Davis appeared in films including The Help, Suicide Squad, and Fences. Now that the show has ended, she has shown no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>The actress has four films cooking, including biopics about Ma Rainey and Harriet Tubman. Ma Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom is slated for a 2020 release, while the untitled Harriet Tubman project is in development. Davis is filming another untitled film, which also stars Sandra Bullock, plus she has been tapped to play Michelle Obama in the First Ladies television drama.</p>
<p>Aja Naomi King</p>
<p>RELATED: Viola Davis Asks Fans to Describe ‚ÄòHTGAWM‚Äô Episode and Twitter Delivers</p>
<p>As Michaela Pratt on How to Get Away with Murder, Aja Naomi King became a master of biting banter. Her spunky portrayal of the law student who pulled herself up by the bootstraps resonated deeply with the audience.</p>
<p>Fans can see the rising star next in The 24th, co-written by Trai Byers of Empire fame. The film‚Äôs director, Kevin Willmott, partnered with Byers to co-write the Jim Crow-era drama. The 24th centers around the all-Black 24th United States Infantry Regiment during the Houston Riot of 1917.</p>
<p>Matt McGorry</p>
<p>Asher Millstone, played by Matt McGorry, was a rich kid with a talent for irking his law school classmates. But he eventually earned a place in the hearts of his cohorts and viewers.</p>
<p>During his time on How to Get Away with Murder, McGorry juggled several feature-length and short films, including the Netflix original, Uncorked, which launched on the streaming giant in March. He will continue appearing on the big screen in 2020 and beyond, starting with Death of a Telemarketer. In the story, a would-be swindler becomes the target of a man he tried to rip off.</p>
<p>Charlie Webber</p>
<p>RELATED: ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äô Final Season: Fans Don‚Äôt Want to Say Goodbye</p>
<p>Charlie Webber played the part of Frank Delfino with beautiful complexity. As the muscle of the crew, Frank wasn‚Äôt afraid to get his hands dirty, but Webber brought humanity to a character who committed inhuman acts.</p>
<p>Webber, who has worked consistently in television and film for twenty years, recently completed a voice-acting gig in the sci-fi video short, Adam Strange. Next up for Webber is the feature film, After We Collided. The drama, based on the novel of the same name, revolves around the love story of two young adults.</p>
<p>Liza Weil</p>
<p>RELATED: ‚ÄòHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äô Cast Plays ‚ÄòWho Said It?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know I look nice, but that‚Äôs just my face,‚Äù said Bonnie Winterbottom in the first season of How to Get Away with Murder. As the actress who portrayed Bonnie, Liza Weil brilliantly brought understated ruthlessness to the character.</p>
<p>Fans can catch Weil in a recurring role on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, now streaming on Amazon Prime. Beyond that, the star has three upcoming films in the works. The Black Emperor of Broadway, which was inspired by a play, centers around a Black actor who won a Broadway part in 1921. Looking ahead, Weil will also appear in Women Is Losers and Mosquito.</p>
<p>Karla Souza</p>
<p>In How to Get Away with Murder, Laurel Castillo often made morally ambiguous decisions. On the other hand, as the actress behind the character, Karla Souza made solid creative choices in her authentic portrayal.</p>
<p>Souza disappeared from the show during the first half of season six, but it appears that she kept busy while away. Fans may remember her from the 2019 horror reboot, Jacob‚Äôs Ladder. Coming soon, Souza will star in the action flicks, The Sleepover and The Jesuit. And on the small screen, the actress has an Amazon Prime drama series called El Presidente in development.</p>
<p>Alfred Enoch</p>
<p>Harry Potter film series veteran, Alfred Enoch, played Wes Gibbins on How to Get Away with Murder. The character became the center of much of the drama depicted on the show from the very beginning, back in 2014. Since then, the actor has landed several film and television projects, including BBC‚Äôs Troy: Fall of a City. Enoch‚Äôs next project, Executive Order, is completed and awaiting a release date.
