<p>Bill Russell is extremely respected in the basketball world. For fans, he is the one who changed the game of defense completely. The Celtics legend stepped into the world of NBA and revolutionized the playing methods of the game. Besides his interest in basketball, Russell was a game-changer in his era due to his involvement in social issues and casting an active voice against racism.</p>
<p>Bill Russell is known as the man who won eleven titles in his 13-year career. He is depicted to be the pathway for African-American players to enter into the NBA. He often criticized Boston for being a racist city, even though he spent his entire playing career there.</p>
<p>Russell refused to attend his Hall of Fame induction ceremony in 1975. When the Boston Celtics retired Russell’s #6 jersey in 1972, the star of the show didn’t attend the event. He refused to take part in the ceremony, which threw a huge shock on everyone’s faces.</p>
<p>Being such a rebellious personality, one can expect Russell to act with the same caliber, even now. The 86-year-old to this day carries the fight in him and wants to end racism for good. When the NFL players took a stand against racism by kneeling to the national anthem, they garnered the support of the legend.</p>
<p>Bill Russell posted a photo of him kneeling with the presidential medal of freedom hanging around his neck. His solidarity with the football players spread widely and earned Russell massive respect from every community.</p>
<p>Bill Russell calls Donald Trump a coward</p>
<p>For a man who has been a rebel all his life, calling out injustice or mockery is no tough task. Russell doesn’t care if you are the President of the country or just a common man. If you’re spreading hatred into the society, it will be called out by the five-time MVP.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump posted a tweet that condemned the act of kneeling against the American flag. Trump suggested alternatives to conduct a protest but strictly wrote: “NO KNEELING,” on his account. Consequently, this invited Bill Russell to give his take on the issue. The Celtics legend bashed Trump by giving him an explicit reply on his Twitter account. This is what he wrote:</p>
<p>“#Trump you projected your narrative that #TakingAKnee is disrespectful &amp; #UnAmerican it was never about that! You are divisive &amp; a coward. It takes true courage 2 stand 4 what is right &amp; risk your life in the midst of a #pandemic #Proud2kneel #BlackLivesMatter”</p>
<p>Apart from educating the president on what is really taking a knee, Bill Russell went the extra mile by specifically adding an old photo of him kneeling, with the prestigious medal around his neck. Most importantly, the NBA legend also asserted the importance of protests in his post. Bill Russell lauded the people who are marching down the street amid the COVID-19 scare.

<h3 id="bill-russell-rips-president-donald-trumps-stance-against-mail-in-voting-during-coronavirus-pandemic">&ldquo;Bill Russell rips President Donald Trump’s stance against mail-in voting during coronavirus pandemic&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.masslive.com/resizer/oxM-W5rNBDw6aTCmbNLOqrLuN2g=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/R2Q63TX72RFGZN26IM3SVNKSIY.jpg" alt="img">
Former Boston Celtics great Bill Russell appears to be picking another fight with President Donald Trump in the commander in chief’s favorite arena - Twitter.</p>
<p>Russell attacked the president for his opposition to voting by mail, which has become a controversial topic in recent weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Russell tweeted:</p>
<p>“Hello @realDonaldTrump there is a good reason for #VoteByMail not sure if you have heard of #coronavirus #COVIDー19 or better known as a #pandemic bit I don’t want to risk my life to #vote ! @MSNBC @CNN”</p>
<p>Several states are considering allowing mail in voting to avoid voting lines and election gatherings that would make social distancing and maintaining disinfected voting stations a challenge.</p>
<p>Russell’s tweet follows Trump’s own Twitter threat to Nevada to withhold federal funds for sending out mail-in ballots:</p>
<p>&ldquo;State of Nevada “thinks” that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots, creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S. They can’t! If they do, “I think” I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry, but you must not cheat in elections. @RussVought45 @USTreasury</p>
<p>At 86 years old, Russell is more vulnerable to the affects of coronavirus, which has been particularly dangerous to people 60 and older.</p>
<p>Russell, an NBA Hall of Famer, won 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons and was a leader in the civil rights movement both in Boston and nationally. He the NBA’s first African American coach and attended the 1963 March on Washington. In 2011, President Barack Obama, who Trump has an acrimonious relationship with, awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>
<p>Russell tagged MSNBC and CNN in his Tweet, likely in an attempt to draw attention to his attempt to pick a fight. It’s not the first time Russell has gone after Trump using a similar approach. When the president criticized LeBron James and CNN’s Don Lemon in 2018, Russell tweeted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time &amp; place for any African American, @KingJames @donlemon @RepMaxineWaters @repjohnlewis &amp; #NFL plyrs to be criticised by @realdonaldtrump means you must be doing something right! As I have said before- Its the biggest compliment you can get. @TwitterSports @MSNBC @CNN</p>
<p>Russell did the same thing when Trump famously used a derogatory phrase about the origin of many immigrants:</p>
<p>“Is @realDonaldTrump aware the first people to come here from #”SHIThole&rdquo; countries did not come willingly, they came as slaves to build this country and the White House #Racismhasnologic @Lawrence @CNN @NBA @JoyAnnReid @FoxNews @POTUS #MLKDay2018″</p>

<h3 id="nba-legend-bill-russell-has-been-married-4-times--meet-his-4th-wife-jeannine">&ldquo;NBA Legend Bill Russell Has Been Married 4 Times – Meet His 4th Wife Jeannine&rdquo;</h3>

The NBA legend was one of the most acclaimed players in NBA history and still is. His defensive style on the court was a big influence on players in the future. At 85 years old, he still holds his stand over racism and is married for the fourth time.</p>
<p>One of the greatest players in NBA history, Bill Russell, is currently in his 4th marriage. At 85 years old, he is still active going to watch basketball games with his wife Jeannine Russell, as he shows in his Instagram account.</p>
<p>In a 2018 Halloween post, Bill wrote that he and Jeannine “go together like Bacon &amp; Eggs”. On another photo posted, the couple watched the Los Angeles Lakers and the former player captioned the image saying he had a wonderful time with his wife. Both appear happy and smiling as Bill wears a Celtics cap.</p>
<p>LIFE ACHIEVEMENTS</p>
<p>Born in 1934, William Felton Russell, is considered one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history. Russell started his professional career with the Boston Celtics in 1956 and played with the team for 13 years, leading the club to 11 championship titles.</p>
<p>The former player had a dominating presence on the court as a defender and an impressive ability to rebound. He was also named five times the NBA’s Most Valuable Player. He retired the game after the 1969 season was over, and after that, he frequently came back as a coach or executive for many years.</p>

<p>Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, but did not accept the ring until 2019, when ex-NBA star, Chuck Cooper, was also inducted in the Hall, whom he considered should be in the Hall of Fame before him.</p>
<p>In 2010 Bill also received from President Barack Obama, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, considered the country’s highest civil honor. He has three children from his first marriage to Rose Swisher, a daughter named Karen, who is a lawyer and TV pundit, and sons William Jr. and Jacob.</p>
<p>RACISM ISSUES</p>
<p>His achievements on the court were only a part of his outstanding career, as he had to face racism while rewriting Boston basketball history. On a few occasions, his home was assaulted, as well as he was rejected from being served at cafeterias. He also once heard from a reporter that he would not get MVP for being black.</p>
<p>In 2017, Bill showed his support to NFL players by posting a photo on social media to reject declarations made by President Trump. The image shows the NBA star kneeling proudly in front of the camera, with the caption: &ldquo;Proud to take a knee and stand tall against social injustice”.

<h3 id="antetokounmpo-bucks-players-join-milwaukee-protest">&ldquo;Antetokounmpo, Bucks players join Milwaukee protest&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://newsbrig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Antetokounmpo-Bucks-players-join-Milwaukee-protest.jpeg" alt="img">
The first NXT TakeOver since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the sporting world needed to be special, and the WWE utilized a bit of nostalgia to deliver a wonderfully themed event with In Your House on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Complete with nods to an era that included IcoPro and Good Humor ice cream sandwich advertisements and some great wrestling from today’s NXT talent, In Your House was an enjoyable past-meets-present show that drew upon the pay-per-view events the WWE held in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>MORE: Money in the Bank results: Asuka wins ridiculous ladder match</p>
<p>The night was headlined by a triple threat match for the NXT women’s championship and featured a cinematic Backlot Brawl for the NXT championship. Here’s how Sporting News graded those matches and the other bouts on the card:</p>
<p>Mia Yim, Shotzi Blackheart &amp; Tegan Nox vs. Candice LeRae, Dakota Kai &amp; Raquel Gonzalez</p>
<p>First things first: The set for the show was a treat; it was a version of the old In Your House PPVs, and the addition of Todd Pettengill certainly added to the show. This triple threat match was a fun opener, in which Nox get the pin on Kai after some miscommunication between Kai and Gonzalez. All six worked hard throughout.</p>
<p>Yim and Lerae took themselves out of the equation late in the match by brawling backstage, which will certainly extend their feud, and left Nox to deal with her longtime rivals. Things became a little sloppy down the stretch as Gonzalez showed how green she is by missing a few spots. Nevertheless, solid work to set the tone for the rest of the show.</p>
<p>Grade: C+</p>
<p>Finn Balor vs. Demian Priest</p>
<p>Balor’s brief heel turn allowed him to acquire an edge to his character that he previously lacked. Sunday was a full hybrid of his babyface and heel personas as Balor likely set the stage for an opportunity to regain the NXT championship later this year by pinning Priest after hitting the Coup de Grace.</p>
<p>As good as Balor is, it has to be said that Priest is extremely underrated in the ring. He showcased his ability by gelling with Balor for some great action that included Priest taking a nasty bump off the apron onto the edge of the steel steps outside.</p>
<p>It appears that Priest is destined for the mid-card but has the ability to deliver really entertaining matches if he gets the time. Balor was expected to win and is peaking at the right time with just a mild tweak of his character.</p>
<p>Grade: B-</p>
<p>Keith Lee (c) vs. Johnny Gargano (NXT North American championship)</p>
<p>Gargano’s heel turn had been lukewarm to this point. It’s not that he has been bad at it; it’s just that his motivation for turning hasn’t quite won the fans over. The way he worked his match with Lee, however, was well done for his character. NXT also managed to find a way to make a match between a monster babyface and an undersized heel work.</p>
<p>Lee — who had “Black Lives Matter” embroidered on his wrestling tights — has stalled a bit since his run at Survivor Series last year and is in need of a jolt. His feud with Gargano, should it continue, could be just what he needs.</p>
<p>Despite being undersized, Gargano used limb manipulation to even the odds against the giant Lee. Lee’s power was on full display as he tossed Gargano around the ring with a plethora of suplexes and slams. But the highlight was a pounce that sent Gargano through the plexiglass on the outside.</p>
<p>Interference from LeRae and Yim hurt the match a bit but allowed Gargano to stab Lee in the eye with a key that he had in his trunks. Gargano nearly stole the win with a DDT and a trio of superkicks, but Lee continued to kick out of every pin attempt. The champion powered up, hit a pair of Spirit bombs and closed the show with the Big Bang Catastrophe to retain his title.</p>
<p>This was a fine match that could have seen a few minutes shaved off, but here’s hoping it sets up something more interesting in the future between two of the best wrestlers in the company.</p>
<p>Grade: C+</p>
<p>Adam Cole vs. Velveteen Dream (NXT championship)</p>
<p>And this is when the cinematic match officially jumped the shark.</p>
<p>Honestly, the Cole-Dream feud has been relatively devoid of heat from the beginning and their lack of in-ring chemistry has been problematic. NXT tried to make this feel important by adding the cinematic aspect to its Backlot Brawl match</p>
<p>This match absolutely didn’t need to be a cinematic match. The numerous camera cuts throughout were dizzying and took away from the action.</p>
<p>There were some nice touches — Dream’s Negan-inspired attire from “The Walking Dead,” The Undisputed Era monster truck and Cole’s spill off the ladder onto a car windshield — but it just didn’t click. Billed as a Backlot Brawl, the match lacked intensity and the interference by Dexter Lumis, Roderick Strong and Bobby Fish didn’t help matters.</p>
<p>Cole finally collected the win — and mercifully end this feud — by hitting the Panama Sunrise on a pile of steel chairs after a low blow.</p>
<p>As good as Cole has been, this was an underwhelming performance. It’s not entirely his fault, nor was it Dream’s. It just didn’t work, with failed attempts at humor (an Uber driver, really?) and a poor use of the cinematic. It could have worked just fine as a regular match. Nevertheless, let’s hope that Cole moves on to a feud with Finn Balor in a battle to see who is the greatest NXT champion of all time.</p>
<p>Grade: D+</p>
<p>Tommaso Ciampa vs. Karrion Kross</p>
<p>There are very few can’t-miss superstars in pro wrestling, but Kross is most definitely one of them. With the perfect blend of size, talent and ability to cut a promo, he exudes the “it” factor.</p>
<p>His match with Ciampa was a beautiful execution of violence that formally announced his arrival, with the former NXT champion putting over the newcomer.</p>
<p>The victor was never in question, but Ciampa did an excellent job trying to slay the upstart and avoid being dominated. Kross maintained control with violent strikes and powerful suplexes while Ciampa tried to fend off the monster and keep him from getting the upper hand.</p>
<p>It was a well-booked match. Ciampa kept his luster as a force with his explosive comebacks, but Kross continued to cut off every rally until he earned the victory by nailing Ciampa with an inverted F-5 that was followed with his Kross Jacket submission to put Ciampa to sleep.</p>
<p>Kross looked great, and he has a phenomenal entrance. WWE would have to go out of its way to mess this up. As for Ciampa, he’ll be just fine. He’s too good not to be.</p>
<p>Grade: B</p>
<p>Rhea Ripley vs. Io Shirai vs. Charlotte (NXT women’s championship)</p>
<p>Finally!</p>
<p>Shiriai’s phenomenal wrestling ability might be the worst-kept secret in pro wrestling. Fans have been waiting with bated breath to see the Japanese star get her due. She finally got it in the main event of this TakeOver.</p>
<p>These women put on a show, with Shirai being the highlight with her excellent work, breathtaking dives and ridiculous athleticism. Charlotte’s in-ring was uncharacteristically uneven. At certain points, her offense came off sloppy, but then she’d have moments where she’d remind everyone why she’s one of the best in the world. Ripley was solid, too. A Rip Tide off the top rope nearly earned her the win, and for the most part she came off as a powerhouse.</p>
<p>But this was Io’s crowning moment, which she punctuated with a splash off the set onto Ripley and Charlotte.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Kendo stick by Charlotte late in the match felt completely unnecessary and didn’t add anything. The end came when Charlotte applied the Figure 8 to Ripley and nearly elicited the submission, until Shirai hit a moonsault on Ripley to steal the pin.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the finish didn’t come off cleanly; Shirai nailed Ripley in the face with her knee, which could have resulted in an injury. It also would have been nice to see Charlotte eat the pin here, but WWE seems to be committed to protecting her, as she will likely head back to “Raw” and enter a feud with Asuka.</p>
<p>Shirai has plenty of options for the future, but it’s great to finally see one of the best in the business be recognized with a championship run.</p>

<h3 id="college-football-players-coaches-take-part-in-unity-walks">&ldquo;College football players, coaches take part in unity walks&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://newsbrig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/College-football-players-coaches-take-part-in-unity-walks.jpeg" alt="img">
The first NXT TakeOver since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the sporting world needed to be special, and the WWE utilized a bit of nostalgia to deliver a wonderfully themed event with In Your House on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Complete with nods to an era that included IcoPro and Good Humor ice cream sandwich advertisements and some great wrestling from today’s NXT talent, In Your House was an enjoyable past-meets-present show that drew upon the pay-per-view events the WWE held in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>MORE: Money in the Bank results: Asuka wins ridiculous ladder match</p>
<p>The night was headlined by a triple threat match for the NXT women’s championship and featured a cinematic Backlot Brawl for the NXT championship. Here’s how Sporting News graded those matches and the other bouts on the card:</p>
<p>Mia Yim, Shotzi Blackheart &amp; Tegan Nox vs. Candice LeRae, Dakota Kai &amp; Raquel Gonzalez</p>
<p>First things first: The set for the show was a treat; it was a version of the old In Your House PPVs, and the addition of Todd Pettengill certainly added to the show. This triple threat match was a fun opener, in which Nox get the pin on Kai after some miscommunication between Kai and Gonzalez. All six worked hard throughout.</p>
<p>Yim and Lerae took themselves out of the equation late in the match by brawling backstage, which will certainly extend their feud, and left Nox to deal with her longtime rivals. Things became a little sloppy down the stretch as Gonzalez showed how green she is by missing a few spots. Nevertheless, solid work to set the tone for the rest of the show.</p>
<p>Grade: C+</p>
<p>Finn Balor vs. Demian Priest</p>
<p>Balor’s brief heel turn allowed him to acquire an edge to his character that he previously lacked. Sunday was a full hybrid of his babyface and heel personas as Balor likely set the stage for an opportunity to regain the NXT championship later this year by pinning Priest after hitting the Coup de Grace.</p>
<p>As good as Balor is, it has to be said that Priest is extremely underrated in the ring. He showcased his ability by gelling with Balor for some great action that included Priest taking a nasty bump off the apron onto the edge of the steel steps outside.</p>
<p>It appears that Priest is destined for the mid-card but has the ability to deliver really entertaining matches if he gets the time. Balor was expected to win and is peaking at the right time with just a mild tweak of his character.</p>
<p>Grade: B-</p>
<p>Keith Lee (c) vs. Johnny Gargano (NXT North American championship)</p>
<p>Gargano’s heel turn had been lukewarm to this point. It’s not that he has been bad at it; it’s just that his motivation for turning hasn’t quite won the fans over. The way he worked his match with Lee, however, was well done for his character. NXT also managed to find a way to make a match between a monster babyface and an undersized heel work.</p>
<p>Lee — who had “Black Lives Matter” embroidered on his wrestling tights — has stalled a bit since his run at Survivor Series last year and is in need of a jolt. His feud with Gargano, should it continue, could be just what he needs.</p>
<p>Despite being undersized, Gargano used limb manipulation to even the odds against the giant Lee. Lee’s power was on full display as he tossed Gargano around the ring with a plethora of suplexes and slams. But the highlight was a pounce that sent Gargano through the plexiglass on the outside.</p>
<p>Interference from LeRae and Yim hurt the match a bit but allowed Gargano to stab Lee in the eye with a key that he had in his trunks. Gargano nearly stole the win with a DDT and a trio of superkicks, but Lee continued to kick out of every pin attempt. The champion powered up, hit a pair of Spirit bombs and closed the show with the Big Bang Catastrophe to retain his title.</p>
<p>This was a fine match that could have seen a few minutes shaved off, but here’s hoping it sets up something more interesting in the future between two of the best wrestlers in the company.</p>
<p>Grade: C+</p>
<p>Adam Cole vs. Velveteen Dream (NXT championship)</p>
<p>And this is when the cinematic match officially jumped the shark.</p>
<p>Honestly, the Cole-Dream feud has been relatively devoid of heat from the beginning and their lack of in-ring chemistry has been problematic. NXT tried to make this feel important by adding the cinematic aspect to its Backlot Brawl match</p>
<p>This match absolutely didn’t need to be a cinematic match. The numerous camera cuts throughout were dizzying and took away from the action.</p>
<p>There were some nice touches — Dream’s Negan-inspired attire from “The Walking Dead,” The Undisputed Era monster truck and Cole’s spill off the ladder onto a car windshield — but it just didn’t click. Billed as a Backlot Brawl, the match lacked intensity and the interference by Dexter Lumis, Roderick Strong and Bobby Fish didn’t help matters.</p>
<p>Cole finally collected the win — and mercifully end this feud — by hitting the Panama Sunrise on a pile of steel chairs after a low blow.</p>
<p>As good as Cole has been, this was an underwhelming performance. It’s not entirely his fault, nor was it Dream’s. It just didn’t work, with failed attempts at humor (an Uber driver, really?) and a poor use of the cinematic. It could have worked just fine as a regular match. Nevertheless, let’s hope that Cole moves on to a feud with Finn Balor in a battle to see who is the greatest NXT champion of all time.</p>
<p>Grade: D+</p>
<p>Tommaso Ciampa vs. Karrion Kross</p>
<p>There are very few can’t-miss superstars in pro wrestling, but Kross is most definitely one of them. With the perfect blend of size, talent and ability to cut a promo, he exudes the “it” factor.</p>
<p>His match with Ciampa was a beautiful execution of violence that formally announced his arrival, with the former NXT champion putting over the newcomer.</p>
<p>The victor was never in question, but Ciampa did an excellent job trying to slay the upstart and avoid being dominated. Kross maintained control with violent strikes and powerful suplexes while Ciampa tried to fend off the monster and keep him from getting the upper hand.</p>
<p>It was a well-booked match. Ciampa kept his luster as a force with his explosive comebacks, but Kross continued to cut off every rally until he earned the victory by nailing Ciampa with an inverted F-5 that was followed with his Kross Jacket submission to put Ciampa to sleep.</p>
<p>Kross looked great, and he has a phenomenal entrance. WWE would have to go out of its way to mess this up. As for Ciampa, he’ll be just fine. He’s too good not to be.</p>
<p>Grade: B</p>
<p>Rhea Ripley vs. Io Shirai vs. Charlotte (NXT women’s championship)</p>
<p>Finally!</p>
<p>Shiriai’s phenomenal wrestling ability might be the worst-kept secret in pro wrestling. Fans have been waiting with bated breath to see the Japanese star get her due. She finally got it in the main event of this TakeOver.</p>
<p>These women put on a show, with Shirai being the highlight with her excellent work, breathtaking dives and ridiculous athleticism. Charlotte’s in-ring was uncharacteristically uneven.

<h3 id="bob-cousy-receives-presidential-medal-of-freedom">&ldquo;Bob Cousy receives Presidential Medal of Freedom&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nba.com/images/cms/2019-08/bob-cousy-honered.jpg?cw=1045&amp;w=1045&amp;x=0&amp;ch=588&amp;h=1044&amp;y=110" alt="img">
WASHINGTON (AP) &ndash; President Donald Trump presented 91-year-old basketball legend Bob Cousy with the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Thursday, praising the Boston Celtics star as &ldquo;one of the all-time greats in the history of sports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cousy played for the Celtics from 1950 to 1963, winning six league championships and the 1957 MVP title. The Bob Cousy Award, given to the country&rsquo;s best point guard in men&rsquo;s college basketball, is named for him. He is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and played a pivotal role in founding the NBA Player&rsquo;s Association.</p>
<p>After hanging up his No. 14 jersey, the 13-time NBA All-Star went on to coach basketball at Boston College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This acknowledgment allows me to complete my life circle,&rdquo; Cousy said during the Oval Office awards ceremony. &ldquo;I can stop chasing a bouncing ball. The Presidential Medal of Freedom allows me to reach a level of acceptance in our society I never once ever dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump spoke of Cousy&rsquo;s childhood during the Great Depression and discovering his talent for basketball at a young age. The president said Cousy never forgot his first mentor&rsquo;s advice to never be predictable, and jokingly added: &ldquo;Hey, I&rsquo;ve heard that lesson, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The president recognized Cousy&rsquo;s achievements on and off the court, lauding his support for underprivileged young athletes and speaking out against racism.</p>
<p>Cousy, who is white, ardently supported his black teammates who faced discrimination during the civil rights movement. Still, Cousy lamented in Gary Pomerantz&rsquo;s biography &ldquo;The Last Pass: Cousy, Russell, the Celtics, and What Matters in the End,&rdquo; that he didn&rsquo;t do more for his black teammates, including 2011 Medal of Freedom recipient Bill Russell.</p>
<p>The Medal of Freedom, the nation&rsquo;s highest civilian honor, celebrates individuals for their &ldquo;especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the U.S., to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump credited West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin for suggesting the medal be given to Cousy.</p>
<p>Cousy is the second Medal of Freedom recipient this year. Trump presented the award to golfer Tiger Woods in May.</p>
<p>Cousy is the 10th honoree under Trump, who is Cousy&rsquo;s candidate of choice in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with NBA.com, Cousy described himself as politically moderate. He said that although he disagrees with some of the president&rsquo;s actions, he plans to vote for Trump next year.</p>
<p>During the award ceremony, Cousy said the medal was made all the more special because it had been presented by the &ldquo;most extraordinary&rdquo; president in his lifetime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know in your world, you&rsquo;re well on your way to making America great again,&rdquo; Cousy told the president. &ldquo;In my world, it&rsquo;s been great for 91 years. Only in America could my story have been told.&rdquo;
