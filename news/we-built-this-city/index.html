<p>Charlotte-based She Built This City is a non-profit organization committed to sparking interest in construction and the maker trades for women and girls ages 9-17. After 20 years in the construction industry, founder Demi Knight Clark, found herself tired of being the only woman in the room. With that in mind, she launched She Built This City to even the playing field. Her ambitious goal: by 2030, women would represent 50 percent of professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>Initially, the plan was to launch She Built This City summer camps through the organization’s Builder Girls platform. However, when COVID-19 hit, they had to quickly change direction. With a new vision for community impact, Demi Knight Clark decided to purchase an Air Stream and create a Mobile Tool Lab to take She Built This City programming into the community… with emphasis on those areas hardest hit by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Starting in July, She Built This City staff will be taking their mobile tool lab into the community with two main initiatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>While They Work (name to be determined – She Built This City wants to partner with organizations that offer job training/job prep courses for adults. She Built This City will be offering 90 minutes to two hours’ worth of hands-on programming designed to engage youth 6+ while their parents focus on preparing to enter the construction workforce.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will be the first step in building long-term relationships with communities.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Women@Work – On the Go! – She Built This City will also focus on putting women to work. They will be offering workforce development training from the Mobile Tool Lab with the “Learning Zone.” They will be teaching drone inspection technology, 3D printing, OSHA 10, and forklift in order to get participants immediate high-wage work.</li>
</ol>
<p>“We realize that the needs of communities are rapidly changing and we will pivot wherever we can to ensure we are meeting both the short-term and long-term needs of those around us,” said Demi Knight Clark.</p>
<p>And, while many organizations are laying off employees and shutting their doors, She Built This City is growing. LaToya Faustin was brought on as Chief Operating Officer in May of 2020 and the organization is currently looking to hire a Program Coordinator.</p>
<p>To learn more about the Mobile Tool Lab or to inquire about working with She Built This City, please contact <a href="mailto:latoya.faustin@shebuiltthiscity.org">latoya.faustin@shebuiltthiscity.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="rally-at-memphis-massacre-site-calls-for-end-to-systemic-racism">&ldquo;Rally at ‘Memphis Massacre’ Site Calls for End to Systemic Racism&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media1.fdncms.com/memphisflyer/imager/u/feature/23151530/img_5498.jpg" alt="img">
A couple dozen people gathered Downtown Memphis on Monday to rally for justice and an end to systemic racism.</p>
<p>The demonstration, organized by the Poor People’s Campaign, took place in Army Park, where a historical marker stands commemorating the Memphis Massacre of 1866. The massacre lasted three days, over which a white mob led by law enforcement killed approximately 46 black people, raped several black women, and burned churches, schools, and other black establishments.</p>

<p>After reading the words from the historical marker, Rev. Edith Love with the Poor People’s campaign said violence by white people toward black people has not stopped, but that “it has merely evolved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“As we stand in the very spot where white police officers and other white men committed acts of unspeakable violence in 1866, consider carefully the deaths of unarmed citizens by the hands of police,” Love said. “And I ask you how much has really changed?”</p>
<p>Monday Rev. Regina Clarke, also with the Poor People’s Campaign, after leading a prayer, called on the country to stop “all forms of systemic racism.”</p>
<p>“Today I want to pray for everyone who has been impacted by systemic racism, denial of health care, and police brutality,” Clarke said. “We also want to make sure we call out and make prominent the names of those here in Memphis who have been impacted by police brutality. We see the violence of injustice, we see the violence of racism against black people, Latinos, First Nations, and people of color. We know this violence is a threat to all humanity in this yet to be perfect union.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Clarke called for an end to “perpetuating poverty,” along with equal access to healthcare, decent housing, voting rights, equitable education, and “the chance to survive and thrive.”</p>
<p>“We hear the cries of the poor people and low wealth in a land of abundance,” Clarke said. “We hear the fear of death among the uninsured and under-insured. We hear the groans of ecological devastation and environmental violence. We feel the violence of militarism all around.”</p>

<p>Rabbi Jeremy Simons of Temple Israel spoke about mourning</p>
<p>Rabbi Jeremy Simons of Temple Israel spoke about mourning in the Jewish faith, saying he is there for “solidarity in presence and partnership.”</p>
<p>“When you enter a house of mourning or when you encounter someone who is mourning, you walk into their house, you sit down, and shut up,” Simons said. “You offer your presence and nothing else.”</p>
<p>Simons continued, saying that this is not only a period of mourning, but also of “self reflection in the face of systemic injustice.”</p>
<p>Frank Johnson of Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church also spoke Monday, after singing a verse of &ldquo;Amazing Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Black lives matter because we built this city and this country, but still this country wants to disrespect our lives,” Johnson said. “It wants to tell us to be quiet when we are talking about our issues and problems, but it always wants our bodies when it needs it.”</p>
<p>The demonstrators then paused and reflected in silence for eight minutes and 45 seconds, the amount of time a police officer knelt on the neck of George Floyd.</p>

<h3 id="we-built-this-nation-congresswoman-johnson-urges-help-from-white-lawmakers-as-officials-mourn-black-lives-at-dallas-city-hall-plaza">&ldquo;‘We built this nation’: Congresswoman Johnson urges help from white lawmakers as officials mourn black lives at Dallas City Hall plaza&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/JswXBYHO1-_23eoTjavDKN9obEM=/1200x630/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/dmn/JX6XVLHYDBBD3OTTAJCZQG6F2E.jpg" alt="img">
As the first black woman elected from Dallas to the Texas House in 1972, U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat, recalled that she was tasked to study race relations and policing during her first term in office. Since then, nothing has changed, she said.</p>
<p>Rep. Johnson urged white people to help black representatives who have long called for a reform of the justice system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not us” who have turned a blind eye, she said.</p>
<p>“We need them to understand that we are black every day, and every day we are reminded that we’re black,” Johnson said. “We just want to be treated the same as everyone else. We want our children to feel that this nation is fair. We built this nation. We were brought here to do that.”</p>
<p>Early Friday, Rep. Johnson and Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson (no relation to the representative) stood in the Dallas City Hall plaza to remember George Floyd and other black victims who had been killed at the hands of police.</p>
<p>City Council members, City Manager T.C. Broadnax, Police Chief U. Renee Hall and other city officials stood side by side as they heard from the mayor, the congresswoman and faith leaders.</p>
<p>In a proclamation, Mayor Johnson declared Friday George Floyd Remembrance Day and said it was a tribute to the “turning point” he represents for the country. The mayor said that as an African American, he understands that much of the violence against black men has been “supported and sanctioned by the state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“The killing of our brother, George Floyd, hurts,” he said. “But if you’re African American, you probably also place what you saw in the context of the fact that our people were brought to this country 400 years ago for the very purpose of racial injustice.”</p>

<p>But not everyone was satisfied with the speeches.</p>
<p>Shenita Cleveland called on the mayor to do more. Cleveland said she had been arrested Sunday after violating the curfew to protest downtown and was handcuffed for seven hours.</p>
<p>She criticized the city for not dropping charges on all protesters after they backed off on charging the nearly 700 who walked onto the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge on Monday. Some council members listened to Cleveland and another demonstrator as they spoke on a megaphone.</p>
<p>“Thank you for the proclamation, but we need action,” Cleveland said.</p>

<p>The mayor said he didn’t know why the reckoning with police violence didn’t happen sooner with other deaths captured on video, such as Eric Garner — a 43-year-old black man who’d been choked to death in New York on July 17, 2014 — or Tamir Rice — a 12-year-old black boy fatally shot by police in Cleveland in November of that same year. He had been carrying a toy gun.</p>
<p>As the event neared the end, officials and onlookers took a moment of silence that lasted eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time an officer held his knee on Floyd’s neck. Several laid down while others knelt. The only sound came from a helicopter above the plaza and a dog’s barks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why or how exactly we got here,” the mayor said.</p>
<p>He added that he wondered if the coronavirus had made the public more reflective.</p>
<p>“But I will tell you this as the mayor of this great city,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I’m glad it’s happening.”

<h3 id="three-and-wks-decade-long-mission-for-viral-fame">&ldquo;Three and W&amp;K&rsquo;s decade-long mission for viral fame&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cached.imagescaler.hbpl.co.uk/resize/scaleHeight/815/cached.offlinehbpl.hbpl.co.uk/news/OMC/EDtthis-20200528081510610.jpg" alt="img">
Three and Wieden &amp; Kennedy&rsquo;s partnership has come to an end after 10 years.</p>
<p>The ad account, which was originally valued at £18m, has seen the pair produce a series of weird and wonderful ads, from a puppet called Jackson to a Fleetwood Mac-loving Shetland pony.</p>
<p>As Three searches for a new creative agency, Campaign has compiled a round-up of the telecoms company&rsquo;s best ads by Wieden &amp; Kennedy.</p>
<p>Embracing the power of social media in building relationships with potential customers, &ldquo;The pony&rdquo; saw a Shetland pony channel Michael Jackson, moonwalking across the coastline to Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac.</p>
<p>Supported by an app that allowed users to customise their own dancing pony, the work was created by Freddie Powell and Hollie Walker.</p>
<p>Three’s next viral attempt featured a young girl and her CGI cat as they lip-sync to Starship&rsquo;s We Built This City during a seemingly unremarkable bike ride.</p>
<p>This came alongside a SingItKitty app that allowed people to star in their own version of the ad. Meanwhile, Starship’s ballad rose to number 25 in the official UK single downloads chart thanks to the spot.</p>
<p>The work was written by Chris Lapham, art directed by Aaron McGurk and directed by Traktor through Partizan.</p>
<p>Three hailed the emergence of its &ldquo;Feel at home&rdquo; service in France, Switzerland, Israel, Finland and Norway with a tongue-in-cheek spot apologising for users and their limitless ability to post about their holidays online.</p>
<p>It won gold at the 2016 UK Effie Awards and ranked as the most-awarded campaign for effectiveness in the UK in 2015, according to the Warc Effective 100.</p>
<p>The campaign was written by Anthony Atkinson, art directed by Greg Kouts and directed by Ric Cantor through Hungry Man.</p>
<p>Claims of free calls to 0800 numbers turned sour when the ad – which showed one woman’s surreal call to a directory called the &ldquo;singing dictionary&rdquo; – was deemed &ldquo;misleading&rdquo; by the Advertising Standards Authority.</p>
<p>However, in an attempt to go the extra mile, Wieden &amp; Kennedy compiled a quirky list of 0800 numbers that people could call if they were experiencing unfounded levels of boredom, the likes of which many people are currently experiencing on lockdown.</p>
<p>The work was written by Becca Pottinger, art directed by Sam McCluskey and directed by Chris Palmer through Gorgeous.</p>
<p>With a nod to everyone’s favourite musical puppets, Three’s next earworm saw a purple puppet named Jackson as he attempted to make his life better to the tune of East 17’s It’s Alright.</p>
<p>The work was written by Bertie Scrase, art directed by Christen Brestrup and directed by Daniel Wolfe through Somesuch.</p>
<p>Directed by Matthijs van Heijningen (who worked on the 2011 version of The Thing), Three‘s 15-rated spoof of The Blair Witch Project saw Jackson head into the woods to test the performance of LG’s G4 smartphone.</p>
<p>A puppet may not seem scary, but the five-minute ad’s viewer discretion warning says otherwise.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s short screen career came to an end with the emergence of Three’s &ldquo;giraffe-amingo&rdquo;, which depicted a sheepish baby giraffe that miraculously gained flamingo feathers, all to the tune of Shoop by Salt-N-Pepa. It sounds disturbing, but it looks stellar.</p>
<p>Katy Edelsten and Chloe Cordon created the campaign, while The Perlorian Brothers directed the film through MJZ. The Mill crafted the visual effects.</p>
<p>A visual razzmatazz of colours, genres, eras and cultures, &ldquo;Phones are good&rdquo; parodied claims that phones are having a damaging impact on wider society.</p>
<p>While the Titanic’s captain avoided destruction by checking his phone’s weather feature, Eve (of Adam and Eve – the first humans, not the agency) avoided the birth of original sin by scrolling through her Instagram timeline.</p>
<p>The work was created by Tom Bender and Tom Corcoran, and directed by Ian Pons Jewell through Friend.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;Phones are good&rdquo; was a visually dense experience, &ldquo;Real 5G&rdquo; is a borderline assault on your eyeballs.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the future of smartphones, the ad depicted driverless hovercars, real-life face filters and trips to the moon on board &ldquo;Spacy McSpaceface&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was created by Adam Newby and Will Wells, and directed by Ian Pons Jewell through Academy.

Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown organized a peaceful protest march through Atlanta on Saturday.</p>
<p>Brown said during a livestream on his Instagram account that he had driven 15 hours from Boston to lead the march in Atlanta, which is just outside his hometown of Marietta, GA. He was joined by Indiana Pacers guard Malcolm Brogdon, former first-round pick Justin Anderson and rapper Lil Yachty on the march that began at the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drove 15 hours to get to Georgia, my community,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;This is a peaceful protest. Being a celebrity, being an NBA player, don&rsquo;t exclude me from no conversations at all. First and foremost, I&rsquo;m a black man and I&rsquo;m a member of this community. [&hellip;] We&rsquo;re raising awareness for some of the injustices that we&rsquo;ve been seeing. It&rsquo;s not OK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group gathered to protest for justice and the end to police brutality. Brown marched with a sign that read &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Breathe,&rdquo; a reference to George Floyd, who died while handcuffed in Minneapolis on Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.</p>
<p>The death of Floyd, along with the death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, KY, has sparked nationwide protests against racial injustices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a young person, you&rsquo;ve got to listen to our perspective. Our voices need to be heard,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 23 years old. I don&rsquo;t know all of the answers. But I feel how everybody else is feeling, for sure. No question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brown and Brogdon are both vice presidents of the National Basketball Players Association.</p>

<p>Brogdon: &ldquo;I got a grandfather who marched next to Dr. King in the 60&rsquo;s and he was amazing. He would be proud to see us all here. We have to keep pushing forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got brothers, I&rsquo;ve got sisters, I&rsquo;ve got friends that are in the streets, that are out here, that haven&rsquo;t made it to this level, that are experiencing it, that are getting pulled over, just discrimination, day after day,&rdquo; Brogdon told protesters in a video posted to Brown&rsquo;s Instagram page. &ldquo;This is systematic. This isn&rsquo;t something where we come and [&hellip;] we don&rsquo;t have to burn down our homes. We built this city. This is the most proudly black city in the world. In the world, man. Let&rsquo;s take some pride in that. Let&rsquo;s focus our energy. Let&rsquo;s enjoy this together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a moment. We have leverage right now. We have a moment in time. People are going to look back, our kids are going to look back at this and say, &lsquo;You were part of that.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got a grandfather that marched next to [Martin Luther King Jr.] in the &rsquo;60s, and he was amazing. He would be proud to see us all here. We got to keep pushing forward. Jaylen has led this charge, man, and I&rsquo;m proud of him. We need more leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Former NBA player Stephen Jackson, who was a longtime friend of Floyd, protested in Minneapolis on Friday alongside Minnesota Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns and guard Josh Okogie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have no more tears honestly,&rdquo; Jackson said on Friday. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve cried enough. I&rsquo;ve cried enough. I&rsquo;m here for one reason. For my brother&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;

<h3 id="springfield-halting-use-of-triage-tents-for-homeless-during-pandemic-grateful-to-avoid-surge">&ldquo;Springfield halting use of triage tents for homeless during pandemic, grateful to avoid surge&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.masslive.com/resizer/DqrgcqiCN_pZngLkbsizigCWbzI=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/MQQUDLJCWBFYJLAPYZ5EJKRMFM.jpeg" alt="img">
SPRINGFIELD — A tent triage area built to test and house the homeless during the coronavirus pandemic is being shut down this week, as the last “guest” leaves and as the city dodged a feared surge in infections.</p>
<p>The three-tent site on Worthington Street, that was built and erected by the city at a cost of nearly $400,000, will remain standing until at least the end of July, in case of a COVID-19 surge among the homeless, said Helen R. Caulton-Harris, the city’s commissioner of health and human services.</p>
<p>The last “guest,” however, was leaving Wednesday and the tents will officially suspend operations on Saturday, she said.</p>
<p>While the cost was high, the city had to prepare for the worst &ndash; the potential for a high rate of COVID-19 cases among the homeless, said Caulton-Harris and Mayor Domenic J. Sarno.</p>
<p>At the time it was being erected, there were very high rates of infection being reported at shelters in Boston and Worcester, she said.</p>
<p>“I am extremely glad we took the risk,” Caulton-Harris said regarding the city’s decision. “We built the structure because we were concerned about the potential number of homeless individuals that might contract COVID-19.”</p>
<p>The tents were erected in late March, and opened in April, but typically housed just several people at a time, peaking at less than 20, she said.</p>
<p>Ten homeless individuals were found to have COVID-19 out of more than 200 tested from Friends of the Homeless and the Springfield Rescue Mission, officials said.</p>
<p>Two of the tents were designed to house a total of up to 75 people &ndash; one set aside for those testing positive for COVID-19 and one used by those “under investigation,” deemed to potentially have the virus.</p>
<p>Sarno said the city wisely was prepared for the worst, and acted quickly.</p>
<p>“The proof is in the pudding,” Sarno said. “It’s a very vulnerable population and I care very much about that. We were very proactive. I moved on that well a month ahead of time with this coronavirus because, God forbid, it could spread like wildfire.”</p>
<p>The total cost of the tents, to date, is $634,079, including the initial construction and equipment, and the weekly operational costs and supplies, officials said.</p>
<p>The staff at the tents during the past two months included workers from Health Services for the Homeless and Community Support Options, the parent company of Friends of the Homeless, as well as personnel from American Medical Response and the state National Guard.</p>
<p>Caulton-Harris said other options were explored including the use of hotels for the homeless, but the hotels were not receptive and were not deemed viable due to factors such as inside air circulation.</p>
<p>The tents had a high-tech air ventilation system, and air conditioning and heating, washers and dryers, floors, cots, bathrooms, protective and sanitizing equipment, and many other features to house the homeless, officials said.</p>
<p>It was also used in April for testing of the homeless from across the street at the Friends of the Homeless shelter and resource center on Worthington Street.</p>
<p>There was a clinical team there from</p>
<p>Sarno and Caulton-Harris praised Springfield Technical Community College for providing the lot on Worthington Street at a low cost. The agreement ends July 30, unless extension is agreed upon if there was surge of cases, officials said.</p>
<p>The tents will now be deep-cleaned, and be on stand-by, Caulton-Harris said.</p>
<p>City officials said they will seek reimbursements for all costs related to the tents including federal grants and disaster aid.</p>
<p>Most of the COVID-19 cases came from the Rescue Mission, which closed its Taylor Street shelter for two weeks for extensive cleaning, Caulton-Harris said.</p>
<p>Baystate Health and Mercy Medical Center provided testing of the homeless in Springfield.</p>
<p>The low numbers of those having the virus potentially means that Friends of the Homeless and the Rescue Mission were taking the necessary steps to keep their guests safe, she said.</p>
<p>In Springfield, the city is seeing a significant lowering of new COVID-19 cases, Caulton-Harris said.
