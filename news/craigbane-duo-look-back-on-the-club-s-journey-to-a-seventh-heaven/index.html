<p>Craigbane lead Derry&rsquo;s intermediate football roll of honour. Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their 1995 winning captain, has six winner&rsquo;s medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a &lsquo;field of dreams&rsquo; in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costner&rsquo;s 1989 film of the same name.</p>
<p>Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. It&rsquo;s well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning.</p>
<p>Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in 2011, is the club&rsquo;s Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands.</p>
<p>Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the U14s. John Óg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. It&rsquo;s their turn to put a different stamp on the club.</p>
<p>Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost 20 years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the 2001 Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions.</p>
<p>The last decade ravaged Craigbane&rsquo;s senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, they&rsquo;re finding their feet. St Columb&rsquo;s Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patrick&rsquo;s and St Brigid&rsquo;s Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.</p>
<p>Craigbane&rsquo;s 2016 U16 championship winning team</p>
<p>All coming from their U16 championship winning team of 2016, when they beat a fancied Kilrea.</p>
<p>“We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game.</p>
<p>“At the start of the year they beat us by 16 or 17 points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.”</p>
<p>By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver.</p>
<hr>
<p>After early signs of football in the area during the 1930s, St Joseph&rsquo;s Craigbane wasn&rsquo;t founded until 1972 and after a Division Three title, the 1985 reserve success was their first championship.</p>
<p>“We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In 1986, it was the 50th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.”</p>
<p>McGuigan, not yet 17, was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didn&rsquo;t play in the final against Loup.</p>
<p>“The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names.</p>
<p>“Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry &lsquo;Roe&rsquo; McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian O&rsquo;Kane.</p>
<p>“There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds.</p>
<p>With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game.</p>
<p>“I also remember Loup taking home Martin O&rsquo;Brien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.”</p>
<p>With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a &lsquo;huge influence&rsquo; on the team. He had returned from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time.</p>
<p>In 1987, it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colm&rsquo;s sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call.</p>
<p>Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbane&rsquo;s second penalty. Nobody else fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.</p>
<p>The Craigbane team pictured before the 1987 replay win over Claudy</p>
<p>Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers.</p>
<p>“There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a &lsquo;Hail Mary&rsquo; and he (Paul) punched it into the net.</p>
<p>The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, 0-11 to 0-9 and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship.</p>
<p>Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Mary&rsquo;s Belfast&rsquo;s 1989 Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry U21s and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior panel, where he saw some initial action.</p>
<p>While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks weren&rsquo;t enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder &lsquo;a few&rsquo; times added to the woe.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moore&rsquo;s life. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in 1991.</p>
<p>Married and living close to Errigal Ciaran&rsquo;s home in Dunmoyle for the last 25 years, saw him faced with a 70 mile return journey to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots.</p>
<p>“We would&rsquo;ve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to join (Errigal) but I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didn&rsquo;t have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.”</p>
<p>Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Micheala&rsquo;s ladies team.</p>
<p>“I have been at Tyrone (minor) games, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “You&rsquo;ll not get me cheering &lsquo;come on Tyrone&rsquo; or anything like that.”</p>
<p>After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U16 in 1989, it was 1992 before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan.</p>
<p>“It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbane&rsquo;s win.</p>
<p>Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbane&rsquo;s golden era.</p>
<p>An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the 1980s.</p>
<p>“Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers.</p>
<p>“A lot of the young boys in the (winning team) photographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as 1995 senior captain.</p>
<p>“Boys were saying &lsquo;I want to play with our senior team&rsquo; and it was a spur for the parish.”</p>
<p>Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience.</p>
<p>“The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley (McCloskey), Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we would&rsquo;ve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they could&rsquo;ve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a &lsquo;45&rsquo; to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their 2001/02 All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground.</p>
<p>The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the 1995 final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss.</p>
<p>“It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states.</p>
<p>Banagher had only been relegated from the first division, and were billed as favourites. The &lsquo;cream&rsquo; against the &lsquo;second division team.&rsquo;</p>
<p>“There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds.</p>
<p>After the influx, it raised the contentious issue&hellip;was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane?</p>
<p>In the league, Banagher had won &lsquo;close&rsquo; games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of &lsquo;nearly 2,000&rsquo; flocked to Drum for the final.</p>
<p>“We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose.</p>
<p>“Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who would&rsquo;ve been Derry City&rsquo;s fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in.</p>
<p>“It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.”</p>
<p>Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a 12th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.</p>
<p>Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the 1995 final</p>
<p>Banagher lost Patrick O&rsquo;Donnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory.</p>
<p>“It was close in the end, but it didn&rsquo;t reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds.</p>
<p>Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a 1-8 to 1-7 win and title number four.</p>
<p>“I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moore&rsquo;s memory of winning the game.</p>
<p>“Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasn&rsquo;t going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.”</p>
<p>“The boys went over to Farah&rsquo;s (bar) after the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls.</p>
<p>“It would&rsquo;ve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights.</p>
<hr>
<p>The 1996 chapter was different. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay.</p>
<p>By 1997, Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farah&rsquo;s. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home.</p>
<p>There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbane&rsquo;s 1992 winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win.</p>
<p>“I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the 1997 success.</p>
<p>Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell</p>
<p>look on as Conrad McGuigan lifts the 1995 championship</p>
<p>It was 2000 before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Curran&rsquo;s shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle.</p>
<p>“We should&rsquo;ve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through, if it had went over the bar, we were out.”</p>
<p>A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy.</p>
<p>Fergal Crossan&rsquo;s also return for the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team.</p>
<p>Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbane&rsquo;s first venture following delay because of foot and mouth.</p>
<p>“I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers.</p>
<p>It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team.</p>
<p>“We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moore&rsquo;s tongue, of their passage to glory.</p>
<p>“Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their 1-9 to 1-7 win.</p>
<p>“We beat Beragh 2-15 to &lsquo;five or six&rsquo; points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh weren&rsquo;t long down from senior&hellip;it was probably the easiest game we played.”</p>
<p>Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of 42, having picked up a fifth medal and a second Ulster in 2011, as part of a panel managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory.</p>
<p>Conrad finished up in 2008, aged 43, but after having a &lsquo;great innings&rsquo;, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the club&rsquo;s seventh championship.</p>
<p>“I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldn&rsquo;t have been playing (in 2011), but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.”</p>
<p>Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright.</p>
<p>“There is enough talent within our club, if we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.”</p>
<p>When Gavin Conwell lifted the Ulster Cup on a magical 2011 night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the &lsquo;young weans&rsquo; could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasn&rsquo;t. It was time to strike when the iron was hot.</p>
<p>A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbane&rsquo;s next team to challenge for a championship.</p>

SINGAPORE - For the last two months, Catherine Kwek has been on long walks every weekend to fill the void left by her inability to play golf.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old, who works in logistics, will soon be able to return to her passion, after sports facilities were on Monday (June 15) given the green light to reopen on Friday.</p>
<p>These include stadiums, swimming complexes, sports halls, hard courts, gyms, fitness studios and bowling centres. This guidance also applies to similar facilities in private settings such as condominiums and golf and country clubs.</p>
<p>Kwek, who used to play golf thrice a week, told The Straits Times: &ldquo;Over the weekends, it was definitely a must to golf, so not playing golf during the weekend over the last two months felt like something was missing and I was getting withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited and looking forward to playing golf again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sports facilities here have been closed since April 7, when the circuit breaker measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus kicked in. These facilities remained shut during the Republic&rsquo;s first phase of reopening, which started from June 2.</p>
<p>The reopening of sports facilities is subject to individuals maintaining safe distancing of at least one metre at all times. Where this is not feasible or practical, such as in group training for team sports such as football, this one-metre requirement can instead be enforced between groups, with each group made up of no more than five persons and with no mixing between groups.</p>
<p>Members of the sports community were pleased to hear the news, with some stressing that individuals must still act responsibly despite the easing of restrictions.</p>
<p>Rajesh Mulani, co-owner of The Cage, an indoor football facility, told The Straits Times: &ldquo;For a contact sport like football, it&rsquo;s going to be challenging to get a game going, so it&rsquo;ll likely be that academies can start with some technical work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he and his partner plan to offer football fitness training for adults &ldquo;just to give football addicts a little bit of relief before we get to the stage where contact is allowed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key is to do it sensibly - to be able to manage crowds, have dedicated entrances and exits, temperature screening and cleaning between groups,&rdquo; he stressed.</p>

<p>Clement Teo, coach of Singapore Premier League club Hougang United, said the club would probably divide its players into groups of five when they resume training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re breaking them into defenders, midfielders and strikers, and the strikers will be with the goalkeepers,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very important for us to be socially responsible - it&rsquo;s been a long time but we can&rsquo;t let our hair down just like this, we still need to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some, like Singapore Hockey Federation (SHF) president Mathavan Devadas, are waiting for further guidance from Sport Singapore (SportSG). SportSG, which runs most public sports facilities as well as governs sports and exercise policy in the Republic, is expected to issue an advisory on its guidelines for the safe return to sporting action soon.</p>
<p>The SHF is preparing a document on how to return to hockey safely, which will include hygiene measures and drills that can be done when training resumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still need guidance from ActiveSG before we finalise the document and send it to affiliates, as the venues belong to SportSG,&rdquo; said Mathavan.</p>
<p>Sean Tan, chairman of the board and director of True Group, which owns and operates the 10 True Fitness and TFX gyms in Singapore, is &ldquo;raring to go&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all ready, it&rsquo;s a matter of what the specific details for the controls for gyms and fitness studios are. We have different contingency plans in place. The devil is in the details. It&rsquo;s good that we are opening up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carol Cabal, co-founder of boutique gym Tribody Fitness, welcomed the announcement but was also apprehensive at the same time.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;We understand that some of our clients are not comfortable with returning, while others are excited. They have to be comfortable again to do the usual thing they did so we will be patient and we are here to cater to their needs.&rdquo;

In the wake of the news that Colin Kaepernick is on the San Diego Chargers’ workout list, odds on his next team and whether or not he’ll be signed before the start of the regular season shifted, according to sportsbetting.ag.</p>
<p>Kaepernick, 32, who started protesting social injustice and police brutality by first sitting and then kneeling during the national anthem in the 2016 exhibition season, hasn’t played over the past three seasons.</p>
<p>Chargers coach Anthony Lynn told reporters on Wednesday that Kaepernick will be on the Charger’s summer workout list and that teams “would be crazy” not to workout Kaepernick, who guided the 49ers to the Super Bowl XLVII.</p>

<p>Kaepernick led the 49ers back from a 17-0 deficit against the Falcons in the NFC Championship game to a 28-24 win on Jan. 20, 2013.</p>
<p>The Ravens favored to sign Kaepernick, but odds suggest he won&rsquo;t be with a team by Week 1.</p>
<p>The Chargers were initially at plus-800, but the odd increased to plus-450 after Lynn’s comments.</p>
<p>Here are the odds:</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-gyms-sports-academies-welcome-news-of-possible-resumption-most-planning-new-safety-measures">&ldquo;Coronavirus: Gyms, sports academies welcome news of possible resumption; most planning new safety measures&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/05/29/ycswim290520.jpg?itok=9NohI7KX" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - After an agonising two months, members of the sports and fitness industry are finally seeing a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>This follows National Development Minister Lawrence Wong&rsquo;s announcement on Thursday (May 28) that the move to Phase 2 of the post-circuit breaker measures, which also mean an easing of of restrictions around sports facilities, could be done before July.</p>
<p>Mr Sean Tan, director of the True Group, said the sports and fitness industry has been given &ldquo;renewed hope&rdquo; by the announcement.</p>
<p>The True Group, which runs 10 gyms in Singapore, saw its revenue in April and May plummet by more than 85 per cent, but Mr Tan and his staff have spent the circuit breaker period attending international fitness webinars and interacting with overseas operators to learn best practices, in anticipation of resuming operations.</p>
<p>They have also have been refining plans for measures like safe distancing, restrictions on group class sizes and capacity controls, which True had put in place before the circuit breaker period.</p>
<p>Yet, Mr Tan and most operators The Straits Time spoke to are adopting a cautious approach to a possible reopening, and are anticipating a slow recovery.</p>
<p>Mr Anil Chugani, the country manager of Fitness First Singapore, said that while surveys of its members found that most are looking forward to returning to the gym environment, the chain is also aware that most people will continue to work from home even in Phase 2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As such, one of the strategies we have in mind is to continue with the creation of online content so members can continue to gain access to their favourite programmes and instructors when they are working from home or if getting to a club will not be convenient,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With the likelihood that some form of safe distancing measures will still be required, Ms Radhika Radhakrishnan, chief financial officer of private football academy F17, said it has made plans to reduce the number of participants per class and assign a maximum of five kids to each coach, down from the usual 12.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not getting my hopes high, as safety is the priority,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am worried that there might be a second wave (of Covid infections), so even if we do not start before July, it&rsquo;s fine. It is better to be safe than sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Singapore swimming icon Ang Peng Siong, the managing director of the APS Swim School, said it would continue measures it had introduced before the circuit breaker period, such as setting up hand sanitiser stations around the pool area and ensuring social distancing measures and regular temperature taking.</p>
<p>He pointed out that there has been no evidence suggesting that the virus can be spread through chlorinated water. However, others have noted that while that may be the case, swimming does not preclude interactions outside the water, at areas such as the poolside and in changing rooms.</p>
<p>Mr Ang added that the school, which operates at the Farrer Park Swimming Complex, will still take extra steps, such as equipping its swim teachers with diving gloves, face shields and waterproof face masks.</p>
<p>Still, he expects some customers to stay away for the time being, and estimated it would take between six and 12 months before operations &ldquo;get back to normal&rdquo;. Because of this, government aid to alleviate any additional costs from new protocols &ldquo;would be useful&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already come out from our pockets in terms of the salary for our employees and the maintenance of the facility,&rdquo; said Mr Ang, who added that the school has no intention of increasing its fees. &ldquo;I think most businesses want to do their part to ensure that things do not get worse when we open up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Russell Harrison, owner and managing director of Spartans Boxing Club, said he is eager to learn from the Government what is required of gyms before operations can resume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a gym owner&rsquo;s perspective, the sooner we can get clarity on what we can do, the better it would be,&rdquo; he said, adding that the added cost of implementing any new measures or protocols was not a concern for his outfit.</p>

<p>Mr Chugani said Fitness First - which closed its 19 clubs on March 27 - was &ldquo;unable to ascertain&rdquo; how the cost of its operations would be affected as details from the Government on resumption of operations for gyms have not been shared.</p>
<p>Mr Tan, meanwhile, said that while it is inevitable some added measures will add &ldquo;some costs&rdquo; to operations, he believes they are necessary.</p>
<p>He added that True does not intend to pass on any possible additional costs of operation to its customers and would absorb them. But he felt that government subsidies would be required by most business operators if the authorities mandated gyms &ldquo;put in place measures that go beyond what is commonly being used today around the world&rdquo;.

Good evening,</p>
<p>If I had to suffer through this thread of college football coaches as girls, then so do you:</p>
<p>I am absolutely cackling at this one:</p>
<p>I can’t unsee it. Excellent Photoshop work.</p>
<p>Alright, let’s jump into today’s headlines.</p>
<p>From around Land-Grant Holy Land&hellip;</p>
<p>Madden NFL 21 trailer features Chase Young</p>
<p>Tia Johnston, LGHL</p>
<p>The SB Nation theme of the week is “Video Games” and, coincidentally, EA Sports released its highly anticipated trailer for Madden NFL 21 on Tuesday. I, a video game expert, tell you all about the new game and what people are saying about the new features.</p>
<p>Video Game Week: Predicting top Buckeyes and rookie ratings in Madden 21</p>
<p>Gene Ross, LGHL</p>
<p>Speaking of Madden, Gene took a stab at predicting the ratings of some of the top Buckeyes in the game, and how the rookies will stack up in their first ever appearance.</p>
<p>Play Like a Girl podcast: Systemic racism in college football</p>
<p>Tia Johnston and Meredith Hein, LGHL</p>
<p>Systemic racism is alive and well in college football (as we’ve been seeing more and more in the media lately) and the only way to change the system is to bring awareness to it. No more turning a blind eye, friends.</p>
<p>From around the gridiron&hellip;</p>
<p>College football’s possible upsets during the 2020 season</p>
<p>Brad Crawford, Bucknuts</p>
<p>Crawford listed some potential upsets that could occur within the Power Five this season, and Nebraska at Ohio State made the list. Here’s his reasoning:</p>
<p>“The Buckeyes have several tough games this season that, at least on the surface, appear more challenging than this one. It was foolish to include this game in last season’s preseason upset alert list, but the conditions were ripe — prime-time home game for the Huskers, lots of build-up in Scott Frost’s second campaign. Then Nebraska flatlined quickly against the eventual Big Ten champs. What makes the 2020 installment of the one-sided rivalry any different? For starters, Nebraska goes to Columbus last in the year coming off what should be a win at Rutgers. Ohio State plays at Penn State the previous week, one of those nationally-ranked showdowns Buckeyes coaches hope doesn’t linger should they falter in Happy Valley.”</p>
<p>Five-star RB TreVeyon Henderson’s commitment influenced why Ohio State football’s 2021 class ‘shoots for high goals’: Buckeyes Recruiting Roundup</p>
<p>Stephen Means, Cleveland.com</p>
<p>Ohio State 2021 RB commit TreVeyon Henderson has been giving Mark Pantoni a run for his money. Every day, it seems, Henderson takes to Twitter to recruit guys to Ohio State. He’s hyped up his recruiting class so much so, that the new agreement between all 18 commits is “three championships.” I can get on board that goal.</p>
<p>“He’s one of the hardest workers I’ve ever worked with”: The story of why and how Miyan Williams underwent a substantial seven-month physical transformation</p>
<p>Zack Carpenter, Eleven Warriors</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the best photos from the players returning to the Woody Hayes facility last week was of Miyan Williams and his insane transformation:</p>
<p>Miyan Williams in April 2019 vs. Miyan Williams in June 2020 pic.twitter.com/XQEXRhdcyh — Zack Carpenter (@Zack_Carp) June 8, 2020</p>
<p>Williams dropped 21 pounds (240 to 219) without losing muscle mass or size. Carpenter has the story on what motivated him and how he did it—including his workout splits and diet plan (which is laid out very specifically if you’d like to follow it) (you will not want to follow it).</p>
<p>Finebaum, Kellerman sound off on Buckeye players signing waivers</p>
<p>Dave Biddle, Bucknuts</p>
<p>A few days ago, Ohio State’s football players were asked to sign waivers stating that they will follow all safety protocol, and if they do still contract the coronavirus, the university is not liable. Obviously, there was mixed feelings about this in the media. Obviously, all the criticism is coming from the likes of Paul Finebaum.</p>
<p>“(Athletic director) Gene Smith and Ohio State is saying we’re responsible and we’ll make it safe for you when you’re in our place. But if you go out into the community, if you go into a nightclub, if you go to a bar, that’s not on us,” Finebaum said.</p>
<p>It’ll be interesting to see whether or not Finebaum changes his tune once the inevitable happens and, as Biddle mentions, most college football programs (if not all) follow suit.</p>
<p>C.J. Saunders can do more than lead for Buckeyes</p>
<p>Spencer Holbrook, Lettermen Row</p>
<p>From his voice within the Black Lives Matter movement, and his efforts as team captain last season, there’s no doubt that C.J. Saunders is a born leader.</p>
<p>Last year, he was forced to lead from the sideline due to injury. This year (his sixth year of eligibility) he is healthy and more than ready to lead his team both on and off the field.</p>
<p>DI Council approves college football preseason model</p>
<p>Ohio State and the rest of the college football scene will be allowed to return to the practice field in some capacity next month, as the NCAA Division I Council has approved a six-week preseason model beginning on July 13. Formal practices will resume on Aug. 7. As of right now, the first game of the year is still scheduled for Sept. 5.</p>

<p>ESPN lied again.</p>
<p>The former Michigan point guard and high school teammate of Jared Sullinger won’t play for @CarmensCrew. But there could be at least one more big fish out there for the team to land. https://t.co/0TZWG91lXB — Patrick Murphy (@_Pat_Murphy) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>Despite there being rumors across the Twittersphere (caused by ESPN— a so-called “reputable” sports network) that former Michigan point guard Trey Burke would be joining Carmen’s Crew in TBT this season, Burke put them to rest on Twitter Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>From everywhere else&hellip;</p>
<p>Four Ohio State Women’s Soccer commits have been named Gatorade State Girls Soccer Players of the Year.</p>
<p>Lauren Brown, senior forward/midfielder from Wisconsin; Chloe DeLyser, senior forward from New York; Kailyn Dudukovich, junior forward from Ohio; and Zoe Vidaurre, junior defender/midfielder from DC have all been named 2019-2020 Gatorade State Girls Player of the Year honors in their respective home states.</p>
<p>All four are up for the Gatorade National Girls Soccer Player of the Year award, being announced next week. Previous winners of the national award have combined for 17 gold medals and eight national championships.</p>
<p>Yeah because that’s what the world needs right now&hellip;

<h3 id="the-new-england-patriots-are-still-the-favorite-to-land-cam-newton">&ldquo;The New England Patriots Are Still the Favorite to Land Cam Newton&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sportscasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cam-Newton.jpg" alt="img">
As of this writing, the New England Patriots are planning to go with Jarrett Stidham as their starting quarterback for the 2020 season. Gone is Tom Brady, who bolted for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after guiding the Pats to six Super Bowl championships. Although Stidham is penciled in as New England’s starter, one sportsbook has the Patriots as the significant favorite to sign free-agent quarterback Cam Newton this year.</p>
<p>Can Jarrett Stidham lead the Patriots?</p>
<p>RELATED: Cam Newton and Jadeveon Clowney Went From No. 1 Picks to NFL Ghosts</p>
<p>The NFL resume isn’t quite there yet for Jarrett Stidham, the second-year quarterback out of Auburn. Stidham began his college football career at Baylor, but transferred to Aburn, playing two strong seasons for the Tigers.</p>
<p>In his first season at Auburn, Stidham completed 66.5 percent of his passes and threw for 3,158 yards and 18 touchdowns. He followed that up with another strong junior season as he matched his 18 touchdowns and threw for 2,794 yards in one less game. Stidham was drafted in the fourth round by the Patriots in the 2019 NFL draft.</p>
<p>Playing behind Tom Brady, Stidham saw little action in his first year in the NFL. He threw four passes, completing two. He had one interception. Veteran Brian Hoyer was brought back to compete for the starting job. The quarterback situation in New England is shaky at best.</p>
<p>Cam Newton is available</p>
<p>it IS béttér TÖ bé PRÊPARÊD fôr AN ôppôrtun1ty &amp; nôt HAVÊ ôné … THAN tô HAVÊ àn ÖPPÖRTUN1TY ànd NÖT béPRÊPARÊD‼️</p>
<p>•wh1tnéyM.yöung• pic.twitter.com/0bGZmAIdSs — Cameron 1 Newton (@CameronNewton) June 16, 2020</p>
<p>If the New England Patriots, or any other team for that matter, was looking for a veteran quarterback, Cam Newton remains unsigned. Newton was the MVP of the league in 2015 and guided the Carolina Panthers to a berth in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Also available is former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who hasn’t played in the league since 2016. Rumors have been swirling that the Los Angeles Chargers might be bringing him in for a workout. If Kaepernick hooks on with the Chargers, Newton, by far, is the best and most experienced quarterback on the market.</p>
<p>Newton, who was limited to two games because of a foot injury last year, underwent successful surgery and appears healthy. He tweeted two pictures of himself working out and wrote, “It’s better to be prepared for an opportunity and not have one than to have an opportunity and not be prepared.”</p>
<p>The Patriots are favored to land Newton</p>
<p>People forget Cam Newton is still a free agent pic.twitter.com/MqWy8FlaOk — DraftKings Sportsbook (@DKSportsbook) June 8, 2020</p>
<p>Nearly three weeks ago, a source told ESPN‘s Jeremy Fowler that the market to sign veteran quarterback Cam Newton had cooled. Those sources also said they weren’t sure if Newton would be open to taking on a backup role. In either case, Newton was planning to play the waiting game.</p>
<p>DraftKings Sportsbook posted odds on the next landing spot for Newton. The New England Patriots were a significant favorite at +300, meaning you would wager $100 to make $300. After the Patriots, the next teams are the Arizona Cardinals, Pittsburgh Steelers, Tennessee Titans, and Washington Redskins, all at +800.

<h3 id="heres-where-the-jets-land-on-espns-football-power-index-for-2020-season">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where the Jets land on ESPN&rsquo;s Football Power Index for 2020 season&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://content.sny.tv/assets/images/4/0/0/312307400/cuts/750x422/cut.jpg" alt="img">
ESPN released its annual &ldquo;Football Power Index&rdquo; for the first time ahead of the 2020 NFL season. It accounts for everything from Vegas Sportbooks&rsquo; win totals for each team, last season&rsquo;s stats and much more.</p>
<p>While GM Joe Douglas brought in some solid reinforcements this offseason, the power index wasn&rsquo;t too kind to the Jets.</p>
<p>After running through the calculations, the Jets fell in at No. 25 on the list of 32 teams. They are projected to have 6.8 wins this season, and only hold a 24 percent chance of making the playoffs.</p>
<p>A big reason the Jets were ranked this low is due to their brutal schedule in 2020. They fall in with the second-hardest schedule, according to the FPI, with the Denver Broncos owning the hardest one. New York will have to not only face the New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills &ndash; two tough divisional teams &ndash; twice this season, it also must take on both Super Bowl teams from last season in the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, as well as the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams to name a few.</p>
<p>Looking at the AFC East, the Patriots &ndash; despite losing Tom Brady &ndash; still sits in the Top 10 at No. 9 overall. The Bills, though, are right behind them at No. 10. The Miami Dolphins are in at No. 27 to round out the division.</p>
<p>The FPI might be counting the Jets out, but there is a very good chance they could be a playoff team despite their schedule. For one, head coach Adam Gase will have his QB Sam Darnold in his offense for the second straight year. And he will have a revamped offensive line and a couple better options in the passing game courtesy of Douglas&rsquo; roster building.</p>
<p>Mix that offense with a solid defense that should return C.J. Mosley and Avery Williamson up the middle at the linebacker positions. Also, Jamal Adams is always a game-wrecker at strong safety under Gregg Williams&rsquo; scheme.</p>
<p>This Jets squad went on a run last season that was a couple games too late. To go 7-9 after starting off terribly was a feat in itself, and you can bet the entire team wants to build off that heading into 2020.</p>
