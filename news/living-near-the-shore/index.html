<h3 id="how-blooms-of-northern-anchovies-are-helping-bring-more-sea-life-back-to-burrard-inlet">&ldquo;How blooms of northern anchovies are helping bring more sea life back to Burrard Inlet&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5610866.1592008181!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/white-rock-pier-seagulls-feed-on-anchovies.jpg" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s not easy to spot northern anchovies in murky sea water, but a school of these 10-centimetre-long fish can often set off a frenzy of hungry seabirds and sea mammals that reveals their underwater dance.</p>
<p>The sight of anchovy scales catching the glint of the sun is becoming more common in B.C. waters, marine biologists say, and that could be drawing other, bigger species back to busy waterways like the Burrard Inlet in Metro Vancouver.</p>
<p>Rod MacVicar is convinced the fish helped lure a humpback whale closer to the shores of Port Moody, B.C., than he&rsquo;s ever seen, just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>MacVicar, a marine biologist and co-founder of the Mossom Creek Hatchery in Port Moody, says he recently spotted a school of anchovies and netted a few of them to be sure — positively identifying the 10-centimetre-long fish by their &ldquo;inferior shark-like&rdquo; mouths.</p>
<p>He believes warming sea water is enabling anchovies to re-establish near his home.</p>
<p>Northern anchovies, once a food source for Indigenous people living in what is now the Burrard Inlet, were more common south of B.C. over the past century.</p>
<p>But University of Victoria researcher Will Duguid, who studies chinook salmon ecology, published a study late last year showing the number of anchovies in the Salish Sea increasing in tandem with sea temperatures.</p>
<p>He is not surprised that anchovies are showing up in the Burrard Inlet, Indian Arm and near the shores of Port Moody.</p>
<p>Unusual suspects: These two fish are northern anchovies, a species of fish that&rsquo;s a food source for everything from sea mammals to salmon, and they&rsquo;re showing up more often in the Burrard and Port Moody Inlets. (Rod MacVicar)</p>
<p>A 10-centimetre-long fish represents an anchovy that&rsquo;s about a year old. MacVicar believes that indicates the fish spawned locally in the pelagic zone, or upper, warmer zone of the seawater.</p>
<p>He says temperatures in the harbour have been rising consistently since 2016. While, generally, rising ocean temperature are seen as negative as the change can bleach coral and jeopardize breeding grounds, MacVicar says the warmer waters in the harbour of the Port Moody arm of Burrard Inlet may be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; for anchovies. He monitors the area and says it&rsquo;s often 17 C.</p>
<p>Light show attracts predators</p>
<p>Anchovies often provide &ldquo;conspicuous shows&rdquo; near shore, drawing predators to feed, as seen near the White Rock pier last December.</p>
<p>Duiguid says a school of anchovies is unmistakable because the fish flare their gill covers as they feed on plankton, providing &ldquo;conspicuous shows&rdquo; and drawing predators to feed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It almost looks like you are looking at the stands at a sports game with all the flash bulbs going off and they are all exactly the same size and shape of flashes,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In Port Moody, MacVicar says the anchovies are attracting dozens of Arctic Sabine&rsquo;s gulls and, this past week, a pigeon guillemot, a bird more common to the open ocean.</p>
<p>He says he&rsquo;s seeing more sea lions and seals in the area, and with them, potentially, come transient, mammal-eating orcas.</p>
<p>But his biggest treat came a few weeks ago, when he got to witness a humpback feed for hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time in my lifetime, I saw a humpback whale feeding in Port Moody,&rdquo; MacVicar said.</p>
<p>A humpback whale was spotted feeding for hours in Indian Arm and Port Moody Inlet on May 21, 2020. 0:23</p>
<p>MacVicar said a reduction in pollution in the waters off Port Moody may also be helping the fish — as well as other species like sea urchins and sea cucumbers — reappear.</p>
<p>Effect on salmon</p>
<p>Historically, the numbers of anchovies seem to rise as salmon stocks fall, but it&rsquo;s not clear if an increase in their numbers will help or hurt the larger fish. Researchers are hopeful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are an alternative food source for salmon and they increase the diversity of the prey base, so I don&rsquo;t imagine them having a negative effect. It&rsquo;s quite possible they will have a positive effect,&rdquo; said Duguid.</p>
<p>MacVicar says the anchovy &ldquo;bloom&rdquo; is likely protecting the salmon fry that swim from the hatcheries into the inlet each year, by distracting predators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice the seals are just about filled up on anchovies, so it probably is reducing the [predatory] pressure on salmon,&rdquo; said MacVicar.</p>
<p>If northern anchovies re-establish long term, they could potentially feed more than seals. Anchovies sustain the world&rsquo;s largest fishery in South America and could offer an alternative to B.C.&rsquo;s herring fishery, MacVicar says.</p>
<p>Dan Greenwood of Red Boat Charters saw this sea lion near Deep Cove. He says he is seeing orca pods, sea lions and seals in Burrard Inlet, Indian Arm and the inlet in Port Moody. (Red Boat Charters)</p>
<p>This orca was seen at Admiralty Point, off Barnet Marine Park on May 28, 2020. 0:44

<p><img src="https://www.coastmountainnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/21863299_web1_190715-GNG-MartinPayne2-1024x683.jpg" alt="img">
‘I don’t want to constantly have to be on guard,’ residents react to murder charges</p>
<p>A few Metchosin residents are speaking out after the William Head prison escapees from July 2019 have been charged with the first-degree murder of Martin Payne, 60. (Martin Payne/Facebook)</p>
<p>Tanya Young still thinks she hears noises outside her Metchosin home in the wee morning hours.</p>
<p>It’s only been a few days since West Shore RCMP officially charged William Head’s prison escapees with the murder of 60-year-old Martin Payne, but it’s been nearly a year since Young has felt completely safe in her community.</p>
<p>Occasionally, she checks the security cameras she and her husband installed to make sure there’s nothing to worry about at night, but safety is an utmost concern for the mother of two. She’s also bought floodlights for the property.</p>
<p>“We had just moved into our forever home with our toddler and baby,” said Young, who moved to Metchosin a month before the prison escape. “[When] the police came to our home to ask questions we were completely freaked. With it being so close to home it was frightening.”</p>
<p>RELATED: William Head prison escapees charged in homicide of Metchosin man</p>
<p>On June 13, police announced the charges of first-degree murder against James Lee Busch and Zachary Armitage.</p>
<p>Busch, who was 42 at the time, and Armitage, who was 30, broke out of the prison in the early evening of July 7, 2019, according to Correctional Services Canada.</p>
<p>The escapees were found two days later after commenting on an off-duty Mountie’s dog in Esquimalt. At the time of escape, Busch was serving a sentence for second-degree murder and assault and had previously served time for aggravated sexual assault and escaping custody.</p>
<p>Armitage was serving a 13-year, 10-month sentence for robbery, aggravated assault and other offences.</p>

<p>On July 12, four days after the inmates were found, West Shore RCMP found Martin Payne’s body inside his home after he failed to show up for work. His death was considered suspicious and most residents in the area voiced their concerns due to the fact that they weren’t notified of the escape until nearly 12 hours later over Facebook.</p>
<p>Though the head of Correctional Service Canada said security at the minimum-security facility has improved and has expressed her “deepest sympathies” to Payne’s family, some residents are hesitant to trust again.</p>
<p>“The real tragedy is that a sweet and kind man lost his life,” said Paula Leweke, a Metchosin resident for the past 11 years. “I believe the whole situation was totally mismanaged.”</p>
<p>Cid Lang, a resident since July 2019, said one of the biggest reasons she moved to Metchosin was to get away from a federal prison she felt unsafe living nearby in California.</p>
<p>“I thought the biggest issues we had to worry about were bears and cougars,” Lang quipped. “I love this community so much and I didn’t want to constantly have to be on guard, but now I feel afraid.”</p>

<p>While Shari Rourke believes the escape and following murder was tragic, she doesn’t expect it to happen again.</p>
<p>“I 100 per cent feel safe in my neighbourhood,” said the resident who grew up in the Mary Hill area, a former range and training area for Canadian Forces Esquimalt right across from the prison. Now, she lives near Pedder Bay.</p>
<p>“As long as the prison has the opportunity to ensure that dangerous felons with a high risk to re-offend are not placed in it, we do not need to worry.”</p>
<p>At the end of September 2019, it was revealed in court that a Correctional Services Canada analysis deemed Armitage fit for a medium-security institution but that an override was recommended and he was moved to William Head in April 2018.</p>

Ahmedabad, June 3</p>
<p>Nearly 50,000 people living in coastal areas of South Gujarat and some 4,000 residents of the neighbouring Union Territory of Daman have so far been shifted to safer places ahead of the approaching cyclonic storm &lsquo;Nisarga&rsquo;, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Police have been deployed on all the beaches in Gujarat&rsquo;s coastal belt and people have been asked to remain indoors, they said.</p>
<p>As many as 50,000 living near the coastline in South Gujarat have already been shifted to safer places while work is in progress to evacuate more people, Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue, Pankaj Kumar said.</p>
<p>The cyclone would have maximum impact on the coastal districts of Valsad and Navsari, followed Bharuch and Surat, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is expected that the wind speed will remain between 100 and 110 kmph in Valsad and Navsari when the cyclone hits the coast between south Gujarat and north Maharashtra.</p>
<p>All the fishermen have already been called back from the sea.</p>
<p>Salt-pan workers along with shrimp farmworkers have also been shifted to safer locations,&rdquo; Kumar said in a statement.</p>
<p>Besides, some 4,000 people living close to the sea shore in the adjoining Union Territory of Daman have also been shifted to safer places, another official said.</p>
<p>The nearly 50,000 people evacuated so far in Gujarat include 32,000 from Valsad district alone.</p>

<p>While the cyclone is expected to cross the state coast in the afternoon, light rain started in most parts of Valsad and Navsari districts since morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have shifted nearly 32,000 people living close to the sea shore to temporary shelters. The weather is cloudy at present but winds have not started yet,&rdquo; Valsad collector R R Raval said.</p>
<p>As many as 15 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and six teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed at different locations to help local administration in relief and rescue works, Kumar said.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, about 236 large hoardings and 120 high mast lights have been removed from Surat, Valsad and other towns of coastal region, he said.</p>
<p>Around 250 ambulances and 170 emergency medical teams have been kept on stand-by in the South Gujarat region to address any eventuality, the official said.</p>
<p>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated that the cyclone may not make a landfall on the Gujarat coast.</p>
<p>However, it will have an impact in the form of gusty winds coupled with heavy rainfall in the coastal belt.</p>
<p>As per the latest IMD release, the cyclonic storm ‘Nisarga’ over East Central Arabian Sea is currently around 460 km from Surat.</p>
<p>It will cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar and Daman, close to Alibaug of Maharashtra during the afternoon, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 100 to 110 kmph, it said.</p>
<p>The state MeT Centre said the cyclone will cause heavy rain in several parts of South Gujarat on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Barring the South Gujarat region, the cyclone will not have much impact in rest of the state, state MeT centre director Jayanta Sarkar said. PTI

In her first television interview after being ousted, the former manager of Florida’s coronavirus dashboard gave greater detail about her firing, alleging she tried to speak up after she was told by superiors to manipulate data so rural counties could reopen sooner.</p>
<p>Rebekah Jones, who helped create the Florida Department of Health data portal that represented the spread of the coronavirus in the state, told CNN’s Chris Cuomo she was fired May 5 after she gave her superiors results on data in Florida’s rural counties that “didn’t match the report for reopening that had already been written.”</p>
<p>The day before she was fired, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) announced the state would begin to reopen. DeSantis has said Jones was fired because she was insubordinate.</p>
<p>“What she was doing was, she was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn’t believe was valid data,” DeSantis told reporters Wednesday. “So she didn’t listen to the people who were her superiors — she had many people above her in the chain of command.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asking me to delete data, and hide information, and make it publicly inaccessible was a bad decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the CNN interview Friday night, Jones disputed the governor’s characterization, saying she told her superiors they were making “the wrong call” by manipulating data.</p>
<p>“If refusing to mislead the public during a public health crisis is insubordination, then I will wear that badge with honor,” she told Cuomo.</p>
<p>DeSantis defended the state’s efforts, saying he was basing his reopening decisions on data and taking a more cautious approach than other governors in the region. After a sharp drop in April while stay-at-home orders were in effect, Florida’s daily confirmed cases have largely flatlined, even as the state has expanded its testing capacity.

<p><img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4979278.1591842739!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg" alt="img">
WINNIPEG &ndash; Hundreds of dead carp are washing up on the shores around Lake Winnipeg, but one ecologist in Manitoba says it may actually be a good thing.</p>
<p>In the past three weeks residents living along the shores of the south basin of Lake Winnipeg have witnessed an odd sight – dead carp have washed up on the beaches. Now scientists in the province are searching for answers as to what might have caused the mass of fish deaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really shocked,&rdquo; said Geraldine Horbas, a resident who lives on the lake front near Beaconia Beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get the odd catfish now and then throughout the summer, but I&rsquo;ve never seen that many dead fish all at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Submitted: Gealdine Horbas)</p>
<p>She said the first time she noticed the fish there were about 10 washed up on shore. She said the number has been growing since then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad that there is something terribly wrong with our lake. I believe something weird is going with the lake, because the lake is very sick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I say something fishy is going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PROVINCE INVESTIGATING MASS FISH DEATHS</p>
<p>The province&rsquo;s Wildlife and Fisheries Branch is investigating the possible cause of the die-off.</p>
<p>The province has taken tissue samples and will be looking for two viruses which common carp are susceptible to. One of the viruses known as the Koi Herpes Virus has been documented in Manitoba before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not know the cause until the tissue analysis is completed, which will take approximately two weeks,&rdquo; provincial spokesperson John Neufeld told CTV News.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Canada&rsquo;s Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans told CTV News that it has received reports of the dead fish showing up on the shores of Lake Winnipeg between Netley-Libau Marsh and Victoria Beach.</p>
<p>(Submitted: Geraldine Horbas)</p>
<p>They said the ministry is working with Manitoba to determine the cause of the death.</p>
<p>While the province works to discover the cause, local rural municipalities are left to wait, and deal with the decomposing fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see if the provincial people find out what it is, or if we have to do the cleanup,&rdquo; said RM of St. Clements Mayor Debbie Fiebelkorn, who heard about the fish this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of time along the shoreline, we don&rsquo;t do the cleanup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She encouraged residents who come across the dead fish in the meantime to use a shovel or rake to push them out of the way. She said they are waiting for direction from the province on how to clean up the fish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is just hundreds of them – it is unbelievable,&rdquo; said Dave Horbas, a councillor in the RM of St. Clements.</p>
<p>CARP KILL COULD BE A GOOD THING</p>
<p>Scott Forbes, an ecologist and professor of biology at the University of Winnipeg, said it is unclear what is causing the deaths, which he said is likely in the thousands.</p>
<p>He said he heard of reports that fish were dying as early as three weeks ago and says the water would have been too cold for the Koi Herpes Virus to survive in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at a bit of a loss. I don&rsquo;t know if the carp are still dying and if they are, that makes it even more puzzling,&rdquo; Forbes said.</p>
<p>He suggested another potential cause of the fish kill could be anoxia, which is a lack of oxygen in the water.</p>
<p>While the cause of the death has yet to be determined, Forbes said there is no need to be concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carp are an invasive species, and they are quite ecologically destructive, and so the fewer carp the better,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sight of dead and rotting carp is always unpleasant and nobody likes that, but there is really no concern over carp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Submitted: Geraldine Horbas)</p>
<p>He said there is no human health concern to the viruses being investigated either, Forbes said, though Manitobans may want to avoid the water for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they last into swimming season, you don&rsquo;t want to be swimming around a bunch of dead fish,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In general, other than the unpleasant odour, it is not a big health concern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geraldine said between the smell and the pile of fish, she will be avoiding the beach for now.
