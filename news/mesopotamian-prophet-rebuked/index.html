<p>The huge human cost of the coronavirus pandemic, the economic shock brought about by high levels of unemployment and business closures, and the suffocating to death of a black man by a white police officer in Minneapolis have created a perfect storm in America: like the death of Mohamed Bouazizi, the Tunisian hawker who set himself on fire in an act of protest against police corruption and ill-treatment (an incident that ignited what is referred to as the Arab Spring in the Middle East and North Africa), the death of George Floyd has sparked an “American Spring” of sorts, with protesters demanding racial justice and equality in a country that has been divided along colour lines for four centuries, since the first slave ship arrived on America’s shores.</p>
<p>A week after Floyd’s murder, the streets of American cities were flooded with paramilitary security forces known as the National Guard, which shot at protestors. Many stunned Africans could not believe the kinds of scenes being played out in the United States – riots on streets, burning of shops and cars, and a leader under siege by citizens who, in the middle of a pandemic, have thrown caution to the wind and taken to the streets in anger, defying social distancing directives.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump, who has all the traits of a narcissistic African Big Man, threatened to call in the military to quell the violence. (If this had happened in an African country, the international media would have had no hesitation in labelling him a dictator.) America is beginning to look like a failed African state.</p>
<p>Protests across the United States, some of which have turned ugly and resulted in a number of deaths and thousands of arrests, have turned American cities into battlegrounds. The video of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of an unarmed black man who died as a result of suffocation has mobilised an entire country to take to the streets in protest against systemic racism. (In Kenya, on the other hand, where at least fifteen people have died as a result of police brutality since a night curfew was imposed on 27 March, nobody has taken to the streets to protest the brutality or to demand justice for the victims. Extrajudicial killings by the police are quite common here, even during normal times.)</p>
<p>For Africans watching the unfolding uprising from afar, the scenes shown on television screens and on social media sites seem eerily familiar, but disconcerting. Suddenly the tables have turned: America is being described in the same way that many African countries (and other countries that elicit a combination of shock, horror and pity) ) are depicted. The façade of democracy that America has been showing to the world appears to be crumbling. As the Ugandan journalist Charles Onyango-Obbo half-jokingly suggested in a tweet, the Western media usually interviews Western experts every time there is a disaster or political turmoil in an African country; maybe now it is time for African experts to be interviewed by the same Western media on the consequences of state failure, democratic fragility and regime illegitimacy in the United States.</p>
<p>The impact of the coronavirus on the United States was also hard to digest, given that America is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with among the most sophisticated and well-equipped hospitals. People on the African continent, who are used to receiving food aid (when it is not stolen or diverted), watched in horror as millions of unemployed and homeless Americans queued for food and other supplies donated by charities. Those who have suffered epidemics like Ebola cannot believe their eyes when they see unclaimed American bodies ravaged by COVID-19 being buried in mass graves. (Mass graves in Africa are usually associated with genocide, ethnic cleansing or other atrocities, not disease.)</p>
<p>The late Binyavanga Wainaina, author of the satirical essay, “How to Write About Africa”, would no doubt have felt vindicated had he been around to see how American journalists are now having to apply the adjectives that they reserve for African basket-case banana republics to describe their own country. With the highest death toll from the coronavirus, and nationwide anti-racism protests, including in the capital Washington DC, the United States is beginning to look like Egypt during its tumultuous Arab Spring uprising (which, unfortunately, did not bring about the expected radical change) and Sudan during its recent revolution.</p>
<p>It is an important moment for Africans who view America as the land of equal opportunity. That rosy image has forever changed since Trump assumed office, and since the pandemic, which neither the president nor his trusted aides seem to be able to contain. Africans eager to study or live in the United States are now having second thoughts. A Kenya-born academic I recently had a conversation with wondered whether moving to the US was the right choice after all. Despite her US passport, she now feels trapped in a country where black lives are under constant threat. Will Africans living in the US move back to their home countries where at least they do not suffer racial discrimination?</p>
<p>Racism: The problem that never went away</p>
<p>Or perhaps America has always had the potential for a revolution like this one and Trump has only helped Americans and the world to see the fault lines that lie hidden beneath the country’s democratic ideals and shining skyscrapers. Now we all know that America is a deeply divided society both racially and in terms of income. It carries the scars of slavery and inequality to this day. The transatlantic slave trade, America’s “original sin”, it seems, has not only damaged African Americans, but their white tormentors as well. America has not learned what history tells us: You cannot move forward as a society until you have addressed and healed from the wounds of the past.</p>
<p>In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr, whose assassination in 1968 sparked similar protests, talked of America as a society that had been “poisoned to its soul by racism”. The Nobel laureate Toni Morrison described racism as “a social construct” and an “insult”. She believed that the main function of racism was distraction – to keep black people so busy explaining themselves to white people that they would not have time for anything else.</p>
<p>James Baldwin, the celebrated black American author, described black people as “the scapegoat” of America’s ills. He wrote that bigotry in the United States was “enough to make prophets and angels weep” and that black people in America lived under “martial law” where the police operate with “arrogant autonomy”. The way America deals with its “Negro problem”, he said, was either by killing black people or incarcerating them. He also said, “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a rage almost all the time”.</p>
<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates, the contemporary African American writer who has been described as “the new James Baldwin”, explains how racism “disembodies” black people. The question Coates seeks to answer is: How does a black man live freely in his body when that body is under constant threat of being exterminated?</p>
<p>Through personal anecdotes of his youth in a rough neighbourhood in West Baltimore, to his days at Howard University, the first all-black university in America, Coates shows how fear is an ever-present feeling among African Americans, and why this fear transcends generations. He poignantly explains in his book, Between the World and Me, why, after more than a century since slavery ended, black people in the United States are still under the threat of being humiliated, locked up, beaten or killed.</p>
<p>He describes white America as a syndicate arranged to protect white power and privilege, which are used to dominate and control black bodies. “Sometimes this power is direct (lynching) and sometimes it is insidious (redlining)”.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s presidency seems to have entrenched white power and privilege to heights that have not been witnessed in the United States in recent decades. His nonchalant attitude towards white supremacists and his belittling of women (including television journalists) and minorities have apparently not diminished his allure among his base. Trump represents an alt-right that is uncivilised and unapologetic. The anti-racism fury engulfing his presidency now is a reaction to his unadulterated bigotry.</p>
<p>However, we must also accept that no US president, not even Barack Obama, successfully handled the scourge of racism in America. Obama, the great hope of black Americans, failed to deliver racial justice and equality, even though he had a large number of people of colour in his administration. The Black Lives Matter movement emerged during his tenure at the White House. Obama, like most of his predecessors, did not overtly seek to address the race question in America. It’s possible that the fact of him being black (or rather, mixed race) prevented him from adopting an explicitly anti-racism agenda for fear of appearing too “radical”. Unfortunately, because the race question remained unresolved, white supremacists found a firm foothold in the Trump camp.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the deepest frustration of thinking about 1968 and 2020 is the time elapsed, the opportunities squandered, the lip service paid,” wrote David Remnick in the 31 May 2020 edition of The New Yorker. “In the realm of criminal justice, the prison population began to skyrocket under Ronald Reagan and kept on accelerating for decades, until midway through the Obama Administration. Black Lives Matter began, in 2013, at least in part because even the Obama Presidency, for all its promise, proved unable to exert anything like a decisive influence on issues of racism and police abuse”.</p>
<p>Many analysts believe that the current outburst of rage is a natural outcome of the financial crisis of 2008, when big corporations and banks were bailed out while thousands of working and middle class people lost their homes in what is known as the subprime mortgage crisis. This gave birth to the Occupy Wall Street movement, and perhaps sowed the seeds of a Trump presidency, which capitalised on people’s mistrust of government.</p>
<p>However, although Trump appears to appeal to white working class people, his rhetoric belies a man who has deep contempt for those who are outside mainstream corporate America, of which he is a prominent member. He lashes out at minorities, be they Mexicans, Muslims or women. He racialises everything, including the coronavirus, which he refers to as “the Chinese virus”. He names and shames his adversaries on Twitter, and even announces his policies via this social media platforms – which is unprecedented in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>Trump is not just a conservative with a loud mouth and bad manners, he is an ultra-conservative of the alt-right variety. Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist and a man with a vision of a dystopian world where might is always right, was Vice President of Cambridge Analytica, the disgraced data mining company that is associated with the Brexit referendum and Trump’s election (as well as with Uhuru Kenyatta’s 2013 election campaign).</p>
<p>White men on their necks</p>
<p>In a radio interview in Chicago in 1961, James Baldwin said: “The only thing that unites all black men everywhere is, as far as I can tell, the fact that white men are on their necks. What I’m curious about is what will happen when this is no longer true. For the first time in the memory of anybody living, black men have their destinies in their own hands. What will come out then, is a very great, a very loaded question”. (African leaders who fought against European colonialism, but who, after gaining independence for their countries, ended up domesticating the European colonial model in these countries – a model that did not deliver dignity, wealth or emancipation to the majority of their people – might want to pay attention to Baldwin’s prophetic words.)</p>
<p>Now, nearly sixty years after that interview, a black man with a white man literally on his neck has galvanised America. Will his death bring about the change that America needs? It is hard to tell, but one thing is certain: the United States of America will never be the same again.</p>
<p>And lest we forget, here are the final words of George Floyd before his untimely death.</p>
<p>“It’s my face man</p>
<p>I didn’t do nothing serious man</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>please I can’t breathe</p>
<p>please man</p>
<p>please somebody</p>
<p>please man</p>
<p>I can’t breathe</p>
<p>I can’t breathe</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>(inaudible)</p>
<p>man can’t breathe, my face</p>
<p>just get up</p>
<p>I can’t breathe</p>
<p>please, a knee on my neck</p>
<p>I can’t breathe</p>
<p>shit</p>
<p>I will</p>
<p>I can’t move</p>
<p>mama</p>
<p>mama</p>
<p>I can’t</p>
<p>my knee</p>
<p>my neck</p>
<p>I’m through</p>
<p>I’m through</p>
<p>I’m claustrophobic</p>
<p>my stomach hurt</p>
<p>my neck hurts</p>
<p>everything hurts</p>
<p>some water or something</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>I can’t breathe officer</p>
<p>don’t kill me</p>
<p>they’re gonna kill me, man</p>
<p>come on man</p>
<p>I cannot breathe</p>
<p>I cannot breathe</p>
<p>they’re gonna kill me</p>
<p>they’re gonna kill me</p>
<p>I can’t breathe</p>
<p>I can’t breathe</p>
<p>please sir</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>please</p>
<p>please I can’t breathe”</p>
<p>George Floyd was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.

<h3 id="do-muslims-matter-for-modi-shah-bjp-or-india">&ldquo;Do Muslims matter for Modi-Shah BJP, or India?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d2c7ipcroan06u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ni-muslims-f.jpg" alt="img">
Text Size: A- A+</p>
<p>The perennial regret of the BJP had always been that Muslims punch way above their deserved political weight in India. It was stated most pithily in conversations by BJP leader, key intellectual voice and my former colleague in the Express Group, Balbir Punj. “Muslims,” he said, “have a veto on who will rule India and who won’t.”</p>
<p>The timing of that conversation was just after Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s second NDA government had been defeated in the Lok Sabha by a solitary vote in 1999 as all ‘secular’ parties came together against it. Not long ago (1996), Vajpayee’s first NDA government was defeated in all of 13 days.</p>
<p>The second NDA government lasted just over a year, and Punj made an arguable case that everyone who had any interest in seeking the Muslim vote, or fear of losing it, was happy to bury the hatchet to deny BJP power. The Muslim vote was much too valuable for them to lose, and their commitment to secular values, in that view stated by Punj, was merely a cynical cover. I bet this view would have been further strengthened after UPA-1 came up, with even the Left supporting the Congress-led government, all to keep the BJP out. The difference in seats between the Congress and the BJP was marginal then, 145 to 138.</p>
<p>The BJP had, at various points of time, tried to reach out to Muslims. Vajpayee himself was the party’s friendliest and most inclusive face for minorities, L.K. Advani cultivated many prominent Muslim intellectuals, even the Muslim-Left. From participating in Muslim festivals to praise for Jinnah, to the choice of A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Vajpayee-Advani BJP tried to breach the fortress of Muslim voters. But the party lacked conviction, and failed.</p>
<p>The BJP translated this as the Muslim veto on who will rule India. The UPA decade, when the BJP’s power declined across the country, strengthened that view. Then, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah rose in 2014, and turned the equation upside down, or inside out, take your pick. They won a full majority without much — if any — help from India’s Muslim voters.</p>
<p>A new template had been set in Indian politics. Many BJP leaders were upfront with it: “We have now accepted we have to fight in a field with only 80 per cent voters, leaving Muslims and most Christians out.” Once they accepted that reality, the challenge was simple: “Get about 50 per cent of that Hindu vote, and we could rule India with a comfortable majority.” They proved this again in 2019.</p>
<p>A most unexpected transformation in Indian politics had come about: The large Muslim population, now nearly 20 crore, had been rendered electorally irrelevant. Don’t buy into any folklore about Muslim women being grateful for the triple talaq ban, or aspirational younger Muslims having voted for the BJP. Demographic analysis of every reliable exit poll underlines this for us. It stunned the BJP’s ‘secular’ rivals. It also left the Muslims searching for answers.</p>
<p>Also read: Modi-Shah’s hyper-nationalism is making India insecure when it is actually most secure</p>
<p>Now, put yourself in the shoes of one of our 20 crore Muslims, and the picture may look something like this: My vote has lost its power, alright. But, should I be deprived even my rightful place in the power structure?</p>
<p>The Modi cabinet, in its sixth year now, has only one Muslim: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, in charge of minority affairs. It is also one of those unfamiliar junctures in our history — and it’s a long one — when none of the key constitutional positions, President, Vice-President, Speaker of Lok Sabha, heads of armed forces, security and intelligence agencies, Election Commission or the judiciary, feature any Muslims.</p>
<p>There isn’t one state with a Muslim chief minister and the one that might have needed to have one, Jammu and Kashmir, isn’t even a state any more. None of the secretaries in the key ministries is a Muslim, nor any important regulator. We can search deeper, but in my quick recollection, Nasim Zaidi as Chief Election Commissioner (2015-17) was the last Muslim to hold a constitutional position of consequence, besides Hamid Ansari, of course. Among India’s 37 states and union territories, there are just two Muslim governors: Najma Heptullah and Arif Mohammed Khan. Where does it leave me in today’s India?</p>
<p>We know the arguments from the BJP: Sabka saath, sabka vikas, to begin with. The absence of major communal riots being the next. Then, we can go on. As stories by ThePrint’s reporters Sanya Dhingra and Fatima Khan have recently shown, under the Modi government, the success rate of Muslim candidates in IAS etc., has, if anything, risen marginally and more minority scholarships are going to the community’s students than under the UPA.</p>
<p>But certainly, a 15 per cent population in a truly equal state would believe it also deserves a place in the sun, a slice of the power and governance pie. We will give you the post-2014 BJP’s answer to this: “You can’t first insist on voting against us en bloc, as if we are enemies, and then also demand a share in power. Much chutzpah?”</p>
<p>The question we are raising, by choosing a headline like “Do Indian Muslims matter?”, draws precisely from this and seeks to argue against this deeply diluted and qualified notion of constitutional equality. You have your vote, scholarships, jobs and opportunity. For a share of power, maybe you should rethink your voting choices.</p>
<p>Or, too bad that 15 per cent of you are so scattered as to count for no more than 27 Muslim MPs in this Lok Sabha. You’ve seen this model elsewhere. The large Muslim minority in Israel is the only Arabic population anywhere to have a free and equal vote, safety, economic and social opportunity. But the political office they can rise to, a place in the governance structure, is limited. It’s a republic, but a Zionist republic. The new deal for Muslims in India also seems to be a similar one. Except, India was never imagined or designed to be a Hindu republic. That is where this argument fails.</p>
<p>Also read: Why India’s middle classes are Modi’s ‘Muslims’</p>
<p>Indian Muslims are not a monolith, nor are the subcontinent’s. Think about this. Forty per cent of all of the world’s Muslims live in the subcontinent. And yet, the number of the region’s Muslims in ISIS has never crossed a few low hundreds. Of these, Indians have never reached even three figures. Why is it so?</p>
<p>It is essentially because the subcontinent’s Muslims have a strong nationalism of their own in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. They have a flag, an anthem, a cricket team to support, and politicians to adore or detest. The fantasy of a Caliphate as a mythical new and pristinely Islamic nation-state has no lure for them. In different parts of the subcontinent, Muslims also lean on diverse denominators or identities: Language, ethnicity, culture, political ideology, and not just religion. Bangladesh came into being as cultural and linguistic identity took precedence over the religion-driven two-nation theory.</p>
<p>This is a great strength of the region, and no liability. It applies most of all to India. The continued isolation and sullenness of the Muslim minority at their post-2014 irrelevance is not what India needs. Don’t confuse silence for acquiescence. Indian Muslims have also grown a new middle-class. An educated and professional elite has emerged. They no longer follow the old dynastic Left-Urdu aristocracies or the Ulema (clergy) as their leaders. As young Delhi University scholar Asim Ali wrote in an article last week, they are now asking them tough questions. Punishing them for their voting preferences may bring some vengeful, serves-you-right joy. But it will be self-defeating. No country or society ever prospered or remained secure by marginalising more than one-sixth of its own.</p>

<h3 id="isaac-the-second-patriarch-of-the-bible">&ldquo;Isaac: The Second Patriarch of the Bible&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://w3.chabad.org/media/images/918/KxsB9180382.jpg" alt="img">
Isaac (Yitzchak, in Hebrew) is the second of the patriarchs of the Jewish people. He is the son of Abraham and Sarah, husband of Rebecca, and father of Esau and Jacob. He is most famous for his central role in the Binding of Isaac, when he was almost offered up as a sacrifice to G‑d. He carried on his father’s work of spreading monotheism and knowledge of G‑d throughout Mesopotamia. He is commonly referred to as Yitzchak Avinu, “Isaac our Forefather.” His life story is told in the Book of Genesis, mostly in the portions of Vayeira and Toldot.</p>
<p>Early Life</p>
<p>Isaac was born when his father, Abraham, was 100 years old and his mother, Sarah, was 90. A trio of angels came to tell Abraham of the coming birth of his child, and Isaac was born exactly a year later.</p>
<p>Isaac was born on the first day of Passover. He became the first child to be circumcised at the proper time, on the eighth day after birth. In many ways, Isaac was the first person to be born Jewish. At his circumcision, Abraham named him Yitzchak (Isaac), which means “laughter” in Hebrew.</p>

<p>After he was born, many skeptics were convinced that Isaac was the child of Abimelech, not of Abraham. They pointed to the fact that Abraham and Sarah had been married for many years without children, and Sarah only conceived after being abducted by Abimelech. In order to nip such thoughts in the bud, G‑d made Isaac the spitting image of Abraham, so much so that when Isaac grew older they became indistinguishable.</p>
<p>As is common with only children, especially those born in their parents’ old age, Isaac was loved dearly by his parents. When he was weaned at the age of two, they made a large party to celebrate, inviting many distinguished guests.</p>
<p>One day, Sarah saw her stepson, Ishmael, acting inappropriately. Fearing that he would become a negative influence to her son, she told Abraham to send him away. Abraham was reluctant to do so, but gave in after G‑d told him to listen to Sarah.</p>

<p>The Akeida : The Binding of Isaac</p>
<p>In the Bible, the request from G‑d to Abraham to offer up his son on an altar comes out of nowhere. The Talmud gives us a little background to the events leading up to this command:</p>
<p>One day, Ishmael was boasting to Isaac that he was circumcised at the age of 13, and he did not protest. That was an advantage over Isaac, who had been too young to protest at the time of his circumcision. Isaac replied, “You think that sacrificing one organ makes you better than me? If G‑d said to me, ‘Sacrifice yourself before Me,’ I would not hold back.”</p>
<p>G‑d made Isaac follow through on that promise. He told Abraham to sacrifice his son on a specific mountain that was a three-day journey away. Abraham agreed, rising early the next morning to saddle up for the journey, and taking Isaac with him. At this point, Isaac was 37 years old. He was a willing participant, just as eager as Abraham to fulfill G‑d’s will.</p>
<p>After they arrived at the mountain and Abraham tied Isaac to an altar, G‑d revealed that his plan was never actually to have Isaac offered up. It was just a test to ascertain the level of their commitment to Him. Extremely relieved, Abraham and Isaac returned home. To their dismay, Sarah, Isaac’s mother, had just passed away. The news that her only son was being offered up as a sacrifice was too much for her to bear. Sarah was buried in Hebron.</p>

<p>Isaac’s Marriage</p>
<p>Following the death of his wife, Abraham decided that it is time for Isaac to get married. He sent his trusted servant Eliezer to the far away land of Aram Naharayim to find a wife from among Abraham’s relatives who were living there. Eliezer succeeded in his mission and returned with Rebecca, the daughter of Abraham’s nephew, Bethuel.</p>
<p>Isaac was immediately taken with Rebecca, and they married. Their marriage helped him get over the tragic loss of his mother.</p>
<p>Read more: How Eliezer Knew She Was “The One”</p>
<p>Isaac’s Children</p>
<p>Isaac and Rebecca married when Isaac was 40. After 20 years of marriage, they remained childless. They prayed to G‑d, and Rebecca conceived and gave birth to twins. The first was a ruddy, hairy child. They named him Esau. As the second child exited the womb, they noticed that he was holding on to Esau’s heel. That prompted them to name him Yaakov (Jacob), which is connected to the Hebrew word for “heel.”</p>
<p>Esau and Jacob grew up and chose their own paths in life. Esau became a hunter and idol worshipper, while Jacob prefered sitting in tents (and studying the teachings of G‑d).</p>
<p>Read more: Jacob and Esau: The Struggle for Power</p>
<p>The Famine</p>
<p>When Abraham came to Canaan, there was a famine that forced him to leave to Egypt. A very similar situation occurred with Isaac. A famine ravaged the land of Canaan, making living there impossible. Isaac considered leaving to Egypt, as his father had done, but G‑d told him not to. This is because when Isaac was placed on the altar during the Binding of Isaac, he acquired the holiness of a sacrificial offering. Therefore, he could no longer leave the holiness of the land of Canaan for a land of lesser holiness. With no other options, Isaac moved to Gerar, which was within the borders of Canaan.</p>
<p>As soon as he arrived and met the people there, he realized that the inhabitants of Gerar were not the most savory people. The first question they asked him was, “Who is that woman there?” referring to Rebecca. Fearing for his life, Isaac did exactly as his father Abraham had done with Sarah in Egypt. He claimed that Rebecca was his sister.</p>
<p>Some time passed, and the inevitable occurred. The king, Abimelech, discovered that Isaac and Rebecca were not siblings after all, but husband and wife. He rebuked Isaac for pretending to be Rebecca’s brother and issued an edict that no one should harm Isaac or Rebecca. Reassured, Isaac settled in Gerar.</p>

<p>Life in Gerar: Isaac’s Wells</p>
<p>“Digging Wells” by Yoram Raanan</p>
<p>Life in Gerar was good for Isaac. He prospered there. Perhaps too much. As the inhabitants of Gerar became increasingly jealous of Isaac’s fortune, the situation became untenable. Abimelech told Isaac that he should find a better locale to live in. Isaac moved to the valley of Gerar.</p>
<p>But that was not far enough. Success breeds envy. Envy breeds enmity. Enmity leads to fights breaking out. In Isaac’s case, the fights revolved around wells.</p>
<p>First, Isaac’s servants dug a well in the valley of Gerar and the Philistines fought over who had the rights to it. Isaac named the well “Esek,” which means “conflict.” So Isaac dug another well. Lo and behold, the Philistines claimed ownership of that one as well. Isaac named it “Sitnah,” which means “enmity.” Showing extraordinary patience, Isaac moved on and dug a third well. And they did not fight over this one. In order to commemorate that, Isaac named it “Rechovot,” which means “abundant space.” Isaac then moved to Be’er Sheva.</p>
<p>Once sufficient distance was established between Isaac and the inhabitants of Gerar, and his spectacular financial success was no longer being rubbed in their faces, King Abimelech approached Isaac and asked him to make a covenant. Isaac agreed, and they made a feast to celebrate their newfound civil relationship.</p>

<p>The Birthright</p>
<p>Isaac began to get old, and his vision failed him. Some say that the reason G‑d made him blind was specifically so that the rest of the story could play out the way it did. Other explanations point to the smoke of the idolatrous incense of Esau’s wives, or to the tears of the angels falling into his eyes during the Akeida. The Midrash also quotes the opinion that Isaac himself wished for his blindness. He wanted to make sure that the suffering he experienced in his lifetime would atone for his sins. G‑d granted his wish and made him blind.</p>
<p>Isaac decided that it was time to bless his eldest son and officially bestow upon him the benefits of the firstborn birthright. Unfortunately, the flaw with this plan was that Esau, the eldest, had already sold the birthright to Jacob for a bowl of lentil stew. (No, seriously!)</p>
<p>Read more: Esau Sells the Birthright</p>
<p>Jacob’s mother concocted a plan to make sure that the right man got the blessings. She took advantage of Isaac’s blindness and dressed Jacob up as Esau. Isaac was fooled, and gave the blessings to Jacob.</p>
<p>When Esau found out, he was devastated. He begged Isaac for a blessing as well, and Isaac acquiesced.</p>
<p>Esau was murderously furious at Jacob for “stealing” the blessings. He planned to kill Jacob as soon as Isaac passed away. Realizing the peril, Jacob’s parents sent him to Padan Aram, far away from the wrath of Esau. Isaac would not see his son for more than 22 years.</p>

<p>Isaac’s Death</p>
<p>The Cave of the Patriarchs as it appeared in 1906.</p>
<p>After reuniting with Jacob after his return from Aram, Isaac lived on for many more years. He passed away at the ripe old age of 180. He was buried with his parents in the Cave of Machpela, in Hebron.</p>
<p>Isaac and the Afternoon Prayer</p>
<p>Isaac is attributed with originating Minchah, the afternoon prayer. This is because Isaac is mentioned in the Torah as praying in the afternoon: “And Isaac went forth to pray in the field towards evening.”</p>
<p>Isaac in Kabbalah</p>
<p>Very little of Isaac’s nearly two-century-long life is written in the Torah. That reflects that spirit with which Isaac lived his life. Isaac embodied the idea of gevurah, the kabbalistic notion of discipline or restraint. The character trait associated with gevurah is yira’ah, awe. Isaac served G‑d with a sense of awe and wonderment. He constantly felt that he was standing in the presence of the Almighty. This caused him to act with restraint and modesty. While his father Abraham was an outgoing, traveling activist, Isaac was more reserved. He stayed in the land of Canaan all his life, working on himself and others in a quieter fashion.</p>
<p>Isaac passed on the positive character traits of restraint, modesty and introspection to his progeny, the Jewish people.</p>

<p>Isaac the Well Digger</p>
<p>Isaac’s episode with digging wells is one of the few aspects of his life that the Torah describes in detail. The reason for this is because digging wells was reflective of Isaac’s personality. He was not one to go out and find oases of water in other places. He was meditative and settled. Rather than searching for solutions from other sources, he would search deep inside for the life-giving water within.</p>

<h3 id="the-crusades-beyond-the-battlefield">&ldquo;The Crusades Beyond the Battlefield&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/Medieval-crusader.jpg" alt="img">
The Crusades were a series of holy wars between the Christians of Western Europe and the Muslims of the Middle East. Traditionally, there were nine major Crusades, which took place between the 11th and 13th centuries. These military expeditions were aimed primarily at the recapture of Jerusalem and the Holy Land.</p>
<p>The Crusades are remembered chiefly for the military aspect and the battles won and lost by each side. Nevertheless, the impact of the conflict went well beyond that and had an influence on various other aspects of life at that time.</p>
<p>There were also other ‘minor’ crusades apart from the nine ‘major’ ones in the Holy Land. These crusades were fought against various peoples considered to be the enemies of Christendom, including the Muslims of the Iberian Peninsula (the Reconquista), the pagans around the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic Sea (the Northern Crusades), and even Christians labelled as heretics (the Albigensian Crusade, for example).</p>

<p>When Did the Crusades Start?</p>
<p>Traditionally, the Crusades are said to have begun in 1095. The Council of Clermont, which took place in November that year, was summoned in response to the appeal for military aid by the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus against the threat of a Turkish invasion. The pope, Urban II, saw this as an opportunity to reinforce the temporal power of the papacy, as the whole of Christendom would unite under his leadership to take back Jerusalem from the Muslims.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the council, the pope delivered an impassioned speech, exhorting the Christians of Europe to stop fighting against one another, to take the cross, to aid their fellow Christians in the East, and to reclaim Jerusalem for Christendom. Urban is recorded to have ended his speech with the words ‘Deus vult’ (Latin for ‘God wills it’), which became the battle cry of the Crusaders.</p>
<p>Pope Urban II preaching at the Council of Clermont. Sébastien Mamerot, ‘Les passages d&rsquo;outremer.’ (Public Domain )</p>
<p>At that point of time, the areas under Islamic rule not only included the entire Middle East, but also Persia, Egypt, North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and Sicily. Nevertheless, the Islamic world was not united as it once was during its early years. Although the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad was the titular head of the Islamic community, not all Muslims recognized his authority.</p>
<p>The Fatimids of Egypt, for instance, were adherents of Shia Islam, unlike the Abbasids, who followed Sunni Islam. While the Crusades represent a significant period in the history of Western Europe, it was viewed in a different light by the Muslims. For them, the Crusades was just another wave of Christian aggression against the Islamic world. Indeed, military expeditions by Christians against Muslims long pre-dated the Crusades. For instance, the Reconquista began during the 8th century AD, not long after the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate. The Muslims had lost Sicily too in 1091, after it was conquered by the Normans under Roger I.</p>
<p>Who were the First Crusaders?</p>
<p>Returning to Clermont, Urban’s speech had its intended effect and many responded to the pope’s call for a crusade. In total, between 60,000 and 100,000 people pledged to take up a crusade. Interestingly, although Urban envisioned all of Western Europe rallying to his banner, the participants of the First Crusade hailed from the French-speaking parts of the continent. Moreover, the leaders of this crusade were not kings, but noblemen. Thus, the First Crusade is also known as the Princes’ Crusade.</p>
<p>Urban had promised that anyone who died in the service of Christ during the Crusade would receive absolution and remission of sins. This, along with personal piety, were strong incentives for those taking up the cross. Still, not all the Crusaders had such noble intentions in mind.</p>
<p>Some of them were motivated by more worldly factors. Members of the nobility, for instance, saw this expedition as an opportunity to gain land and riches in the East. As an example, Bohemond, the Norman prince of Otranto, used the First Crusade to establish the Principality of Antioch, and did not continue with the rest of the Crusaders as they proceeded to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Jerusalem</p>
<p>In spite of the odds against them, the participants of the First Crusade prevailed over their Muslim enemies and Jerusalem fell to them in 1099. The Kingdom of Jerusalem was created and one of the Crusade’s leaders, Godfrey of Bouillon , became its first ruler. Although Godfrey accepted the rulership of the kingdom, he refused the title ‘king,’ reasoning that no man should wear a ‘crown of gold’ in the city where Jesus Christ had worn a ‘crown of thorns.’ He opted for the title Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri (‘Defender of the Holy Sepulchre’) instead.</p>
<p>His successors, however, were less modest. After ruling for a year, Godfrey died in 1100 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Baldwin, who took the title ‘king’. The Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted until 1291, when its capital, Acre, fell to the Mamluks.</p>
<p>Jerusalem itself was lost long before the kingdom’s destruction, in 1187, when it was conquered by Saladin. In response to the loss of Jerusalem that year, the Third Crusade was called to reconquer the holy city. This is arguably the most famous crusade, thanks mainly to the tales of chivalry surrounding Saladin and his arch-rival, Richard the Lionheart . In short, however, the Third Crusade was a failure, as it did not fulfil its objective of reconquering Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The Infamous Fourth Crusade</p>
<p>Whereas the Third Crusade is popularly remembered for the chivalry of Richard and Saladin, the Fourth is notorious for the treachery of the Venetians. This crusade was preached in 1189 by Pope Innocent III, who hoped to invade the Holy Land from the south, i.e. via Egypt. Overall command was given to a French nobleman by the name of Thibaut of Champagne, and the Crusaders negotiated with Venice to provide transport for the army.</p>
<p>Thibaut died before the crusade began and was replaced by Boniface of Montferrat, an Italian nobleman whose political connections contributed to the infamous deeds of the Fourth Crusade. His brother, Conrad, for instance, had married the sister of the Byzantine emperor, Isaac II Angelus, and received the title ‘Caesar.’</p>
<p>Additionally, Boniface was a vassal of Philip of Swabia, Isaac’s son-in-law. In 1195, Isaac was blinded and deposed by his brother, who seized the throne as Alexius III. Some years later, Isaac’s son, also names Alexius, escaped from captivity in Constantinople and fled to Philip’s court. In 1201, Philip, Boniface, and Alexius discussed the possibility of using the crusade to topple the usurper and replace one Alexius with another. The pope’s approval for the plan was sought, but Innocent refused to grant it.</p>
<p>Conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204. ( Public Domain )</p>
<p>In the summer of 1202, the Crusaders arrived in Venice, where they were to be transported to Egypt. Unfortunately for them, the army was only a third of its projected size. This meant that the Crusaders neither needed nor could they afford the transport and provisions that had been prepared.</p>
<p>The Venetians were undoubtedly upset, but its doge, Enrico Dandolo, proposed a compromise. He suggested that the Crusaders help Venice capture Zadar (in present-day Croatia), which was economically under Venice’s dominance, but had rebelled not long before. In return, he would allow the outstanding debt to be suspended until it could be paid in captured booty.</p>
<p>Zadar was a Christian city and had allied itself with the Kingdom of Hungary, whose king had also taken up the cross. Many of the Crusaders were reluctant to attack the city, but they had little choice, and went ahead with Dandolo’s proposal. The pope did not agree with this plan at all, but his views were disregarded. In the end, Innocent gave conditional absolution to the Crusaders, but not to the Venetians, so as to not jeopardize the enterprise.</p>
<p>After capturing Zadar, envoys from Philip came with a proposal from Alexius. In return for deposing the current Byzantine emperor and placing him on the throne, Alexius would place the Byzantine Church under Rome, pay the Crusaders a large sum of money, and join them in Egypt for their crusade. Dandolo, in particular, was highly supportive of the plan, since he held a personal enmity against the Byzantines , and did much to convince the other leaders of the crusade to accept it. Some, however, disapproved of this scheme, and deserted.</p>
<p>In any case, the Crusaders arrived in Constantinople in late June 1203, and began to besiege the city. The emperor’s weak leadership caused the people of Constantinople to turn against him and he fled the city. As a result, Isaac was restored to the throne and his son, Alexius, appointed as his co-emperor. Alexius’ popularity, however, was rapidly declining, and he was eventually deposed in a coup in late January 1204. A nobleman by the name of Alexius Doukas was crowned as Alexius V.</p>
<p>The Crusaders demanded the new emperor keep the pledges of his predecessor. When he refused, they declared war on him. Constantinople fell on April 12, 1204 and the city was sacked. The Crusaders are recorded to have systematically destroyed and defiled the city’s churches and monasteries and emptied them of their valuables. When news of Constantinople’s fall reached the ears of Innocent, he was filled with shame and strongly rebuked the Crusaders, though the damage had already been done.</p>
<p>‘The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople’ (1840) by Eugène Delacroix. ( Public Domain )</p>
<p>Consequences of the Crusades</p>
<p>Between the infamous sack of Constantinople in 1204 and the fall of Acre in 1291, several more crusades were launched. Nevertheless, as the century wore on, enthusiasm for such military expeditions to the Holy Land began was in decline. The last of the nine ‘major’ Crusades was launched in response to the Mamluk threat to the remaining Crusader states.</p>
<p>The Ninth Crusade, also known as Lord Edward’s Crusade, is sometimes considered part of the Eighth Crusade, and was led by Lord Edward, the future Edward I of England . This crusade failed to accomplish much and Edward left the Holy Land in September 1272, just over a year after his arrival in the previous May.</p>
<p>Although the Crusades ultimately failed in their mission to recapture the Holy Land, they had some unforeseen consequences, most notably in the interactions between the Crusaders and the Muslims. For instance, after the Crusader states were established they became part of the local political landscape as well.</p>
<p>While the Crusades are undoubtedly best-known for battles, alliances and peace treaties were also formed between the Crusaders and their Muslim neighbors. An example of this is seen in the letters sent by Saladin to Baldwin III, the king of Jerusalem, in which a sense of friendship can be felt. In another instance, some months before his departure for England, Edward, along with Hugh I, the king of Jerusalem, managed to negotiate a truce with Baibars, the Mamluk sultan.</p>
<p>The truce was to last for a duration of 10 years, 10 months, and 10 days. Crusader-Muslim interaction and co-existence, however, extended beyond politics, and included trade and commerce, cultural exchanges, and the transfer of scientific knowledge from the Muslim world to Europe.</p>

<p>Crusading Spirit Lived On</p>
<p>Eventually crusading zeal in the Holy Land was extinguished but the crusading spirit itself lived on, which is evident in the ‘minor’ crusades that were launched even after the Crusader states were destroyed. These crusades, however, were directed at different enemies in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>The best-known of these is the Reconquista in the Iberian Peninsula, which once again saw Christians pitted against Muslims. Although the Reconquista began during the 8th century AD, it was only declared a crusade in 1123 by Pope Callixtus II, and ended in 1492 with the fall of Granada.</p>
<p>The Northern Crusades (also known as the Baltic Crusades) are less well-known, and were fought against the pagans of the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. Indirectly, these crusades were ‘missionary wars’ and were meant to create the conditions that were necessary for the conversion of the region to Christianity later on.</p>
<p>The Northern Crusades began in the 12th century and only ended in the 15th century. Finally, crusades were also launched against those deemed heretics by the Roman Catholic Church. These included the Cathars of southern France during the 13th century (the Albigensian Crusade), and Hussites of Central Europe during the 15th century (known variously as the Hussite Wars , the Bohemian Wars, and the Hussite Revolution).</p>

<p>13-1. Does God sanctify and cleanse His Church?</p>
<p>Ephesians 5:25-27 . . . Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; [26] That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, [27] That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>

<p>Catholic (Universal)</p>
<p>14-1. Did the first Pentecost suggest the catholicity of the Church?</p>
<p>Acts 2:4-11 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. [5] And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. [6] Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language. [7] And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans? [8] And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? [9] Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, [10] Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, [11] Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>

<p>14-3. Is the gospel to be universally available and fruitful?</p>

<p>14-5. Was the predicted messianic kingdom universal?</p>
<p>Isaiah 49:6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.</p>

<p>Ezekiel 17:22-23 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent: [23] In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</p>
<p>14-8. Is the gospel to be preached everywhere?</p>

<p>Romans 1:5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>
<p>Apostolic Succession</p>
<p>15-1. Is there an example of succession of office during the old covenant?</p>
<p>1 Chronicles 27:33-34 And Ahithophel was the king’s counseller: and Hushai the Archite was the king’s companion: [34] And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: . . .</p>
<p>15-2. Did the apostles speak truth?</p>
<p>1 Corinthians 2:7, 12-13 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: . . . [12] Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. [13] Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
<p>15-3. Were the apostles eyewitnesses of Jesus, with a “prophetic word”?</p>
<p>2 Peter 1:16, 19 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty. . . . [19] We have also a more sure word of prophecy; . . .</p>
<p>15-4. Is there an example of an apostle actually succeeding another, in terms of office?</p>
<p>Acts 1:20-26 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another take. [21] Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, [22] Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection. [23] And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. [24] And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, [25] That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. [26] And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p>
<p>15-5. Does St. Paul pass on his office in any sense, to another?</p>
<p>2 Timothy 4:1-2, 5-6 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom; [2] Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. . . . [5] But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. [6] For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>

<h3 id="get-to-know-seven-of-evangelions-angels">&ldquo;Get to Know Seven of Evangelion&rsquo;s Angels&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/crop600x315/herald/75152/fourth-angel-s-halo-rebuild.png" alt="img">
Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the most influential anime series of all time and after spending far too long out of print, is finally available again in the U.S. courtesy of Netflix as of Friday, June 21st. What makes the series so evocative all these years later is the emotional core of its characters but beyond that is the amazing world-building. Anno and his team crafted a multitude of interesting angles to approach the show, including monsters inspired by theoretical science and a lot of references to Christian mythos. Neon Genesis Evangelion dabbles in Kabbalah and Gnosticism as window dressing around its larger emotional themes.</p>
<p>If you look at Christianity as a sort of fandom, we can call The Bible &ldquo;canon.&rdquo; However, there&rsquo;s a lot of really, really old &ldquo;fanfiction&rdquo; (apocrypha) that didn&rsquo;t make the cut into the True Word. This includes angelology (and demonology) that lays out hierarchies of Heaven and Hell. Medieval writers loved this shit and the ideas extend into a lot of pop culture today. Pick up any copy of any manga that concerns itself with demons, angels, King Solomon, alchemy, or the like to see how writers Thomas Aquinas and the De Coelesti Hierarchia live on today. The fascination with classifying celestial beings also means it&rsquo;s difficult to whittle down what&rsquo;s historical and what&rsquo;s yet another book of pseudo-occult babble muddying the waters, but that&rsquo;s me being particular (and yet another reason why I was kicked out of coven about 10 years ago).</p>
<p>Neon Genesis Evangelion &lsquo;s many, many Christian elements are fun as another way to approach the series but knowledge isn&rsquo;t 100% necessary to enjoy the show. I&rsquo;m keeping this rundown of Eva&rsquo;s Angels as spoiler free as possible, but we&rsquo;ll be looking at older descriptions of angels and how that may have played a part in the series&rsquo; designs and the monsters&rsquo; personalities.</p>
<p>Sachiel</p>
<p>Perhaps our most precious angel. Sachiel is Evangelion &lsquo;s defacto &ldquo;yuru&rdquo; mascot. At some point, it was decided that Sachiel is just a weak, lovable little baby and a simplified version of him as appeared on merchandise ever since. In the anime he&rsquo;s humanoid and the first Angel to attack in the story&rsquo;s current timeline (not a flashback). It also is first to use what would become an iconic symbol during the show&rsquo;s run; a crucifix-shaped beam.</p>
<p>Sachiel&rsquo;s name means &ldquo;the covering of God&rdquo; and appears in early Jewish occult books circa 1200s and again in the The Heptameron grimoire in the 16th century although his origins are even earlier. The Book of Enoch places him with the Archangels (like the more widely known Michael, Uriel, and Raphael). There aren&rsquo;t any stories of Sachiel interacting with humans, instead he&rsquo;s listed in occult books in a similar fashion as gods from the Greek mythos. They advise envoking or praying to Sachiel for help with legal matters and money.</p>
<p>Shamshel</p>
<p>Everyone&rsquo;s phallic monster. Despite my best attempts to unearth the truth, I can&rsquo;t explain to you why Yoshitoh Asari designed Shamshel the way that he did. Its two whip arms remind me vaguely of flagellum found on bacteria. The creature has both flight and attack modes, fighting primarily with its light whip arms.</p>
<p>The choice to call it Shamshel might be connected to these weapons which are shown to quickly burn its foes. The name means &ldquo;sun of God&rdquo; and he&rsquo;s described the Jewish mystical text Zohar as the angel that guarded the Garden of Eden. Genesis 3:24 describes the angel stationed at the Garden of Eden as wielding a flaming sword.</p>
<p>Ramiel</p>
<p>Ramiel is one of my favorite angel designs from the series. He encompasses an idea of sacred geometry and self-reflection while melting everything in its path. When it hones in on its target it can annihilate it with precision and tunnel after it.</p>
<p>Ramiel is described in The Book of Enoch, an apocraphyl text allegedly written by the great-grandfather of Noah (yeah, the one with the Ark). The book fleshes out the mythology of fallen angels, angels that were corrupted in their association with humans, and their giant offspring (Nephilim). These were the events said to lead up to the flood that Noah built that boat for. Ramiel is described as one of the leaders of these fallen angels. In the Apocalypse of Baruch he&rsquo;s credited with ruling over &ldquo;true visions.&rdquo; Ramiel&rsquo;s design could allude to this, but most likely it was just Anno&rsquo;s shout out to Future Police Urashiman .</p>
<p>Israfel</p>
<p>And they say (the starry choir</p>
<p>And the other listening things)</p>
<p>That Israfeli&rsquo;s fire</p>
<p>Is owing to that lyre</p>
<p>By which he sits and sings—</p>
<p>The trembling living wire</p>
<p>Of those unusual strings.</p>
<p>-Edgar Allen Poe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Israfel is one of the few angels where its origin seems to have played a larger part in the episode themes as a whole. Israfel, as demonstrated in Poe&rsquo;s poem, is associated with music. Some stories think of him like a muse that musicians could pray to for inspiration. The 14th century Arabic text The Wonders of Creation shows Israfel (Israfil) playing a trumpet. The text states that he&rsquo;s the angel that will blow the trumpet to initiate the death of all livings on Earth (yeah, that took a dark turn, didn&rsquo;t it?). While awaiting God&rsquo;s orders to end all life, Israfel cries at the sight of Hell and is said to have tutored Muhammad.</p>
<p>In the episode, Israfel splits in half, prompting Asuka and Shinji to have to synchronize together to defeat both at the same time. How do they do it? Jazzercise.</p>
<p>Sandalphon</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for Sandalphon because his name is fun to say and he was a very creepy baby in the Angel Sanctuary manga . He&rsquo;s also a creepy baby in Evangelion before transforming into a prehistoric fish. He even cries like a human child. So what&rsquo;s up with Sandalphon and babies? The story goes that Sandalphon was originally the human prophet Elijah but he took on his new angelic form after ascending to Heaven. Elijah is associated with the unborn and children; Jewish tradition saves a special seat for Elijah to oversee circumcision ceremonies (this is sort of a punishment bestowed on Elijah though). As Sandalphon, he&rsquo;s said to be able to reach any part of the Earth (even volcanoes, according to Evangelion ).</p>
<p>Tabris</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll notice that Tabris here, aka Kaworu, has a name different than the earlier angels. The names of angels come from Theophory, the act of embedding the name of a deity within a name. This is usually done by adding -el to a name in the Judeochristian tradition. There is not any &ldquo;god&rdquo; in &ldquo;Tabris&rdquo; though, unlike the other angels. Tabris (sometimes written Thabris), however, originates from two different stories. One is a romance starring Moses and the other is the occult book The Nuctemeron by Apollonius of Tyana. The Moses story is interesting as a potential influence for Shinji and Kaworu&rsquo;s relationship.</p>
<p>A few lines in the Bible allude to Moses having a previous wife named Tharbis, a princess of what is now Ethiopia. Moses was leading an invading force of Egyptians and won. The Princess Tharbis watched as Moses fought her people and fell in love with him. Perhaps a marriage out of convenience, Moses agreed to marry Tharbis if she would give him the city of Mer. But Moses didn&rsquo;t want to stay in Mer, he planned to return to his land of Egypt. Tharbis protested so Moses looked for a way to, essentially, divorce his wife. He used magic to craft a pair of rings and gave one to Tharbis that would cause her to forget him while he wore the ring that would never allow him to forget. The memory of her romance gone, Moses was free to leave Ethopia and return to Egypt.</p>
<p>The Nuctemeron identifies Tabris as the &ldquo;genius of free will&rdquo; (genius here is used as a singular for &ldquo;genii&rdquo; or &ldquo;genie&rdquo;) and one of the rulers of the sixth hour. When performing magic, seals, hours, cardinal directions, elements, planets, etc are referenced quite often to make sure your evocation is performed under all the right conditions. The 19th century French magician Eliphas Levi interpreted Apollonius of Tyana&rsquo;s writings about Tabris as &ldquo;the magus is free; he is the occult king of the earth.&rdquo; A pretty apt description of the wisdom Kaworu tries to pass on to Shinji.</p>
<p>Lilith</p>
<p>Mankind is so cruel to its originator, but Lilith is a controversial figure in mythology. She&rsquo;s come to represent a variety of things whether it be demons or feminism. The story always starts the same: Lilith is the first partner created for Adam but unlike Eve, she&rsquo;s made from the same dirt as her would-be husband. She rebukes him and thus is cast out. The Mesopotamians had a whole class of demons named after Lilith and legends told of her promiscuity and baby-napping. Some Jewish folklore says that after she denies Adam she strikes up a romance with the angel Samael, archangel of death. Her name is popularly used for vampire or generally seductive characters.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s had a bit of a redemption arc over the years as her story has been re-purposed to represent independent women and her subsequent demonization merely a reflection on how society views said women.</p>
<p>Lilith&rsquo;s place as a demon in mythology can be extrapolated out as a larger metaphor within Evangelion . If humankind is her progeny, what does it say about humans or Angels or monsters? Personally, I see her as a pitiable character given her state in the series and how her body (and blood) are used. It&rsquo;s reminiscent of Shel Silverstein&rsquo;s The Giving Tree poem, just you know, creepier.</p>
