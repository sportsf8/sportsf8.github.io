<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-06/7blsts9_yuzvendra-chahal-ms-dhoni-kuldeep-yadav-instagram_625x300_14_June_20.jpg" alt="img">
Yuzvendra Chahal took to his social media handles to share a throwback picture with former India captain MS Dhoni and fellow spinner in Team India, Kuldeep Yadav. In the picture, Chahal can be seen taking the field with Dhoni and Kuldeep. &ldquo;A walk to remember&rdquo;, the leg-spinner captioned the image on Twitter. Soon after Chahal shared the picture, fans flooded the post with comments for the former India skipper. A fan called Dhoni &ldquo;lion&rdquo; while another user pointed out that Chahal seems to be really missing the wicketkeeper-batsman.</p>

<p>Sher k sath bekhauf ghumne wale Sher hi hote h&hellip; — Deepanzz (@Deepanzz) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>While fans praised MS Dhoni on Chahal&rsquo;s tweet, Kuldeep Yadav took to Instagram to react to Chahal&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Kuldeep left a heart emoji along with a globe one on Chahal&rsquo;s picture.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old leg spinner has been quite active on social media during the forced break from cricket due to the coronavirus pandmeic.</p>
<p>Recently, Chahal trolled Chris Gayle on Instagram when the West Indies batsman tried to take a cheeky dig at the India spinner.</p>
<p>Chahal had posted a video of him bowling an impressive leg-spinner to knock over Martin Guptill&rsquo;s off stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overstepped the line, No ball!! Umpire,&rdquo; Gayle left a comment on Chahal&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Chahal, who has played alongside Gayle in Indian Premier League during the left-hander&rsquo;s stint with Royal Challengers Bangalore, hilariously took a cheeky dig Gayle for his comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;haha uncle still last night effect?&rdquo; Chahal replied.

<p>Key Highlights Sakshi Dhoni shared some stunning pictures from MS Dhoni&rsquo;s farmhouse in Ranchi Sakshi took to her official Twitter handle to share the pictures Dhoni is at his farmhouse with his family amid the lockdown</p>
<p>Former Indian skipper MS Dhoni remains the heartthrob of the nation. The veteran wicketkeeper-batsman has not been active in international cricket since India&rsquo;s semi-final exit from the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales. Nonetheless, the hype and hysteria surrounding him refuse to die down.</p>
<p>Amid the nationwide lockdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, Dhoni is with his family and enjoying his break at his farmhouse in Ranchi. While the 38-year-old remains out of action from the 22-yard cricket strip and continues to be least active on social media platforms, his wife Sakshi is quite the opposite in this aspect.</p>
<p>Sakshi has, time and again, shared breathtaking visuals of the former Indian captain&rsquo;s farmhouse in Jharkhand&rsquo;s capital city. On Saturday (June 13), Sakshi did the same by giving more insights into their picturesque farmhouse.</p>
<p>Earlier, videos of Dhoni and his daughter Ziva playing in the farmhouse as well as enjoying bike rides had gone viral after the clips were shared by Sakshi on Instagram. Recently, Sakshi also did her maiden Instagram live session with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) presenter Rupha Ramani.</p>
<p>During the chat session, Sakshi shared quite a few details on her relationship with Dhoni. She revealed how the two first met before getting married in 2010. She stated, &ldquo;He seemed to be a very regular guy. He seemed normal. For me, I didn&rsquo;t follow cricket at that time. We knew Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly. I knew there was a Pahadi guy, he has long hair and a hulk. My mom knew him, she was his fan. That much I knew. He seemed really regular. He was very down to earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, Sakshi made fun of Dhoni&rsquo;s long-orange hair and clearly mentioned that it didn&rsquo;t suit him. When Dhoni had entered the international arena, he had become a household name for not only his power-hitting but also for his long hair and admiration for bikes.</p>
<p>In his glorious 15-year-long international career so far, Dhoni remains to be the darling of the masses and will be seen in action in IPL 2020 for Chennai Super Kings (CSK), if the tournament is held later this year by the BCCI.

Former India opener Gautam Gambhir believes MS Dhoni would have been a completely different player had he continued batting in the top-order. The legendary opener said that the cricket world missed witnessing the former India captain continue to bat at No. 3.</p>

<p>He went on to say that Dhoni would have the ‘most exciting cricketer’ had he continued to bat at No. 3 instead of going on to become the captain of the Indian cricket team. Well, Dhoni indeed marked his arrival in world cricket when he was promoted at No.3. He scored a stunning 148 against a formidable Pakistan attack in just his fifth ODI.</p>
<p>His highest ODI score of 183 also came at that position when he destroyed the Sri Lankan attack. However, he played just 16 ODIs at the top-order spot before demoting himself and excelling as a finisher. In those 16 games, he scored an impressive 993 runs at an average of over 82 and a strike rate of close to 100.</p>
<p>After taking charge of the team, Dhoni batted mostly at No.5 and 6 and scored majority of his 10,773 ODI runs came at those positions. And while many few have scored more than 10,000 runs in ODIs, Gautam Gambhir believes Dhoni would have been even more successful had he batted at No.3.</p>
<p>“Probably world cricket has missed one thing… that is MS (Dhoni) captained India and did not bat at No. 3. Had MS batted at No. 3, probably world cricket would have seen a completely different player,” Gautam Gambhir told Star Sports ‘Cricket Connected’</p>
<p>“Probably he would have got many more runs, broken many records. Forget about records, they are meant to be broken. He would have been the most exciting cricketer in the world had he not captained India and had he batted at No. 3.</p>
<p>“MS Dhoni batting at No. 3 on flat wickets with the quality of bowling attack now in world cricket… look at Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and West Indies in the current situation, with the quality there is no international cricket, MS Dhoni would have broken most of the records,” he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dhoni has not played international cricket since the 2019 World Cup semifinal. As soon as the tournament ended, he took a sabbatical which is yet to end. He would have returned to action in March through the IPL but the tournament was suspended indefinitely in the light of the pandemic.</p>

MS Dhoni&rsquo;s retirement once again became the talk of the town as late on Wednesday, #DhoniRetires started trending on Twitter. MS Dhoni&rsquo;s wife Sakshi took to the micro-blogging site to clear the air and said that the lockdown had made people &ldquo;mentally unstable&rdquo;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only rumours ! I understand Lockdown has made people mentally unstable ! #DhoniRetires Get a life,&rdquo; Sakshi tweeted. Soon after her tweet went viral on social media, Sakshi deleted it. After Sakshi&rsquo;s statement, the trend on Twitter changed from #DhoniRetires to #DhoniNeverRetires as fans came in support of the former India captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waking up to see #DhoniNeverTires trending He never tires and will be back soon,&rdquo; a fan said.</p>

<p>Recently, veteran India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh said that according to him MS Dhoni has played his last match for India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I know him, he won&rsquo;t want to wear India blue jersey again. IPL he will play but for India I think he had decided World Cup (2019) was his last,&rdquo; Harbhajan said.</p>
<p>Dhoni has not played competitive cricket since India&rsquo;s semi-final loss to New Zealand in the World Cup 2019.</p>
<p>The former India captain was set to lead Chennai Super Kings in the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) but the Board of Control for Cricket in India postponed the lucrative league indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<p><img src="https://s4.scoopwhoop.com/anj2/5ee5f50160c060121eefcaae/94926b50-06aa-49d7-a709-1a44125f783f.jpg" alt="img">
You&rsquo;re not among us anymore, Sushant. You left the planet; its troubles, occasional joys and everything that exists on it.</p>
<p>We have lost you forever.</p>
<p>However, before going, you did something. You gave us the gift of movies that we can watch every time we forget how it was to see you smiling, moving, crying. In movies, you will always be one of us.</p>
<p>And there is one of them, that&rsquo;s the most special to us: M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story.</p>
<p>As a cricket lover, my heart breaks to even think that the on-screen Mahi is no more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a thought I can&rsquo;t afford to entertain at this moment because these days are long, and my heart is weary.</p>
<p>I do realise, though, that I am feeling this way because you were so believable in the film.</p>
<p>Cricket fans were bowled over by how authentically #SushantSinghRajput played #MSDhoni onscreen - body language, cricket stance, bat swing, hair style etc. everything was perfect. Deservingly he got so much love for this film which will always be remembered #RIPSushantSinghRajput pic.twitter.com/mUbdOOprP8 — Kaushik LM (@LMKMovieManiac) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>There were moments when I got completely immersed in it. It didn&rsquo;t feel like it wasn&rsquo;t Mahi, but you.</p>
<p>And that, among other things, is an act of courage.</p>
<p>To take up that role, to prepare for it, to make it look as good as you did.</p>
<p>Not to mention that you did a biopic on a cricketer who is still very relevant, still playing. As a matter of fact, when the movie had released, he was even a bigger part of the team. Only you could have taken up a job so difficult.</p>
<p>The helicopter shot.</p>
<p>The days of struggle.</p>
<p>#SushantSinghRajput R.I.P</p>
<p>Thank You for the Role of #MSDhoni 🙏</p>
<p>Still can&rsquo;t believe u have left us 😭</p>
<p>I can bet even once @msdhoni will also cry after listening to this news 🙏</p>
<p>I wish this was not true 🙏😶 pic.twitter.com/F5BzG06pLM — Kishan Singh (@iamKishanSingh7) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>The love real Dhoni never talks about.</p>
<p>Through you, Dhoni showed us himself, and it is a debt that we will never be able to repay.</p>
<p>And you took the responsibility with complete seriousness.</p>
<p>It was visible in the way you captured the nuances.</p>
<p>The fixing of the helmet, the tapping of the bat, the blinking of the eyes.</p>
<p>Truly, you aced the smallest of details. That look in your eyes right before hitting the ball, the expression while watching it go out of the stadium, the stance, the body language.</p>
<p>You studied all of it, and portrayed it with enviable honesty.</p>
<p>That goes for even the non-cricketing bits. For instance, we do not know how Dhoni was as a ticket conductor, but looking at you, we thought &lsquo;yes, this is how I imagined him to be&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I often wonder, how much do we really know Dhoni? Sure, people like me can&rsquo;t imagine our childhoods without him, but there is so much under wraps.</p>
<p>And that makes sense too. Dhoni never reveals what he is thinking.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story is probably the closest we will ever get to know our icon, and we only have you to thank for it.</p>
<p>You will be missed Sushant! 😭 #ripsushantsinghrajput pic.twitter.com/H70uzRoBKK — MS Dhoni Fans Club (@MSDhonifansclub) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>You would have had a long innings ahead, Sushant; and even though we lost the match today, it was a delight to see you play.</p>
