Trump’s comments came after senior aides presented him with a list of options they thought could help deal with the economic problems caused by the outbreak. Trump also said he was seeking to provide assistance to the airline, hotel and cruise industries, which are all suffering as Americans rapidly cancel travel plans.

AD

It was unclear, based on Trump’s comments, whether he would ask Congress to help these industries or if he thought he could do it on his own.

AD

“We are going to take care of and have been taking care of the American public and the American economy,” Trump said. He added that he would have another news conference on Tuesday to talk about the big economic package.

Trump’s comments made clear that the White House is considering a huge and expensive government response. Just a reduction by one percentage point in the payroll tax would cut between $55 billion and $75 billion in revenue, according to a recent projection from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

AD

Payroll tax cuts in the past have been popular with Democrats, because of the way they are structured, and opposed by many Republicans. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Friday that big stimulus packages have “never really worked in the past.” But House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) expressed skepticism about the idea.

AD

“I don’t think we think that the payroll tax cut is what we need right now,” Hoyer said. “What the economy needs right now is some stability and confidence that we are addressing the issue that is undermining the economy. And I mean, the president’s answer for almost everything is a tax cut. We think we need to make sure that people in health facilities and insurance companies and others have confidence that they’re not going to be bankrupted by this and they’ll have some support of the government.”

Hoyer said key House committees were researching immediate and longer-term relief packages in response to the coronavirus outbreak, adding that the first tranche of legislation could pass as early as later this week.

AD

“I think the consensus out of the group was that we need to address the immediate health needs first,” Hoyer said.

AD

Still, other senior Democrats said it was inevitable that Washington will have to step in with measures to stimulate the economy because of the coronavirus outbreak. “We’re going to reach that point,” said Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.). “If we’re serious about this, we have to put all the cards on the table.”

Vice President Pence, who is leading the administration’s coronavirus task force, also appeared to suggest the administration would embrace a package to provide paid sick leave to workers who become ill because of the coronavirus. Paid sick leave was among the menu options set to be presented to the president.

AD

Pence said the administration would work with Congress to make sure people who contract the coronavirus do not lose paychecks as a result, although details of such a plan were unclear

AD

The announcement came on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 2,000 points and as pressure was rapidly building on federal policymakers to address the growing economic impact of the outbreak.

After resisting a large economic package for weeks, the White House now seems to be quickly assembling one. Congressional leaders said they are considering their own legislative remedies to address the economic turmoil. Democrats are discussing how to propose paid sick leave as part of new legislation, while Republicans have expressed reservations about a one-time change. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), though, has said he would consider tax code changes to address the economic turmoil.

AD

The White House has faced intense pressure to arrest falling markets and stabilize an economy that investors increasingly fear may tip into recession. Many Democrats, meanwhile, are insisting that the government implement paid sick leave policies to help Americans who are forced to stay home because they are sick.

Last week, The Washington Post reported that White House officials were looking at deferring taxes for the airline, travel, and cruise industries. It could not be learned if Trump’s own hotels would benefit from the changes he is contemplating.

AD

In a sign of how quickly the White House is ramping up its economic response, White House officials have invited senior bank executives to meet this week to discuss the economic turmoil. Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon is expected to attend the meeting, among others.

AD

Despite growing fears, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin downplayed the chances of a recession at the news conference, saying the fluctuations in the stock market reflected the oil shock rather than weakness in the U.S. economy. Mnuchin said the administration would also consider extending money to companies through the U.S. Small Business Administration to certain firms hurt by the downturn. He added that the government could provide temporary tax relief to both businesses and individuals.

“This is not like the financial crisis where we don’t know the end in sight. This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months,” Mnuchin said. “The economy will be in very good shape a year from now.”

AD

Congress last week passed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill that focused on medical and public health needs caused by the coronavirus outbreak, but Democrats are already working on a new bill that would seek to address the economic problems that are rapidly expanding.

AD

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) plans to meet Monday evening with key committee chairs to discuss the planning, which includes efforts to lock in paid sick leave benefits for certain workers.

Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, told reporters on a conference call Monday that Congress should move forward quickly.

“I believe that this is precisely the direction we need to go in. There are the economic consequences from the crisis that are of equal concern as responding on the health-care side,” DeLauro said.

AD

“Everybody is trying to move at warp speed,” DeLauro added, although the timing, price tag and exact contours of any legislative response is uncertain.

AD

DeLauro has introduced legislation mandating 14 days of paid sick leave in the case of an emergency health crisis such as coronavirus, noting that most workers — especially low-wage workers — have no paid sick leave and thus would face difficulty complying with medical quarantine advice

Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) laid out a list of priorities in a statement released Sunday night, including enhanced unemployment insurance; expanded food stamps and school lunch programs; widespread and free coronavirus testing; and ­anti-price-gouging provisions.

Grassley, meanwhile, is looking at “targeted tax relief measures” with the aim of providing a “timely and effective response to the coronavirus,” a spokesman said Monday.

AD

Senate Finance Committee spokesman Michael Zona said several options under the committee’s jurisdiction were being reviewed as members learn more about the impact on specific industries and the economy as a whole.

He did not specify what the measures might be.

Before his news conference late Monday, Trump downplayed the danger posed by coronavirus in a series of Twitter posts.

At one point, he celebrated a sharp decline in oil prices, which investors fear signal a deflationary sell-off in a bidding war between major oil-producing nations. “Good for the consumer, gasoline prices coming down!,” Trump said about the decline, which experts warn could foreshadow a recession.

Trump also said on Twitter: “Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!”
