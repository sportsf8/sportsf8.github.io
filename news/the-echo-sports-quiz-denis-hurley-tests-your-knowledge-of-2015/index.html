<h3 id="al-boum-photo-joins-elite-group-with-back-to-back-cheltenham-gold-cup-success">&ldquo;Al Boum Photo joins elite group with back-to-back Cheltenham Gold Cup success&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2020/03/13/TELEMMGLPICT000227793882-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMG9jYnib85FJIfCc-bQYcQGNY_A2dHyghdflyNWj5P8.jpeg?imwidth=1200" alt="img">
It completed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for Willie Mullins, whose first-day drought was now a flood. The Gold Cup was the fourth race of the day and his fourth winner (and then he had the second in the St James’s Place Foxhunters).</p>
<p>With not much pace and a closely rated field, Paul Townend, for whom the day had been equally redemptive, began to move Al Boum Photo into contention a mile out and was front rank controlling things from the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Three out, his biggest dangers appeared to be Lostintranslation, on whom Robbie Power was motionless, and Real Steel, Al Boum Photo’s 50-1 stable companion.</p>
<p>A few lengths behind, Presenting Percy still had each-way hopes when he turned over at the second last but it was Nicky Henderson’s Santini, who stayed on strongly wide of the winner, who posed the biggest threat inside the last 100 yards, although the winner was always doing enough.</p>
<p>Since the war, only Cottage Rake, Arkle, L’Escargot and Best Mate have won consecutive Gold Cups. Kauto Star’s brace were divided by Denman. Best Mate also won his first Gold Cup aged seven, as Al Boum Photo was last year, and the Joe Donnelly-owned chaser is only 6-1 to match Best Mate and the peerless Arkle next year.</p>
<p>“I thought it was winnable with a clear run,” Mullins reflected. “I didn’t think it was anything like last year’s race. I know the statistics are against horses winning two Gold Cups but I didn’t worry about them.</p>
<p>“I didn’t see anything all year that I was afraid of. Everyone was knocking the Champion Hurdle but, to me, I wasn’t afraid to take on anyone today. If the same horse turned up this year, I reckoned it would take something we hadn’t seen before to beat him.”</p>
<p>“Paul was very brave, it was his plan and the whole thing came together. It’s his day and that’s the way I want it. He had a difficult job taking over from Ruby Walsh but he’s stable jockey to Willie Mullins and he’s a top-class guy with it.”</p>
<p>Mullins added: “I’m very happy to win two and we’ll plan for three. If we are back even competing we’d be very pleased. The owner’s very keen and loves Cheltenham. We owe a little thank-you to [the late] Mick O’Toole for hooking us up with the Donnellys with the hope of winning a Gold Cup.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the plan to go to Tramore [on New Year’s Day last year], the weather forced us. But we thought ‘why break a winning formula’, and I’d imagine that will be the plan next season, too.”</p>
<p>Marie Donnelly, the immaculately dressed wife of Joe, the Paris-based dapper former bookmaker, said: “We spoke to Paul in the paddock and Joe said to him to make history. It’s special for us and special for Willie to have in a row in one day. Well done to Paul. He was brave on him and he is obviously in tune with him.”</p>
<p>For the runner-up, Santini, it was a case of so near and yet so far.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to be proud of him and pleased for everyone but when you come that close …” said Nicky Henderson, leaving the sentence hanging. “He never touched a fence, he never left the inside rail, he fought like a lion but the other horse was better by a neck.</p>
<p>“It’s only his sixth steeplechase, he was a couple of lengths down at the last but I didn’t think we could hope for another Champ [his RSA winner who made up eight lengths from the last].”</p>
<p>“I’m a bit dejected,” said jockey Nico de Boinville, who picked up a two-day ban for interfering with Monalee. “I thought we were going to get there. It rode like a nice race, probably not fiercely run – we were all there three out. That’ll have made a man of Santini so the dream is still alive.”</p>
<p>Colin Tizzard was delighted with Lostintranslation. “It’s saved our week,” he said after a catalogue of disappointments. “He travelled, jumped and challenged at the last. I think he was slightly outstayed up the hill – not that he didn’t stay.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a great prep pulling up in the King George then having a wind operation but the worst worry was the form of the stable. They’ve all been cutting out but then you get a lovely run like that so we’ve all forgotten it now.”</p>
<p>Coronavirus might not be forgotten for a while, but in the annals of the turf, neither will the exploits of Al Boum Photo be readily erased from the memory.

You can’t see the winner of the Cheltenham Gold Cup from the paddock as he is led back to unsaddle, but you can follow his progress thanks to the wave of acclaim that accompanies him all the way along the rails and then back up the chute towards the entrance to the famous cauldron of a winner’s enclosure.</p>
<p>If it seemed louder than ever here on Friday as Al Boum Photo returned – he was the favourite, after all, as well as a rare dual winner – then it was a reminder too of what will be missing from racing’s grandest occasions if, or more probably when, the experts charged with managing the coronavirus pandemic decide that racing should go behind closed doors. But at least Al Boum Photo and Paul Townend got the reception they deserved, at the end of a compelling and ever-changing race that was in the balance until the final strides.</p>
<p>Goshen comes cropper at the last with Triumph Hurdle at his mercy Read more</p>
<p>Townend had earned it as much as his partner, having risen to the challenge of filling the riding boots of Ruby Walsh as stable jockey to Al Boum Photo’s trainer, Willie Mullins. Mullins saddled the first four winners here and Townend was aboard three, with the Gold Cup victory ensuring that he took the prize for the meeting’s leading rider for the first time.</p>
<p>Al Boum Photo is the first horse to win consecutive runnings of the Gold Cup since Best Mate in 2003, and the win owed much to Townend’s positional sense in a race that was run, for the most part, at a very steady pace. That ensured that the field was still tightly bunched coming down the hill for the final time, but the horses ridden prominently – Al Boum Photo, Lostintranslation and Santini – were best placed to strike for home and all made their move just after the turn for home.</p>
<p>Al Boum Photo and Lostintranslation took the final fence as one, with Santini just half a length behind. Lostintranslation was the first to wilt as they battled up the hill, but Santini, making only his sixth start over fences, was closing strongly in the final strides and would have needed only a few more yards of turf to overhaul the favourite.</p>

<p>For Mullins, the most successful trainer in Cheltenham Festival history, this was a second successive victory in a race that had famously eluded him, often in the most frustrating of circumstances, until Al Boum Photo’s win 12 months ago. This was just the winner’s second run of the season, as Mullins repeated the schedule that proved successful last year, and he will no doubt follow a similar path next season, reminiscent of the care with which Henrietta Knight steered Best Mate to three Gold Cups.</p>
<p>“We just decided not to break a winning formula and it’s paid off,” Mullins said. “I thought this year’s Gold Cup wasn’t anything like last year’s, and that if he had a clear round and a bit of luck, then it was all to play for.</p>
<p>“It’s really, really good for Paul, to take over from someone like Ruby Walsh. People said he was under pressure. Paul does his own thing, he probably rides better under a little bit of pressure. Paul has come and stamped his authority on his season in Ireland. It’s a tough act to follow, but he is Paul Townend, stable jockey to Willie Mullins, and he is top class.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he expected to be as forward as he was, that wasn’t what he said to me before going out, but I could see the horse just taking him there with his jumping and he didn’t want to disappoint him. That’s a rider riding with huge confidence.” For Townend, who endured a series of frustrating near-misses on the opening day’s card, Al Boum Photo is a horse that “has everything, guts as much as anything else.” He added: “At least [the week] ended well. I suppose he was a bit unknown last year and this year, he had to deliver.</p>

<p>“We missed a couple of fences but he has a tendency to do that. He started to jump well when we needed to, and that got us into a good position when we got to the top of the hill.</p>
<p>“This is the stage, before this I was having a brilliant day but this is the one, the icing on the cake. The Gold Cup is the Gold Cup and I’ll have to wait a year for another one.”</p>
<p>Townend was not the only one casting an eye already towards 2021. The crowd at Cheltenham to see the race was 68,859, only a fraction down on the 70,000 capacity that usually makes the pilgrimage to the west country for the final day of the Festival, and tickets will be in very short supply if Al Boum Photo returns next year to attempt to join Best Mate and Arkle as the winner in three consecutive years.</p>
<p>Santini, still so lightly raced, is likely to be a stern opponent once again, while Champ, a stable companion at the Nicky Henderson yard, will also be a huge contender judged on his extraordinary win in Wednesday’s RSA Chase.</p>
<p>Al Boum Photo, though, is now steeplechasing’s undisputed champion, and is quoted at a top price of 6-1 to make it three in a row. It is a thought to carry into the weeks and months ahead, as racing prepares for a future with no one in the grandstand.

<p>The Cheltenham Gold Cup is a horse race, it&rsquo;s a social gathering and it&rsquo;s a handsome 96-year-old trophy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the most prestigious National Hunt (ie horses which race over jumps) festival in the calendar.</p>
<p>This year the Cheltenham Festival runs from Tuesday March 10 to Friday March 13, with the highlight, the Gold Cup race itself, is run.</p>
<p>And last year the original Gold trophy was presented to the winner, Al Boum Photo&rsquo;s, handlers for the first time in almost 50 years.</p>
<p>The first Gold Cup race was run in 1819, a three-mile Flat race won by Spectre.</p>
<p>But the race as we know it now was introduced in 1924, when Red Splash won the trophy we now recognise as the Gold Cup.</p>
<p>It continued to be presented until the early 1970s when a private owner took possession and placed it in a bank vault. It was reacquired by the racecourse in 2018 and now remains on display there, the winning owners receiving a replica.</p>
<p>It weighs 644 grams of nine carat gold and is plated in 18 carat gold to give it a rich colour.</p>
<p>A Gold Cup is not all the winning handlers receive. The race is the most valuable non-handicap chase in Britain. The total prize money for the 2019 running was £625,000, with £351,687 going to the winner and prize money down to the eighth horse home.</p>
<p>The race is run over a distance of three miles, two furlongs and 70 yards and during its running there are 22 fences to be jumped.</p>
<p>The steeplechase is open to horses aged five years and over.</p>
<p>The most famous winner of the race was Arkle, who won three consecutive runnings from 1964 to 1966.</p>
<p>So certain were bookies that the gelding was going to win for a third time in 1966 he was given a starting price of 1/10 (a £10 bet would have won £1).</p>
<p>Of course he won.</p>
<p>Most successful Gold Cup horse</p>
<p>Even Arkle couldn&rsquo;t compare with the record of the remarkable Golden Miller. He won five successive Gold Cups between 1932 and 1936.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t win in 1931 or 1937 because first frost and then flooding caused the cancellation of that year&rsquo;s running.</p>
<p>But he returned in 1938, where he came second to Morse Code.</p>
<p>Most famous rivalry</p>
<p>The run in to the finish line is uphill which has impacted on so many famous finishes.</p>
<p>In 2011 the famous Kauto Star and Denman went head to head, but the younger legs of Long Run told up the hill as the 7/2 favourite powered past both to win for the only time.</p>
<p>Kauto Star won the race in 2007, but was beaten into second place by Denman the following year. In 2009 Kauto Star then reversed the finishing order, forcing Denman into the runners up spot.</p>
<p>The gallant Denman also finished second in 2010 and 2011.</p>
<p>Record attendance</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s Gold Cup saw 71,816 gather at Cheltenham, a new record for the race.</p>
<p>The total for the four days also set a new record at 266,779.</p>
<p>Most successful Gold Cup jockey</p>
<p>Pat Taafe is the most successful jockey to ride in the Gold Cup. He rode Arkle to all three of his victories in 1964, 1965 and 1966, then piloted Fort Leney to victory in 1968. In total Taafe rode 32 winners at Cheltenham, including five Champion Chases as well as his four Gold Cups.</p>
<p>The last horse to win a hat-trick of Gold Cups</p>

<p>Best Mate was one of the best loved horses in British racing history, landing three Gold Cups in succession in 2002, 2003 and 2004.</p>
<p>He was denied a potential four in a row when he was withdrawn from the 2005 race eight days before the event after bursting a blood vessel on the gallops.</p>
<p>When he died of a suspected heart attack following a race at Exeter the same year his death made front page headlines.</p>
<p>Fastest Gold Cup winner</p>
<p>Poet Prince was due to be ridden by his owner, David Sherbrooke, in the 1941 Gold Cup.</p>
<p>However, a fall the day before presented Roger Burford with the ride.</p>
<p>It was just as well. He went on to post a record winning time of six minutes and 15 seconds.</p>
<p>Most Successful Trainer</p>
<p>The most successful trainer was Arkle&rsquo;s owner, Tom Dreaper, who won five Gold Cups with three separate horses. Prince Regent won in 1946, followed by Arkle&rsquo;s hat-trick and then Fort Leney in 1968.</p>
<p>Biggest priced winner</p>
<p>If Arkle&rsquo;s 1/10 favouritism in 1966, which he justified, was the shortest priced winner ever, the longest was Norton&rsquo;s Coin who started at 100/1 in 1990.</p>

<h3 id="cheltenham-festival-chacun-pour-soi-misses-out--tiger-roll-bids-for-treble">&ldquo;Cheltenham Festival: Chacun Pour Soi misses out &amp; Tiger Roll bids for treble&rdquo;</h3>

Last updated on .From the section Horse Racing</p>
<p>Defi du Seuil has dominated the division in Britain this season</p>
<p>Cheltenham Festival day two - BBC coverage Live text on the BBC Sport website from 13:00 GMT. Live radio commentary between 13:15 and 17:45 on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, with coverage on 5 Live between 15:15 and 15:45.</p>
<p>Chacun Pour Soi has been ruled out of a clash with Defi Du Seuil in the Champion Chase on Wednesday&rsquo;s second day of the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
<p>The two-mile feature race had already lost the 2018 and 2019 winner Altior.</p>
<p>It was announced just after 11:00 GMT on Wednesday that the Willie Mullins-trained Chacun Pour Soi, was also out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two-time Grand National winner Tiger Roll will look to land a fifth Festival triumph in the Cross Country Chase.</p>
<p>Who will be champion?</p>
<p>In the absence of Altior and Chacun Pour Soi, it leaves Defi Du Seuil, trained by Philip Hobbs as the clear favourite for the race, which now has just five runners.</p>
<p>Altior&rsquo;s bid for a hat-trick was scuppered on Tuesday when he failed to recover in time from lameness while Chacun Pour Soi was pulled out on Wednesday morning on veterinary advice with an abscess.</p>
<p>Defi Du Seuil, the mount of Barry Geraghty, has won twice at the Festival.</p>
<p>Geraghty, fresh from victory in Tuesday&rsquo;s Champion Hurdle on another JP McManus-owned horse, Epatante, will be bidding for an outright record sixth win in the Champion Chase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a horse, I just simply love his jumping,&rdquo; admitted Geraghty before the start of the Festival. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got so much scope and has the perfect attitude for jumping a fence.</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s runner-up Politologue, plus Dynamite Dollars, Sceau Royal and Bun Doran, complete the small field.</p>
<p>Tiger on a roll?</p>
<p>Tiger Roll on the gallops at Cheltenham earlier this week</p>
<p>There will be few more popular winners than Tiger Roll if the Gordon Elliott-trained star can land a third successive Cross Country Chase.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old also won the Triumph Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2014 and the National Hunt Chase three years later.</p>
<p>Victory here would keep the diminutive horse on track for an attempt to win next month&rsquo;s Grand National at Aintree for an unprecedented third consecutive time.</p>
<p>Opposition on Wednesday includes French challenger Easysland and the 2018 Cheltenham Gold Cup runner-up Might Bite.</p>
<p>Wednesday schedule</p>
<p>13:30 - Ballymore Novices' Hurdle 2m 5f</p>
<p>14:10 - RSA Insurance Novices' Chase 3m 80y</p>
<p>14:50 - Coral Cup Handicap Hurdle 2m 5f</p>

<h3 id="faugheens-saga-stirs-hearts-again-at-leopardstown-with-grade-one-win">&ldquo;Faugheen&rsquo;s saga stirs hearts again at Leopardstown with Grade One win&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbff1ed135b47a2a7e0c76c3ca642f7875c7ca18/0_45_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=38b9beac70fa2ccc9ae628132721c1f3" alt="img">
Willie Mullins has saddled more than 3,000 winners over the course of a 32-year training career, but as the 12-year-old Faugheen returned to the unsaddling enclosure here on Sunday after winning the Grade One Flogas Novice Chase, even his trainer could not remember a moment to match it. “I’ve had lots of winners but this was special,” Mullins said. “The way he battled. To come back at his age and do it on the number one stage, that’s fantastic.”</p>
<p>Leopardstown agreed. The grandstand emptied as soon as Faugheen crossed the line half a length in front of Easy Game, a stable companion who is half his age, to acclaim their returning hero just 14 months on from a horrible fall at the same course which left him on the turf for two agonising minutes. Twelve-year-old Grade One winners are a great rarity – only Sizing Europe (2014 Punchestown Champion Chase) and Florida Pearl, in the 2004 Irish Gold Cup, have achieved the feat in recent decades. Victory in a Grade One novice event at such an advance age is more astonishing still and Faugheen’s connections must now decide whether to attempt an unprecedented double at Cheltenham next month.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to retire him without going over fences,” Mullins said. “That’s what we bought him for. People want to retire horses at 10, 11 or 12, but to me, they have plenty of life in them if they haven’t used up the mileage as younger horses. They an go much longer than people think and he’s the living proof of it. He’s got stamina, he’s got speed, he can jump. He’s got the whole package and a will [to win].”</p>
<p>Faugheen is top-priced at 6-1 favourite for the Marsh [formerly JLT] Novice Chase at Cheltenham next month, and 14-1 for the RSA Chase.</p>
<p>Delta Work, the 5-2 second-favourite, stayed on best at the end of a demanding race for the Irish Gold Cup here on Sunday, beating Kemboy and Presenting Percy to give Gordon Elliott, his trainer, a first success in Ireland’s most prestigious staying chase.</p>
<p>The first three horses home approached the final fence with less than a length between them, but Delta Work jumped best to secure an advantage that he held to the line. It was the fifth Grade One success of his career, which includes a win in the ultra-competitive Pertemps Handicap Hurdle final at the Cheltenham Festival in 2018.</p>
<p>“We missed here last year and went straight to Cheltenham [for the Gold Cup],” Elliott said, “which might not have been ideal. It’s all systems go now for Cheltenham. Our horse is improving the whole time and we can dream about a Gold Cup now.”</p>
<p>Delta Work is top-priced at around 6-1 for the Gold Cup in an open market in which Al Boum Photo, Lostintranslation, Kemboy, Santini and Clan Des Obeaux are all on offer at single-figure odds.</p>
<p>Mullins added another significant runner to his Cheltenham team when Asteroin Forlonge forged clear of the Elliott-trained favourite Easywork to win the Chanelle Pharma Novice Hurdle over two miles. His Festival target, though, is more likely to be the two-and-a-half mile Ballymore Novice Hurdle, as Joe Donnelly, his owner, also owns Shishkin, the current favourite for the Supreme Novice Hurdle.</p>
<p>Aspire Tower was sent off at 1-3 to justify his status as favourite for next month’s Triumph Hurdle, only to fall at the last while trying to fend off a strong challenge from Joseph O’Brien’s Cerberus. With the race seemingly at his mercy, Cerberus then idled on the run-in as his stable companion A Wave Of The Sea ran on to snatch the win.</p>
<p>All three seem likely to renew rivalry at the Festival, but the result strengthened the form claims of Allmankind (5-1), who beat Cerberus with ease at Chepstow last month.

<h3 id="the-2020-magners-cheltenham-gold-cup-six-key-questions">&ldquo;The 2020 Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup: Six key questions&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5v3ask2aw4ox/3EEEkqy2Bqi2424yGsM20U/76152e9a323811093f6201d70bc44bec/MT2_9515.jpg?q=50" alt="img">
The Cheltenham Festival is little more than 60 days away and the countdown to the biggest race of them all begins in earnest with 31 entries revealed on Wednesday for the 2020 Magners Cheltenham Gold Cup.</p>
<p>We are set for further clues in the coming weeks, but what does the Gold Cup picture look like now - and who rates the pick at the current prices?</p>
<p>We consider six key questions before the big race on Friday, March 13.</p>
<p>Al Boum Photo – first successive winner since Best Mate?</p>
<p>Retaining the Gold Cup is no easy feat. Three-time winner Best Mate was the last horse to do so in 2004 and greats such as L’Escargot, Arkle and Cottage Rake are the only other successive winners since 1945.</p>
<p>The history books raise doubts, but Al Boum Photo is a lightly-raced eight-year-old who was well in command last year and you would hope he can produce a similar effort again this year.</p>
<p>A strong stayer, Al Boum Photo suffered interference on the first circuit in last season’s race while connections may ponder a more positive ride this time; such tactics went down well on his return and contributed to one of his better jumping performances.</p>
<p>He went really nicely at Tramore in a comparable performance to his victory in the same race last year en route to Gold Cup glory. The title holder warrants plenty of respect, though he has not been missed at 5-1 and was trimmed by the layers for winning as he should have done on New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>Will Clan Des Obeaux stay the distance this time?</p>
<p>Watch how Clan Des Obeaux landed his second King George</p>
<p>King George winner last season, King George winner this season. But will Clan Des Obeaux fully conquer the extended three and a quarter miles at Cheltenham this time around?</p>
<p>He faded into fifth in last year’s Gold Cup when pre-race doubts about his staying power were ultimately proved correct, but he shaped better than his 11-length defeat in fifth behind Al Boum Photo suggests.</p>
<p>Fairly prominent behind the pace-setters as Native River and Might Bite exchanged blows in the lead, Clan Des Obeaux looked to hit a slight flat spot just before the top of the hill before travelling nicely on the downhill run heading towards the straight. It is wise to thing he might just be ridden a tad more conservatively this time.</p>
<p>A year older and now stronger according to Paul Nicholls, his jumping is arguably the most assured of all the market protagonists and that will give him every chance.</p>
<p>The trainer’s assertion that his horse wants to be fresh is not completely backed up by the form book and going straight to the Gold Cup is a small question mark.</p>
<p>Clan Des Obeaux is yet to win in five visits to Cheltenham and, while commendable in this race last term, this is not his ideal test. He is expected to ultimately fall short again in what may prove a stronger race this time.</p>
<p>Which are the biggest potential improvers?</p>
<p>Kemboy is expected to improve for his outing in the Savills Chase on his seasonal debut</p>
<p>Kemboy proved highly progressive last year and had to prove himself from a ‘standing start’ on his belated return in the Savills Chase.</p>
<p>He more than passed the test, taking a grip for fully two miles and jumping particularly exuberantly early in the race. The way he shaped at Leopardstown suggests he could take a very significant step forward next time.</p>
<p>Delta Work beat Kemboy in the Savills Chase, bouncing back from his Down Royal flop and landing senior Grade One honours on just his second start in open company. His jumping still does not warrant absolute trust, but when he gets it right he takes lengths out of his rivals and he looks the type to benefit from another run before the Festival. Gordon Elliott suggested Delta Work will improve physically from Leopardstown, too.</p>
<p>The trainer’s horses were not fully firing at last year’s Festival, but Delta Work moved with real menace late in the RSA despite doing plenty wrong and, with a clear round, must be on the premises in the big one this year.</p>
<p>Talking of the RSA, Santini is the forgotten horse in the Gold Cup picture. Second at the Festival last year after a horrid preparation, he runs at Ascot later this month. However, 10-1 does not make much appeal.</p>
<p>Lostintranslation – Gold Cup dreams still alive?</p>
<p>Lostintranslation showed a good attitude to win the Betfair Chase</p>
<p>Lostintranslation was arguably the horse of this jumps season before Christmas – electric on his Carlisle return, novice form looking better all the time and a Grade One winner on just his second start out of novice company in the Betfair Chase.</p>
<p>He was flat last time in the King George, never displaying his usual fluency and throwing in highly uncharacteristic jumping errors. A breathing issue exacerbated by the soft ground was mentioned by connections afterwards.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the performance was out of character given the small field at Kempton, an unexacting gallop and his season beforehand. Lostintranslation has something to prove now, but the general evidence points more to an ‘off-day’ rather than long-term malaise.</p>
<p>The fact he moved threateningly from the back straight despite his poor round just hints at inherent class and 8-1 Gold Cup quotes from the 4-1 prices before the King George could prove a little premature. It is a shame we&rsquo;re now unlikely to see him before Cheltenham and such a preparation doesn&rsquo;t fully inspire.</p>
<p>One small thing to note – Colin Tizzard won the Gold Cup with Native River in 2018 but he’s been quiet at the last two Festivals before hitting riotous form at Aintree and Punchestown. He has saddled just three Festival winners from 80 runners in the past five seasons and his runners perform significantly below market expectation in that time (0.63 actual winners to expected winners).</p>
<p>Can anything emerge from left-field?</p>
<p>Bellshill narrowly won the Irish Gold Cup last year</p>
<p>Time is running out, though the layers might have taken a small chance with Bellshill at 50-1.</p>
<p>He was the pick of the Willie Mullins’ quartet last year after Irish Gold Cup success but made numerous early errors and was promptly pulled up before running below par again at Punchestown subsequently.</p>
<p>A hard race on unusually quick ground at the Dublin Racing Festival does seem a legitimate excuse. Only Envoi Allen and Klassical Dream won at both meetings last season – eight horses triumphed at both meetings after the inaugural 2018 fixture.</p>
<p>Bellshill made a perfectly acceptable reappearance in the Savills Chase at Leopardstown, looking particularly good during the first mile before reaching for the third-last. One of the first off the bridle then, he was fully eased after the last and shaped much better than his defeat by 24 lengths suggests.</p>
<p>Mullins expects improvement and the Irish Gold Cup – the race he won last year – looks the next port of call. He is not the likeliest winner of the Cheltenham showpiece by any means and no ten-year-old has won the race since the early 90s, but 50-1 is an overreaction to some modest efforts.</p>
<p>What is the Gold Cup play at this stage?</p>

<p>In an interesting market, some bigger-priced contenders are naturally vulnerable for win purposes but still look generous at the current quotes; Monalee at 25-1 is an example.</p>
<p>Of those at the head of the market, Kemboy appeals most at 7-1 with Skybet and 888sport. His return in the Savills Chase was particularly eye-catching and we can expect a significantly slicker article next time with that freshness out of him.</p>
<p>Even at this stage, he looks to boast a better chance than the current odds suggest.</p>
