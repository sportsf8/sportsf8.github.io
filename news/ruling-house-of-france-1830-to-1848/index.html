<p>The Malthusian underpinnings of Boris Johnson’s “herd immunity” strategy</p>
<p>By Thomas Scripps</p>
<p>8 June 2020</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s name will forever be associated with the murderous strategy of “herd immunity.”</p>
<p>A policy now universally followed by the world’s ruling classes was first openly advocated in response to the coronavirus pandemic by Johnson’s government, where it found a fitting representative in a prime minister who embodies the most reactionary traditions of British imperialism. Johnson’s actions have stripped bare the fundamental savagery of a social order based on the accumulation of profit by a super-rich oligarchy, in a way that will never be forgotten or forgiven by the working class.</p>
<p>On March 13, two days after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Johnson’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance suggested publicly that the population could “build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission.” Johnson had spelt out the practicalities of this policy in an interview the week before, where he explained, “one of the theories is, that perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease, as it were, to move through the population.”</p>
<p>The general concept of herd immunity has a legitimate scientific background, referring to the immunisation of a sufficient percentage of the population to block transmission of and therefore contain and eradicate a virus. But with serious diseases, such immunity has only ever been conceived of as the result of mass vaccination programmes. To rely on individuals developing natural immunity through contact with the virus not only fails to guarantee effective resistance to infection, through the development of lasting antibodies. It also presupposes the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people who do not survive the disease. This is exactly what the British government intended.</p>
<p>In keeping with their plan, no significant public health measures were put in place as the pandemic spread rapidly internationally and throughout Europe. No lockdown was imposed, and major sports events were allowed to go ahead. On March 12, the government abandoned any thought of containing the virus through community tracing and quarantining. Asked on Sky News why UK society was carrying on as normal when high infection rates would lead to an unprecedented number of deaths, Vallance replied, “Well of course we do face the prospect, as the prime minister said yesterday, of an increasing number of people dying.”</p>
<p>What was being prepared was a slaughter. On March 2, a report to the government’s Science Advice Group for Emergencies (SAGE) warned that coronavirus was highly contagious and already spreading in the population. If “stringent measures” were not imposed it would result in “around 80% of the population [53 million people] becoming infected,” resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths.</p>
<p>A national lockdown was only implemented three weeks later, on March 23, under massive popular pressure and amid widespread repugnance and anger at the pronouncements of the government. Ever since, the government has been working with big business and the trade unions to get the policy reversed so that now a criminal policy of an unsafe return to work is underway.</p>
<p>“Herd immunity” is not a public health strategy. It is a policy of culling the vulnerable, while defending the economic interests of the ruling elite—a sociopathic prioritisation of profit over life. According to a senior Conservative, it was summarised by Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings as “herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s supporters in the right-wing media have openly championed the same agenda. On March 13, fascistic columnist Katie Hopkins tweeted, “Coronavirus is a team sport. Get it. Get immunity. Feel better. The herd triumphs. Do not fear death. Everyone has an end.”</p>
<p>On March 31, Toby Young wrote in the Sceptic, “spending £350 billion to prolong the lives of a few hundred thousand mostly elderly people is an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money.” Telegraph economics editor Russell Lynch published an article declaring, “The cost of saving lives in this lockdown is too high.”</p>
<p>The bloody balance sheet of this policy is that Britain has the highest number of deaths from COVID-19 outside of the United States, with its far bigger population. The death toll is set to explode as the population is sent back to work without even the most minimal public health protections in place.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson and “global over-population”</p>
<p>The Johnson government is reviving and putting into practice the most barbaric of social theories. A valuable insight into the conceptions guiding the government’s response to COVID-19 is to be found in a hitherto obscure opinion piece written by Johnson for the Daily Telegraph in 2007. The article is titled, “Global over-population is the real issue.” In it, Johnson laments how “it is a tragic measure of how far the world has changed” that “the fertility of the human race” can no longer be publicly discussed as a government policy.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s Telegraph article &ldquo;Global over-population is the real issue&rdquo;</p>
<p>“We seem to have given up on population control, and all sorts of explanations are offered for the surrender. Some say Indira Gandhi gave it all a bad name, by her demented plan to sterilise Indian men with the lure of a transistor radio.</p>
<p>“Some attribute our complacency to the Green Revolution, which seemed to prove Malthus wrong. It became the received wisdom that the world’s population could rise to umpteen billions, as mankind learnt to make several ears of corn grow where one had grown before.”</p>
<p>What this means, says Johnson, is that society is “refusing to say anything sensible about the single biggest challenge facing the Earth; and no, whatever it might now be conventional to say, the single biggest challenge is not global warming. The primary challenge facing our species is the reproduction of our species itself.”</p>
<p>Attributing this situation to “political cowardice,” Johnson agitates, “It is time we had a grown-up discussion about the optimum quantity of human beings in this country and on this planet. … Isn’t it time politicians stopped being so timid, and started talking about the real number one issue?”</p>
<p>Johnson makes no real effort to conceal the fascistic character of his views. He writes that “we have reached the absurd position in which humanity bleats about the destruction of the environment, and yet there is not a peep in any communiqué from any summit of the EU, G8 or UN about the population growth that is causing that destruction.</p>
<p>“You can see it as you fly over Mexico City, a vast checkerboard of smog-bound, low-rise dwellings stretching from one horizon to the other; and when you look down on what we are doing to the planet, you have a horrifying vision of habitations multiplying and replicating like bacilli in a Petri dish.”</p>
<p>More than all the tame “investigations” of the corporate media, this article gets to the core of the British government’s murderous response to the coronavirus pandemic. Social inequality, poverty, wars and the gutting of social services are non-issues to Johnson. Any measures to address them, let alone a global pandemic, would be counterproductive: the workers in the slums of Mexico City (or anywhere else)—”replicating like bacilli in a Petri dish”—are the real virus.</p>
<p>The thrust of Johnson’s article turns on the reference to Thomas Malthus, a capitalist ideologue of the late 18th and early 19th century who argued that the “inevitability” of overpopulation made poverty and early death necessary for the poor. Johnson embraces this claim with his declaration that history only “ seemed to prove Malthus wrong.”</p>
<p>While he is blunter and appears stupider than most of his fellow capitalist politicians, Johnson was educated at Eton public school and Oxford University. He knows the intellectual and political smoke signal he is sending to his co-thinkers.</p>
<p>Since its first articulation, Malthusianism has performed a vital and vicious political function for the social layer in which Johnson is thoroughly enmeshed.</p>
<p>As leading German Marxist August Bebel explained in 1879, Malthus’s work “contained an explanation of existing evils that expressed the innermost thoughts and wishes of the ruling classes, and justified them before the world.” Namely, that while property and wealth righteously insulates them from the ravages of hunger and disease, the working class, as little more than beasts of burden for the capitalists and the landowners, should expect no such relief. The elite can live luxurious lives for as long as the labour of society can sustain them, but death for an old or infirm worker becomes “natural” at the point they can no longer meet their commitment to their betters.</p>
<p>Thomas Malthus</p>
<p>Today the toll of the pandemic is viewed as a supposedly natural “check” on sections of the population considered a drain on profits. That is the content of “herd immunity.”</p>
<p>Thomas Malthus and “population theory”</p>
<p>Born to a country gentleman, Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) was a fellow of Cambridge University, a curate in the Church of England and later a professor in the private college established by the East India Company to train its administrators. He became a fundamental figure in bourgeois politics with his publication of An Essay on the Principle Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of Society in 1798.</p>
<p>Malthus argued:</p>
<p>The power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind [wars, for example] are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction; and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague, advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and ten thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.</p>
<p>All social problems were resolved into the problem of a perpetual excess of people who, if left unchecked by society, would be “naturally” killed off by “sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague.”</p>
<p>On pain of these catastrophes, Malthus advocated punitive measures of population control and insisted on the futility of the rich supporting a “redundant population.” He demanded “moral restraint,” preventing the poor from having too many children, an end to the Poor Law system of relief for the destitute, and only the most selective private charity.</p>
<p>This was a justification for the unrestrained operation of the capitalist profit system, whatever its devastating consequences for the working class.</p>
<p>Karl Marx in 1875</p>
<p>The “law of population” is an ahistorical nonsense. Karl Marx declared it a “libel on the human race,” delivering a scathing criticism of the “abstract numerical relation, which [Malthus] has fished purely out of thin air, and which rests neither on natural nor on historical laws.”</p>
<p>As Marx would later demonstrate in Capital, contemporary poverty and unemployment are a consequence not of “overpopulation” but of the exploitation of the worker by the capitalist, which produces an “Accumulation of wealth at one pole” and an “accumulation of misery, agony of toil slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole.”</p>
<p>Malthus, Marx explained, sought to disguise this reality with an “apologia for the poverty of the working classes.” He gave “brutal expression to the brutal viewpoint of capital” that if workers could not maintain themselves or their children in the “struggle for existence,” to use Malthus’s terms, they should expect no support. The worker “has no work, hence no wages, and since he has no existence as a human being but only as a worker, he can go and bury himself, starve to death, etc.”</p>
<p>The concluding chapter of Malthus’s essay includes the statement:</p>
<p>That the principal and most permanent cause of poverty has little or no direct relation to forms of government, or the unequal division of property; and that, as the rich do not in reality possess the power of finding employment and maintenance for the poor, the poor cannot, in the nature of things, possess the right to demand them; are important truths flowing from the principle of population…</p>
<p>This ghoulish theory was advanced in opposition to the struggle of the masses for an improvement in their position. “A mob,” the bourgeois academic trembles, “is of all monsters the most fatal to freedom.” Malthus’s essay was first published in 1798, the year of the United Irishman uprising, and the next three editions in the years leading up to the 1819 massacre of workers protesting for parliamentary representation at Peterloo, Manchester. The fifth edition was published in 1830.</p>
<p>Malthus declared himself an enemy of the Enlightenment arguments for equality recently given explosive actuality in the American and French Revolutions. In the course of his original essay and subsequent editions, he attacked the British utopian anarchist William Godwin, utopian socialist Robert Owen, radical democrat Thomas Paine and the French revolutionary Nicholas de Condorcet. Against egalitarian arguments demanding fair access to basic social rights, Malthus provided the ruling class with a crude ideological club to justify the impoverishment and premature death of the poor as the natural order of things. He was rewarded with immediate and immense influence in ruling circles.</p>
<p>As Marx explained:</p>
<p>The great sensation this pamphlet caused, was due solely to party interest. The French Revolution had found passionate defenders in the United Kingdom; the “principle of population,” slowly worked out in the eighteenth century, and then, in the midst of a great social crisis, proclaimed with drums and trumpets as the infallible antidote to the teachings of Condorcet, &amp;c., was greeted with jubilance by the English oligarchy as the great destroyer of all hankerings after human development.</p>
<p>Malthus theoretically enshrined the principle that the working class has no right to life except as a disposable labour force for the capitalist class. He argued, “There is one right which man has generally been thought to possess which I am confident he neither does nor can possess—a right to subsistence when his labour will not fairly purchase it … no person has any claim of right on society for subsistence, if his labour will not purchase it.”</p>
<p>In the second version of his essay, Malthus stated his savage views so boldly that the following passage had to be removed in subsequent editions: “A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him.”</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels subjected Malthus’s legacy to a devastating exposure in his 1843 Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy, in words that resound with full force today:</p>
<p>Malthus … maintains that population is always pressing on the means of subsistence; that as soon as production increases, population increases in the same proportion; and that the inherent tendency of the population to multiply in excess of the available means of subsistence is the root of all misery and all vice. For, when there are too many people, they have to be disposed of in one way or another: either they must be killed by violence or they must starve. … The implications of this line of thought are that since it is precisely the poor who are the surplus, nothing should be done for them except to make their dying of starvation as easy as possible, and to convince them that it cannot be helped and that there is no other salvation for their whole class than keeping propagation down to the absolute minimum. … Charity is to be considered a crime, since it supports the augmentation of the surplus population. Indeed, it will be very advantageous to declare poverty a crime and to turn poor-houses into prisons, as has already happened in England as a result of the new “liberal” Poor Law… Am I to go on any longer elaborating this vile, infamous theory, this hideous blasphemy against nature and mankind? Am I to pursue its consequences any further? Here at last we have the immorality of the economist brought to its highest pitch. … And it is just this theory which is the keystone of the liberal system of free trade, whose fall entails the downfall of the entire edifice. For if here competition is proved to be the cause of misery, poverty and crime, who then will still dare to speak up for it?</p>
<p>Engels noted that in 1834, just a few months before the death of Malthus, his writings were used to justify a reform of the Poor Law system designed to curb the minimal cost to ratepayers of maintaining the destitute. Relief payments were replaced with the hellish workhouse system. Men, women, and children were separated and forced to live and work in prison-like conditions. Support was withdrawn from the mothers of “illegitimate” children.</p>
<p>Just over a decade later, the Malthusian claim of the inevitability and benefit of catastrophic “checks” on the population, and of the inability of society to avert their consequences, justified the British government’s genocidal response to Ireland’s Great Famine of 1845-49. A million people starved to death and a million more were forced to emigrate while the British ruling class insisted that the free operation of the market could not be interfered with. Even as Ireland’s potato crop was destroyed by blight, vast quantities of food continued to be exported for sale.</p>
<p>Charles Edward Trevelyan</p>
<p>The Whig government’s Assistant Secretary to the Treasury Charles Trevelyan thought the famine was an “effective mechanism for reducing surplus population” and a “direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence” sent to reform the “selfish, perverse and turbulent” Irish. Trevelyan had studied under Malthus.</p>
<p>Mutatis Mutandis, there is nothing to distinguish the actions of the Whigs in the mid-19th century from Johnson’s Tories during the pandemic of 2020.</p>
<p>Malthus, social Darwinism and eugenics</p>
<p>Malthus was foundational to the “survival of the fittest” theories of social Darwinism and eugenics in the late 19th and early 20th century.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), the most prominent social Darwinist, refers in A Theory on Population, deduced from the General Law of Animal Fertility, to a “constant increase of people beyond the means of subsistence,” an “excess of fertility which entails a constant pressure of population upon the means of subsistence.” Going further than Malthus’s idea of a “struggle for existence,” however, he concluded:</p>
<p>Necessarily, families and races whom this increasing difficulty of getting a living which excess of fertility entails, does not stimulate to improvements in production—that is, to greater mental activity—are on the high road to extinction; and must ultimately be supplanted by those whom the pressure does so stimulate. This truth we have recently seen exemplified in Ireland. And here, indeed, without further illustration, it will be seen that premature death, under all its forms, and from all its causes, cannot fail to work in the same direction. For as those prematurely carried off must, in the average of cases, be those in whom the power of self-preservation is the least, it unavoidably follows, that those left behind to continue the race are those in whom the power of self-preservation is the greatest—are the select of their generation.</p>
<p>This new ideological step towards barbarism was a response to a new sharpening of class tensions. Spencer wrote following the storms of working class Chartism, the European revolutions of 1848 and the publication of the Communist Manifesto, and in the midst of Britain’s “imperial century,” founded on the brutal subjugation and exploitation of India, China and other colonies. Faced with a strengthening working class and the emergence of the socialist movement, Spencer was driven to write a full-blooded defence, again citing a supposed natural law, of inequality, oppression, and imperialist violence.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer</p>
<p>In his book Social Statistics, he attacked socialism’s “erroneous … assertions of a man’s right to a maintenance and of his right to have his work provided for him.” The prominent contemporary economist and Spencer disciple Alfred Marshall, wrote in the same spirit that social welfare might lead to “Some partial arrest of that selective influence of struggle and competition … to which more than any other single cause, the progress of the human race is due.”</p>
<p>The ruling class showered Spencer with praise; he sold over a million copies of his works in his own lifetime. Social Darwinism “proved” to the elite its belief that not only was the working class undeserving of support, but that its suffering and premature death was of active benefit to “society” and “the human race”—by which they understood their own bank accounts. A sickening passage in Social Statistics reads:</p>
<p>Meanwhile the well-being of existing humanity, and the unfolding of it into this ultimate perfection, are both secured by that same beneficent, though severe discipline, to which the animate creation at large is subject. … The poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong, which leave so many “in shallows and in miseries,” are the decrees of a large, far-seeing benevolence. It seems hard that an unskilfulness which with all his efforts he cannot overcome, should entail hunger upon the artisan. It seems hard that a labourer incapacitated by sickness from competing with his stronger fellows, should have to bear the resulting privations. It seems hard that widows and orphans should be left to struggle for life or death. Nevertheless, when regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence—the same beneficence which brings to early graves the children of diseased parents, and singles out the low-spirited, the intemperate, and the debilitated as the victims of an epidemic.</p>
<p>In the context of the worsening inter-imperialist tensions, economic turmoil and class struggles of the late 19th and early 20th century, social Darwinism spawned the eugenicist movement, whose founder, Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911), promised, “What nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly, man may do providently, quickly, and kindly.”</p>
<p>Sir Francis Galton</p>
<p>Eugenics offered the ruling class another pseudo-scientific “explanation” for the poverty of the working class and of other “races,” deemed inherently mentally inferior. The most oppressed layers, considered a burden on the capitalist class and its imperialist ambitions, could be written off and disposed of as an “unfit” underclass.</p>
<p>Like its ideological forerunners, the eugenicist movement found a wide and ready audience in the middle and upper classes hostile to revolutionary socialism—from the nominally “left” reformist Fabian Society to the conservative aristocrat Winston Churchill (who Johnson constantly seeks to ape.)</p>
<p>Under the influence of these ideas, the Mental Deficiency Act 1913 led to the segregation of up to 65,000 “feeble minded” or “morally defective” people in internal colonies in the UK. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, a Joint Committee on Mental Deficiency reported that there were some 300,000 “mental defectives” in the country and defined the poorest 10 percent of the population as a “social problem group.” In 1934, the Departmental Committee on Sterilisation recommended legislation to ensure the “voluntary” sterilisation of “mentally defective women.”</p>
<p>Eugenics, like Malthusianism and social Darwinism, was a world movement, justifying tens of thousands of forced sterilisations in the United States and Scandinavia. It reached its fullest and most appalling expression in Nazi Germany, whose concept of “the life unworthy of life” saw the forced sterilisation of 400,000 and murder of 300,000 people considered mentally or physically disabled, and later the mass extermination of Jews, Slavs and Romani people.</p>
<p>In citing Malthus in his article, Johnson is aligning himself with this entire blood-soaked ideological heritage.</p>
<p>The ruling class and the pandemic</p>
<p>The revival by the ruling class of the fascist traditions of its recent past has been carefully analysed by the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) and the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) for the last six years. In 2014, the German section of the ICFI took up a fight against the relativization of the crimes of the Third Reich being carried out by sections of academia.</p>
<p>In the course of this work, which began in a struggle against the reactionary teachings of Humboldt University Professors Jörg Baberowski and Herfried Münkler, the ICFI uncovered a broader conspiracy in the ruling elite. Baberowski’s pronouncements in leading German newspapers that “Hitler was not vicious” were a preparation for the revival of German militarism now being orchestrated in the Bundestag and for the welcoming of the fascistic Alternative for Germany (AfD) and its policies into the heart of government, to facilitate the suppression of left-wing opposition.</p>
<p>The struggle against the rehabilitation of fascism has become a major question on dozens of German university campuses, and massive anti-fascist demonstrations have been held in several cities. The German section of the ICFI has been placed on the extremist watch-list of the German state security services, on behalf of the AfD.</p>
<p>Drawing the lessons from these events, and following the exposure of a eugenics conference (the London Conference on Intelligence) at University College London in January 2018, involving multiple UK academics, the British section of the ICFI began a far-sighted fight against the revival of social Darwinist and eugenicist ideology, especially in connection with former Oxford researcher Noah Carl .</p>
<p>The WSWS and the Socialist Equality Party explained in a series of articles and two public meetings that the recrudescence of these ideas was bound up with an international campaign of right-wing revanchism on university campuses, in response to widening social inequality, a ratcheting up of inter-imperialist tensions and a global resurgence of class struggle. “The return of eugenics and social Darwinism,” we wrote, “is the product of immense shifts in social forces and powerful ruling-class interests, which demand an ever-more right-wing intellectual climate.”</p>
<p>In February this year, the WSWS noted that modern-day “eugenicists have found an ally in Johnson’s viciously elitist, anti-migrant Tory government.”</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a news conference giving the government&rsquo;s response to the new COVID-19</p>
<p>Johnson told the Centre for Policy Studies in 2013, “Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 percent of our species have an IQ below 85.” The same year, as the Mayor of London who rubbed shoulders with billionaires on a regular basis, Johnson wrote an article for the Telegraph arguing that the “super-rich” belong to “three fairly exclusive categories of human being.” They “tend to be well above average” in “mathematical, scientific or at least logical reasoning.”</p>
<p>Speaking at the Centre for Social Justice in 2016, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of the onslaught on welfare provision and an advocate for lifting the retirement age to 75, said social security “entrapped individuals &hellip; and created a growing underclass.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s key adviser, Dominic Cummings, produced a paper for Education Secretary Michael Gove arguing that since intelligence was mostly genetic, funding a well-rounded education for working class children was pointless. Cummings was responsible for hiring the self-avowed eugenicist Andrew Sabisky as a special adviser to the government in February. Sabisky was a participant, alongside white supremacists and fascists, in the London Conference on Intelligence. Several UK academics and the right-wing columnist Toby Young, who had been nominated to head the government’s student oversight body in January 2018, also attended the event.</p>
<p>Later that year, Tory Party Vice Chair for Youth Ben Bradley claimed in a blog post that Britain would soon be “drowning in a vast sea of unemployed wasters,” before telling poorer families, “Sorry but how many children you have is a choice; if you can’t afford them, stop having them! Vasectomies are free.”</p>
<p>The WSWS commented after Sabisky’s hiring that in every case this ideology “has come to prominence in the ruling class in response to a sharpening of the class struggle, under conditions of deep capitalist crisis. Its fundamental purpose is as an ideological weapon against Marxism and the socialist movement—insisting on a biological rather than social cause of inequality—and its consequences are the denigration, suppression and racial division of the working class. &hellip; This reactionary filth is the product of a deep-going rot in ruling class politics, which increasingly takes on a fascistic character.”</p>
<p>In the last three months, this process, which began deep in the bowels of bourgeois society, has erupted into a world issue confronting millions of people.</p>
<p>To the ruling class represented by Johnson, the pandemic is an inevitable and largely beneficial “Malthusian catastrophe”; a “check” on population which will filter out its “redundant” and “unfit” sections. The continued endangering of the working class and especially its lowest-paid sections and those with health complications, the turning of care homes into killing fields, and the failure to provide for the essential needs of the old and infirm while isolated at home are social crimes rooted in this abhorrent class ideology.</p>
<p>Its consequences have been most glaringly and horrifically exposed in the abandonment of the elderly. Last Friday, the Guardian revealed that the government had rejected a plan from Public Health England for a more secure public health lockdown of care homes, and for making the UK’s unused Nightingale hospitals available for the quarantining and care of their residents. Their proposal was submitted on April 28, when it was abundantly clear that the sector was being decimated by coronavirus.</p>
<p>The government shrugged its shoulders at the fate of over 400,000 old people because it considers them, in the language of the Third Reich, “empty eaters.” Early on in the crisis, Telegraph assistant editor and leading business and economics columnist Jeremy Warner wrote, “From an entirely disinterested economic perspective, the COVID-19 might even prove mildly beneficial in the long-term by disproportionately culling elderly dependents.”</p>
<p>All of this has been carried out unopposed by any section of the ruling elite, or its servants in the media, the trade unions and the Labour Party.</p>
<p>The same is underway internationally. In Germany, politicians and media figures, including representatives of the Left Party, championing a return to work, in alliance with neo-Nazi mobs, are spitting on the right to life. US President Donald Trump is carrying out a wholesale reopening of the economy and abandonment of public health measures in alliance with the Democratic Party. Sweden’s Social Democratic government and its de facto policy of herd immunity that resulted in one of the highest death rate per capita in the world has been cited repeatedly as the model to emulate.</p>
<p>Coronavirus has exposed a ruling class in a state of terminal decay, which has lost any right to rule and which responds to crises with murderous theories “unearthed from a medieval graveyard,” as Trotsky wrote of 1930s fascism. A rational and humane solution to this world catastrophe and its aftermath depends on the progressive force in society, the international working class, fulfilling its revolutionary mission and laying these retrograde social forces to rest in a conscious struggle for socialism.</p>
<p>Contribute to the fight for socialism in 2020 We need you to help the WSWS and ICFI make 2020 the year of international socialist revival. We must expand our work and our influence in the international working class. If you agree, donate today. Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="what-happened-to-frances-monarchy">&ldquo;What happened to France’s monarchy?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/royalcentral.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Default-icon.png?fit=750%2C750&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
In the latest instalment of our autumn series, looking at what led to the fall of various monarchies throughout history, Royal Central looks at the end of the monarchy in France.</p>
<p>The most well-known episode regarding the ending of France’s monarchy is the 1789 Revolution which led to the deaths of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie-Antoinette. But while this event did lead to the end of the absolute monarchy, it was only for a short time and the monarchy did not actually end for good until 1870.</p>
<p>The French Revolution</p>
<p>The first real attempt to end the monarchy in France happened in 1789, and it is probably the most well-known event that led to the end of the monarchy. The current King in 1789 was King Louis XVI who was married to the famous Queen Marie-Antoinette. King Louis XVI ascended the throne in 1774 and was a member of the House of Bourbons who had ruled over France since 1589. King Louis XVI’s reign was complicated from the beginning as he ascended the throne in the middle of a financial crisis that wouldn’t end during his reign and a rising anger in the French people. This led him to call the Estates-General in 1789, a sign that the monarchy was weakened as it was the first time the body was called since 1614. The Estates-General were split into three estates: the clergy, the nobility and the rest of France – the Third Estate. But the middle class created the National Assembly and were soon joined by the Third Estate. They took the Tennis Court Oath under which they agreed not to separate until they had given France a constitution. They were joined by the Clergy as well as 47 members of the nobility.</p>
<p>When Louis XVI fired Necker – the Finance Minister- a few days later after he published an inaccurate account of the government’s debts, a lot of Parisians thought the King did it to undermine the National Assembly which made them even angrier. On July 14th, insurgents stormed the Bastille fortress in order to take the weapons and ammunition. However, despite the storming of the Bastille being probably the most well-known episode of the French Revolution, it only lasted for a few hours, and the Revolution lasted until 1792. The Bastille episode did act as a symbol and example in other parts of France and civil authority rapidly deteriorated which caused a lot of members of the nobility to flee France as they were fearing for their security.</p>
<p>Other important episodes of the French Revolution are the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August 1789 (directly influenced by Thomas Jefferson) and the Women’s March on Versailles in October 1789 which led to the King and Queen leaving Versailles to live at the Tuileries Palace in Paris. Indeed, the people tried to kill Queen Marie-Antoinette as they felt she was living a lavish lifestyle that was provocative considering the financial crisis in France. They felt that if the royal couple lived in Paris inside of Versailles, it would be easier to make them accountable if they were living among the people in Paris.</p>
<p>Worried about his family safety and dismayed by the direction the Revolution was taking, King Louis XVI decided to flee with his family from Paris to the Austrian border in June 1791. However, he was recognised during the trip, in Varennes, and brought back to Paris. The Assembly suspended him, and the King and Queen were held under guards. His attempted flight did not go down well with the public and would ultimately lead to his death.</p>
<p>The Revolution’s goal was to abolish the absolute monarchy (called the Ancien Régime), but the Assembly was split on whether France should become a constitutional monarchy or a republic. Ultimately, they settled on a constitutional monarchy with the King only having a representative role. The writing of the First Constitution in 1791, and it stated that there would be one Assembly and that the King would only have a suspensive veto. However, a lot of people were still angry that the King had attempted to flee and raised the point that since he had been suspended from his powers after being arrested in Varennes. He was now deposed and shouldn’t be the King of the new constitutional monarchy. However, despite huge protests, the First Constitution was signed on 3 September 1791, and the National Assembly gave way to the new Legislative Assembly that would share power with the King.</p>
<p>While it seemed like this was the end of the troubles for King Louis XVI and the monarchy, things only got worse from there when foreign monarchies got involved at a time when the French people were trying to assert their sovereignty. It had already started in August 1791 when the King’s brother-in-law, Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, King Frederick William II of Prussia, and the King’s brother, Charles-Philippe, Comte d’Artois, issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, declaring their intention to bring the French king in the position “to consolidate the basis of a monarchical government” and that they were preparing their own troops for action.</p>
<p>In April 1792, the Legislative Assembly declared war on Austria over territories claims. However, the French army was completely disorganised due to the Revolution, and they lost. In July, the Duke of Brunswick and his troops took the fortresses of Longwy and Verdun and on July 25th, he issued a statement written by King Louis XVI’s cousin, the Prince de Condé saying that the Austrians and Prussians intended to restore the King to his full powers. This was the downfall of King Louis XVI, as on August 10th, an armed mob invaded the Tuileries Palace while the King and his family took shelter in the Legislative Assembly. King Louis XVI was arrested on August 13th, and France was declared a Republic on September 21st, 1792.</p>
<p>King Louis XVI was beheaded on January 21th, 1793 while Queen Marie-Antoinette was beheaded a few months later on October 16th, 1793. This was the true end of the absolute monarchy in France but not the end of the monarchy altogether as France would alternate between Empires, Monarchies, and Republics from 1792 to 1870.</p>
<p>The First French Republic and the First French Empire</p>
<p>France became a republic in September 1792 and remained one until 1804 – although the form of the government changed several times. In 1799, after a coup, the government became the Consulate with Napoleon Bonaparte – one of the co-conspirators- being the Consul (equivalent to the head of government). However, in 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte proclaimed himself Emperor of the French thus ending the First French Republic and starting the First French Empire. During his time as Emperor, Napoleon took part in many wars and was very successful which allowed him to solidify his grip over Europe. But he had a lot of enemies, and in 1813, Prussian and Austrian armies joined forces with the Russian army in the Sixth Coalition War against France and invaded the country in 1814 which forced Napoleon to abdicate. He was exiled to the Island of Elba.</p>
<p>The restoration of the Bourbon monarchy</p>
<p>After Napoleon’s abdication, the monarchy was restored with the Bourbons in power. King Louis XVI’s younger brother, Louis Stanislas was crowned as Louis XVIII in April 1814. However, Napoleon came back less than a year later in March 1815. He returned from exile and took back control of the throne. Under his control, France took part in the Seventh Coalition War, but they had few resources and Napoleon ultimately lost the Battle of Waterloo. He then tried to abdicate in favour of his son, but the Bourbon monarchy was restored instead. Napoleon was exiled again, and he would die in 1821. Since his rule only lasted 111 days, it is now known as The Hundred Days.</p>
<p>The next fifteen years were quiet in terms of regime change as King Louis XVIII ruled France until his death in 1824 and his younger brother succeeded him as King Charles X until 1830.</p>
<p>The 1830 July Revolution and the reign of the Orléans</p>
<p>In March 1830, King Charles X dissolved parliament after 221 members of the Chambers of Deputies passed a motion of no confidence, and he also delayed the elections for two months. In the meantime, the “221” were held as heroes by the liberals as the King had become really unpopular. The government was defeated in the next elections, and on April 30th, King Charles X dissolved the National Guard of Paris – a voluntary group of citizens – on the grounds that it had behaved in an inappropriate manner towards the King. On July 25th, the King signed the July Ordinances that suspended the liberty of the press, dissolved the newly elected Chamber of Deputies, and excluded the commercial middle-class from future elections. This would lead to the end of the Bourbon monarchy in just three days.</p>
<p>Indeed, from July 27th to July 29th, the French people started a revolution against the King and his government, and they won over most of the important institutions of Paris, capturing the Tuileries Palace, the Hotel de Ville, the Louvre and the Archbishop’s Palace among others.</p>
<p>On August 2nd, King Charles X and his son, Louis Antoine abdicated their rights for the throne and left for Great Britain. Charles X had hoped his grandson would takeover as Henry V, but the members of the former government decided otherwise. As a result, they chose to elect Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans as King. A fact that is not often well-known is that Charles X’s son only renounced his rights to the throne after a 20 minute argument with his father, and he is, thus, considered by the monarchists as King Louis XIX Antoine even though he only “ruled” for 20 minutes. Historians usually don’t count him as a King of France.</p>
<p>This decision made significant changes for the French monarchy. King Louis-Philippe I was chosen because he was more liberal and the regime officially changed to the July monarchy – still a constitutional monarchy but a more liberal one – and it officially ended the Bourbons monarchy as Charles X was the last Bourbon to rule over France. It also started a division between the Bourbons and the Orléans with the Bourbons supporters being called Legitimists and the Orléans supporters being called Orléanists. This division still exists today.</p>
<p>During his reign from 1830 to 1848, King Louis-Philippe I had the title of King of the French (as opposed to King of France) and was very liberal. However, he grew more and more conservative, and when a new revolution started because of a very tense economic and social climate in the country, he fled to Great-Britain. The Second French Republic was declared in February 1848, marking a new change of regime in France, the fifth one in less than 60 years.</p>
<p>The Second French Republic and the Second French Empire</p>
<p>The Second French Republic lasted from 1848 to 1852 with Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as President. Louis-Napoléon was the nephew of Napoléon I. He was the first French head of state to hold the title of president, the first elected by a direct popular vote. However, the Constitution stated that a President could not seek re-election after his four year term. Louis-Napoléon spent the first half of 1851 trying to convince the National Assembly to change the constitution, but when the Assembly voted against his suggestion, he organised a coup d’état in December 1851. A Parisian insurrection started, but the insurgents were quickly defeated. The Assembly was dissolved and a new Constitution was drafted.</p>
<p>Following a referendum, the new constitution was adopted in January 1852 with more legislative power to the President, and the President was now elected for ten years with no term limits. However, Louis-Napoléon followed his uncle Napoléon I’s footsteps as he quickly decided to become Emperor, and after another referendum, the Second French Empire was proclaimed in November 1852. Louis-Napoléon chose to be proclaimed Emperor on December 2th as it was a very symbolic date, one year after his coup and 48 years to the day after Napoléon I’s coronation. He became Napoléon III and ruled until 1870.</p>
<p>The real end of the monarchy and the start of France as a long-standing Republic</p>
<p>In September 1870, Napoléon III and his army were made prisoners during the Franco-Prussian war and Napoléon III had to surrender. When the news reached Paris, a group of Republican deputies gathered at the City Hall and proclaimed the return of the Republic and the creation of a Government of National Defence. It was the end of the Second French Empire and the start of a long-standing republic regime, marking the end of the monarchy in any of its forms in France. Napoléon III was, thus, the last French monarch ever.</p>
<p>France has been under the regime of the Fifth Republic since 1958. And while 1789 and the Revolution are the events that started it all, it took 81 years for the monarchy to completely disappear in France. However, there are still monarchists in the country today, most of them split between two pretenders. Indeed, there are several claimants to the throne of France, but the main two are the Bourbons and the Orléans. The current Bourbon pretender is Louis de Bourbon as Head of the House of Bourbon since 1989. The current Orléans pretender is Henri d’Orléans as the head of the House of Orléans; although his son and heir, Jean d’Orléans, Dauphin de France and Duc de Vendôme is quite well-known.

<h3 id="luxembourgs-history-revolution-in-luxembourg">&ldquo;Luxembourg&rsquo;s history: Revolution in Luxembourg&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.rtl.lu/rtl2008.lu/nt/p/2020/02/24/17/94c2d92dbd8a7d3b229427bfe658ef7e.jpeg" alt="img">
RTL Today contributor Thomas Tutton investigates the little-known events of the Revolutions of 1848 in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>The year 1848, sometimes known as the Springtime of the Peoples, has a special place in modern history.</p>
<p>A wave of revolutions spread across Europe, from France and Italy to the states of Germany and the Habsburg Empire in Austria and Hungary.</p>
<p>And in Luxembourg, a revolutionary movement would succeed in establishing a new Chamber of Deputies, which has survived to this day.</p>
<p>Government in Luxembourg before 1848</p>
<p>The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg’s independence, conferred in 1815, was confirmed in 1839 after the tumults of the Belgian Revolution.</p>
<p>It remained in a personal union with the King of the Netherlands, who was also Grand Duke of Luxembourg, but from 1840 to 1848 under William II Luxembourg set about creating its first modern administration.</p>

<p>In 1841, the popular William II (still commemorated today with a statue of him on horseback on Place Guillaume II) introduced the first ever constitution in Luxembourg, known as the Charter of the Estates.</p>
<p>The constitution left sovereignty entirely in the hands of the Grand Duke, while the new Assembly of the Estates was virtually powerless and elected only by men over the age of 25 who paid 10 florins a year for the privilege, restricting the franchise to only around 3% of the population.</p>
<p>This left the (small) bourgeoisie, the peasants, the artisans and the nascent working classes entirely outside the administration of the new state, and there was no freedom of the press or of association.</p>
<p>Economic Problems</p>
<p>In 1842, Luxembourg entered the Prussian-led Zollverein customs union, alleviating some of the worst economic problems that had plagued the Grand Duchy since its inception, but as industrialisation had not yet set in, the economy remained primarily agricultural, and the Zollverein was not popular with the people.</p>
<p>Overpopulation and bad harvests led to occasional famines in the Luxembourgish countryside, such as in 1839-40 and 1842-3.</p>
<p>Between 1841 and 1846, the great potato blight which resulted in a famine in Ireland caused the price of potatoes to triple in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>And the Grand Duchy would also be affected by the European-wide economic crisis of 1845-47.</p>
<p>A general downturn put many of the country’s artisans and workers out of work, while punitive legislation such as an 1845 ban on using straw roofs for houses hit the poor particularly hard.</p>
<p>Beset by economic problems and receiving no help from an elitist government, the Luxembourgish population was ready to revolt.</p>
<p>1848: European Crisis</p>
<p>Across the continent, similar social, economic and political problems caused discontent to rise among the European population.</p>
<p>The first revolutionary event of the year actually took place in Sicily, but the real trigger was the February Revolution in Paris which overthrew King Louis-Philippe.</p>
<p>The fall of King Louis-Philippe in France led to a wave of revolutions in 1848. / © Public domain</p>
<p>As news of the French success spread, barricades then went up in most of the cities of Central Europe, while uprisings in Italy and Hungary led to the outbreak of nationalist wars against the Austrian Habsburgs.</p>
<p>In Germany, the Frankfurt Parliament was set up with the intention of creating a unified German state, while dukes, princes and kings granted their citizens constitutions out of fear of socialist revolutions.</p>
<p>One such panicky monarch was Grand Duke William II.</p>
<p>Revolution in Luxembourg</p>
<p>When news of the February Revolution reached Luxembourg, it served as the trigger for popular unrest.</p>
<p>Petitions, an ancient form of protest which had been banned under the Grand Duchy, soon began to flood the government in Luxembourg from across the country.</p>
<p>Then, in Ettelbruck, a protest movement broke out in early March, during which cries of ‘Vive la Republique’ and ‘Merde pour les Prussiens’ were heard, while the Marseillaise was apparently also sung.</p>

<p>The house of the mayor of Luxembourg, Fernand Pescatore, was attacked on March 16th, and various other disturbances occurred in towns across the Grand Duchy, including in Wiltz, Esch-sur-Sûre, Mersch and Echternach.</p>
<p>Fearing the worst, and perhaps influenced by his father’s counter-productive reaction to the Belgian Revolution, Grand Duke William II conceded to the protesters on March 20th, and a new Constituent Assembly was charged with creating a better constitution for the Grand Duchy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, liberty of the press was granted, with the Luxembourger Wort being formed on March 23rd, 1848.</p>
<p>Results of 1848</p>
<p>The Constituent Assembly met in Ettelbruck on April 25th; by the end of June, they had written a new Constitution that was accepted by the Grand Duke in July and came into force on August 1st.</p>
<p>So was this a revolution?</p>
<p>In the social sense, maybe not, as government troops were able to quell the protests without a single death.</p>
<p>But politically, a revolution had indeed taken place.</p>
<p>Luxembourg in effect become a constitutional monarchy overnight.</p>
<p>The Constitution of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, 1848. / © Public domain</p>
<p>The new constitution, modelled on the Belgian Constitution of 1830, set far greater limits on the power of the Grand Duke, created a new unicameral Chamber of Deputies with legislative sovereignty and the power to vote on budgets, and set up an independent judiciary.</p>
<p>This was a strongly liberal and progressive constitution for the time, even if the franchise was barely extended, with only 5% of the electorate eligible to vote.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Luxembourgish government had thus been set.</p>
<p>But, as we will see next week, the death of William II led to a renewed constitutional crisis in the Grand Duchy, as his successor William III took the new Chamber of Deputies head on.

​Jean d&rsquo;Orleans says he has the answers to France&rsquo;s problems - but, with three pretenders to the throne, is the nation ready for a return to the monarchy?</p>
<p>The man who would be king of France, Prince Jean d&rsquo;Orléans, Count of Paris and heir to the Bourbon dynasty, lives in a chateau in Dreux, an hour from Paris.</p>
<p>A pretty town with a maze of twisting, narrow streets and squares, and a population of 31,000 (it is twinned with Evesham), Dreux has been a seat of the Orléans family since the 12th century. The first count of Dreux was Robert, the son of Louis VI, known as &lsquo;Louis the Fat&rsquo;, described in his genealogy as &lsquo;a great fighter, a great hunter, and a great eater&rsquo;, who by the age of 46 was too large to mount a horse.</p>
<p>Nothing remains of the original castle. Prince Jean and his family live in a handsome 19th-century turreted chateau - modest as chateaux go - high on a hill overlooking the town. The Prince&rsquo;s domain.</p>
<p>Its most remarkable feature, a short walk from the house - almost in the back garden - is the chapelle royale, a mausoleum in the Gothic Revival style. Nine generations of the Orléans family are buried in the chapel, most notably Louis-Philippe I, the last Bourbon king of France.

The Revolution began in 1789. Though most of the working classes were poor and hungry, the aristocracy remained rich and well-fed in their palaces. These were the hallmarks of a feudal system that meant little had changed since the Middle Ages. The King wielded absolute power, having stripped political roles from the nobility, and the majority of French citizens had little hope of change.</p>

<p>The Revolution began in 1789. Though most of the working classes were poor and hungry, the aristocracy remained rich and well-fed in their palaces. These were the hallmarks of a feudal system that meant little had changed since the Middle Ages. The King wielded absolute power, having stripped political roles from the nobility, and the majority of French citizens had little hope of change.</p>
<p>The country had been bankrupted by war and the bourgeoisie (the upper and middle-classes) had limited political power. Educated citizens, influenced by the writers of the Enlightenment, became jaded with the absolutist regime that had been in place for centuries. They decided it was time for change. Different factions rose up within the various revolutionary governments, all with their own approaches and definitions of revolution.</p>
<p>The mob’s storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 signalled that a revolution had begun. Though mainly a symbolic attack – there were only a handful of prisoners in the Parisian fortress-prison – it was seen as an assault on royal authority. The King and his family were soon imprisoned, with a deadly fate awaiting them and many others across France.</p>
<p>This time of nationwide change brought into the public eye some colourful characters – many of whom lost their heads. We bring you the stories of some of the pivotal people who defined the Revolution.</p>
<p>1 Louis XVI, 23 August 1754 – 21 January 1793</p>
<p>As the figurehead of the despised Ancien Régime, King Louis XVI was blamed for the suffering felt by the people of France. The chasm between the monarchy and the working classes was vast. What’s more, support for the colonists in the American War of Independence, as well as France’s participation in a number of other costly wars, had seen the country sink deep into debt. But while his people struggled in poverty without enough food to eat, Louis XVI wielded absolute power from his opulent palace at Versailles. The decadence and indifference of the royal family would eventually become too much for the citizens of France to bear.</p>
<p>In an attempt to fix the financial crisis, Louis reluctantly agreed to summon the Estates-General – a form of parliament with representatives from the three estates, the clergy, the nobility and the commons – for the first time in 175 years.</p>
<p>They met in May 1789 and began arguing immediately. By 17 June, the frustrated Third Estate, representing the majority of the population, had had enough. Even though it had the most members, the Third Estate wasn’t permitted a vote for every man present, neutering its ability to bring about reform. So it renamed itself as the National Assembly, a body that would represent the people and not the estates themselves. Over the next few days, members of the clergy and nobility joined them and, on 27 June, the King surrendered power to the Assembly.</p>
<p>The royal family were moved from their comfortable surroundings in Versailles to virtual imprisonment at Tuileries Palace in Paris. In June 1791, they made a desperate attempt to escape Paris and launch a counter-revolution, but only made it as far as Varennes – 150 miles away – before being arrested and returned to Tuileries.</p>
<p>On 21 September 1792, the French monarchy was officially abolished, and the First French Republic established.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the end of Louis’ troubles however – the National Convention (a successor of the Assembly) found him guilty of treason on 15 January 1793, sending him to the guillotine. He was executed a few days later, to the rejoicing of jubilant crowds.</p>
<p>2 Marie Antoinette, 2 November 1775 – 16 October 1793</p>
<p>One of the most enduring images associated with the French Revolution is of Marie Antoinette facing her impending death, with disdain for the starving citizens of France. It’s a persisting myth that she said “Let them eat cake” – this quote was attributed to her 50 years after her death. However, her unpopularity in France was no tall tale. An Austrian princess, Marie Antoinette married the future Louis XVI when she was just 14 years old. Their union was intended to cement an alliance between Austria and France, which had been at war for many years.</p>
<p>Although initially charmed by this young princess, popular opinion soon turned sour and she became despised by the ordinary working-class French for her lavish spending and extravagance. She even commissioned a model village to be constructed at Versailles as her own personal retreat, which was widely seen as a mockery of peasant life. Rumours circulated that she was having a number of affairs and she began to embody everything that the revolutionaries hated about the Ancien Régime.</p>
<p>After the royal family’s failed attempt to flee Paris in June 1791, Antoinette spent the remaining months of her life in various prisons, and France’s declaration of war with Austria in April 1792 did nothing to help her situation. Her last prison, the Conciergerie, was infested with rats, and foul water ran through it from the nearby River Seine.</p>
<p>The execution of Louis XVI saw the Queen’s two surviving children separated from her, including eight-year-old Louis-Charles who was later made to testify against his mother at her trial. Nine months later, Marie Antoinette was brought before a tribunal and found guilty of treason. She was guillotined on 16 October 1793. Her last words were an apology for standing on the foot of her executioner.</p>
<p>Marie Antoinette’s body was thrown into an unmarked grave – her remains, and those of her husband, were exhumed in 1815 and relocated to the Basilica of Saint-Denis.</p>
<p>From infamous to immortals London’s famous waxwork museum allows visitors to get up-close and personal with their favourite celebrities and figures from history, but it actually has quite a gruesome history itself. Marie Tussaud was a French artist who learnt how to create wax models in Paris, where she worked with Philippe Curtis – a modeller whose wax museums Tussaud inherited. Tussaud was imprisoned as a royalist after working as the art tutor for Louis XVI’s sister, Madame Élisabeth. During the Reign of Terror, she was released on the grisly condition that she create death masks of those who had recently been guillotined – including those of Louis XVI and Robespierre. Tussaud eventually left France, taking her waxwork collection to Britain and establishing her Baker Street exhibition in 1835. The ‘Chamber of Horrors’ room was created to house some of the relics she had brought back from revolutionary France.</p>
<p>3 Princess Lamballe, 8 September 1749 – 3 September 1792</p>
<p>Marie-Thérèse-Louise de Savoie-Carignan, Princess de Lamballe, was an intimate companion of Queen Marie Antoinette, and her salon became a popular meeting place for royalist sympathisers after the Revolution began.</p>
<p>After a mob attack on Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792 – where the royal family were being held – the Princess was taken to La Force prison. Between 2 and 4 September – a period later known as the September Massacres – prisoners were hauled in front of hastily-formed courts and sentenced to death. More than half of the 2,700 prisoners were killed, many by armed mobs, the Princess among them.</p>
<p>Refusing to swear an oath renouncing the monarchy on 3 September, Lamballe was delivered to a mob in the streets who awaited her. Various sensational and gruesome accounts of her death were circulated which included her being raped and mutilated. Most, however, agree that Lamballe’s head was severed and later processed through the streets, with the crowd intending to flaunt it before Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>4 Charlotte Corday, 27 July 1768 – 17 July 1793</p>
<p>Events like the French Revolution demonstrate the extreme measures people can take in the name of their cause – in the case of Charlotte Corday, it was murder for liberty. Jean-Paul Marat was a journalist and one of the leading supporters of the Montagnards – a radical group within the Jacobin faction of the National Assembly, which advocated violence to achieve equality. It was led by one of the most influential, and ruthless, figures of the French Revolution, Maximilien Robespierre.</p>
<p>In 1789, Marat began writing a newspaper – L’Ami du Peuple (Friend of the People) – which advocated the rights of the lower classes against the enemies of the people, namely the monarchy and the revolutionary governments that had sprung up.</p>
<p>The paper was accused of inciting violence and instigating the September Massacres and the Reign of Terror, a particularly dark period of the Revolution, which saw radicals take control of the revolutionary government and hundreds executed by the guillotine.</p>
<p>Charlotte Corday was a minor aristocrat from Caen and a sympathiser of the Girondins – a political group that advocated a less extreme revolution. She grew distressed at the direction in which the Revolution was going and reacted in desperation. On 13 July 1793, after giving assurances that she would betray the Girondins, Corday was invited to Marat’s Paris home. He was takinga medicinal bath at the time – due to a debilitating skin disorder – when Corday stabbed him in the chest. At her trial where she was sentenced to death, Corday explained her reasoning for killing Marat: “I knew that he, Marat, was perverting France. I have killed one man to save a hundred thousand.”</p>
<p>According to one local legend, a man slapped the cheek of Corday’s severed head, causing it to take on an indignant expression. This fuelled the idea that guillotine victims may retain consciousness for a short while.</p>
<p>5 Louis Philippe, Duke of Orléans, 13 April 1747 – 6 November 1793</p>
<p>A surprising supporter of the Revolution came in the form of the King’s cousin – the Duke of Orléans. One of the wealthiest men in France, he favoured a transformation</p>
<p>from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. A champion of the poor, he would often use his wealth to feed the needy and opened up his residence, the Palais-Royal, to the public. Next in line to the throne after the immediate royal family, the Duke had a frosty relationship with his cousin and was openly hostile to Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>In 1787, after challenging the King’s authority in front of the Parlement of Paris (one of the high courts of justice of the Ancien Régime), the Duke was temporarily exiled to his estates. He became a hero for many revolutionaries – especially those involved in the storming of the Bastille – and was elected to represent the nobles in the Estates- General, later joining the National Assembly.</p>
<p>After the fall of the monarchy, the Duke gave up his royal titles and was given the name Philippe Égalité (equality) by the Paris Commune – the government of Paris between 1792 and 1795. After learning that his cousin had called for his execution, the King said: “It really pains me to see that Monsieur d’Orléans, my kinsman, voted for my death.”</p>
<p>It would be the former Duke’s son, Louis Philippe, who would be his father’s downfall. In 1793, after several years serving in the French military, Louis Philippe defected to the Austrians, along with French general Charles-François du Périer Dumouriez. This caused outrage in Paris, and even though there was no evidence suggesting his father had committed any crime, his son’s actions were enough to condemn him. On 6 November 1793, Philippe Égalité was found guilty by the Revolutionary Tribunal and guillotined the same day.</p>
<p>6 Georges Danton, 26 October 1759 – 5 April 1794</p>
<p>Originally trained as a lawyer, Georges Danton was inspired to help the revolutionary cause, joining the civic guard (garde bourgeoise) in 1789. In 1790, along with some militant revolutionaries he founded the Cordeliers Club – created to prevent the abuse of power and violations against the rights of man. A brilliant public speaker, Danton quickly gained fans amongst the Jacobin faction and managed to secure a post in.the Paris Commune.</p>
<p>On 10 August 1792, Tuileries Palace was stormed by the National Guard of the Paris Commune – it’s unclear whether Danton actually took part in this overthrow of the monarchy, but he is credited with its success and was swiftly made Minister of Justice. By September, he had been elected into the National Convention. It’s believed that Danton had wanted to spare the King from execution but eventually voted for his death.</p>
<p>In April 1793, Danton became the Committee of Public Safety’s first president. Attempts were made to negotiate a peace with Austria, but when these failed Danton was left out of the next committee elections. As the revolution took a darker turn, Danton began to call for a more moderate approach. His continual challenges to Robespierre’s violent overtures led to his arrest on 30 March 1794, and he was beheaded a few days later.</p>
<p>7 Maximilien Robespierre, 6 May 1758 – 28 July 1794</p>
<p>One of the most influential figures during the Revolution, Robespierre was originally a lawyer who was elected into the Estates-General and then served as part of the National Constituent Assembly, which had been formed from the National Assembly in 1789. He became popular with the people for his virulent attacks on the monarchy and calls for democratic reform.</p>
<p>In 1790, Robespierre became the president of the radical Jacobin Club and then first deputy for Paris to the National Convention. The Convention abolished the monarchy, declared France a republic, and charged Louis XVI with treason.</p>
<p>A power struggle ensued between the Jacobins and the more moderate Girondins. The Jacobins used their influence with the mob to seize control, and leaders of the Girondins were rounded up. The Committee of Public Safety took control of France, with Robespierre becoming its leading force.</p>
<p>The Reign of Terror was now underway. Anyone considered an enemy of the Revolution was guillotined, including Robespierre’s former friend Georges Danton. Some 17,000 people were officially executed during the 11 months of the Terror, as Robespierre attempted to consolidate his power.</p>
<p>This dangerous time is often remembered as Robespierre’s defining act during the Revolution – but he would soon encounter a fall from grace. Robespierre’s autocratic rule soon saw his popularity diminish – he had even tried to establish a new national religion known as the Cult of the Supreme Being. A plan was hatched by the Convention to overthrow him. On 27 July 1794, after some resistance, Robespierre was arrested after being denounced as a tyrant in a counter-revolution that became known as the Thermidorian Reaction. During the scuffle he was shot in the jaw – it’s unclear whether Robespierre shot himself or was shot by one of his captors.</p>
<p>The next day, Robespierre and 21 of his supporters were sent to the guillotine. The executioner tore off the bandage covering his jaw, causing him to cry out in agony before the falling blade silenced him forever. According to witnesses, the crowd cheered for 15 minutes at his demise.</p>
<p>What happened next? Robespierre’s death ushered in a period known as the White Terror, during which the familiesof those killed during the Reign of Terror enacted their revenge. It was followed, in October 1795, by a royalist revolt against the National Convention – quashed by a young general called Napoleon Bonaparte. The Convention was disbanded in November 1795. In its place came the French Directory, a body that hope to reverse the quasidictatorship that had ruled France during the Terror. The number of executions began to fall and measures against royalists and the clergy were relaxed, but even so the Directory was full of corruption. In November 1799, Napoleon led a coup against the Directory, establishing himself as First Consul. This ended the revolution butwould begin the Napoleonic era, throughout which he attempted to conquer most of Europe. The monarchy was restored in 1814 after Napoleon’s defeat, with Louis XVI’s brothers, Louis XVIII and Charles X, ruling as constitutional monarchs. The July Revolution of 1830 saw Charles X forced to abdicate in favour of his cousin Louis Philippe I – son of the executed Duke of Orleans. Rebellions in 1832 against this ‘July Monarchy’ serve as the setting for Victor Hugo’s classic novel Les Misérables. Revolution revisited France again in 1848, when the wellspring of political upheaval washed over Western Europe. This time, the monarchy was abolished for good.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-exposes-the-true-cost-of-republicans-acquiescence-to-donald-trump">&ldquo;Coronavirus exposes the true cost of Republicans’ acquiescence to Donald Trump&rdquo;</h3>

But will they stick by him as he continues to blunder amid the novel coronavirus crisis, with its seismic health and economic effects?</p>
<p>The story of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte’s seizure of power in France in the mid-19th century illuminates this dynamic and reveals the dangerous consequences when executive power goes unchecked. The French Legislative Assembly’s failure to control a wayward executive who increasingly ignored the legal constraints on his power led to a dictatorship that governed France for nearly 20 years. While France enjoyed economic prosperity (albeit facilitated by graft and corruption) during the early years of Bonaparte’s reign, constitutional parliamentary life ceased to exist. But Trump may want to reflect on Bonaparte’s eventual fate: When confronting a national crisis — the Franco-Prussian War — his base and legislative allies abandoned him.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>During the 18th and 19th centuries, France had vacillated between authoritarianism and republican rule. The French Revolution of 1789 brought down France’s absolutist monarchy in favor of constitutional government. The subsequent Reign of Terror, however, led many to fear democratic impulses, paving the way for the rise of the authoritarian and imperialist Napoleon Bonaparte in 1799. His disastrous invasion of Russia led to the restoration of a monarchy with constitutional constraints. While a more moderate monarchy replaced the Bourbons in 1830, it, too, became increasingly rigid, leading to another revolution in February 1848. The creation of France’s Second Republic set the stage for the rise of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who would take on the name Napoleon III.</p>
<p>Bonaparte, the nephew of the more famous Napoleon I, is an enigma to historians, as he was to those who knew him. He grew up in exile in Germany after the overthrow of his uncle but he returned to France after the 1848 revolution to participate in the elections of the newly established Second Republic. He campaigned as a populist, even writing a pamphlet about “The Extinction of Pauperism” designed to appeal to France’s poor. Presidential elections took place in December, months after the working-class riots that had terrified France’s elite and middle classes. With a familiar, famous name and a message that stirred the peasants of France, Bonaparte won the election with nearly 75 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>During the campaign, Bonaparte, like Trump, stressed his status as a political outsider and his lack of ties to political elites. However, as president, he had to work with the conservative monarchist members of the aptly named Party of Order, representatives of France’s landowning, professional and business elite who still dominated the Legislative Assembly. Like the establishment Republicans of our own era, these deputies had not wished to see Bonaparte elected president, but they were willing to work with him as long as he served their purposes.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>At first, Bonaparte acceded to the wishes of the conservative majority, for example, sending troops to support the pope against revolutionaries in Rome in 1849 and approving a law that gave the Catholic Church an enhanced role in education. In exchange, he hoped they would accede to his chief desire: a revision of the constitution so that he could serve a second four-year term as president.</p>
<p>When that didn’t work, Bonaparte shifted to demagoguery. He drummed up his lower-class political base with political speeches in which he asserted that he alone could guarantee the tranquility and the prosperity that France required. At the same time, he unceremoniously fired Party of Order members who resisted him from his cabinet and other positions in government. According to Karl Marx’s perceptive analysis of Bonaparte, “No one has ever sacked lackeys with less ceremony than Bonaparte his ministers.” Now unrestrained, Bonaparte placed his own men in key positions in the government throughout France and the military, and launched his coup d’etat on Dec. 2, 1851, the anniversary of his uncle’s spectacular military victory at Austerlitz in 1805. While the military had long stayed out of politics, it was drawn in by the man whose name suggested that he would return France to its previous glory.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Bonaparte ruled as a dictator, officially becoming Napoleon III, emperor of France’s newly christened Second Empire. A growing French economy made it easier to shut down the democratic institutions of government that the Second Republic had established in 1848. Members of the French elite acquiesced, even though they found their new leader unappealing, a man whose “taste for vulgar enjoyments and comforts increased with the opportunities given by power,” according to Alexis de Tocqueville. But they were willing to sacrifice their political power to a leader who would protect their economic interests. Those same economic improvements meant that Bonaparte kept the support of many of the peasants and workers he courted.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>However, the economic downturn of the 1860s would lay bare the regime’s authoritarianism, while Napoleon’s unsuccessful foreign adventures, most notably in Mexico where his efforts to impose a Catholic Empire under the Habsburg Emperor Maximilian would end in abject failure and Maximilian’s execution, exposed its incompetence.</p>
<p>These same dynamics are on display in the GOP in 2020. Time and again, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and others have breezily ceded their legislative authority and oversight responsibility in exchange for conservative judges, chummy Fox News appearances and generous tax cuts for their wealthy backers. While Trump rails against the establishment at rallies and claims to advance the interests of the disgruntled working class, his tax and anti-regulatory policies have protected the wealthy, encouraging even more Republicans to support him. However, the fast progression of covid-19 and the subsequent economic downturn may put the Trump presidency to a test that it seems ill-equipped to meet. While GOP senators look the other way while Trump challenges the norms of our democracy, they may be less willing to do so if their constituents turn on an administration that is incapable of keeping them safe.</p>
<p>Too many members of the Party of Order were willing to overlook the authoritarianism of the Second Empire as long as their interests were protected; the same was true of the popular classes who provided Napoleon III’s base of support. Yet when faced with military disaster in 1870, the regime’s support vanished, and the Second Empire collapsed.</p>

<h3 id="why-has-the-british-monarchy-survived">&ldquo;Why has the British monarchy survived?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/7/2006/05/GettyImages-3247832-64417e4.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413" alt="img">
The durability of the English monarchy is one of its most widely remarked characteristics. Of all the great imperial monarchies of pre-1914 Europe, the British alone survives. The history of the British monarchy has not been without vicissitudes. It was temporarily displaced in the general crisis of the mid-17th century. In the present Queen’s reign criticism has been voiced of the junior members of the royal family. Not since the 1688 Revolution, however, has a serious challenge been mounted either to the person of the king or the institution. Never in modern England has there been a mighty Revolution like France’s after 1789. The monarchy remains part and parcel of British political life.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Many reasons have been advanced for its durability. Victoria’s long reign did much to strengthen the identification of the monarchy with the aspirations of the people. Before that, the embourgeoisement of royal life under George III did much to recommend the institution to the new middle class created by the Industrial Revolution. The monarchy, over the years, has shown a remarkable ability to adapt and respond to the challenges of modern times. Yet in many ways its fortunes had been decided before the beginning of the modern period. Long before 1832 the monarchy had been reshaped as a constitutional one; and well before the 18th century its powers had been limited by law. In many ways, the key period for determining the future course of the British monarchy (as it was to become) was the late medieval. In the centuries from 1215 to 1500 the foundations were laid of a polity in which king, lords and commons all co-operated for the common good. The links which were forged then between “head” and “members” of the body politic contributed to political stability in the long term.</p>
<p>How did Magna Carta change the monarchy?</p>
<p>The event in the middle ages of the greatest significance for the monarchy’s fortunes was King John’s acceptance of Magna Carta in 1215. John’s submission to the barons signified the monarchy’s willingness to accept the restraint of law. Until John’s reign the authority of the crown had known few restraints beyond the merely practical. Angevin kingship, powerful and predatory, had been government by the king’s will. The king made and enforced the law, but could also, when it suited him, override it. Magna Carta changed that for ever. From now on, the king had to recognise the principles of good government laid down in the Charter. It is true that King John had little intention of abiding by the Charter for longer than was necessary to buy off the opposition. The circumstances of the minority of his son Henry III, however, were to make the Charter permanent. What the minority government under William Marshal did was take over the Charter, shorn of its most controversial clauses, and reissue it under the authority of the new king. In this way it became, as it is so often described, the first English statute.</p>
<p>Its effect was to place the monarchy under written law. As the legist known as Bracton was to say in the 1230s, the king is below God and below the law. Elsewhere in Europe, there was no precise equivalent to this relationship between king and legal structure. Kings might, and did, issue charters of liberties to their subjects. In most cases, however, these documents were regional and local in nature. In no polity was the king limited by law in his dealings with all of his subjects. It is especially noteworthy that there was no equivalent to Magna Carta in France. In the Capetian-ruled kingdom the king made the law and also stood above it. In England, by contrast, royal authority was embedded in the fabric of political society. The king’s subjects had the assurance of knowing that he was bound by the same rules as they themselves were. Regularity of legal procedure was assured.</p>
<p>For the king’s subjects, Magna Carta provided a touchstone of good government. By itself, however, the Charter did not bring about the growth of limited monarchy. The English monarchy was powerful, assertive and ambitious. In the late 13th century Edward I was to yield nothing to his contemporary, Philip IV of France, in the range, depth and intensity of his government. In Edward’s later years, after 1300, the signs were that it was the English monarchy which would develop the characteristics of autocracy. A hundred years later, however, the roles were reversed. It was the French monarchy which was dressed in the trappings of absolutism, while its English counterpart was acquiring the habit of negotiation with its subjects. What brought about the change was the different way in which war interacted with the two national polities.</p>
<p>The wars of the late middle ages, notably the conflict later to be known as the Hundred Years’ War, created unprecedented demands on both sides of the Channel for manpower and money. By the early 14th century it was no longer possible for a king like Edward I or Edward II to meet the cost of warfare solely from his ordinary revenues – feudal incidents, the profits of justice and the income from the royal lands. A system of public finance had to be developed. In both England and France the institutions of financial administration were already in existence. Both had a central treasury into which taxes could be paid and an exchequer which would ensure the accountability of officials, while locally there was a network of officials who could be relied on to collect and spend national resources. What was needed, to supplement these, was a body of ideas to justify the ruler making financial demands on his subjects.</p>

<p>What was the ‘community of the realm’?</p>
<p>In England such a body evolved in the late 13th and 14th centuries. In the concept of the “community of the realm” thinkers found a means of bringing together ruler and ruled in mutual obligation. The king had a duty to provide for the common profit, while his subjects were reciprocally obliged to assist him in that duty. In the event of a threat to the common profit – increasingly identified with war – the king, it was said, could demand the financial assistance of his subjects for which, since the danger touched the whole realm, the consent of a representative assembly was required. This assembly was to become “parliament”. The granting of taxation took place in the framework of the Roman law doctrine of necessity. This meant that once a necessity – a threat to the realm – had been recognised, complete refusal of taxation could not be admitted; bargaining could take place only about the size of the grant. Nonetheless, as the king’s demands grew in regularity and intensity, parliament and, more particularly, the lower house within it were able to use the power of the purse strings to strengthen their position. The crown might be the symbol of the realm, yet it was parliament which emerged as the institutional expression of the realm, adjudicating the ruler’s demands in the common good. Through the development in parallel of a doctrine of national representation, those elected to the lower house of parliament were given the power to speak for those they represented. Electors and elected were bound together.</p>
<p>In France the demands of war finance were no less regular or intense, and the ideas of the theorists no less developed, yet the institutional means for the securing of assent to public taxation were a good deal less sophisticated. There was no omnicompetent national assembly on the lines of the English parliament. The Estates General, a body which met only irregularly, might assent to a grant of taxation to the king; if that grant were to be made locally effective, however, the king would have to bargain with local assemblies in addition. Because the French state preserved within its shell the fabric of older regional identities, it was at the local level that the process of negotiation was most crucial. By the 15th century this ramshackle and inefficient structure was found to be incapable of responding to the needs of the moment. With the kingdom threatened with conquest by the English, Charles VII (1422–61) began collecting taxes without consent. Citing the common danger as his justification, he presented himself as the personification of French identity, claiming a loyalty which in the past had often been seen in regional terms. The estates and assemblies of the kingdom offered him no resistance. Jealous in defence of local liberties, they found it difficult, if not impossible, to co-operate to resist royal assertiveness. In the absence of any doctrine of public representation, moreover, they lacked the direct links with those they claimed to speak for which made the English parliamentary Commons so effective.</p>
<p>By the late 15th and 16th centuries the French king was, to all intents and purposes, ruling without popular consent. In the short term, it could be said that this made the monarchy stronger. In the longer run, however, it contributed to its weakness, and ultimately to its demise. In time of popular discontent, as in the late 18th century, there was no readily available mechanism by which the king’s subjects could seek redress. The only remedy was to remove the monarchy altogether.</p>
<p>10 pivotal monarchs in Britain’s history Stephen (1135–54) Stephen seized the crown on Henry I’s death in 1135, plunging the Anglo-Norman world into a 15-year civil war, “when the saints slept”. His rival was Henry’s daughter, Matilda, widow of the German Emperor. The settlement of the war was that Matilda’s son would become king – the future Henry II. So began the Angevin line. John (1199–1216) John’s ill repute has withstood all attempts at rehabilitation. He was slippery, cruel and capricious. By 1215 his rule had provoked a massive rebellion which led to the making of Magna Carta. By the time of his death the struggle between the two sides had been renewed. Only his death saved the country from prolonged civil war. What would have happened had he lived? Would he have become the first post-Conquest king to be deposed? Henry III (1216–72) The reign of John’s son, Henry III, culminated in crisis, upheaval and civil war. However, he was more sinned against than sinning; he was actually a well-meaning man, whose main fault was undue generosity to his friends. In Simon de Montfort he faced an implacable and self-righteous opponent. De Montfort was killed at Evesham in 1265, and the reign ended in peace. Henry VI (1422–61) Arguably England’s most disastrous monarch, he became king aged nine months and went from infancy to insanity without much in between. He was deposed in 1461 by the Yorkist Edward IV, who claimed a superior legitimacy. Challenges to kings in the Wars of the Roses took the form of challenges to their title, not challenges to the institution of the monarchy. Richard III (1483–5) A close rival to John for the accolade of England’s worst king. His defeat and death at Bosworth provided a fitting indictment of his rule. Richard’s seizure of the crown split the powerful Yorkist establishment. In this way, Henry Tudor was given enough of a power-base to pitch a bid for the crown himself. The absence of plausible alternative claimants after 1485 helped Henry to restore political stability. Charles I (1625–49) The Civil War was the monarchy’s gravest crisis since the Norman Conquest. The outcome was Charles’s execution and the abolition of the monarchy. He had been a poor king, but made a good martyr, with churches dedicated to him. Paradoxically the years of Interregnum which followed showed the popular appetite for monarchy. Cromwell was asked to assume the crown but declined. If he had accepted, England would probably have had two rival royal lines, as France was to have with the Bourbons and Bonapartes. Charles II (1660-85) The “merry monarch” has been fortunate in his reputation. In reality, he was duplicitous, with leanings towards French-style absolutism. His heir was his Catholic brother James, on whose succession he insisted. James was deposed after three years. The establishment of two co-rulers – James’s daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange – provided a veneer of dynastic legitimacy. George IV (1820–30) Extravagant and self-indulgent, George chalked up huge debts, then asked the taxpayer to pay them off. As Prince Regent, he was king-in-waiting for a decade. He spent most of his reign as a paranoid recluse. Conscious of his monstrous figure, he hid from public gaze in the lodges of Windsor Great Park. The monarchy, however, could survive his eccentricities – by George’s reign, the king was little more than a figurehead. Edward VIII (1936) The abdication crisis, the British monarchy’s greatest 20th-century crisis, actually raised a very old question: was the king to rule in accordance with his own will or, rather, on the advice of his ministers? Edward wanted to marry Mrs Simpson; his ministers, however, thought otherwise. In England the question of what the monarch should do had been settled years before: he had to follow the advice of his ministers. Edward, therefore, had to go. Elizabeth II (1952– ) The issues raised in the present reign are also, in a sense, very old ones. First, there is the obvious question of how the king-in-waiting is to be kept usefully employed; in the past, impatience has bred resentment and instability. Second, there is the problem of the antics of younger members of the royal family. Earlier monarchs kept siblings usefully employed in commanding armies or running the Empire – such options are no longer available. But the present Queen’s combination of experience, dignity and good sense has always saved the day.</p>
<p>Monarchies and the burden of taxation</p>
<p>The very different financial histories of the English and French monarchies have relevance to our theme in a different connection. In France the incidence of direct royal taxation was far narrower than it was in England. One of the most cherished privileges of the French nobility was exemption from taxation; the upper classes did not pay the taille (the land tax), the fouage (the hearth tax) or the gabelle (the salt tax). In consequence, the largest share of the burden of taxation fell on the poor. The origins of noble exemption were to be found in the medieval concept of the three estates: those who fought, the knights; those who prayed, the clergy; and those who worked, the commons. The knights – the nobility – maintained that since they were engaged in the task of fighting (that is, national defence), they should not also be asked to pay for the same. In the 13th and 14th centuries the monarchy was too dependent on noble support to resist; and so noble exemption was granted.</p>
<p>In England, by contrast, the nobility were always included in the tax net; it was a mark of the power of the English monarchy that it was able to make the incidence of taxation universal. The consequence of the French nobility’s exemption from taxation was that they lacked any interest in resisting royal demands, for they always knew that it was the lower orders who would pay. By the 16th century, French royal government was increasingly predatory in character, burdening the lower orders with ever heavier imposts. As a result, the lower orders became resentful, and French society was polarised between an impoverished majority and a privileged aristocracy bound in close alliance with the monarchy. At the same time, the monarchy found it increasingly difficult to meet its expenditure from taxation. The cost of war was rapidly increasing. Under Louis XIV the military budget rose from 54 million livres in 1687 to 103 million two years later and 138 million in 1692. When the wealthiest contributed little directly, and the poor were ground into poverty, there was no prospect of increasing income at anything like a corresponding rate. Thus the monarchy found itself heading for bankruptcy. It was financial ruin which precipitated the outbreak of revolution in 1789.</p>
<p>A side effect of the cession of fiscal relief to the French nobility was the need to establish just whom the nobility comprised. It was important that, if tax exemptions were to be granted, such exemptions be limited. Thus it came about that the nobility acquired the character of a legally defined caste. Aspirants to nobility had to show that they led a noble lifestyle, had noble kin, had borne arms in the royal army, and did not practise any trade or craft incompatible with nobility (dérogeance). Once these qualities were proved, they would be granted letters of ennoblement and they became members of an elite whose privileges were hereditary. This meant that if a man was of noble estate, all his sons would be noble too. In France nobility ran in the blood; France had a noblesse.</p>
<p>England’s enterprising nobility</p>
<p>In England the concept of nobility was very different, even if the lifestyle was similar. With no exemption from taxation, there was no need for nobility to be legally defined. Those with wealth could count on eventual elevation to the peerage; those who lacked it would remain excluded; their lot would be to compete for election to the lower parliamentary house. This difference in conceptions of nobility made for a much larger difference between the countries’ social structures. Society in early modern France was founded on rank and privilege to a greater extent than in England. In France rank was cherished; those with rank avoided doing anything which might bring about dérogeance. This had the effect of discouraging noble enterprise in commerce or industry.</p>
<p>In England, by contrast, the nobility and gentry were uninhibited by such restrictions. They showed themselves both able and willing to engage in enterprise. In the north Midlands in the 16th century both the Willoughbys and the Cavendishes were active in exploiting the coal seams on their estates. England’s more open and fluid social structure was thus a major factor in the creation of a cohesive and politically stable society. North of the Channel, birth and social standing raised no obstacle to entry into the highest ranks. The ablest could, and did, rise to the top. English society, moreover, was not only more open; it was also more integrated. In the community of the realm “head” and “members” were linked in a relationship of mutual dependence. The levying of taxation, rooted in common consent, recognised the obligations to each other of king and people. The creation of a broadly based, well integrated society in the late medieval period did much to give England its distinctive political character.</p>
<p>The test of a successful monarchy is whether it can survive the periodic reigns of inadequate or incompetent monarchs. England, or, later, Britain, has had its share of hopeless monarchs (though rather fewer than, say, Russia). Stephen, Henry VI, Charles I, George IV have all in their different ways posed problems. In the present Queen’s reign, the marital problems of junior royals have caused tensions. The House of Windsor has at times produced soap opera plots beyond the wildest imaginings of any TV producer. Yet the British monarchy still ranks as the most stable and successful in the world.</p>
<p>The present strength of the monarchy owes a great deal to the achievements of monarchs of the last century. King George VI successfully restored the prestige of the monarchy after the abdication crisis of 1936 while, more recently, Queen Elizabeth II has shown extraordinary sureness of touch in her long reign. However, the long-term reasons for the success of our monarchy go much further back. If Britain is the outstanding example of a successful constitutional monarchy today, it is in large measure because of social patterns that were established half a millennium ago.</p>
