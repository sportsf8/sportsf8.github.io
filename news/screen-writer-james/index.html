<p>The British playwright and screenwriter James Graham is using lockdown to work on a new musical with singer and songwriter Sir Elton John.</p>
<p>Mr Graham told Hardtalk&rsquo;s Stephen Sackur the musical was about US televangelists in Ronald Reagan&rsquo;s 1980s America and how they became some of the biggest ministries in the world.</p>
<p>But the coronavirus pandemic is making it harder to write: &ldquo;It is not easy. None of the great 20th Century musicals were written over Skype and Zoom,&rdquo; said Mr Graham.</p>
<p>He and Sir Elton are sharing ideas over Zoom. They hope to finish the musical in lockdown so it could be seen next year when theatres reopen.</p>

<h3 id="quiz-writer-james-graham-on-the-ingrams-guilt-or-innocence-i-kind-of-stopped-caring">&ldquo;Quiz writer James Graham on the Ingrams&rsquo; guilt or innocence: &lsquo;I kind of stopped caring&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&amp;c=sc&amp;poi=face&amp;w=2000&amp;h=1047&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2020%2F06%2F11%2FQUIZ_102_MF_0827_0814_RT.jpg" alt="img">
The three-part AMC miniseries tackles the true story of an English couple accused of cheating their way to the top prize on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</p>
<p>So, did they do it?</p>
<p>If you just finished AMC&rsquo;s Quiz, that&rsquo;s probably the question you&rsquo;re sitting with right now. The miniseries stars Fleabag&rsquo;s Sian Clifford and Succession&rsquo;s Matthew MacFadyen as Diana and Charles Ingram, a real-life couple who were accused of cheating their way to the top prize on the U.K. version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? back in 2001.</p>
<p>Directed by Stephen Frears (The Queen, Florence Foster Jenkins), Quiz was adapted by James Graham from his West End play of the same name. Over three episodes, the audience is split 50/50 on the Ingrams&rsquo; guilt. Could they really have been guided to the correct answers by a coughing crowd member? The show&rsquo;s host, British TV icon Chris Tarrant (played uncannily well by Michael Sheen), wasn&rsquo;t convinced of their guilt, so what hope do we, the TV audience, have of figuring it out? Then again, perhaps whether or not they cheated isn&rsquo;t really what&rsquo;s interesting here&hellip;</p>
<p>With that in mind, we spoke to Graham about adapting his play into a three-part miniseries, the challenges that presented, and his take on the guilty verdict.</p>
<p>ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What was it about this story that originally made you want to turn it into a play, and now a TV show?</p>
<p>JAMES GRAHAM: I loved the story when it first became news here 15, 20 years ago. I thought I knew it. I thought I&rsquo;d figured it out — it was so well covered, and their guilt seemed so certain. I put it to bed thinking that was it. Years later, in 2016, I was handed a book by a theater producer called Bad Show, by Bob Woffinden and James Plaskett. That had reopened the case for many people, in terms of bringing all this new information to light about all the inconsistencies. That brought the story to life. I found all that really exciting. It&rsquo;s exciting to take a story that — certainly here in the U.K. — people had already made their minds up about, and then to get to bring it to a new audience in the U.S., who I&rsquo;m guessing have never heard of these events.</p>
<p>Was it difficult to adapt it for screen, or was it just exciting to get to expand it in certain ways?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got to be honest, sometimes I find it really, really hard to adapt my writing to a different form, but for some reason this was just an absolute joy from start to finish. I think it&rsquo;s because TV is a narrative medium — that&rsquo;s its strength. The story — beat by beat, plot by plot — in this real-life tale has such momentum to it that I just really enjoyed writing it. The strength of television is that it can take you, the audience, into different worlds and it feels really enchanting. I was really excited to be able to, in particular, expand upon some characters who didn&rsquo;t get stage time in the play, and that&rsquo;s this group called the Syndicates. They&rsquo;re a completely real organization. I find them sort of strangely endearing. Their biggest crime, if there is a crime, is that they just really liked the show too much. They were just big fans of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? For me, the exciting thing about the television adaptation was to be able to visit that world, to go to those quaint English villages and the pub gardens and see these characters in their cardigans just loving the show and being part of this middle-class heist.</p>
<p>Did you learn anything new about the story or the case in the making of the series?</p>
<p>We learned loads between the play and shooting the television drama. It became really meta, strangely. The creator, Paul Smith [played by Mark Bonnar], called me. I&rsquo;ve got to hand it to him, he was very helpful in the show, which he didn&rsquo;t have to be because it&rsquo;s opening up a question that he considers to be completely closed. He believes they&rsquo;re guilty and there&rsquo;s no reason to delve back into the story, but he was so generous and willing to play along. In fact, he wanted to meet members of the Syndicate, 20 years later. As we were developing this TV drama, his intrigue was reawakened by the story. We&rsquo;d met people from the Syndicate because they&rsquo;d come to see the show in the West End, so we were able to connect to them. The real-life Paul discovered all of these amazing new facts about this organization that was attacking his show for a decade. So the scene in the third episode when we really shift the timeline on, that actually only happened last year as we were going into production. He discovered that this organization had got hundreds of people into the chair in the U.K. and had probably taken — as we reveal for the first time in this television drama — at least 10 percent of all the prize money given away by way of the show. He learned that before we started shooting and we thought, &ldquo;My God, we have to put this in a scene in the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow, that&rsquo;s so cool but also must&rsquo;ve been such a weird experience for him since they truly loved his show but were also undermining it.</p>
<p>Exactly. I think he&rsquo;s conflicted here. It&rsquo;s a testament to how captivating people found that game show for whatever reason, and credit both to Paul and Paddy Spooner — who was the head of the Syndicate — they had a really therapeutic and cathartic reconciliation. I always thought of it like that scene in Heat where Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino meet and give each other mutual respectful for all they achieved.</p>
<p>Were there any new moments or scenes that were challenging to figure out logistically?</p>
<p>The hardest thing, which I didn&rsquo;t have to deal with in the stage show because stage theaters are a less literal medium and you can be slightly more playful, was in the third episode when we finally get to be with the Ingrams on their own, in their house, after they&rsquo;ve been accused of the crime. I remember just pausing over my keyboard and realizing, I don&rsquo;t know what to do because they&rsquo;re on their own now, and surely if they cheated they&rsquo;d say they cheated, and if they didn&rsquo;t cheat they would say that as well. It&rsquo;s about suspending the possibility that both of those things are true for the audience. That took a long time to write, and I leaned into the idea that even if they were guilty, they could still feel outraged by the level of punishment, by the scrutiny, by the media, and the fact that they didn&rsquo;t really think it was cheating.</p>
<p>Yeah, seriously. Can you imagine what would happen today with social media the way it is?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. I hope that the drama is, to some extent, kind of a foreshadowing of all of the existential threats and the truth that we&rsquo;re facing today in terms of misinformation and how real-life offenses are perceived and framed by different platforms.</p>
<p>We have to talk about Michael Sheen as Chris Tarrant. He&rsquo;s so convincing. Were you excited we he took the role and then when you got to see him in action?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s one Britain&rsquo;s greatest actors, so you have a certain amount of trust that he can do it. But it was all trust because he was filming in New York in the lead-up to his first day, so we&rsquo;d never actually seen him do it. He&rsquo;d spoken to Stephen Frears, the director, about whether it was an impression or just capturing the essence of him. We were very confident, but the first scene we filmed with him was when he&rsquo;s appearing in court to testify and it was like life imitating art. That whole scene is about the court being slightly charmed and excited that this famous person is coming to visit today. Everyone was swooning over Chris Tarrant, and the exact same thing happened when Michael Sheen walked into the room. He had that star quality, and then he opened his mouth and I&rsquo;m thinking, &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re going to be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much humor inherent in this story, in the ridiculousness of being able to cough your way to £1 million, but it&rsquo;s also very serious in that the Ingrams are treated so harshly by the press and public. Was it difficult to strike that balance and not fall into mocking them?</p>
<p>We thought a lot about it in the script and kept dialing up and dialing down the humor because it is a naturally absurd story: It&rsquo;s crime committed by coughing. It is also a very painful human story for this particular family. Frankly, I think most audience members will probably come away thinking — even if they believe that they are guilty — that the proportionality of their punishment and what they suffered was not completely balanced. As we see Sian&rsquo;s character, Diana, say, they just liked a thing too much for a bit, and that&rsquo;s the biggest crime they commit. I really just trusted the actors to find that balance between pathos and farce and knew that Stephen Frears — who has chartered and chronicled so many important political moments but always with a twinkle in his eye — would get that tone right.</p>
<p>I imagine you won&rsquo;t want to comment on whether you think they&rsquo;re guilty or not, but did your mind change over the course of writing the play and then the TV series?</p>
<p>Yeah, you won&rsquo;t be surprised to know that I never say what I think, but I&rsquo;m happy to admit that absolutely my mind goes back and forth. In a way, when writing the script, what was helpful was having asked that question for over 15 years, I&rsquo;ve actually just stopped asking it because I realized that that wasn&rsquo;t really what interested me. It was the different points of view and then what it felt like to be on both sides of this argument, whether you&rsquo;re the producers or whether you&rsquo;re the Ingrams. In a way, and I mean this respectfully to everyone involved, I kind of stopped caring because it&rsquo;s just about telling the story.

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/15/obituaries/05Harvey1/05Harvey1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
James Harvey wasn’t a popular film critic with a cozy berth at a major publication, or an academic theorist presiding over a formidable film studies department. Yet his three books, each more than a decade in the making and meticulously yet gorgeously written, are required reading for cinephiles.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey died at 90 on May 15 at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. He had a rare blood disease, according to the author and essayist Phillip Lopate, one of Mr. Harvey’s many friends.</p>
<p>It was “Romantic Comedy in Hollywood: From Lubitsch to Sturges” (1987), Mr. Harvey’s first book, clocking in at more than 700 pages, that made his reputation. In this celebration and analysis of what he called “Hollywood’s essential genius,” the screwball comedy, he went deep: He took you scene by scene through, say, an Ernst Lubitsch movie, so you could experience the film, even if you had never seen it, or revel in it anew if you had.</p>
<p>Image Mr. Harvey’s first book, from 1987, made his reputation.</p>
<p>“Even if you thought you knew a film,” said Foster Hirsch, a film historian at Brooklyn College, “he taught you something more about it.” Mr. Hirsch, another friend of Mr. Harvey’s, often accompanied him to movies.

<h3 id="oxford-bloomsday-festival-marks-40th-celebration-of-james-joyce">&ldquo;Oxford Bloomsday festival marks 40th celebration of James Joyce&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.heraldseries.co.uk/resources/images/11483445/" alt="img">
LOVERS of Irish literature and music are being invited to join a celebration of the writer James Joyce.</p>
<p>The 40th annual Oxford Bloomsday, which takes place tomorrow, will feature songs, poetry and readings, and for the first time, will be online.</p>
<p>Bloomsday is celebrated all over the world on June 16 and commemorates the work of Joyce – one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.</p>
<p>June 16 is the day on which his 1922 novel Ulysses is set. The event is named after the book&rsquo;s main character Leopold Bloom.</p>

<p>The Bloomsday celebration was launched by Oxford musician Michael Henry, famed for his repertoire of Irish songs, and is usually held upstairs at Oxford’s Port Mahon pub.</p>
<p>Due to the lockdown it will be streamed in the form of a film with contributions recorded by writers Terry Eagleton, Tom Paulin, Iggy McGovern, Keith Hopper and Bernard O&rsquo;Donoghue, and by musicians Gerald Garcia, Pam Cooper, John Pethica, Teresa and Caitriona Moran, and Nick Hooper – who wrote the scores for two of the Harry Potter films.</p>
<p>Mr Henry, 80, was born in the West of Ireland and moved to Oxford in his early 20s. He said: &ldquo;The Joyce night has been celebrated in Oxford for 40 years. This wasn&rsquo;t the 40th anniversary we expected, but with it being shown on the internet we hope many people can enjoy what we have been enjoying doing for so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adrian O’Neill, Irish Ambassador to the UK, praised the event, saying: “I am delighted to extend my best wishes to Oxford’s Bloomsday celebration on this especially auspicious occasion, which marks the 40th anniversary of the event. It is also Oxford Bloomsday’s first celebration in this new, socially distant but virtually connected space. While different in character, I have no doubt it will be equally impactful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mick Henry deserves enormous credit for promoting a successful Bloomsday each year. To everyone partaking in this Joycean celebration, I wish you a happy Bloomsday. &lsquo;Beir bua agus beannacht&rsquo;.”</p>
<p>Poet Bernard O&rsquo;Donoghue said: “Apart from the Bloomsday events, Mick Henry has been the main organiser of Irish cultural events in Oxford for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>From 1986 to 1990, he organised a series of festivals called Oxford-Ireland from 1986, which brought a major galaxy of Irish stars to Oxford. We should acknowledge his importance to Irish cultural life in Oxford at this extraordinary juncture this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also performing is Mr Henry’s daughter, Anna Henry. She said: &ldquo;The Joyce night was started 40 years ago when my dad met Richard Ellman, Joyce&rsquo;s biographer. He read at the first-ever Oxford Bloomsday and every year Oxford has carried on the celebration of Joyce&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my dad&rsquo;s lack of IT skills, my siblings and I decided to take it forward in an online form, that we hope everyone enjoys, as it holds such great memories for us. We look forward to welcoming the people of Oxford and beyond tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oxford promoter Autumn Neagle, is helping to organise the evening. She said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been fantastic to help out with the event, even if it&rsquo;s just from my living room, as so many amazing events in Oxford have sadly been cancelled or put on hold during lockdown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone has really come together to make it happen, from Oxford and even over in Ireland. The performers jumped at the chance to contribute with readings or music, and it&rsquo;s been quite a family affair with Mick&rsquo;s sons and daughters getting behind it, working hard to get in touch with the artists and overcome these challenges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amazingly a family friend offered to edit the film together and screen it online, so the show will go on!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In such difficult times for all, it&rsquo;s heart-warming to see such talented and creative people gather together and reach into people&rsquo;s homes, to celebrate Irish culture but, more importantly, to hopefully bring a smile to people&rsquo;s faces and maybe even a jig around the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tune in, come for the Craic, but stay for an evening of music, poetry and song to remember - and don&rsquo;t forget to raise a glass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening starts at 7.30pm tomorrow (Tuesday) and can be viewed at oxfordbloomsday.live/2020</p>

<h3 id="in-dave-chappelles-846-lives-the-spirit-of-james-baldwin">&ldquo;In Dave Chappelle’s ‘8:46’ lives the spirit of James Baldwin&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://theundefeated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dave-Chappelle.jpg?w=700" alt="img">
Dave Chappelle receives the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center in October 2019. Chappelle’s new stand-up, 8:46 , is time-stamped with George Floyd’s death and focuses on the one-sided relationship America has with its black citizens.</p>
<p>Twenty-two minutes in. That’s roughly when James Baldwin’s fierce 1968 Esquire interview graduates from hovering presence to co-pilot in 8:46, Dave Chappelle’s imperfectly eloquent new set for Netflix reacting to the protests and death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>It’s at that point — roughly three-quarters of the way through — when Chappelle claps back at conservative commentator Candace Owens’ vile comment that Floyd was “neither a martyr or a hero,” with one of the most powerful statements of his hall of fame career.</p>
<p>“We’re not desperate for heroes in the black community,” he said. “Any n—a that survives this nightmare is a god damned hero.”</p>
<p>Being a survivor, though, comes with the burden of telling the story. Chappelle’s 2020 differs from Baldwin’s 1968, but also mirrors it in multiple ways. Fifty-two years apart, America crescendoed in an angry, deadly moment. Shortly after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Baldwin captured black America’s rage and made sense of the violence that had engulfed the country.</p>
<p>He was vehemently offended at how the country could act astonished when it had been the reason for the anger in its streets. To Baldwin, it wasn’t up to him to justify the fire from men and women who looked like him. Rather, it was up to America to acknowledge its own sins for the crimes inflicted on his people.</p>
<p>What separates 8:46 from anything he’s done before is how he delivered the message. The jokes were few and far between because, honestly, there’s very little to find humorous these days. Truth, however, was in surplus.</p>
<p>Accepting Harvard’s W.E.B. Du Bois Medal in 2018, Chappelle noted that Baldwin had always been one of his favorite writers because he “managed to tell white people what they feel like to be around.” The 8:46 special isn’t necessarily telling white people what it feels like to be around them. But it is Chappelle speaking directly to nonblack folks, who comprise a good chunk of his audience in Beavercreek, Ohio, on June 6, what it feels like to be driven to the point of no return by them.</p>
<p>Baldwin was almost offended by the interviewer’s first question: “Can we still cool it?” For Baldwin, the idea that was even incrementally possible was laughable. The 1960s was a decade defined by bloodshed, not only with the Vietnam War, but with high-profile assassinations of an American president, civil rights icons, Freedom Riders and young girls in a Birmingham, Alabama, church. It was the decade that made Muhammad Ali the most hated black man in the country. So “cooling it” wasn’t Baldwin’s or his people’s cross to bear.</p>
<p>“It’s a very serious question in my mind whether or not the people of this country, the bulk of population of this country, have enough sense of what is really happening to their black co-citizens to understand why they’re in the streets,” Baldwin responded. “It came as no revelation to me or to any other black cat that white racism is at the bottom of the civil disorders.”</p>
<p>Baldwin died long before the birth of social media. Chappelle, also, rose to prominence before the social media era. Like Richard Pryor before him, Chappelle’s lauded stand-ups and sketch comedy show were more societal dissertation than a string of knee-slapping jokes. Yet, even with Chappelle’s star power, he still is a black man in America. The events, the hashtags and the marches over the last decade have left their mark on him.</p>
<p>Much has been debated about why Floyd’s death ignited worldwide protests. That, for whatever reason, it became the “chickens coming home to roost” moment Malcolm X prophesied decades earlier.</p>
<p>The truth is, since 1900, Congress has gone back and forth on whether lynching should be a federal crime. Next month marks a decade since the guilty verdict in the trial of the officer who killed Oscar Grant — coincidentally delivered just hours before NBA star LeBron James (whom Chappelle defends in 8:46 from Fox News’ Laura Ingraham’s “shut up and dribble” comments) announced his “Decision” to join the Miami Heat. Grant’s 2009 killing at Fruitvale Station in Oakland, California, was arguably the first recorded death to make waves in the social media era. In the years following came Trayvon Martin, the undeniable shifting point in social media awareness, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Jordan Davis, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, John Crawford III, Walter Scott, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Charleena Lyles, Atatiana Jefferson, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and countless more.</p>
<p>Chappelle’s new stand-up is time-stamped with Floyd’s death. Its title earmarks an alpha and omega, connecting the comedian’s time of birth to how long police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck. Holistically, however, 8:46 is a ghost story about lives lost at the hands of those entrusted to “protect and serve.” Lives lost that never became front-page news nor inspired protests outside of the houses where their loved ones wept over their pictures.</p>
<p>Police brutality, profiling and culture have long been topics for Chappelle. His bit on 2000’s Killin’ Them Softly, which examined black America’s inherited fear of the police, is one of comedy’s greatest profiles on the subject.</p>
<p>What separates 8:46 from anything he’s done before is how he delivered the message. The jokes were few and far between because, honestly, there’s very little to find humorous these days. Truth, however, was in surplus.</p>
<p>He responded to CNN anchor Don Lemon’s call for celebrities to speak out by saying a celebrity’s take wasn’t needed and the worldwide protests were ignited by everyday men and women who had reached a breaking point. Whatever he had to say, he surmised, paled in comparison. He went on to nod to one of his funniest bits on celebrity culture and a classic shot at Ja Rule from 2004’s For What It’s Worth. (Lemon later said he agreed with Chappelle.)</p>
<p>Chappelle’s set posted on Netflix a day after a slew of white celebrities posted a collective “I Take Responsibility” video detailing ways they intended to combat racism toward African Americans. However well-intended, the montage came off as white guilt for a reckoning they never recognized would arrive.</p>
<p>For much of his impassioned soliloquy, Chappelle focuses on the one-sided relationship America has with its black citizens. It sounded much like the logic Baldwin employed 52 years earlier. “If … the American black man is going to be a free person in this country,” Baldwin said, “the people of this country have to give something up. If they don’t give it up, it will be taken from them.”</p>
<p>Never was this more apparent than in Chappelle’s riff about Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner, who had been fired from the department in 2008 and infamously went on a killing rampage in 2013. The massive manhunt for Dorner proved violent, including eight Los Angeles police officers shooting a pickup truck in which a mother and daughter were injured while delivering newspapers. The officers were never charged. Before his death, Dorner released a manifesto explaining his actions. In it, he mentioned Chappelle among many other celebrities, politicians and athletes he admired.</p>
<p>“They found him in Big Bear [California]. He was hiding in a cabin … no less than 400 officers answered the call. And, boy, let me tell you something, they Swiss cheese’d this n—a,” Chappelle recounted in 8:46. “And you know why 400 cops showed up? Because one of their own was murdered. So how the f— can’t they understand what’s going on in these streets?”</p>
<p>In less than 30 minutes, Chappelle’s polarizing narrative encapsulates 2020 in a way no other creative has come close to. Not once does he mention the coronavirus, but not once is it necessary. Each member of the audience was wearing a mask. He could’ve easily made crude jokes, he said, but each segment, each subject, each word had to matter.</p>
<p>Still, we can and should credit him as one of our most respected commentators on race, black life and the pressure American systems place on that, while also holding him accountable for missed opportunities. At least in the moment, black women — whom he has expressed vocal support for in the past — didn’t appear to be in his thoughts.</p>
<p>Chappelle isn’t a perfect man. Being flawed is almost a prerequisite in comedy. But mentioning Taylor or Tony McDade would have spoken volumes.</p>
<p>Taylor was shot to death by police weeks before Floyd, but, unlike in the Floyd case, the cops who killed her have not been charged. McDade was a black trans man killed by police in Tallahassee, Florida, on May 27.</p>
<p>Chappelle’s commentary on the trans community has come under fire. And black women are far from immune from police violence. Very few pieces of art carry the cultural cachet of a Dave Chappelle stand-up. What he says not only matters, it creates a historical curriculum in real time. Criticizing him for omitting mention of them doesn’t take away from the potency of 8:46. It acknowledges how an already powerful moment in time could have been even more so.</p>
<p>This month, a Washington Post poll revealed that nearly 70% of Americans believed Floyd’s death resulted from a systemic problem with policing as opposed to 29% who believe it was an isolated incident. Just six years ago, in 2014, more than half called police killings of unarmed black people isolated incidents.</p>
<p>“Every time, including the time the president was murdered, everyone insisted it was the work of one lone madman,” Baldwin told Esquire in 1968. “No one can face the fact that this madness has been created deliberately.”</p>
<p>Chappelle’s storytelling is one of his inimitable skills, putting him in the company of names such as musicians Curtis Mayfield, Nina Simone, Tupac Shakur and novelist Toni Morrison. Near the start of 8:46, Chappelle tells an anecdote about how he feared for his life during the Northridge earthquake in January 1994. It lasted, he surmised, 35 seconds — a fraction of the time Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd’s neck. When Chappelle watched the infamous video, he noted it was the second time he’d ever heard a black man call for his mother in his final moments. The first was when his father called for his grandmother.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, we learn the second part of the story. From the years leading to the Civil War up until President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, less than a handful of black people had visited the White House. One was Frederick Douglass. Another was William David Chappelle, who was born into slavery, and who, along with a delegation of black Americans, visited President Woodrow Wilson to protest the lynching of a black man in South Carolina following a monetary dispute. His wife was the same woman Chappelle’s father called out to in his final moments.</p>
<p>Both Chappelle’s show and Baldwin’s interview are moments of self-reflection from two men, in the same country, at two different junctures, attempting to figure out not only their purpose, but their people’s. America has long known of its dependency on racism, and the fear and obedience it commanded. Baldwin and Chappelle both took on the task of putting white America in its historical place.</p>
<p>“All that can save you now is your confrontation with your own history, which is not your past, but your present,” Baldwin said near the end of the Esquire interview. “Your history has led you to this moment, and you can only begin to change yourself by looking at what you are doing in the name of your history, in the name of your gods, in the name of your language. … That’s why you keep saying, what does the Negro want? It’s a summation of your own delusions, the lies you told yourself. You know exactly what I want!”</p>
<p>In his own exit statement, Chappelle noted that history instructs the present. “These things are not old … it’s today,” he said. “These n—as say why isn’t Dave Chappelle saying anything — because David Chappelle understands what the f— he’s seeing! And the streets will speak for themselves whether I am alive or dead.”</p>
<p>How does black America “cool it” in 2020? There are many places to look. Just don’t look to Baldwin and Chappelle.
