The Los Angeles Medical Examiner revealed Monday that Harry Hains, a 27-year-old actor known for his appearances in “American Horror Story” and the Netflix series “The OA,” died from accidental fentanyl intoxication.

Hains died on Jan. 7 in Los Angeles. At the time, his mother, Jane Badler, posted that her son suffered from mental illness and addiction.

“He was 27 and had the world at his feet,” she wrote on Instagram. “A brilliant spark shone bright too short a time.”

She later posted Hains was “A lover of life ... a crazy, creative . Magical creature ... just on loan to spread magic.”

“Heard you were flying around creating planets and new life forms,” she added.

Hains had previously spoken about being gender fluid, telling the magazine Boys By Girls that he didn't think he represented "what it means to be a man."

"I believe we should be whatever we want," Hains said. "It gets kind of confusing when we start labelling ourselves so I try to stay away from labels.
