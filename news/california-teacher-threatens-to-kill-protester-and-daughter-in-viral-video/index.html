<p>A California elementary school teacher has issued an apology after a viral video showed her threatening to kill a mother and her young daughter as they were leaving a Back Lives Matter protest.</p>
<p>Carrie Maxwell, a second-grade teacher at Wayside Elementary School, was filmed screaming profanities into the face of Erika Baze and her eight-year-old girl, Kimberly, after a protest in Bakersfield last Friday.</p>
<p>Baze, who is white, said Maxwell ‘jumped out of nowhere’ and began shouting at them, telling them they weren’t welcome in the area and that she was going to call police.</p>
<p>The startled mother began recording Maxwell when she started to become violent.</p>
<p>‘I will f***ing kill you,’ Maxwell can be heard saying in the footage. The teacher had to be physically dragged away from Baze by her shirtless husband.</p>
<p>Scroll down for video</p>
<p>Carrie Maxwell, a second-grade teacher at Wayside Elementary School, was filmed screaming profanities in the face of a mother and her eight-year-old daughter last week</p>
<p>Erika Baze, who is white, said Maxwell ‘jumped out of nowhere’ and began shouting at them, telling them they weren’t welcome in the area and that she was going to call police.</p>
<p>Kimberley can be heard crying throughout the ordeal in fear, telling her mother on a number of occasions that she’s scared.</p>
<p>‘Do you see what you did to a child? Good job,’ Baze yells out to Maxwell as she’s being pulled away. ‘You just traumatized a child for walking. Look at this! Are you proud?’</p>
<p>The footage of their encounter, posted by Baze onto Twitter, has since been viewed more than three million times.</p>
<p>Users later identified Maxwell as the woman depicted and began emailing the principal of Wayside Elementary. Police also announced they were investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Bakersfield City School District Superintendent Doc Ervin has since said the district is investigating the incident involving the teacher.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We do not condone nor endorse the action and behavior captured on the video,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>In response, on Monday, Maxwell issued a statement through her attorney, Kyle J. Humphrey, apologizing for her actions and calling them a by-product of ‘anxiety, frustration and panic’, caused in-part by over caring for an elderly mother vulnerable to health complications and an autistic son.</p>
<p>‘I had seen news coverage of the protest turning into riots across the country and was aware that the protests near my home had turned to confrontations the day before,’ Maxwell said.</p>
<p>‘When I heard protesters gathering near my home, loudly chanting profanities, I became overwhelmed with anxiety and fear.’</p>
<p>The footage of their encounter, posted by Baze onto Twitter, has since been viewed more than three million times</p>
<p>Users later identified Maxwell as the woman depicted and began emailing the principal of Wayside Elementary. Police then announced they were investigating the incident</p>
<p>Bakersfield City School District Superintendent Doc Ervin has since said the district is investigating the incident involving the teacher (Wayside Elementary shown above)</p>
<p>Maxwell said she called police but was allegedly told there was nothing they could do about the gathering crowd, so she claims she went outside to ask the protestors to move away.</p>
<p>‘There was a woman who became confrontational and I responded in an inappropriate manner,’ Maxwell said in her statement. ‘I never spoke to or threatened this woman’s daughter. I have never been in a physical altercation in my life.’</p>
<p>Maxwell added that she is ‘humiliated by her actions’, and also apologized to anyone hurt by her behavior in the video and for distracting from the point of the protest.</p>
<p>The teacher said she too, like much of the world, was horrified by the video of George Floyd’s death, which showed him pinned to the ground by his neck, under the knee of Derek Chauvin, desperately gasping for air before losing consciousness.</p>
<p>‘Every man, woman and child deserves to be treated with dignity, compassion and equality, regardless of the color of their skin, and every person deserves to live a life free of fear,’ Maxwell said.</p>
<p>‘I am heartbroken to think that any of my students or their parents might see that video and believe that it is in any way reflective of my values or views regarding race or inclusivity.’</p>
<p>Maxwell added that she is ‘humiliated by her actions’, and also apologized to anyone hurt by her behavior in the video and for distracting from the point of the protest. But reacting to the statement, Baze said she rejects Maxwell’s apology saying she ‘didn’t see it as legitimate’</p>
<p>Humphrey, meanwhile, claimed the video is not reflective of who Maxwell is as a person. He said she’s been a ‘dedicated’ teacher for a dozen years.</p>
<p>‘She clearly made a bad choice,’ Humphrey said. ‘But there was no fear or perceived threat as a result of what she said.’</p>
<p>But reacting to the statement, Baze said she rejects Maxwell’s apology saying she ‘didn’t see it as legitimate’.</p>
<p>In a counter-statement, Baze told KGET the apology was for those who were ‘outraged by the video,’ and Maxwell was only sorry because she was caught by the public.</p>
<p>‘This is a press release from a lawyer that Ms. Maxwell has secured, full of excuses for Ms. Maxwell’s behaviour,’ she said.</p>
<p>Baze asks Maxwell to release the video she recorded because Baze ‘knows the truth on how it began.’</p>
<p>In the statement, Baze said she does not see any other way Maxwell’s threats could be interpreted. Whether her threats were directed toward Baze or her 8-year-old daughter, she said ‘any child who sees their parents threatened will feel threatened as well.’

BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — After a video began circulating on social media of a local teacher threatening and swearing at Black Lives Matter protesters, that teacher is apologizing. Carrie Maxwell said what was seen in the video was a &ldquo;captured moment of my anxiety, frustration and panic&rdquo; for the safety of her family.</p>
<p>Maxwell was caught on video Friday yelling at protesters on a corner in her Northwest Bakersfield neighborhood. In the video, Maxwell is seen yelling, swearing and even threatening supposed protesters, including a young girl, according to the woman filming the video.</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the law offices of Kyle J. Humphrey, on behalf of Maxwell, she said, &ldquo;My behavior was never intended in any way to diminish this important time in the life of our country. Like everyone else, I was horrified by the video of the murder of George Floyd. Every man, woman, and child deserves to be treated with dignity, compassion, and equality, regardless of the color of their skin, and every person deserves to live a life free of fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell went on to say in her statement that she had seen news coverage of protests turning into riots and, on Friday, heard protesters gathering and loudly chanting profanities near her home, and became overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. She said she is the primary caretaker for her 18-year-old autistic son and elderly mother who is extremely vulnerable to health complications.</p>
<p>Maxwell&rsquo;s attorney, Kyle J. Humphrey, reiterated her statements saying that after several weeks of being quarantined Maxwell just broke down. He noted that in the moment of panic, she said something &ldquo;angry but not racist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Nathan McCauley of the Bakersfield Police Department said they did receive a police report regarding the video and is investigating it as a criminal threat.</p>
<p>Maxwell said in her statement that she had originally gone outside to ask the protesters to move the protest away from her home, which she noted is not shown in the video. She said when the woman filming the video became confrontational, she responded in an inappropriate manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never intended to cause fear. I never spoke to or threatened this woman’s daughter,&rdquo; Maxwell said in the statement. &ldquo;I have never even been in a physical altercation in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman filming the video, Erika Keener Baze, told 23ABC that she would like to accept the apology Maxwell released but does not see her statement as a legitimate apology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a press release from a lawyer that Ms. Maxwell has secured, full of excuses for Ms. Maxwell’s behavior,&rdquo; Blaze said.</p>
<p>Blaze said she felt the statement was released in response to media attention, and not directed towards her or her daughter.</p>
<p>Maxwell is a teacher with the Bakersfield City School District and has been a teacher for over 12 years, according to her attorney. Following the release of video, which has received more than 35,000 likes and 14,000 shares on Twitter, the school district releases the following statement:</p>
<p>The Bakersfield City School District strives to be a model of inclusion and equity for our students, staff, families and community members.</p>
<p>The District is aware of the incident that occurred on June 5, 2020 involving an employee. We do not condone nor endorse the action and behavior captured on the video.</p>
<p>The District is currently conducting an investigation into the incident. As this is a confidential personnel matter, we are unable to comment any further</p>
<p>You can read both Maxwell&rsquo;s and Blaze&rsquo;s full statements below:</p>
<p>Statement from Carrie Maxwell</p>
<p>I want to offer my sincerest apology to anyone who was hurt by my behavior in that video.</p>
<p>My behavior was never intended in any way to diminish this important time in the life of our country. Like everyone else, I was horrified by the video of the murder of George Floyd. every man, woman, and child deserves to be treated with dignity, compassion, and equality, regardless of the color of their skin, and every person deserves to live a life free of fear.</p>
<p>What you saw in that video was a captured moment of my anxiety, frustration, and panic for the safety of my family. I am the caretaker for my 18-year-old autistic son and my elderly mother who has COPD and is extremely vulnerable to health complications. I had seen news coverage of the protests turning into riots across the country and was aware that the protest near my home had turned to confrontation the day before. When I heard protesters gathering near my home, loudly chanting profanities, I became overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. I called the police and was told there was nothing they could do. I went out to ask the protesters to move the protest away from my home. This was not shown on the video that was posted. there was a woman who became confrontational and I responded in a inappropriate manner. I never intended to cause fear. i never spoke to or threatened this woman’s daughter. I have never even been in a physical altercation in my life.</p>
<p>I am humiliated by my actions.</p>
<p>I am heartbroken to think that any of my students or their parents might see that video and believe that it is in any way reflective of my values or views regarding race or inclusivity.</p>
<p>My family and my students are my greatest joys in life. I take pride in creating a classroom environment that is welcoming and safe for all my students, regardless of their race. In my twelve years of teaching, I have predominantly taught students of color. I have always been and will continue to be passionately protective of my students’ well-being. I work every day to ensure that my students are afforded every opportunity for success. As teachers, we are not only educators, but also counselors, social workers, guardian, and friends. I take pride in the relationships I have cultivated with my students and their parents. In the future I will continue to support and uplift my students and stand against inequality of all types.</p>
<p>Statement from Erika Keener Baze

<h3 id="mass-protests-and-mayhem-continue-into-a-sixth-night-thousands-nationwide-are-arrested-during-weekend">&ldquo;Mass protests and mayhem continue into a sixth night; thousands nationwide are arrested during weekend&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EW2WO4VDCEI6VPQGV5KRJ3QDQU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
BROOKLYN — The downtown area of this New York City borough looked like it was under martial law as Saturday night turned into Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Dozens of police vehicles screamed to a halt in front of a McDonald’s near the DeKalb subway stop, as what appeared to be at least a hundred officers with plastic shields pushed back on crowds shouting “George Floyd,” and “Eric Garner,” two African Americans killed by police. “Go home!” officers shouted back, waving batons.</p>
<p>A pile of trash burned on the asphalt. Cars honked their horns. Sirens blazed. Fire trucks rushed to the scene. Multiple times, police pushback caused a stampede — sometimes prompted by glass bottles thrown at officers from the crowd, sometimes seemingly prompted by nothing at all.</p>
<p>One woman who said she was a medic rushed forward to help a man bleeding from his forehead. Seconds later, she ran the opposite direction, clutching her eyes, saying she’d been pepper sprayed and asking for someone, anyone to grab saline solution from her bag.</p>
<p>“At nighttime they get real dirty. They want you to go home and they become very, very aggressive,” said protester Derek Rutledge, 53, an unemployed accountant born and raised in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
<p>He’d arrived by bicycle for a way to escape if things got hairy and said this was his second night protesting. “There are good cops and there’s a whole bunch of dirty cops. If I was a cop and I saw somebody killing somebody for $20, I’d say, ‘Dude, get off of him!’ There’s no need.”</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the police said that they’d made more than 300 arrests during the overnight protests in New York. At least 30 officers were injured and nearly 50 police vehicles were damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>“I’m extremely proud of the way you’ve comported yourselves in the face of such persistent danger, disrespect, and denigration,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote to the NYPD force on Twitter. Shea noted that the spams of violence in the city were driven by “a mob bent solely on taking advantage of a moment in American history, to co-opt the cause of equality that we all must uphold, to intentionally inflict chaos, mayhem, and injury just for the sake of doing so.”</p>
<p>All along Brooklyn’s Atlantic Avenue thoroughfare were shattered windows and piles of glass, at a TD bank, a Men’s Wearhouse, and the downtown Brooklyn Apple Store, where a single panel of the store’s tempered glass facade had cracked but was not broken.</p>
<p>Photographer Flo Ngala, 25, came from Harlem and was wearing a Martin Luther King Jr. T-shirt. She carried a sign reading, “Can’t breathe with a mask on. Can’t breathe without one.” Most of the day, she said, had been inspiring, with crowds cheering protesters on from cars and balconies. Two little black boys had marched with them, one with a sign that read “Stop killing us.” Ngala stopped talking mid-sentence, as batons and plastic shields came into view, and ran.</p>
<p>Among the bystanders caught up in the melee were a few people exiting the subway and a homeless woman pushing a shopping cart filled with her belongings. She leaned over and let out a hacking cough. A protester with his mask around his chin stood in the sidewalk, directing the traffic of fleeing protesters around her. “Yo brother, run that way,” he said. “Coronavirus is real.”</p>
<p>Around a corner, a 26-year-old black woman slumped on the sidewalk surrounded by five other protesters, all of them people of color who said they came from the city. They’d been strangers to her until moments earlier, when, they said, she’d gotten pepper sprayed. The woman’s face was caked with salt and milk from a solution the other protesters poured into her eyes to stop the burning.</p>
<p>Even when the stinging stopped, she cried. “They’re just good people who saw me in pain,” she said of her new protest friends. “I’m moved to tears by the kindness.”</p>
<p>A special education teacher from Brooklyn, the woman said she’d previously been arrested when an ex-boyfriend beat her and she physically defended herself. “I want to believe in them so badly. I want to believe that they’re good,” she said of police, but that was hard when she’d spent five hours in the same station as her ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>She burst into tears explaining that she’d come out to protest, despite her fears of the police and the pandemic, because she felt like she’d be letting her students down if she didn’t.</p>
<p>The woman works in a poor school district with mostly children of color. “And they tell me, ‘I want to be an astronaut. I want to become a pilot,’” she said.

<h3 id="3-more-officers-charged-in-floyds-death-as-protesters-gather-for-9th-night">&ldquo;3 more officers charged in Floyd’s death as protesters gather for 9th night&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XUNG3IFFKYI6VCMOWINZVA7XSI.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
The monument to a notorious Philadelphia mayor and top cop, which became a flash point of the city’s protests, was removed from its perch outside a government building before the sun rose Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat, said he ordered the hauling off of the 10-foot, 2,000-pound bronze statue of the late Frank Rizzo because it was “a deplorable monument to racism, bigotry, and police brutality for members of the Black community, the LGBTQ community, and many others.”</p>
<p>The city erected the statue in 1999 as a tribute to a man beloved by Philadelphia’s white conservatives for his tough-on-crime approach. But for many — especially the city’s black and gay communities — it is a painful symbol of oppression and injustice.</p>
<p>“The treatment of these communities under Mr. Rizzo’s leadership was among the worst periods in Philadelphia’s history,” Kenney said in a statement. “The battle for equal rights and justice is still being fought decades later, and our city is still working to erase that legacy.”</p>
<p>I cant underscore how important of a victory this is for protestors in this city. This has been such an intense issue in Philadelphia that had been delayed and delayed and in an instant, it was gone. The statue had even been defaced and was cleaned up just last week. Now its gone https://t.co/vrC0LYrIhT — Ayman Mohyeldin (@AymanM) June 3, 2020</p>
<p>Rizzo presided over the police force from 1967 to 1971 and served as mayor from 1972 to 1980. His tenure was marked by frequent raids on gay businesses, a public strip search of Black Panther members, his casual use of the n-word and violent responses to student protesters. During one mayoral run, he urged supporters to “vote white.” Rizzo died in 1991 but remains a deeply polarizing figure.</p>
<p>Activists have been calling for the monument’s removal for years, and the push intensified in recent days as thousands took to the streets in protest after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. On Saturday, demonstrators defaced the statue and tried to tear it down themselves. The next day, a city crew was spotted cleaning off the graffiti, further enraging those who called for its removal.</p>
<p>Protesters cheered its uprooting, but some argued that Kenney — who has long said he wanted to see the statue gone — took too long.</p>
<p>“You don&rsquo;t get a thank you for doing what you&rsquo;re already supposed to do in your job as mayor,” tweeted Queen Muse, a La Salle University professor.

BROOKLYN — The downtown area of this New York borough looked as if it were under martial law as Saturday night turned into Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Dozens of police vehicles screamed to a halt in front of a McDonald’s near the DeKalb subway stop, as what appeared to be at least a hundred officers with plastic shields pushed back on crowds shouting “George Floyd,” and “Eric Garner,” two African Americans killed by police. “Go home!” officers shouted back, waving batons.</p>
<p>A pile of trash burned on the asphalt. Cars honked their horns. Sirens blazed. Firetrucks rushed to the scene. Multiple times, police pushback caused a stampede — sometimes prompted by glass bottles thrown at officers from the crowd, sometimes seemingly prompted by nothing at all.</p>
<p>One woman who said she was a medic rushed forward to help a man bleeding from his forehead. Seconds later, she ran the opposite direction, clutching her eyes, saying she’d been pepper sprayed and asking for someone, anyone to grab saline solution from her bag.</p>
<p>“At nighttime they get real dirty. They want you to go home and they become very, very aggressive,” said protester Derek Rutledge, 53, an unemployed accountant born and raised in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
<p>He had arrived by bicycle for a way to escape if things got hairy and said this was his second night protesting. “There are good cops and there’s a whole bunch of dirty cops. If I was a cop and I saw somebody killing somebody for $20, I’d say, ‘Dude, get off of him!’ There’s no need.” (Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody, was suspected of trying to use a counterfeit $20 bill at a local deli.)</p>
<p>All along Brooklyn’s Atlantic Avenue thoroughfare were shattered windows and piles of glass, at a TD bank, a Men’s Wearhouse, and the downtown Brooklyn Apple Store, where a single panel of the store’s tempered glass facade had cracked but was not broken.</p>
<p>Photographer Flo Ngala, 25, came from Harlem and was wearing a Martin Luther King Jr. T-shirt. She carried a sign reading, “Can’t breathe with a mask on. Can’t breathe without one.” Most of the day, she said, had been inspiring, with crowds cheering protesters on from cars and balconies. Two little black boys had marched with them, one with a sign that read “Stop killing us.” Ngala stopped talking mid-sentence, as batons and plastic shields came into view, and ran.</p>
<p>Among the bystanders caught up in the melee were a few people exiting the subway and a homeless woman pushing a shopping cart filled with her belongings. She leaned over and let out a hacking cough. A protester with his mask around his chin stood on the sidewalk, directing the traffic of fleeing protesters around her. “Yo brother, run that way,” he said. “Coronavirus is real.”</p>
<p>Around a corner, a 26-year-old black woman slumped on the sidewalk surrounded by five other protesters, all of them people of color who said they came from the city. They’d been strangers to her until moments earlier, when, they said, she’d gotten pepper sprayed. The woman’s face was caked with salt and milk from a solution the other protesters poured into her eyes to stop the burning.</p>
<p>Even when the stinging stopped, she cried. “They’re just good people who saw me in pain,” she said of her new protest friends. “I’m moved to tears by the kindness.”</p>
<p>A special-education teacher from Brooklyn, the woman said she had previously been arrested when an ex-boyfriend beat her and she physically defended herself. “I want to believe in them so badly. I want to believe that they’re good,” she said of police, but that was hard when she’d spent five hours in the same station as her ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>She burst into tears explaining that she’d come out to protest, despite her fears of the police and the pandemic, because she felt like she’d be letting her students down if she didn’t.</p>
<p>The woman works in a poor school district with mostly children of color. “And they tell me, ‘I want to be an astronaut. I want to become a pilot,’” she said.

One man was shot and killed when police and the National Guard opened fire in Louisville following a violent confrontation between a group gathered in a parking lot and law enforcement trying to disperse the crowd, authorities said early Monday.</p>
<p>Gov. Andy Beshear (D) said in a statement Monday morning he had authorized the Kentucky State Police to independently investigate the fatal shooting “given the seriousness of the situation.”</p>
<p>Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad said that after another night of destructive protests over the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor in Louisville and the death of George Floyd in Minnesota, the Kentucky National Guard and Louisville police were dispatched to the parking lot at Dino’s Food Mart around 12:15 a.m., where a large crowd had gathered.</p>
<p>But as the agencies began trying to disperse them, someone in the crowd fired at the officers and soldiers, Conrad said.</p>
<p>Both the National Guard and Louisville police returned fire, he said, killing one man at the scene. Conrad did not identify him.</p>
<p>“Our officers are working very hard to keep people safe and protect property,” Conrad said in an early-morning news briefing. “While doing that, we’ve had officers shot at and assaulted. I think it’s very, very clear that many people do not trust the police. That is an issue we’re going to have to work on and work through for a long time.”</p>
<p>Conrad said that police are interviewing several people and are collecting video footage of the shooting, which he pledged to release to the public soon. The chief did not address whether the crowd was in any way related to the protests, which were centered about two miles away in downtown Louisville.</p>
<p>The fatal shooting is likely to further inflame tensions in Louisville, where protesters have been demanding justice in the death of the unarmed 26-year-old Taylor, an African American EMT, on March 13. Taylor was asleep in her apartment when officers broke down her door in the middle of the night to serve a warrant, alarming her boyfriend who fired at police, believing they were armed intruders. Taylor died when police returned fire.

LOS ANGELES — A large nighttime rally outside City Hall dispersed, but not before dozens were arrested in peaceful protest for not adhering to the city’s curfew.</p>
<p>At around 10:30 p.m. local time, police in riot gear ended up handcuffing close to 100 protesters who had overstayed the 9 p.m. curfew by about an hour and a half.</p>
<p>But many attendees of the 1,000-person rally in Los Angeles described the demonstration, meant to protest Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey and the city’s police department, as “beautiful.” Some praised law enforcement for largely allowing them to congregate and support their cause.</p>
<p>“When I first got here it was really scary, because when I came here I saw the National Guard and I was not myself,” said Ashley, a 22-year-old protester from Pasadena, Calif., who declined to give her last name. “So seeing that made me fear what was going to happen.”</p>
<p>For Bernard Elmore, 58 of Los Angeles, attending the protest was just as much about witnessing a peaceful anti-police brutality protest after experiencing the 1992 Rodney King riots, as it was about sharing the experience with his 16-year-old daughter, Mayah.</p>
<p>“This is going to be history. She needs to see a peaceful protest, not that negative stupid stuff,” he said. “If you’re trying to be a voice and let your voice speak for the cause, you need to see this side of it.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California filed an emergency lawsuit challenging “draconian curfews” imposed in the region, arguing that the orders violate constitutional rights and calling for them to be immediately rescinded.</p>
<p>Many attendees of the City Hall protest said they were unsure whether they would breach the curfew, despite understanding the need to pushback on what they believed was an unjustified timeline.
