<h3 id="ana-ivanovic-novak-djokovic-has-big-chance-to-break-roger-federers-record">&ldquo;Ana Ivanovic: Novak Djokovic has big chance to break Roger Federer&rsquo;s record&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tennisworldusa.org/imgb/93362/ana-ivanovic-novak-djokovic-has-big-chance-to-break-roger-federer-s-record.jpg" alt="img">
Former Serbian tennis player Ana Ivanovic believes world No. 1 Novak Djokovic is capable of breaking Roger Federer&rsquo;s all time Grand Slam record. The 38-year-old Swiss has won a record 20 Grand Slam titles but he hasn&rsquo;t won a Major title since he beat Croatian Marin Cilic in the 2018 Australian Open final.</p>
<p>Federer&rsquo;s old-rival Rafael Nadal comes at second place with 19 Grand Slam titles, while Djokovic sits on the third place with 17 Majors captured. Djokovic, who is also third on the list with most weeks spent as world No.</p>
<p>1, has admitted several times that his goal is to break those two Federer&rsquo;s records. Ivanovic, a former world No. 1, was speaking with former world No. 7 Barbara Schett in an Instagram Chat. When asked if Djokovic can break Federer&rsquo;s record, Ivanovic replied, per Sportskeeda: &ldquo;Yeah.</p>
<p>Probably&hellip; He still has a few years left and he definitely has a big chance of doing it and that&rsquo;s one of his goals.&rdquo; Djokovic, 33, won the lone Grand Slam event played this season as he made it all the way at Melbourne Park earlier this year.</p>
<p>Djokovic and Federer clashed once again on the biggest stage but the Serb had no problems as he handed the Swiss a straight-set loss in the semifinal at Melbourne Park. Djokovic was facing a loss in the final but he recovered from two sets to one down to beat world No.</p>
<p>3 Dominic Thiem and claim a record eighth Australian Open title.</p>
<p>Ana Ivanovic reveals she and Djokovic were once very close friends</p>
<p>33-year-old Djokovic and 32-year-old Ivanovic both achieved big success very early in their respective careers.</p>
<p>Djokovic claimed his maiden Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January 2008, while Ivanovic claimed her maiden Major title a few months later at the French Open. &ldquo;In Tour we were very close friends&hellip; But then later over the years he had his own part and I had my own part&hellip;</p>
<p>But what he achieved is really amazing,&rdquo; Ivanovic said. Ivanovic never again won a Grand Slam title but she finished her career with 15 WTA titles in her collection. Ana Ivanovic, 32, retired at a young age as he called it a career in 2016, citing not being able to perform at the highest level as one of the main reasons for her decision.

<h3 id="djokovic-will-overtake-roger-federer-and-become-the-goat-says-former-world-no-1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Djokovic will overtake Roger Federer and become the GOAT&rsquo;, says former World No. 1&rdquo;</h3>

Former Serbian tennis player Ana Ivanovic was the protagonist of a long interview on Eurosport, where he commented on all the news that gravitates around the world of tennis. The former World number 1, who retired from the circuit at the end of 2016, has won 15 singles titles during his career, including Roland Garros in 2008.</p>
<p>She also reached a final in Paris in 2007 and one at the Australian Open in 2008. She was at the top of the world ranking from 9th June to 10th August 2008 and then from 18th August to 7th September of the same year (for a total of 12 weeks).</p>
<p>Ivanovic: &lsquo;Djokovic will break Federer’s Slam record&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ana had a recent talk with former world no.10 Barbara Schett-Eagle. She talked about Kim Clijsters: “I have been watching some of her matches and she has been striking the ball amazingly well, but I really hope she can get back to that level to play like she used to,” Serbia’s 2008 French Open champion Ivanovic, talking to Eurosport’s Hanging out with Babsi, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Personally, I don’t think it’ll be easy after being out for so many years. It’s amazing what she achieved. I still respect her so much, it’s just difficult to imagine now after having three kids and being out for so long to make a comeback,” Ivanovic, who retired in 2016, aged 29, said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not because she’s not fit, but because your body just reacts differently. When you are out of competition you realise how much fine-tuning is necessary and she’s been out a while”. When asked about her opinion about Novak Djokovic and the opportunity for him to break Federer’s slam record, Ana sounded rather positive.</p>
<p>“In tour we were very close friends, but then later over the years he had his own path and I had my own path, but what he achieved is really amazing,” Ivanovic said. “Yeah. Probably. He has time working for him.</p>
<p>He still has a few years left and he definitely has a big chance of doing it and that’s one of his goals probably,” she added.

<h3 id="novak-djokovics-mom-reveals-his-retirement-date">&ldquo;Novak Djokovic’s mom reveals his retirement date&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tennisworldusa.org/imgb/93085/novak-djokovics-mom-reveals-his-retirement-date.jpg" alt="img">
In the past 4 years, Novak Djokovic has won 82 wins out of 106 games against the top 20 in the world. A clear dominance over his longtime rivals, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. The Spanish tennis player has scored 60 wins and 26 defeats against the Top 20 in recent years.</p>
<p>The exceptional numbers of the World number 1 are also present in this particular 2020. Before the stop to tennis, caused by the Coronavirus emergency, the Serbian tennis player started 2020 with 18 wins and 0 losses to his credit.</p>
<p>Victories that have given Serbian important successes such as the Australian Open 2020 or the ATP Cup. In these tournaments there have been extraordinary comebacks such as the victory in the final in Melbourne against Dominic Thiem (under two sets to one) and the great victory in Dubai on Gael Monfils where he also canceled a match point.</p>
<p>During a recent interview, Graham Bensinger asked Novak&rsquo;s mom if she sees her son playing at the age of 40. “No, I don’t think so. He has so many things in life, not just tennis. He is a tennis player now but he wants to do many things after that and he has his family.</p>
<p>So I think he will play for 3 or 4 more years, 5 at the most&rdquo; - she said. Tennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic&rsquo;s matches as some of the greatest contests ever, with the 2012 Australian Open final being considered one of the greatest matches ever seen.</p>
<p>Some longtime analysts claim that the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history primarily because of the quality of matches they produce. Some journalists and tennis players consider that the achievements of Djоkovic are not proportionally appreciated in the media and among tennis fans because of the prejudice against Eastern Europe.

<h3 id="the-day-novak-djokovic-thought-of-retiring">&ldquo;The day Novak Djokovic thought of retiring&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/sportsfinding.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1589521381_536508_1589521543_noticia_normal.jpg?resize=696%2C392&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Novak Djokovic was very close to hanging the racket in 2018. This was confessed by his wife Jelena Djokovic in an interview in &lsquo;In Depth with Graham Bensinger&rsquo;, where he revealed that the Serbian tennis player, current number one in the ATP ranking, thought about making this decision after a bad streak of results.</p>
<p>The episode in which Djokovic thought about his retirement took place after the Serb&rsquo;s defeat to Benoit Paire in the second round of the 2018 Miami Masters 1,000 in two sets, and after a difficult start to the season after falling in the round of 16 of the Australian Open against Hyeon Chung in three sets and in the second round of Indian Wells against Taro Daniel.</p>
<p>Djokovic, who started the season after a nearly six-month hiatus to recover from an elbow injury, gathered his team in the locker room and made this confession to them that his wife revealed. “After losing in Miami, a terrible loss, he said he wanted to quit tennis. It&rsquo;s the truth. He called us together and said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s over.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;What?&rsquo; and he continued saying: &lsquo;Eduardo (his agent), you can tell my sponsors, I want to be clear with them. I don&rsquo;t know if I will retire for six months, a year or forever. Just tell him “Jelena commented. “It was like &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t leave it&rsquo; while we cried and said to him &lsquo;What are you doing? This is not the time,'” said the tennis player&rsquo;s wife, who also commented on the moment when Djokovic wanted to completely disconnect from tennis. “We took vacations and one day, while we were playing, he decided he didn&rsquo;t want to play tennis, he didn&rsquo;t want to see tennis, he didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with tennis”.</p>
<p>However, Jelena and her son Stefan were very important when Djokovic regained his passion for tennis. “I love tennis and I take the kids with me to play. On the third or fourth day of this break he saw me because I found an old tennis machine that I was starting to like and I started playing against it because I didn&rsquo;t have a coach while Stefan (his son) was picking up the balls. It is a training that he is not used to because it is very serious and competitive. I wanted him to enjoy himself and not feel the pressure. Fortunately He saw how we were having fun and then he came out without shoes, without a shirt and only in panatlon and he said to us &lsquo;Can you give me a racket, please?&rsquo; And I said &lsquo;no, you&rsquo;re not playing anymore, you quit tennis, so leave the court.&rsquo; Of course I was kidding him and then Stefan said &lsquo;Okay dad, it&rsquo;s your turn now&rsquo; and then He hit some balls, he started to serve and he didn&rsquo;t feel bad, and then I said, &lsquo;Can I play with you? and we started playing a little with our son, “said the tennis player&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>In the return of Novak Djokovic after this downturn, his lifelong coach, Marjan Vajda, also played an important role. “On the last day he appeared dressed ready to play and told me: &lsquo;Do you know what I am going to do? I am going to call Marjan (Vajda) because he is my coach. I am going to ask him to come back and be my entertainer again. It was like &lsquo;what are you saying to me?&rsquo; after 10 days in which I felt I was not going to play again, “confessed Jelena.</p>
<p>Jelena Djokovic also revealed her husband&rsquo;s desire to return to the circuit as soon as possible and how this took its toll, although she highlighted the great recovery capacity of her husband. “He had come from a year in which he had undergone surgery and he tried to return. He rushed since he did not find the results. Everyone told him to slow down and he did not do it because he hoped to recover, but he began to lose, and lose, and to lose… He is not a good loser but he was like a phoenix, he found the motivation and had to fall completely to rebuild himself amazingly. “

Ana is confident that Novak will be the man with the most slam titles</p>
<p>Novak Djokovic and Ana Ivanovic are 2 icons of Serbian tennis. Ana retired in 2016 after being the world no.1 in 2008 following her French Open title and Nole is on his way to become the so-called GOAT (Greatest of all time).</p>
<p>Ana is currently married with former soccer star Bastian Schweinsteiger, and she has 2 children; she still loves talking about tennis every now and then.</p>
<p>Ana had a recent talk with former world no.10 Barbara Schett-Eagle. When asked about her opinion about Novak Djokovic and the opportunity for him to break Federer’s slam record, Ana sounded rather positive.</p>
<p>“In tour we were very close friends, but then later over the years he had his own path and I had my own path, but what he achieved is really amazing,” Ivanovic said. “Yeah. Probably. He has time working for him. He still has a few years left and he definitely has a big chance of doing it and that’s one of his goals probably,” she added</p>

<p>Now the world no.1, Novak played his last match on the 29th of February when he beat Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-3 6-4 in the final in Dubai to win his 79th career title.</p>
<p>During this season Novak has a 18-0 win-loss record. Djokovic has won 2 titles in 2020 at the Australian Open and in Dubai.</p>

<h3 id="novak-djokovics-mother-reveals-his-retirement-date">&ldquo;Novak Djokovic’s Mother Reveals His Retirement Date&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200525131550/Mom-1.jpg" alt="img">
Serbian star Novak Djokovic became a professional player way back in 2003. Ever since then, he has been playing some extremely good tennis and has won a lot of titles. But how long can he continue playing like this? His mother has just answered this question for us.</p>
<p>How Long Will Novak Djokovic Play?</p>
<p>Novak’s mom recently had a talk with Graham Bensinger where she showed him Novak’s trophy room which obviously had a lot of trophies. During this talk, Graham asked her if she sees her son playing at the age of 40. She replied by saying,</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so. He has so many things in life, not just tennis. He is a tennis player now but he wants to do many things after that and he has his family. So I think he will play for 3 or 4 more years, 5 at the most.”</p>
<p>Many tennis fans might be disappointed to hear that he won’t play till he’s 40. But he will still play for 5 more years which is a long time. And hopefully, in that time we can see him achieve one of his biggest goals – becoming the greatest tennis player of all time.</p>
<p>To become the GOAT of tennis, Novak Djokovic has to hold one record – the most Grand Slam titles. He currently has 17 which is 3 short of the all-time record that belongs to Roger Federer. If he continues the way he has been playing, he will beat the record in no time.</p>
<p>He is probably training extremely hard right now so that he can get closer to beating that record. And he is probably waiting for the next opportunity to do it. Unfortunately for him, that opportunity is only going to come after a long time.</p>
<p>This is is because the ATP Tour has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. It is scheduled to return in August assuming the virus is contained by then. Hopefully, it is so that Novak will get his opportunity to become the GOAT of tennis
