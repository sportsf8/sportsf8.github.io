<p>The internet is a wondrous place, as was evidenced when one x-rated meme made its way to Australia and landed a spot in the evening weather report.</p>
<p>With Win News in Ballarat, Victoria, asking for viewer submissions of the wild weather punters have filmed on their phones, as the region is battered by strong storms, producers clearly didn’t cotton onto the meme buried in one clip.</p>
<p>As the presenter threw to one submission in particular, some very eagle-eyed viewers realised one cheeky chap had Photoshopped quite an explicit meme in the background to look like a lightning strike.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the cool kids on the block, you may have noticed a meme doing the sounds of a rather well-endowed naked man, sitting on a bed and glancing down the camera with his, er, member on full-frontal show.</p>
<p>Since resurfacing earlier this year, it’s been dubbed everything from ‘Wood sitting on a bed’ – owing to the name the now-deceased porn star was given by the internet (his real name is Wardy Joubert III) – to ‘huge penis meme’.</p>
<p>What more can we say? The internet is a weird place.</p>
<p>Yeah so this made it onto the news (Picture: Twitter)</p>
<p>We’ll keep things PG by only showing you from the waist up, but you get the picture…</p>
<p>Anyway, Win soon deleted the offending clip from its social media page, but ofcourse it had been snapped up by fans, with reporter Cameron Wilson sharing it for posterity.</p>
<p>We thank him for that.</p>
<p>In the blink and you’ll miss it moment, Wood is now in the sky, as an outline of what is quite clearly the meme illuminated as lightning strikes a car park.</p>
<p>The outline of Wood really remains on the retinas, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>The thing is, though, viewers weren’t even mad as they all had a little giggle about it on Twitter afterwards.</p>
<p>Clearly a spot of entertainment, while there’s not much else to do, one mused: ‘TBH I think it’s easy to miss given that @WIN_TV produces so many news bulletins – and it gave us all a laugh so not complaning!’</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Other fans thought this was the glorious work of Mother Nature, as another noted: ‘seeing in the comments that this is likely edited and not just an incredibly beautiful natural coincidence, as i had naively taken it to be, is heartbreaking.’</p>
<p>As one rather cheekily suggested it would be ‘quite the downpour’ another felt for the poor sod who uploaded the clip to the news bulletin: ‘someone’s about to lose their job and we need to start a gofundme for them immediately.’</p>
<p>While it’s clear producers weren’t looking out for an outline of a large, naked man and his penis as they surveyed the clip for broadcast, the image flashes up so quickly you have to cut them some slack for missing it.</p>
<p>Rest assured calls for viewer submissions may be put on hold for the time being…</p>

<h3 id="noida-student-designs-wood-cube-that-transforms-into-14-types-of-furniture">&ldquo;Noida Student Designs Wood ‘Cube’ That Transforms Into 14 Types of Furniture&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thebetterindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/lifestyle-2020-05-27T180252.166.jpg" alt="img">
Madhur Sharma’s hostel room was so small it could hardly accommodate necessary furniture. So he designed a single furniture that could turn into 14 shapes, from chair and table to even a TV unit!</p>
<p>Promotion</p>
<p>With The Positive Collective, The Better India’s COVID-19 coverage is available to regional language publications for free. Write to <a href="mailto:editorial@thebetterindia.com">editorial@thebetterindia.com</a> for more details.</p>
<p>They say hostel life will change you for good. For Madhur Sharma, an architecture student in Noida, his days in a hostel inspired him to make a single piece of furniture that can work as a study table, chair, coffee table and more!</p>
<p>“My hostel room was so small that it could not accommodate all the furniture I wanted. I have always been a creative person and this gave me the opportunity to design furniture that could serve many purposes and fit into a corner when not in use,” Madhur tells The Better India (TBI).</p>
<p>Promotion</p>
<p>The 21-year-old conceptualised the design in his first year, and finalised it two years later. Today, this multi-functional piece of furniture has won many awards and is already sitting in the rooms of eminent designers and architects.</p>
<p>Buy one get 14 free!</p>
<p>What prevents most of us from purchasing beautiful, utilitarian furniture is the price. A basic desk can cost you about Rs 2000 while a lounge chair can go beyond Rs 15,000. Few of us are privileged to splurge on such furniture and so, our rooms remain empty.</p>
<p>“When I was designing this, I had three crucial points in mind: the social factor, the economic factor and the environmental factor. I was just a hostel student and that was my temporary residence. But so many people who live in small apartments compromise on purchasing good furniture because of lack of space. This became my motivation,” Madhur shares.</p>
<p>Many Mumbai residents will agree to this considering that the average apartment size there was about 700 sq feet (in 2018) while the current average apartment in Bengaluru and Delhi is 1200 sq feet—just about the national average. Hyderabad, at 1600 sq feet (in 2018) had the largest average apartment size in metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>Unless you are living alone in such an apartment, the need to ration space and utilise it to the fullest becomes paramount, and Madhur’s furniture design helps you do that.</p>
<p>When arranged as a block, it takes about one square foot of space. That is about the same size as a floor tile. And just as easily, you can turn it into a lounge chair to read a book on, a study table during work hours, a coffee table and just about anything you would like in a room.</p>
<p>Madhur lists the 14 functions as:</p>
<p>“Z” Shape Chair</p>
<p>Normal Chair</p>
<p>Center Table</p>
<p>Coffee Table</p>
<p>Settee for Single Person</p>
<p>Bench</p>
<p>Side Table</p>
<p>Low Floor Sitting for Single Person</p>
<p>Low Floor Sitting for Double Person</p>
<p>Partition for Separating Two Workplaces</p>
<p>Plant Enclosure For Single Pot</p>
<p>Plant Enclosure For Double Pot</p>
<p>Television Unit</p>
<p>Table with Book Storage</p>
<p>This addressed the social factor. The total cost of this piece of furniture is Rs 12,000, so you are spending about Rs 850 on each separate block, and that takes care of the economic aspect. Next up, the environmental factor.</p>
<p>For nature, inspired by nature:</p>
<p>“If one table uses one cubic foot of wood to make, so does a chair, a desk and the bed, much more. This piece of furniture uses just one cubic foot for all of it together. This translates into less stress on the limited resources at our disposal,” the final year architecture student shares.</p>
<p>While it is clear that nature has a huge influence on Madhur, he mentions that he also found inspiration in the human body. “The three crucial joints of the shoulder, pelvis and knees that allow us to sit, stand, walk and bend into different positions became my starting point. These three joints, bolted together by nuts allow my furniture to transform into different shapes,” he says.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also user-friendly. If, say, one block of wood gets damaged, instead of throwing out the whole piece, you can just replace that block. This too helps conserve resources. “It is easy to modify, replace, maintain and transport,” Madhur adds.</p>
<p>Much more than architecture:</p>
<p>His furniture does not exactly toe the line of the expectations of an architecture college. But he went with the flow anyway. In fact, this (ironically) out-of-the-box thinking won him awards in his college, the Apeejay Institute of Technology—School of Architecture &amp; Planning (AIT).</p>
<p>Two years ago, after his prototype was displayed in college exhibitions, fashion designer Payal Jain, architect Nilanjan Bhowal and Vivek Sabherwal, the director of AIT, got in touch with him to understand the design better. They had encouraging reviews to share which pushed Madhur to make more units of this design.</p>
<p>But Madhur hasn’t stopped at that. Since 2018, he has designed 10 more furniture pieces— seven of which are multifunctional.</p>
<p>“My furniture should not be treated as a trivial object but it should be conceived as an artwork which can convey some social message,” he shares with TBI.</p>
<p>As smaller homes become the new norm, multifunctionality, affordability and eco-conscious factors are going to be determining factors. Madhur’s designs are bringing the future of interior designing in the present.</p>
<p>Madhur’s designs are ready to be ordered. You can get in touch with him by email to place your orders. Contact him on <a href="mailto:madhursharma4599@gmail.com">madhursharma4599@gmail.com</a></p>

<h3 id="10-yurts-to-stay-in-this-summer">&ldquo;10 yurts to stay in this summer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://life.spectator.co.uk/content/uploads/2020/05/kinton_kintoncloudhouse_powys_yurt-4096x2731.jpg" alt="img">
With international travel still out of the picture, it makes sense to opt for a staycation this summer. Step forward glamping – the ideal last-minute holiday that will make you feel a hundred miles away from home.</p>
<p>Hadrian’s Wall Yurt, Hexham, Northumberland</p>
<p>This is what camping feels like if you’re a renowned general with a legion to set up your tent for you. Inside, a collection of antiques make up your bedroom and lounge, giving a stately feel to the inside of the spacious yurt. Outside, an island of decking holds a covered kitchen and walkways to the shower and loo. Your two-acre camp is surrounded by the rest of Barry’s 27-acre’s of land, so you’ll not see another soul during your stay.</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £90 per night</p>
<p>Yarlington Yurt, Somerset</p>
<p>The Yarlington Yurt is an unusual two pod arrangement, with a king-sized double bed in the main yurt, and two single beds in a connected bedroom pod. It’s magnificently eccentric and although perhaps unexpected within the grounds of such a house, somehow seems to fit it perfectly.</p>
<p>Yurt for 4 from £95 per night</p>
<p>Bramblewood Yurt, near Bath</p>
<p>Bramblewood Yurt sits under a limestone rock face and has a cosy, ‘pull up a chair, have a drink and stay a while’ vibe that even crummy weather couldn’t hide. You can gather around the wood burner, sit in the rocking chairs listening to music on the stereo or read books on the sheepskin covered sofa. There’ll be no post-shower shivers or torch-lit trips to the loo here – the ensuite is rather special and has underfloor heating!</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £130 per night</p>
<p>Deers Leap Yurt, Holford, Somerset</p>
<p>The views from Deers Leap, over the trees and across rolling countryside and ancient woodland, are an ever-changing backdrop to a stay of beautiful peace and solitude. You might see deer in the woods as you lie out on the deck for an afternoon nap and, as the sun sets, you can watch the stars come out as you sit round the firebowl or swing in the hammock.</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £100 per night</p>
<p>River Yurt, Powys, Wales</p>
<p>The location could hardly be more idyllic: in the heart of the Dyfi forest, 25 mins off the tar road, in a beautiful buttercup-filled meadow high above a sparkling river. River Yurt is a light space and a roomy one, with two round windows and a transparent skylight above the white canvas walls. A comfy double bed beautifully handcrafted out of oak gathered on site and local larch is covered in sheepskins and plenty of cushions, making it perfect for lounging.</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £138 per night</p>
<p>Harvest Moon, Lydbury, Shropshire</p>
<p>Raised up on stilts overlooking one of the natural pools at Walcot Hall, Harvest Moon Yurt is built like a round Mongolian ger: wooden struts soaring to a high ceiling with a cupola, so you can wake with the sun, or a woolly alarm clock – the estate’s sheep often nibble the grass below. Up on the deck there’s no one to disturb, just a barbecue and a table for sitting with a pack of cards as you watch the light soften with the setting sun.</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £72 per night</p>
<p>Kinton Cloud House Yurt, Powys, Wales</p>
<p>Cloud-House is the original Mongolian term for yurt, although the original Mongolian yurt-dwellers would probably be utterly amazed at the canopy of rainbow colours you see as soon as you open the door to the Kinton Cloud-House; bright fabrics fill the ceiling and walls, while mountains of throws, decorative fleeces and authentic sheepskins ensure maximum cosiness.</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £77 per night</p>
<p>Inshriach Yurt, Highlands Yurts, Scotland</p>
<p>The yurt is a cosy space set in wonderful isolation on the hillside above the river Spey. Isolation is all part of being at Inshriach. You’re perfectly set up for forays into the Cairngorms, safe in the knowledge that a comfortable haven is yours to come back to but before bed, why not pop over to the owner’s gin distillery too.</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £72 per night</p>
<p>Burlingham Yurt, Norwich, Norfolk</p>
<p>This cosy yurt is perfectly positioned between the Broads in one direction, the coast in another and Norwich to the west. Not only are you the only people camping, or indeed staying here at all, but there is also a good distance between Burlingham and their nearest neighbours. This isolation means that the night sky is stunning. You can even remove the yurt’s central roofcap and watch the stars from bed.</p>
<p>Yurt for 2 from £95 per night</p>
<p>Sapperton Yurt, Stroud, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>Follow a winding farm track and a footpath across a meadow through 30 acres of ancient woodland to magical Sapperton Yurt. The spectacular yurt is a dream in cream canvas, a traditional Kyrgyz design handmade in Devon by Yurts for Life. Sink into the supremely comfortable double bed, lounge on the bean bags surrounded by rugs and throws in the cosy space warmed by the wood-burning stove.</p>
<p>Yurt for 4 from £115 per night

<p>Kate Wagner writes a cruel but hilarious post on her McMansion Hell website titled Coronagrifting: A Design Phenomenon, where she complained about &ldquo;cheap mockups of COVID-related design &lsquo;solutions&rsquo; filling the endlessly scrollable feeds of PR-beholden design websites.&rdquo; She also coins a great neologism that will outlive this virus: PR-chitecture, or &ldquo;architecture and design content that has been dreamed up from scratch to look good on Instagram feeds or, more simply, for clicks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought of this while I was reviewing a couple of designs from architects and industrial designers I have admired for years, and agree that some of the examples Wagner shows are ridiculous. But most of the ones we have shown are from reputable industrial designers like Mark Sanders with his DIY mask made out of a pop bottle, or instant hospitals from Broad Sustainable Buildings, a company that has been building instant buildings for a decade.</p>
<p>Another example of designers using their expertise appropriately is a proposal from Tye Farrow of Farrow Partners. Tye has been working in health care for years, doing huge hospital projects, most notably the Credit Valley Hospital (shown above), with its incredible lobby made of wooden &ldquo;trees.&rdquo; Tye knows this kind of design.</p>

<p>Farrow Partners have also been working with Grip Metal, a sort of metal Velcro developed by Nucap Technologies, which was developed for the auto industry to hold brake pads together, but works well for any material that is softer than the base metal used, first seen on TreeHugger in the Steam Canoe winter station from OCAD university.</p>

<p>Newcap and Farrow have been working together on a system where they press scraps of wood (like from shipping pallets) into blocks about the size of concrete masonry units, and then squeeze them together with Grip Metal as the velcro-like glue.</p>
<p>© Grip metal box via Farrow Partners © Grip metal box via Farrow Partners</p>
<p>They call it &ldquo;the Grip Timber Cross Laminated Block (GTCLB).&rdquo; It is built up with internal cavities for integrating electrical and mechanical systems. Farrow explains in a Daniels School press release:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, if you build a building, approximately 80 percent of the cost of the building is labour,&rdquo; Farrow says. &ldquo;With these wooden bricks, the skilled labour cost is brought down significantly. I could stack the walls myself. You can build something rapidly that&rsquo;s as strong as it would be if you were using concrete blocks, and it has the feel of a permanent building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>© Farrow Partners © Farrow Partners</p>
<p>Since they go up so quickly and easily, Farrow came up with a design for a quick-assembly hospital for COVID-19 care, called the &ldquo;Solace Rapid Assembly High Performance Covid-19 Inpatient Bed Solution.&rdquo; Farrow explains:</p>
<p>The Solace team observed that the rapid assembly Covid-19 hospital building solutions constructed to date globally – the UK ‘Nightingale hospitals’ constructed out of exhibition hall centre partition wall cubicles; the New York tented enclosed battle frontline field hospitals in Central Park; or Italian shipping container adapted inpatient room solutions – while good initial reactions to the problem at hand, naturally left room for reflection, lessons learned, and improvements towards the goal of achieving solutions which are “faster, cheaper, smarter, safer, more adaptable and importantly healthier – which cause health” – versus working against those that were doing the caring and healing.</p>
<p>Farrow has always been a promoter of biophilia and how buildings can help heal, an interior that &ldquo;causes health.&rdquo; No shipping containers or trailers here:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sitting in a black box is really bad for your health,&rdquo; Farrow says. &ldquo;There are studies that show if you take a patient that has had heart surgery, and you put them in an inpatient room that has a view of the sky, they heal faster, they use less medicine, they have better outcomes, and they have shorter stays in the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>© ICU room looking from bed/ Farrow Partners © ICU room looking from bed/ Farrow Partners</p>
<p>Patient rooms are 12 by 14 feet, which is enough that medical workers can move freely around a bed. Patients face into the middle so that they can see the staff and vice versa, and there is a carefully designed clerestory window that lets them catch a view of the sky.</p>
<p>© Unit layout of larger installation/ Farrow Partners © Unit layout of larger installation/ Farrow Partners</p>
<p>In the larger complexes, there is a &ldquo;logistics corridor that houses all mechanical, electrical and medical gases, the equivalent to a ‘vertical interstitial space’, allowing building plant staff to access and modify systems in the space without any interaction with the patient areas within the unit.&rdquo; Since the light is coming in from the clerestory skylights, the building can pack rooms in at pretty high density without a lot of exterior wall. &ldquo;Fresh air is fed from the public corridor side through HEPA filtration and exhausted in the logistics interstitial corridor, creating the negative pressure requirements to contain the airborne spread of the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>© Farrow Partners © Farrow Partners</p>
<p>There are a lot of advantages to this kind of system. Wood is a relatively good insulator and sound absorber, so it should be a comfortable space. When the crisis is over and the building is not needed for this purpose, the Grip Metal bricks can be pried apart like Lego and reassembled into another building of any kind. And they can be made into anything, according to Farrow in the Grip Metal press release.</p>
<p>“Interestingly the uptake isn’t only for the ICUs,” he says, “but in also helping solve some of the long-term-care home challenges.” The building block technology could also help provide affordable housing both in the city and in northern communities. “Northern First Nations communities that have a sawmill can now produce their own block, by simply buying the grip strips and having a press, and their communities can build their own homes.” He cites other ways that the block can help in rapidly deployable architecture: for instance, laneway houses that could be accessory dwelling units for elderly parents or children moving back home.</p>
<p>© Farrow Partners © Farrow Partners</p>
<p>So this raises the question: is every proposal that comes out in a pile of press releases, with no specific site or client, just Kate Wagner&rsquo;s PR-chitecture? Or is this an example of how every crisis is an opportunity to demonstrate new ways of doing things better? Perhaps it depends who is doing the proposing. Tye knows his health care, having &ldquo;initiated a global &lsquo;Cause Health&rsquo; movement aimed at raising expectations for design as the basis for total health, which extends beyond environmental sustainability and physical health to encompass our mind health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides running Farrow Partners, in his spare time Tye is in the process of obtaining a Master of Neuroscience applied to Architecture and Design degree from the University IUAV of Venice (Istituto Universitario di Architettura di Venezia), one of fifteen people from around the globe accepted into the program. He anticipates obtaining the degree in September 2020.</p>
<p>Tye Farrow knows hospitals and he knows wood. This is the real thing.

<p>Here at the Strategist, we know that finding the “best” product really depends on exactly who you ask — which is why we’ve devoted a new series to squeezing in as many informed, trustworthy opinions as possible. And we’ve come up with dozens of ways to do this, among them: surfacing reader reviews from across the internet, taking quick polls (among our most insane friends and fellow shopping-obsessed Strategist editors), and partaking in some advanced internet snooping.</p>
<p>With that, we’re rounding up the best desks, according to the people. Our recommendations range from a bamboo laptop desk beloved by the Strategist’s resident home-design writer to a direct-to-consumer standing desk with over 2,000 glowing reviews, and almost all are under $500.</p>
<p>Snooping: Best small desk used by a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist</p>
<p>Mercury Row Orion Console Table $198 $296 now 33% off $198 Just as most people reached the one-month mark of working from home during the coronavirus pandemic, Ashley Parker, a Pulitzer Prize–winning White House reporter for the Washington Post, took to Twitter looking for an in-stock desk. “I am losing my mind and don’t know how much longer I can work from my ‘left side of the bed’ home office,” she wrote. At just over 28-inches wide, complete with two drawers, her “gold standard” of small desks — the Dean Console by Safavieh — is sold out online, except at a couple of smaller sites. However, this desk from Mercury Row, which is available at several major retailers, is a pretty close dupe, down to the 28.3-inch width, double set of drawers, and comparable price tag. $198 at Wayfair Buy</p>
<p>Expert-Approved: Best standing desk according to chiropractors</p>
<p>Strategist Pick: Best Donald Judd–esque desk</p>
<p>Mid-Century Fold Out Desk $449 $449 When we realized that a small group of stylish people were building their own Donald Judd–inspired furniture, we also learned that there’s some Judd-esque pieces for sale at Urban Outfitters (of all places) — like this mid-century foldout desk, that does double as a storage space. The modular, minimal, wooden look is certainly Judd-ish, with some modern touches like a cord hole in the back and some hidden storage compartments. The desk is on pr-order right now until July 8, but if you can’t wait that long for a Judd-esque workspace, consider this pale wood table. $449 at Urban Outfitters Buy</p>
<p>Ask a Cool Person: Chris Black’s favorite desk</p>
<p>Steelcase Currency Author Desk $337 When he’s not working from bed, our resident taste-based expert Chris Black uses a simple, untreated wood desk that his friend built for him. However, if he were to buy something, Black recommends this (also extremely Judd-ish) desk from Steelcase, calling it “clean, simple, and well priced. You can fit storage underneath which is a bonus,” he adds. Like anyone with a penchant for the modular and minimal, Black suggests the winter on maple or white-toned option. $337 at Design Public Buy</p>
<p>Curbed Editors’ Choice: Best space-saving desk</p>
<p>The Container Store Driftwood &amp; Platinum Elfa Wall-Mounted Desk From $255 $364 now 30% off From $255 According to writers and editors at Curbed, another desk solution for small spaces is this wall-mounted Elfa pick, which includes three shelves. “Transform a small nook from wasted space to functional desk with this set that uses only one piece of track mounted to the wall,” explain the writers. Plus, on the Container Store’s website, the desk gets dozens of five-star reviews (with none under four stars), including one Manhattan-based customer who calls the purchase their “best decision ever,” adding that they can now study in their studio apartment instead of going to a cafe with enough space. From $255 at The Container Store Buy</p>
<p>People’s Choice: Best-rated desk according to Amazon reviews</p>
<p>Quick Pick: Best desk after a Strategist writer’s hour of research</p>
<p>People’s Choice: Best-rated desk according to Houzz reviewers</p>
<p>Monarch Specialties Metal Computer Desk $288 Most of the wares on interior-design aggregator Houzz only have a couple of reviews, which is why this computer desk from Monarch Specialties is such a standout — with nearly 100 four- and five-star reviews that praise its storage and open design. One independent business owner describes herself as “happy as a pig in mud,” thanks to the desk’s “highly functional storage space” for all of her papers. And if that’s not convincing enough, the computer desk is sold across several online sites, and it has excellent reviews on all of them. At Amazon, one customer says it’s a “super sturdy” desk with “so much top desk space.” It’s also available in a variety of finishes at Macy’s, K-Mart, and Overstock.com. $288 at Amazon Buy</p>
<p>The Verge Editors’ Choice: Best standing desk</p>
<p>Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk From $489 From $489 With over 2,000 reviews and an average rating of 4.8 out of 5 stars on Fully, a direct-to-consumer furniture company, thousands of customers appreciate this sustainably built, customizable standing desk for its sleek look and expert-approved ergonomic setup. “It is beautiful, extremely sturdy, and easy to move up and down,” says one grad student, who found the desk to be better for her back pain than biweekly visits to the chiropractor. Plus, four staffers at the Verge recommend the desk for working from home, including Nick Statt, who calls the Jarvis “far and away my best work-from-home purchase in years.” At just under $500, Statt adds that the desk is “rather pricey by desk standards, but cheap by standing desk standards,” especially for one that “looks great.” From $489 at Fully Buy</p>
<p>Strategist Readers’ Choice: Best (less expensive) standing desk</p>
<p>Quick Poll: Best desk according to my seven most design-minded friends</p>
<p>Snooping: Man Repeller founder Leandra Medine’s writing desk</p>
<p>Safavieh Chapman Desk $240 $240 A couple of years ago, Leandra Medine’s apartment was profiled in Architectural Digest, and when we snooped through her furniture, we learned that when she works from home, Medine writes at a red-trimmed Safavieh desk. Like the rest of her “very French, very eclectic” home décor, the desk is a mix of bright colors and modern design. Although Medine’s exact desk is out of stock online, a similar red-toned, crossed-leg pick is available at English Elm (and there’s another dupe in white at Crate &amp; Barrel). $240 at English Elm Buy</p>
<p>Ask a Cool Person: The favorite desk of a CEO (with good taste)</p>
<p>Jensen Desk $399 $399 When we explored the workspaces of creative and productive people, Emma Mcilroy, the CEO of Portland-based feminist clothing line Wildfang, says she gets the most work done at her West Elm Jensen Desk. “It’s kind of mid-century-inspired because I’m really into that era,” she says of the desk, which has a wooden A-frame base and sleek glass surface. $399 at West Elm Buy</p>
<p>People’s Choice: Best-rated corner desk at Wayfair, according to reviewers</p>
<p>Andover Mills Suri Corner Desk $170 $170 “For anyone (everyone?) trying to shoehorn a work-from-home situation into an already-full home, a corner desk will work wonders,” says lifestyle journalist and author of The Little Book of Living Small, Laura Fenton. This triangular Andover Mills desk has over 1,500 five-star reviewers on Wayfair, who vouch for its small but functional storage spaces. “The desktop is spacious enough to accommodate my two full-size computer monitors,” says one reviewer, and another adds, “I love the little shelves underneath to tuck away our small printer and books.” $170 at Wayfair Buy</p>
<p>Snooping: Vogue fashion director Virginia Smith’s desk</p>
<p>CB2 Drommen Desk $599 After combing through a recent Vogue article about five editors’ at-home desk setups, we learned that fashion director Virginia Smith lives “in fear of technology issues” while working from home, and this acacia-toned desk has enough surface space to fit her laptop, iPad, two phones, and some drawers for other tchotchkes — like Jao Refresher hand sanitizer. Although it’s on the pricier side, the Drommen Desk is a CB2 exclusive from German designer Jannis Ellenberger, whose work usually retails for much more. $599 at CB2 Buy</p>
<p>According to Reddit: Best gaming desk</p>
<p>Ikea Fredde Desk $299 Ikea desks are popular among gamers on Reddit: In the 2.2 million-member subreddit r/buildapc, a top discussion about the best gaming desks surfaces the word “Ikea” over 200 times. One member disputes the notion that Ikea desks aren’t built to last, writing that they’ve been using the desk since 2015 and that it’s “solid” and “will last for some time.” Another member says their Fredde “has lasted five years and is still going strong,” adding that it’s “great for gaming.” When compared to Ikea’s iconic gaming desk, the Jerker, the Fredde is described as “wider,” “shallower,” and “lighter,” with “appealing features” like additional shelving for monitors and subwoofers. One pleased gamer notes that the Fredde also has “cupholders, a top shelf for a printer, and disassembles easily if you are moving.” $299 at Ikea Buy</p>
<p>Strategist Pick: Our home-design writer’s favorite lap desk</p>
<p>HOMFA Bamboo Laptop Desk $50 $50 When Strategist writer (and our resident home-design expert) Lauren Ro isn’t writing at her vintage desk, she works from bed or the couch with this lap desk. “I wanted something that was sturdy and also looked nice, so I opted for this bamboo one with cutouts that help keep your laptop cool,” she says, adding “it also has a ton of neat features, like adjustable legs and a tabletop that can be tilted to a range of angles.” Much like Liz Carey’s lap desk (turned Fruit Loops-in-bed tray), Ro imagines that her bamboo desk would double as a great breakfast-in-bed tray. Strategist writer Tembe Denton Hurst also stands by her slightly less-expensive laptop tray, which has a convenient mini shelf and is big enough for a 17-inch laptop. $50 at Amazon Buy $50 at Amazon Buy</p>

<p>Routines have changed and you may have extra time on your hands to tackle your household to-do list — which might include anything from revamping your store of food containers to upgrading your furniture. Patio sets, bestselling home products, office furniture and more are seeing discounts of up to 75 percent off original prices — and we found some of the best stores to shop this weekend, given more broad sales categories. Finally, we highlighted the best furniture deals on popular items you won’t want to miss. As the weekend continues, we’ll keep refreshing the best Memorial Day sales and deals so keep an eye on those updates.</p>
<p>In this article</p>
<p>When is Memorial Day 2020?</p>
<p>Memorial Day was officially established in 1967 as a way to pay tribute to U.S. Armed Forces service members — unofficially, its roots go back to the Civil War. It also marks the unofficial beginning of summer, having become an American tradition rife with weekend travel and grilling-centric get togethers. This year, Memorial Day is on Monday, May 25, 2020. This means most ongoing sales will run through the end of Memorial Day Weekend, which begins on Friday, May 22.</p>
<p>How to shop Memorial Day furniture sales</p>
<p>Shopping Memorial Day sales will look different this year for several reasons, not least of which are stay-at-home orders, but you can still shop online — and still find substantial savings. According to DealNews.com, the large majority of Memorial Day sales last year came up within a week of Memorial Day Weekend — of course, this year’s realities mean it’s hard to foresee how things will shake out. Julie Ramhold, a consumer analyst for DealNews.com, told NBC News that popular stores like Lowe’s and The Home Depot will typically offer up to 40 percent off furniture, grills and outdoor items, whereas stores like Wayfair, Walmart and Overstock, among others, will run their own sales on patio sets, living room furniture and more.</p>
<p>Best Memorial Day 2020 sales</p>
<p>Below, we share some of the best Memorial Day sales to shop this year, listed alphabetically. We’ll keep updating this list in the weeks building up to Memorial Day Weekend.</p>
