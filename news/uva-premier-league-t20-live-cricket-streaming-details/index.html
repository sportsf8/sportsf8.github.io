Cricket Match Predictions: UVA T20 Premier League 2020 - Monaragala Hornets vs Wellawaya Vipers - Match 1</p>
<p>©UVA T20 Premier League 2020</p>
<p>The 1st match of the UVA T20 Premier League 2020 will be played between Monaragala Hornets and Wellawaya Vipers in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>That Tilakratne Dilshan has agreed to be a part of Monaragala Hornets will go a long way in increasing the popularity of the UVA T20 Premier League. The batsman is one of the most celebrated Sri Lankan players, particularly in white-ball cricket.</p>
<p>The opening batsman has had many great outings for the side but none more so than his utter dominance in the 2009 T20 World Cup where he played a major role in guiding Sri Lanka to the final. Unfortunately, the team lost to Pakistan by 8 wickets but the opener ended as the Player of the Series.</p>
<p>Dilshan struck 317 runs in the T20 WC, the most in the tournament, from 7 matches at an average of 52.83 and a strike rate of almost 145. He has given a lot to the game, including the the famed Dilscoop and his presence will mean a lot to the side.</p>
<p>Hornets&rsquo; wicketkeeper Ajith Ekanayake is 54 years old but the love for cricket has kept him going. The wicketkeeper has played 9 T20 matches and has the highest of 27*.</p>
<p>Sachithra Serasinghe has 41 wickets from 37 T20 matches and will be the leading bowler for the Monaragala Hornets. All-rounder Umesh Karunaratne is another player to look out for. He has played 19 T20 matches in which has scored 266 runs and picked up 16 wickets.</p>
<p>Their opponents, Wellawaya Vipers have Ajantha Mendis as their skipper. Mendis last played competitive cricket for the Sri Lanka Legends, alongside Dilshan and Tushara, as late as 10 March, 2020.</p>
<p>Mendis may have ceased to be effective in international cricket but his bagful of variations will still be too much to handle for the Monaragala Hornets batsmen.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at the squads of both teams:</p>
<p>Monaragala Hornets - Tilakratne Dilshan (C), Ajith Ekanayake (Wk), Kasun Senanayaka (Vc), Binura Fernando, Sriyaan Wijeratne, Chethan De Silva, Dhyan Ranatunga, Chamind Silva, Imesh Udayanga, Chaturanga Kumara, Pradeep Witharana, Nishan Mendis, Umesh Karunaratne, Mark Nawanjaya, Sachithra Serasinghe</p>
<p>Wellawaya Vipers - Ajantha Mendis (C), Rashmina Kesara, Lahiru Maduwantha, Chathura Manaranga, Sandun Dushmantha. Chandana Lakmal, Achintha Eranda, Adithya Siriwardhana (Wk), Anith Bandasa, Akila Dushyentha, Amila Senadeera, Amila Thusara, Anjana Lakshan, Pavan Edirisinghe (Vc), Gayan Chathurange</p>
