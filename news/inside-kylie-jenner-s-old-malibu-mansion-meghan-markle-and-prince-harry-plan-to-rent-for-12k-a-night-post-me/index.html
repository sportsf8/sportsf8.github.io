MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry are said to have their sights on renting a luxury £5.4million mansion in Malibu that previously was rented by Kylie Jenner.

Sources say the Duke and Duchess of Sussex 'plan to stay at the sprawling Petra Manor in California' as they choose somewhere to settle after leaving the royal family.

The “test-run” show-stopping home has a staggering eight bedrooms, ten bathrooms and even comes with its own pool, tennis court and cinema.

Currently Petra Manor costs around £12,224-a-night to rent, but it is ideally located, being around 30 miles from Meghan’s mum Doria Ragland.

The move would mean grandma Doria could spend more time with nine-month-old baby Archie.

The home is also ideally placed for the family trying to become financially independent from the royal family, thanks to being situated near to Silicon Valley and Hollywood.

Stanford is also close to Apple headquarters, where Prince Harry had been developing a new series with Oprah Winfrey.

Stay Awhile Villas owner Stuart Heller would not confirm if the royal couple have settled on the extravagant pad, which reality star Kylie rented during the summer of 2018.

Stuart told the DailyMail.com: “Stay Awhile Villas is often contacted by high profile families seeking to test neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles before making any move permanent.

“This is the perfect property for anyone wanting to move to the area and Harry and Meghan will want to see if Malibu suits their lifestyle.

“The house is a short term rental, many people come to Malibu looking for a home and they will rent somewhere first to see if it makes sense for them and their family.”

This comes as Meghan and Prince Harry did their last public engagement as royals at the Commonwealth Service in London yesterday.

From March 31, Prince Harry and Meghan will no longer use their HRH titles, and will aim to be financially independent as they split their time between the UK and North America.

The Italian-style mansion in LA is in a secure gated community, and has a host of glamorous features, including an extensive wine cellar.

The house offers the ex-Royals a good deal of privacy as it is tucked away from the main strip in Malibu, where the two could get dinner at Nobu or pick up food at the local Whole Foods.

It was previously owned by Baywatch star David Charvet and his wife, Brooke Burke, who built the pad in 2015.

The home has an airy open kitchen with two islands for Meghan to indulge in her love of cooking.

Attached to the first living room is the cinema, with sleek dark couches and a cozy fireplace.

The master bedroom has two sets of beautiful windowed doors that lead out to a balcony overlooking the property.

Completing the home are a massive outdoor pool, tennis court and basketball hoop, for Harry to possibly pass on his love of sport to son Archie.

It was Caitlyn Jenner who first broke the news that Meghan and Harry were looking at properties while appearing on Loose Women.

Caitlyn also threw her support behind Meghan during her appearance on the program.

She said: “It was a big shock to her, she’s probably had enough. Good for them, we’ll see how it goes.

“I heard they were looking for a house in Malibu. It must have been tough. Everyone deserves to be happy.”

Currently the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are staying with baby Archie in an £11m waterside mansion on Vancouver Island.
