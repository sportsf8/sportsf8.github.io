<p>Daughter of private who fought for both sides and had children in his 80s lived for years in a North Carolina nursing home</p>
<p>The last person to receive a US government pension from the American civil war has died.</p>
<p>Confederate statue to be removed from Virginia&rsquo;s Monument Avenue Read more</p>
<p>Irene Triplett was 90 when she died last Sunday in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Her father, Mose Triplett, fought for the Confederacy and the Union in the civil war, which began in 1861 and ended with the defeat of the slave power in 1865. He applied for his Union pension 20 years after the war and in 1930, when his daughter was born, he was 83.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, which spoke to Irene Triplett for a story in 2014, reported that she died “from complications following surgery for injuries from a fall, according to the nursing home where she lived”.</p>
<p>Dennis St Andrew, a commander of the North Carolina Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, told the Journal Triplett was “a part of history”.</p>
<p>“You’re talking to somebody whose father was in the civil war,” he said. “Which is mind-bending.”</p>
<p>But to Stephanie McCurry, a historian of the civil war and Reconstruction era at Columbia University in New York, Triplett’s death acquired a deeper resonance by occurring in the midst of national civil unrest over the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd, an African American man.</p>
<p>“Just like the Confederate monuments issue, which is blowing up right now, I think this is a reminder of the long reach of slavery, secession and the civil war,” she told the Washington Post. “It reminds you of the battle over slavery and its legitimacy in the United States.”</p>
<p>Each month, Triplett collected $73.13 from the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), a total of $877.56 a year. Her father earned the sum by defecting north in 1863 after missing the battle of Gettysburg, the turning point of the war.</p>
<p>“Pvt Triplett enlisted in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment in May 1862,” the Journal reported, citing Confederate records which showed he was then 16.</p>
<p>And Triplett “transferred to the 26th North Carolina Infantry Regiment early the following year”, “fell ill as his regiment marched north” then “ran away from the hospital … while his unit suffered devastating losses at Gettysburg”.</p>
<p>A deserter, Triplett “made his way to Tennessee and, in 1864, enlisted in … the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry”, Kirk’s Raiders, which “carried out a campaign of sabotage against Confederate targets”.</p>
<p>Mose Triplett was unsurprisingly not popular in post-war North Carolina but eventually, in 1924, still childless, he married a second time. He was nearly 80. His new wife, Elida Hall, was 34. As the Journal put it, “such an age difference wasn’t rare, especially during the Great Depression when civil war veterans found themselves with both a pension and a growing need for care.”</p>
<p>Triplett and Hall had five children but only two survived: Irene, who like her mother suffered from mental disabilities, and Everette, a son born when Mose Triplett was 87. As the Journal wrote in 2014, “Irene and Everette Triplett were born in tough country during tough times. The forested hills ran with white lightning from illegal stills. Ms Triplett said she didn’t drink moonshine, but she got hooked on tobacco in first grade.”</p>
<p>“I dipped snuff in school, and I chewed tobacco in school,” Triplett said then. “I raised homemade tobacco. I chewed that, too. I chewed it all.”</p>
<p>In 1938, aged 92, Mose Triplett attended a reunion at Gettysburg. In his remarks, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt referred to the Gettysburg Address, delivered in November 1863: “Lincoln spoke in solace for all who fought upon this field; and the years have laid their balm upon their wounds. Men who wore the blue and men who wore the gray are here together, a fragment spared by time.”</p>
<p>Newsreel footage posted to YouTube by CSPAN tells of “2,500 veterans, north and south”, black and white, marking “the 75th anniversary of America’s Armageddon”.</p>

<p>Housed in the Confederate camp, Triplett reportedly kept quiet about the double service that placed him in rarefied company. The Victorian journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley, for example, also fought for both sides.</p>

<p>Triplett died shortly afterwards. His gravestone, in Wilkes county, says only: “He was a civil war soldier.”</p>
<p>In 1943, Irene and her mother moved to the Wilkes county poor house. In 1960, they moved to a care home. Elida Hall died in 1967. Everette Triplett died in 1996. Irene lived on, her care paid for by Medicaid and the civil war pension.</p>
<p>The Journal reported that though Irene “saw little of her relatives … a pair of civil war buffs visited and sent her money to spend on Dr Pepper and chewing tobacco”.</p>
<p>Jamie Phillips, the home’s activities director, told the Post Triplett liked gospel music, cream cheese cheeseballs and laughing.</p>
<p>“A lot of people were interested in her story,” Phillips said, “but she’d always deflect the conversation to something different going on in the news.”

<p>On Sunday, Irene Triplett died at Accordius Health, a long-term-care facility in Wilkesboro, N.C., at the age of 90. A relative said she’d broken her hip a few days earlier and died of complications. She never married, and her only brother had died in 1996.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Triplett’s story is a powerful reminder that the Civil War wasn’t that long ago, said Columbia University historian Stephanie McCurry. “Just like the Confederate monuments issue, which is blowing up right now, I think this is a reminder of the long reach of slavery, secession and the Civil War,” she said. “It reminds you of the battle over slavery and its legitimacy in the United States.”</p>
<p>Many more widows and children of other long-ago soldiers are still alive. According to VA, there are 33 surviving spouses and 18 children receiving pension benefits related to the 1898 Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Triplett’s status as a Civil War pensioner began gaining attention in 2011, when the Wilkes Genealogical Society in Wilkes County, N.C., displayed her photograph on its quarterly publication and featured her in a story. The article noted she was one of only two people in the country still reaping a Civil War pension.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>One of the piece’s researchers, Jerry Orton, of Syracuse, N.Y., a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, first discovered that Triplett was earning the benefit in the late 1980s, after he’d embarked on a research project on surviving widows and children of Civil War soldiers. He’d gotten her name from the Veterans Administration. Eventually, he traveled to North Carolina and interviewed her about her life.</p>
<p>“Irene could not recall much of her childhood and has no recollection of Mose,” the historical society’s article said. “She has virtually no memories of fun, presents, friends, neighbors or such, as they lived so isolated, and she had to work on the farm each day, where they primarily raised chicken[s] and kept some hogs and cows as well.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In 2013, an Associated Press story reported that more than $40 billion a year was being spent to compensate veterans and survivors from the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan war. Then the wire service dropped this nugget: “The Civil War payments are going to two children of veterans — one in North Carolina and one in Tennessee — each for $876 per year.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But the AP story didn’t name Triplett or the Tennessee recipient. That’s when the tabloid Daily Mail got involved, identifying Triplett for the first time in a major news publication. The headline: “EXCLUSIVE: Revealed, America’s last living link to the Civil War.”</p>
<p>Relying partly on military records, Orton’s research for the genealogical society and an interview with her nephew, the Daily Mail piece included a photo of Triplett and painted a colorful portrait of her father: Mose first joined a Confederate regiment in North Carolina in 1862, then defected to the Union Army in 1864. He once held a rattlesnake around his neck and sported a Wyatt Earp-style mustache that extended below his chin. He sat on his porch and shot acorns out of trees.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The next year, the Wall Street Journal published its own story on Triplett, a lengthy front-pager that recounted how Mose chose to abandon the Confederacy at exactly the right time — just as he and his regiment were marching through the Shenandoah River Valley on their way to Gettysburg, Pa. The Journal noted that Mose went to a hospital in Danville, Va., with a fever and that state records said he “deserted” on June 26, 1863.</p>
<p>For his future daughter, the timing of his decision could not have been more significant. About a week later, of the 800 men in Mose’s Confederate regiment, 734 died at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Journal said.</p>
<p>On Aug. 1, 1864, Mose joined the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry, known as “Kirk’s Raiders,” a regiment that laid waste to Confederate depots, railroads and bridges.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Four months after the war ended in 1865, Mose was discharged, and he eventually moved back to his native North Carolina, settling on farmland in Wilkes County. Twenty years later, the Journal article said, he applied for his Civil War pension. He and his first wife, Mary, had no children.</p>
<p>After Mary died in the 1920s, Mose married Elida Hall. He was 78. She was 27. Their 1924 marriage, according to the Journal, was rough. They lost three babies. Then Irene was born on Jan. 9, 1930, but had mental disabilities, according to the newspaper. She was 8 when her father died on July 18, 1938, at the age of 92. His headstone reads: “He was a Civil War soldier.”</p>
<p>When the Journal interviewed Triplett, she said her teachers beat her with an oak paddle, and her parents also hit her.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Other children teased her about her father, “the traitor,” one of her relatives told the newspaper. She dropped out of sixth grade. According to the Journal, she and her mother lived for years in a county “poorhouse,” which was infested with rats and mice, before she and her mother later moved into a private nursing home.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“I didn’t care for neither one [of my parents], to tell you the truth about it,” she said. “I wanted to get away from both of them. I wanted to get me a house and crawl in it all by myself.”</p>
<p>After her mother died in 1967, Triplett eventually found her own friends at various nursing homes, especially at her most recent stay at Accordius Health. She chewed tobacco from her pouch of Star tobacco. She loved watching the news on television and reporting back to other residents about the latest goings-on.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Jamie Phillips, the home’s activities director, said she spent most days with her playing bingo and watching her use a red Solo cup as her spittoon. She loved gospel music. Listening to the Bill Withers song, “Lean on Me.” Cream cheese cheeseballs. Fried potatoes and onions. Fried chicken and pinto beans. Laughing. This is what she was known for.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Even if you tripped or dropped something, she’d laugh,” Phillips said. “She was set off by anything. I never saw her angry. Everything was funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if anyone asked her about her father or, in the aftermath of all the news stories, why she was getting a Civil War pension check, she’d demur. “A lot of people were interested in her story,” Phillips said, “but she’d always deflect the conversation to something different going on in the news.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thegreatcoursesdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Offense_thumb.jpg" alt="img">
The American Civil War—fought between the Federals, or Unions, who represented the North, and the Confederates, who formed the Southern Army—witnessed a number of attacks from either side, some more influential than others. One of the most important parts of the war was the Union’s offensive in the Western Theater, which went on to decide the outcome of the war.</p>
<p>The Confederates had to defend a large area in the West, from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River.

<p>There were a number of reasons for which the Western Theater was seen by soldiers and professionals as an area of tantamount importance, which would be integral in deciding the outcome of the war. It was a great area between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, where both sides had different, but significant vantage points. While the south had a significant amount of territory there, the Union had been able to establish excellent advances. There, the Confederates had an expansive network of railroads and internal lines that allowed them to progress and fall back as required. Meanwhile, the North had been able to mobilize large numbers with their troops in the West. Further, the Confederates in the West were led by Albert Sidney Johnston, who, being the ‘highest’ de facto ranking officer in the field, was able to lead their troops in the West under a unified overall command.</p>
<p>Of course, such an important battle had to be fought under able leadership, and both parties put their best men to the task.</p>
<p>The Leaders in the West</p>
<p>The importance of the battle in the Western Theater was reiterated by both parties when they put their most decorated, most essential men to the task. One of the men who led the North to its victory was the General-in-Chief, Winfield Scott. He was pivotal in a lot of strategic planning for the North, though he left the force in November 1861, after being plagued by some health problems, as well as by the defiant attitude of Major General George B. McClennan, who, interestingly, took up Scott’s command after he the latter retired.</p>
<p>Two men led commands for the Union under Scott: Henry Wager Halleck, and Don Carlos Buell.</p>
<p>The Union’s primary goals at the time were to identify major advance lines Southward through the west, pacify territories to their side, and take down the opposition’s strategic networks. There was also the political target to liberate Unionists, primarily those in East Tennessee.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Confederates in the West were led by the remarkable Albert Sidney Johnston, who was, at the time, touted to be the best soldier in the Confederates’ arsenal. The enormity of the expanse of territory covered by the Confederates, which in some ways also was their strength, now became a strategic nightmare, as they now needed to defend all that is, stretching from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>The Confederate Defense Structure in the West</p>
<p>The western frontier under Johnston’s command was vulnerable along four primary routes: the Mississippi River, the Tennessee River, the Cumberland River, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad; any of these could have proven viable for the Federals. In order to defend all four routes, Johnston deployed his troops along a great arc.</p>
<p>In a bid to protect the heart of Tennessee, the left flank was anchored at Columbus, Kentucky, a very strong, heavily fortified position. On a high strong point on the Mississippi river here, twelve thousand men were deployed. The troops at Columbus were commanded over by Episcopal Bishop Leonidas Polk, who, according to his own troops, was not a man of great military acumen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the right flank for Johnston’s formation was anchored on the Louis and Nashville Railroad at Bowling Green, Kentucky, where about 25,000 men were present.</p>
<p>Within the arch, there were a pair of forts intended to guard the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers: Fort Henry on the Tennessee, and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland. However, Johnston didn’t give too much of his attention to either, focusing instead on his flanks. Two final components of the Confederate forces in the west were a small army in Arkansas led by General Earl Van Dorn, and another small one, led by Officer Felix Zollicoffer, near the Cumberland gap.</p>

<p>The Great Union Offense</p>
<p>The offensive position taken by the Union in the Western Theater went on to become a pivotal point, as it would turn out to be the first successful major Union military operation during the war.</p>
<p>For their offense, both the leading commanders of Scott’s Union forces, Halleck and Buell, agreed that the weakest points in Johnston’s defense were through Fort Donelson on the Cumberland and Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. Incidentally, both the points fell in Halleck’s department, so it was he who formulated plans to not only take down these forts but also to cut the railroad that ran from Memphis to Bowling Green, thereby denying the Confederacy their precious interior lines.</p>
<p>Nashville, then a rail, manufacturing center, and supply center, was also noted as one of the key targets, as one of the most important cities in Tennessee at the time.</p>

<p>Early Union Victories</p>
<p>General Felix Zollicoffer became one of the Confederate’s early war heroes when he was martyred at the Battle of Mill Springs. (Unattributed/Public domain)</p>
<p>Before Halleck put his overall plan in motion, there were a few smaller-scale plans put to action. An important one of these was conducted by George H. Thomas, one of Buell’s important men, who, in January 1862, took down Felix Zollicoffer’s small Southern force at the Battle of Mill Springs, on the Cumberland River.</p>
<p>While this defeat marked the first crack in Albert Sidney Johnston’s western line by forcing the confederates to back away from eastern Kentucky, it also gave them an early war hero, as Zollicoffer was martyred in the battle.</p>
<p>Battles at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson</p>
<p>After a series of minor early victories, the Union set out to set Halleck’s plan in motion, for which the significant fighting would come at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. Ulysses S. Grant was selected to lead the forces ahead. Halleck needed to clean up Missouri to make it safer for the Union, after which he was to move into Confederacy territory along either of the three rivers. In Missouri, he gave Grant a force of about 15,000 men and instructed him to move up the Tennessee River towards Fort Henry.</p>
<p>Grant used Tennessee as his route, reaching Fort Henry first, which fell easily, as it was a weak establishment. He then proceeded to cut the railroad and focus his attention on Fort Donelson.</p>
<p>Although Donelson boasted of much more robust construction in comparison to Henry, it was still a vulnerable target, and Grant’s approach, combined with a series of serious mistakes on Johnston’s part meant that soon enough, Fort Donelson fell as well.</p>
<p>Fall of the Confederate forces</p>
<p>The fall of Fort Donelson was a momentous occasion: it led to the Fall of the Confederate forces in Nashville and subsequently culminated into the Confederate forces abandoning their entire line in the Western Theater. Their defeat forced them to retreat, and the Union gained control over several important parts of the West.</p>
<p>Johnston hailed as a super – soldier, had not lived up to the many expectations placed on him. He was criticized for his strategic miscalculations, as well as for under-utilizing the Confederacy’s internal lines, and for not concentrating his troops well enough.</p>
<p>He ended up losing 25 percent of his troops, and his entire defense. This battle, waged in the wee months of 1862, had brought great news for the Union, but the war was still ongoing, and both parties continued to fight on.</p>
