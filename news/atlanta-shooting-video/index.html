<p>The bureau initially said in a statement that witnesses described Mr. Brooks being shot “in the struggle over the Taser.” But on Saturday afternoon, after obtaining surveillance video from the restaurant and reviewing videos on social media, the bureau revised that account, saying it “was based on the officer’s body cam which was knocked off during the physical struggle, preventing the capture of the entire shooting incident.”</p>
<p>“During the chase, Mr. Brooks turned and pointed the Taser at the officer,” the bureau said, adding that “the officer fired his weapon, striking Brooks.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks was taken to a hospital, where he died after surgery, the authorities said. One officer was treated at a hospital for an injury and was later released.</p>
<p>L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer who was hired by the Brooks family, said repeatedly at a news conference Saturday night that a Taser was not considered a deadly weapon, and that there was no justification for the police to shoot Mr. Brooks just because he had one in his hands.</p>
<p>He also said that the police could have instead cornered Mr. Brooks and arrested him, instead of chasing him and shooting him. “His life was not in immediate harm when he fired that shot,” Mr. Stewart said of the officer.</p>
<p>He said the officers put on plastic gloves and picked up shell casings before rendering first aid to Mr. Brooks, and also did not check his pulse for more than two minutes after he was shot.</p>
<p>Mr. Brooks’s half-sister, Kiara Owens, 26, said in a phone interview that Mr. Brooks had been working a construction job and had five daughters, including two who were stepchildren, and a sixth daughter on the way. “All he wanted to do is work and come home to his kids,” she said. “The kids have been asking like, ‘Is Daddy coming home?’ And I can’t tell the kids nothing. I can’t tell them.”

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin linked the protests that erupted after the killing of George Floyd to “deep-rooted crises” in the United States that also led the “losing side” in the 2016 election to question the legitimacy of Donald Trump’s presidency, in the Kremlin leader’s first comments on anti-racist protests that have spread around the US and worldwide.</p>
<p>“I try very carefully to comment or better, not comment, on what is happening in the United States or other countries,” Putin said, according to an excerpt from an interview posted online by state television channel Rossiya 1 on Sunday.</p>
<p>“What happened there is a manifestation of some deep-rooted internal crises. In fact, we have been observing this for a long time now, from the moment the incumbent president came to power, when he obviously won in an absolutely democratic way, and the losing side came up with all sorts of tales in order to question his legitimacy,” Putin added.</p>
<p>In the interview, the Russian President’s first major media engagement since coronavirus hit Russia, Putin said the pandemic “highlighted more broad problems” in the US and added that he thinks “partisan interests put above those of the people” are the main problem in American politics.

This is a developing story</p>
<p>ATLANTA — Police now say that as many as seven people have been shot in one of Atlanta&rsquo;s busiest neighborhoods and two victims have died.</p>
<p>Atlanta Police said they were called to Mason Avenue NE to reports of five people shot. Police said that some of the victims were taken to the hospital by ambulance while others were taken by private vehicle.</p>
<p>However, police later confirmed their concern that there may have been even more victims. In an update late Saturday even, the police confirmed two more people have been shot. Of the total seven victims, two have also died.</p>
<p>Police said at least three of the victims have been stabilized though their exact condition hasn&rsquo;t been released. All five of the initial victims were said to be seriously injured at the time they were taken from the scene.</p>
<p>Since the shooting, police have identified a vehicle they believe is connected to the crime. Police believe someone in the vehicle fired several shots into a group of people and hit several of them.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about the shooting or the person behind it is asked to call Crime Stoppers Atlanta at 404-577-8477 (TIPS). Tipsters do not have to provide identifying information to be eligible for a reward of up to $2,000.
