<p>Mahler’s “Symphony of a Thousand” might not be a great idea. Schoenberg’s “Gurrelieder,” with 150 instrumentalists and even more singers? Ditto.</p>
<p>As the coronavirus pandemic endures, much of the attention in resuming the performing arts has been on the size and density of audiences. But symphony orchestras are often just as packed onstage as in their auditoriums. If concerts are to go forward with social distancing restrictions in place, they will have to include not just fewer listeners, but also fewer players.</p>
<p>What will those fewer players play? Chamber standbys, surely: the original 13-person “Appalachian Spring”; string-ensemble works like Barber’s Adagio and Tchaikovsky’s Serenade; Bach’s “Brandenburg” Concertos.</p>
<p>But what about more varied fare? Schott/EAM, a publisher of contemporary composers, recently posted an inspiring list of works from its catalog appropriate for social distancing. Universal Edition put out an intriguing selection of opera and symphonic reductions. In a livestreamed panel discussion on Thursday, several innovative chamber orchestras will share repertory ideas. We have followed their lead with our own playlist of pieces, old and new.

<h3 id="best-elgar-works-10-essential-pieces-by-the-great-composer">&ldquo;Best Elgar Works: 10 Essential Pieces By The Great Composer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Elgar_BestWorks_Facebookimage.jpg" alt="img">
Sir Edward Elgar (2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was one of the greatest British composers and one of the leading European composers of his generation. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. Elgar’s best works include the Enigma Variations, The Dream Of Gerontius, the Pomp and Circumstances Marches, concertos for violin and cello and two symphonies.</p>
<p>Elgar was largely self-taught as a musician and composer and felt himself to be an outsider, not only in musical circles dominated by academics, but also socially. He struggled to achieve success until his forties when, after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations, composed between October 1898 and February 1899, marked his breakthrough as a composer of national importance. His reputation was consolidated the following year with the oratorio The Dream Of Gerontius regarded as one of the greatest English choral pieces of all time. Elgar achieved even greater national recognition for his Pomp and Circumstance Marches – the first of these includes ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ which became an unofficial English national anthem. His last masterpiece was the Cello Concerto, completed in June 1919. After the death of his wife in 1920 he went into virtual retirement however he was working on a third symphony, a piano concerto and an opera when he died in 1934.</p>
<p>Listen to the best of Elgar on Apple Music and Spotify and scroll down to explore our selection of the best Elgar works.</p>
<p>Best Elgar Works: 10 Essential Pieces By The Great Composer</p>
<p>Salut d’Amour</p>
<p>Edward Elgar composed Salut d’Amour, one of his best-known works, in 1888 when he was romantically involved with Caroline Alice Roberts and he gave the piece to her as an engagement present. The dedication was in French: “à Carice” – “Carice” was a combination of his fiancée’s names, Caroline Alice, and the name given to their daughter born two years later.</p>
<p>Serenade For Strings</p>
<p>Elgar’s Serenade For Strings is a piece for string orchestra in three short movements and one of the composer’s best pieces. Written and first performed in 1892 it was dedicated to the organ builder and keen amateur musician Edward W Whinfield. It was reportedly the first of Elgar’s works which he professed himself satisfied. The work remains among the most frequently performed of all his music.</p>
<p>Enigma Variations</p>
<p>It was Elgar’s Enigma Variations, composed between October 1898 and February 1899, that catapulted the composer to international renown relatively late in life when he was in his early forties. The enigmatic theme is understood to be a famous melody that, if played along with the Enigma Variations, would fit perfectly and many suggestions have been made regarding the identity of the hidden theme. The best-known of the Variations is No. 9, ‘Nimrod’, a musical portrait of Elgar’s publisher and friend August Jaeger.</p>
<p>Sea Pictures</p>
<p>Sea Pictures is a song cycle consisting of five songs, based on five poems by different authors, about the sea, including one by Elgar’s wife Alice. Elgar composed Sea Pictures in 1899, following the success of his Enigma Variations, for the acclaimed contralto Clara Butt, who gave the premiere dressed as a mermaid! It is the only song cycle Elgar wrote for voice and orchestra.</p>
<p>The Dream Of Gerontius</p>
<p>The Dream Of Gerontius, composed in 1900, is widely regarded as Elgar’s finest choral work and some consider it his masterpiece. The work is based on a Victorian poem by Cardinal John Henry Newman which tells the story of the journey of a pious man’s soul from his deathbed to his judgment before God and settling into Purgatory. On the last page of the manuscript Elgar wrote “this is the best of me” and the work is considered to be one of the greatest Oratorios.</p>
<p>Pomp and Circumstance Marches</p>
<p>The Pomp and Circumstance Marches are a series of five marches (a sixth was intended but never completed) for orchestra composed between 1901 and 1930. The marches were composed over a period of almost thirty years and include some of Elgar’s best-known works. Each march is dedicated to a particularly close friend. The first in the set, in D major, is the most famous and includes ‘Land of Hope and Glory’ which became an unofficial English national anthem.</p>
<p>Symphony No. 1</p>
<p>Elgar’s Symphony No. 1 in Ab major was hailed as the best British symphony ever written when it debuted in 1908. The symphony was an immediate success and nearly 100 performances were given around the world within a year. Symphony No. 1 remains a standard of the classical repertoire and is still performed regularly today. Elgar explained, “The is no programme beyond a wide experience of human life with a great charity (love) and a massive hope in the future.”</p>
<p>Violin Concerto</p>
<p>Elgar’s Violin Concerto, one of his best works, was composed for the violinist Fritz Kreisler, regarded as one of the greatest violinists of all time. Kreisler gave the premiere, which Elgar conducted, in London in 1910. Elgar was a severe self-critic but thought very highly of this work and admitted, “It’s good! Awfully emotional! Too emotional, but I love it.” The concerto is dedicated to Kreisler but Elgar wrote an inscription in Spanish, “Aqui está encerrada el alma de …..” (“Herein is enshrined the soul of …..”), a quotation from the novel Gil Blas by Alain-René Lesage, and several names have been proposed to match the mysterious inscription.</p>
<p>Symphony No. 2</p>
<p>Elgar’s Symphony No. 2, completed in 1911, was officially dedicated to the memory of King Edward VII, who had died in May 1910, but many scholars believe his close friend Alice Stuart Wortley, with whom he was rumoured to have a romantic liaison, was the inspiration. Although relatively well received Symphony No. 2 lacked the immediate success of earlier works and Elgar complained the audience “sat there like stuffed pigs”. It was not until after the First World War that Symphony No. 2 was fully appreciated and it is now acclaimed at least as much as his First Symphony.</p>
<p>Cello Concerto</p>
<p>Edward Elgar composed his Cello Concerto in E minor, one of his best works, in the aftermath of the First World War and a deep feeling of melancholy pervades the work. The first performance of Elgar’s Cello Concerto in 1919, under the composer’s baton with Felix Salmond as soloist, was a disaster because of inadequate rehearsal time. The work did not achieve wide popularity until the 1960s when Jacqueline du Pré’s recording of Elgar’s melancholy masterpiece caught the public imagination. The Cello Concerto was Elgar’s last major work and in the remaining 15 years of his life he wrote very little.</p>
<p>Recommended Recording</p>
<p>Sheku Kanneh-Mason was inspired to learn the cello after hearing Jacqueline du Pré’s recording of Elgar’s Cello Concerto when he was a child. His latest album Elgar features Elgar’s Cello Concerto, recorded at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Simon Rattle, and ‘Nimrod’ from Elgar’s Enigma Variations.</p>

click to enlarge Photo courtesy Illinois Symphony Orchestra. Roy Meyer, concertmaster, performed the first “Sunday at Six” concert from his Chicago apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previous to the pandemic, things had been looking good and positive,&rdquo; said Illinois Symphony Orchestra executive director Trevor Orthmann, during a phone conversation last week. &ldquo;We had great concerts up until February – the season was going well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the ISO was faced with having to cancel 2020&rsquo;s final two performances – and all other programs, including the popular Concert For Kids, which had been set for April – in compliance with federal and state pandemic guidelines. The ISO found itself with a problem now common to arts organizations but never previously imagined: how to keep their mission – and the music – alive while shorn of the ability to safely assemble audiences, let alone musicians, for traditional live performances.</p>
<p>A quick visit to the ISO&rsquo;s &ldquo;Symphony Channel&rdquo; on YouTube reveals several videos made and posted by individual members of the orchestra since the lockdown began. While these are enjoyable showcases, Orthmann, ISO music director Ken Lam and director of marketing Beth Wakefield hatched a plan for something a little more ambitious and engaging – a series of live performances to be streamed each week via YouTube. The &ldquo;Sunday at Six Recital Series&rdquo; debuted on Sunday, May 31, with an hour-long concert by ISO Concertmaster Roy Meyer from his Chicago apartment, featuring works of Bach, Dvorak and others.</p>
<p>Lam, who is finishing out his third season with the ISO, says he was drawn to Springfield, not only by the orchestra, but also by the community. &ldquo;Here and in Bloomington-Normal as well, we have many people who feel strongly about the community having access to the arts.&rdquo; He describes the sense of camaraderie and togetherness involved in coming together to rehearse and perform. &ldquo;We look forward to meeting nine times a year to make music for the community,&rdquo; he said. Of course, for now that is impossible. &ldquo;The funny thing with this pandemic is we are having to think of new ways to reach out to our audiences,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very interesting time. Our symphony&rsquo;s season motto is &lsquo;Life Music.&rsquo; The thing is, the audience is part of the performance just as much as the people onstage – same in the theater, same in the concert hall. Music is not like a painting that stays there forever. You make music and then it&rsquo;s gone, so you have to be there for the moment. When you have that experience, you literally bring people together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One initiative Maestro Lam is excited about, which will be happening within a few weeks, is the previously announced merging of the ISO with the Sangamon Valley Youth Orchestra. &ldquo;This is the third youth orchestra I&rsquo;ve merged as a conductor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and each time the synergy was just amazing. I&rsquo;ve been reaching out to this youth orchestra since the first day I started in Springfield. As one organization, we will be able to share resources and give opportunities to the students much more readily.&rdquo; He described a similar program he was involved with in Charleston, South Carolina, which increased enrollment from 40 or 50 students to120 within two years. &ldquo;With the right leadership and consistent support, I think this program can grow and reach new heights,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the changes wrought by the pandemic, Lam said that one thing he is thankful for is that, despite the cancellations, the board elected to continue to partially pay the ISO&rsquo;s musicians. &ldquo;It was just a wonderful gesture. It shows the commitment of the board to the orchestra and the musicians.&rdquo; The idea of doing videos and streaming concerts was largely born from this financial decision. Though it is hard not to long for the days of live audiences and communal rehearsals and performance, the approach does have its unique rewards. &ldquo;The audience at home sees another side of the musician, a more human side,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of our musicians are technologically advanced because they are of that generation – they are in their 20s and have probably been doing livestream videos for a long time already. Looking forward, Lam says that ideas are being considered for video and streaming in the future, even into the fall season. &ldquo;If the halls are open and we are allowed to have a social-distanced concert or something, the question is, would our patrons be comfortable doing that? And who knows what&rsquo;s going to happen in two months&rsquo; time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to get back to live performances as soon as we possibly can,&rdquo; said Trevor Orthmann. &ldquo;Just as long as it will be safe for the audiences as well as the musicians – it&rsquo;s weighing all of those things and making decisions.&rdquo; He says there is a possibility being discussed for the ISO to perform a small live outdoor performance &ldquo;probably of a small ensemble or an individual musician&rdquo; – at the end of August or early September. Whether this will be the beginning of a &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; or just a way to keep the symphony visible to the community as things continue to evolve remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Sunday at Six</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Sunday at Six&rdquo; series began this past Sunday, May 31, with a performance by Roy Meyer, who has been concertmaster for the ISO since 2015. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a great few weeks preparing for this concert. I had been fairly stagnant for a while and this motivated me,&rdquo; he said at the top of the performance, which is available to view in its entirety on YouTube.</p>
<p>Meyer explained that the recital would be relatively brief (&ldquo;I think everybody&rsquo;s attention spans have changed a little bit.&quot;) and that he would be concentrating on multiple movements from a few pieces rather than any complete works. The show began with a solo violin performance of Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sonata No. 1 in G minor&rdquo; (adagio and fugue) followed by &ldquo;Sicilienne Opus 78&rdquo; by Faure, which was written in 1893 for Maurice Maeterlinck&rsquo;s play, Pelléas et Mélisande and was described by Meyer as drawing on themes of creation and destruction, &ldquo;which feels like something we might be going through a little bit right now.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the first attempt at this piece – on which the soloist enhanced the performance with an accompaniment app – was interrupted by an emergency alert on Meyer&rsquo;s phone regarding a Chicago transit shutdown due to protests. This was the only technical glitch of the evening and was soon remedied. Meyer successfully performed the Faure piece after only a short delay.</p>
<p>The next selection was the first and third movements of Vivaldi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Concerto in G minor,&rdquo; which Meyer described as being familiar to him from the cradle. In addition to playing the solo portion live, Meyer had also recorded the first and second violin parts, the viola part and the cello part, effectively transforming himself into a one-man quintet. The concert concluded with two live violin duets with Meyer&rsquo;s girlfriend, Maya, who accompanied him on short pieces by Bach and Dvorak.</p>
<p>Overall, the first &ldquo;Sunday at Six&rdquo; was an intimate and casually beautiful musical experience, with fine performances, tasteful selections and unique technological assists to keep things interesting. It may not be a perfect substitute for a concert experience, but it will do for now.</p>
<p>Upcoming with the Illinois Symphony</p>
<p>The schedule of upcoming &ldquo;Sunday at Six&rdquo; concerts will include ISO&rsquo;s principal flute Kim Risinger with Angelo Favis on guitar (June 7); the ISO Percussion Ensemble (June 14); ISO principal horn Brian Goodwin (June 21); and will conclude on June 28 with ISO principal harp Eleanor Kirk, followed by an online version of the Illinois Symphony Orchestra&rsquo;s annual fundraising gala. Full details on the series are available at ilsymphony.org.</p>

<h3 id="conducting-electricity-finding-strength-in-classical-music">&ldquo;Conducting Electricity: Finding strength in classical music&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jacksonville.com/storyimage/LK/20200531/ENTERTAINMENT/200539827/AR/0/AR-200539827.jpg" alt="img">
The Jacksonville Symphony’s Courtney Lewis says that, in trying times like these, we can all find strength and solace in the works of the masters.</p>
<p>A friend recently asked me what symphonic music I think feels of the moment, what music feels like now, as we adjust to a new normal of social distancing and uncertainty. I often use music to change my mood, so I immediately began to list pieces that feel optimistic and joyful, the opposite of the way many of us have been feeling under lockdown. But one of music’s greatest gifts is the solace it can offer when we listen to something that sounds like our feelings, be they contemplative, grief-stricken, lonely or ambivalent.</p>
<p>In times of grief, two pieces of music have offered me strength. The first isn’t symphonic, but choral: Rachmaninoff’s Vespers. In just over an hour, Rachmaninoff mixes together ancient Greek and Russian chants in a glorious tapestry of unaccompanied song. There is something comforting in the music’s timeless and otherworldly qualities. Over a hundred years earlier, Beethoven penned his greatest symphonic ode to human mortality in the slow movement of the Eroica, his Third Symphony. This second movement is entitled ‘Funeral March’, and in it Beethoven confronts the searing agony of loss while celebrating the noble and indomitable nature of the human spirit.</p>

<p>For many people living alone, quarantine has been a time of loneliness. No music sounds more lonely than the solo piano that begins the second movement of Mozart’s great A major Piano Concerto, K. 488. Mozart presents us with someone searching for meaning in emptiness. After the piano’s solitary entry, the orchestra responds with paragraphs of keening canons: forlorn voices in the night.</p>
<p>Sibelius’ Seventh and Vaughan Williams’ Fifth symphonies both offer space for contemplation and optimism. Sibelius’ is the more severe piece, beginning with an uncompromising timpani stroke and an ominous rising scale in the strings. It’s a short symphony, but it feels like the longest 20 minutes in music: a great biography charting a life’s challenges and triumphs. We leave it with a renewed sense of strength. Vaughan Williams’s Fifth was dedicated to Sibelius. The Englishman admired the Finn’s technique of seamlessly moving between different moods and tempi. The Fifth offers more instant gratification than anything else on this list; it takes us into a world of pastoral balm, of heartfelt expression and bigness of spirit. I’ve found myself listening to it rather a lot over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Perhaps uncertainty is the most striking characteristic of today’s world. I often think that it’s one of the most powerful forces in the music of our time, too. Mozart and Beethoven’s music reflects the decorative values and relative certainties of their societies, just as Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring channels the destructive forces that were welling up at the beginning of the 20th century. For me, the music of today needs to reflect the vast ambiguities and complexities of modern life, the loneliness of the great city, the rejection of the dogmas of the past, the impossible complexity of global politics, the pressure on the individual to make sense of it all. Thomas Ad�s’s incredible score Tevot seems to grapple with all this. Tevot is the Hebrew word for &ldquo;arc,“ and the piece is just that: a vessel carrying us across troubled waters. Written for a huge orchestra (we had planned to end our season with it in June), it tells a redemptive story starting with shimmering harmonics high in the strings, moving through turbulent storms during which we feel as if we might be sucked down the plughole, before finding a calm resolution in music of heartbreaking beauty.</p>
<p>At some point in the not-so-distant future we will emerge from the grip of the pandemic, and it will be a time of great joy. I know of no music that expresses joy in such an irrepressible way as the finale of Mahler’s Fifth Symphony. The symphony is an enormous journey from darkness to light, from a funeral march to an ecstatic dance. In the months before he wrote it, Mahler had discovered Bach, falling in love with the master’s way of writing densely for all the instruments together (what we call “counterpoint.”) By the movement’s conclusion we feel as if all creation is jumping for joy. It’s absolutely guaranteed to quicken your pulse and put a smile on your face!</p>

<h3 id="classical-music-101-all-about-formats">&ldquo;Classical Music 101: All About Formats&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/sites/ipr/files/styles/medium/public/202006/janine_jansen_new_york_phil.jpg" alt="img">
Classical music can feel daunting to dig into if you’ve not had a lot of exposure to the genre or didn’t grow up playing an instrument. There are lots of terms, styles, composers, and performers, and if you are unfamiliar, it can feel tough to break in. Since schools adjourned due to the pandemic, we’ve been working to create resources for learners of all ages. This summer, we’re going to dig into classical music for the non-classical listener.</p>
<p>Here are ten common formats of classical works and well known examples of each.</p>
<p>Ballet - The Nutcracker Op. 71, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</p>
<p>Ballets are large scale performances with instrumental accompaniment and are focused on dancing. The dance is precisely choreographed and used to portray anything from a story or a specific emotion without the use of voices or libretto (lyrical text). Ballets are seen in all kinds of sizes and can range from big opera-like productions with costumes and staging like The Nutcracker, to a single dancer with single instrument accompaniment.</p>
<p>Cantata - Carmina Burana, Carl Orff</p>
<p>Cantata is an Italian word that translates in English to “sung” or in this case, “a piece that is sung.” Cantatas are very similar to oratorios, but they more loosely defined and don’t have to be religious in nature. They are typically performed on a much smaller scale by a small ensemble in a church setting or something similar. Carmina Burana is a larger scale, secular (non-religious) piece that has shown up in many instances of popular culture and is most recognized by its opening movement “O Fortuna.”</p>
<p>Chamber Music - String Quartet No. 12 Op. 96 - Antonin Dvorak</p>
<p>Chamber pieces are usually performed by small ensembles such as duos, trios, quartets, quintets, and so on. They only have one instrument to a part and are usually not heard in a concert hall, but at an event like a house concert or a lobby performance. One of the more common ensembles is the string quartet made up of violin I, violin II, viola, and cello. String Quartet No. 12 from Antonin Dvorak is a wonderful example and was actually written in Spillville.</p>
<p>Concerto - Piano Concerto No. 2 Op. 18 in C Minor, Sergei Rachmoninoff</p>
<p>A concerto is an ensemble piece that features a single soloist throughout and usually consists of three movements. Concertos typically have a large scale accompaniment like an orchestra, but they many have been written or rearranged to be just piano or something of a smaller scale. Though not strictly a concerto feature, concertos often have longer solo sections known as cadenzas. Cadenzas are typically written by the composer, but they are very fluid and can be improvised or even replaced by a different composer’s cadenza. Rachmoninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 in C Minor is a great example, and this piece has a cadenza in its beautiful second movement.</p>
<p>Mass - Requiem in D Minor K. 626, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</p>
<p>A mass is a format of music originally sung at church services, and a mass normally contains five parts known as the &ldquo;Kyrie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gloria,&rdquo; &ldquo;Credo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sanctus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Agnus Dei.&rdquo; A Mass is usually quite long, but it isn’t uncommon to perform one of these parts in church today. Within the last two centuries many composers wrote Masses as long form concert pieces instead of writing them for church services. Requiem in D Minor is a funeral Mass and the last piece Mozart composed. While writing it he began to believe it was for himself and passed away leaving it unfinished.</p>
<p>Opera - The Barber of Seville, Gioachino Rossini</p>
<p>Operas are large scale performances made up of two to five acts. They feature an orchestra, a large group of singers that perform in lyrical solos (known as an Aria), and vocal ensembles. Operas are character focused stories that have full staging and costumes and are very expensive to produce. The Barber of Seville by Rossini is one of the most popular, and its overture has been featured in many pop culture instances, including a famous Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd short.</p>
<p>Oratorio - The Messiah, George Frideric Handel</p>
<p>Oratorios sit somewhere between an opera and a cantata. They are larger than cantatas and closer to an opera in style, but they focus on religious stories. Handel’s Messiah is probably the best known oratorio, particularly the piece towards the end, “Hallelujah Chorus.”</p>
<p>Sonata - Piano Sonata No. 2 in B Flat minor Op. 35, Frederic Chopin</p>
<p>If Cantata is “a piece that is sung” the opposite would be a Sonata, or “a piece that is played.” Sonatas are small scale works that typically have a soloist, and sometimes a piano accompaniment. They have several movements, but at least one of those movements (typically the first, last, or both) have to be in sonata form. Sonata form has three parts to establish key relationships: the exposition, development, and recapitulation. Symphonies and concertos typically also have movements in sonata form. Chopin wrote a lot of piano sonatas, and the second movement of his Sonata No. 2 in B Flat Minor is an extremely well known funeral march.</p>
<p>Suite - Cello Suite No. 1 in G, Johann Sebastian Bach</p>
<p>A suite is a set of connecting pieces that are typically dances and are occasionally preceded by a prelude. Unlike a ballet, these dances are not choreographed but set a beat for people to dance to at a party setting. Bach wrote a large number of these including Cello Suite No. 1 In G whose prelude is heard all over modern pop culture.</p>
<p>Symphony - Symphony No. 5 Op. 67, Ludwig Van Beethoven</p>
<p>Symphonies are large scale classical works featuring a full symphony orchestra. They typically have four movements, one of which is in sonata form. Symphonies make up some of the most famous classical pieces. One of the best known is Beethoven’s 5th Symphony. It opens with one of the most well known themes in all of music history, and has been featured in pop culture countless times.</p>
<p>These examples only scratches the surface, and there are lots of other genres and even subgenres within these examples to explore. Next week, we&rsquo;ll learn about a few well known composers.

<p><img src="http://indepth.ideastream.org/the-six--or-more--degrees-of-separation/assets/BgAGnp3S9l/beethoven-bourdelle-2560x2868.jpeg" alt="img">
Ludwig van Beethoven broke new musical ground, particularly in the areas of instrumental music. During his early, formative years in Vienna, he studied composition with Joseph Haydn. Haydn is often called the “father of the symphony” and the “father of the string quartet.” It is in precisely these two genres where we find Beethoven’s deepest influence.</p>
<p>In the Classical period (1750-1820), concert-goers didn’t pack the halls to hear the latest symphony. Audiences wanted to hear arias from their favorite operas performed by the hottest stars of the day. Vocal virtuosity sold tickets. The symphony, often performed as separate movements, acted as a sort of musical sorbet between courses of vocal numbers. Coinciding with the proliferation of high-quality, professional orchestras, we start to see not only the symphony performed as a single composition, but also as a vehicle for the highest of musical and human ideals. This approach anticipates the symphonies of Johannes Brahms and later, Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner.</p>
<p>Beethoven, through his symphonies, expanded the symphonic form to include societal ideals as well. We see an excellent example of this in his third symphony, Eroica (“Heroic”). He originally dedicated the work to Napoleon Bonaparte because Bonaparte embodied the ideals of the French Revolution of democracy and anti-monarchy. However, when Napoleon declared himself emperor in May of 1804, Beethoven flew into a fit of rage and exclaimed, “So he is no more than a common mortal! Now, too, he will tread under foot all the rights of Man, indulge only his ambition; now he will think himself superior to all men, become a tyrant!” Beethoven tore the title page of the score in half, scratched out the dedication to Napoleon, and the work was eventually published as “Heroic Symphony, Composed to celebrate the memory of a great man.”</p>
<p>Title page to the manuscript of Eroica with the dedication to Napoleon scratched out. Title page to the manuscript of Eroica with the dedication to Napoleon scratched out.</p>
<p>The string quartet as a genre exists today thanks to the efforts of Joseph Haydn. The combination of two violins, viola, and cello existed long before him, but treating them as equal voices and capable of “high art” music can be traced to him.</p>
<p>In the hands of Beethoven, Haydn’s pupil, the genre developed in an experimental direction with all tradition of form thrown out the window by the end. Particularly in the late quartets, he pushed the limits of harmonic and personal expression.</p>
<p>Not only did Beethoven break tradition and new ground with his symphonies and quartets, his music gave license to others to question musical dogma. Who says you can’t add voices to a symphony? Why can’t we plumb the depths of human expression outside of opera? Beethoven can be viewed as a “composer of music” and a “composer of ideas” and it’s through this lens that we look at Beethoven’s legacy.

<h3 id="the-most-difficult-movement-to-start-conducting">&ldquo;The most difficult movement to start conducting&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://slippedisc.com/wp-content/themes/bridge/img/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Welcome to the 79th work in the Slipped Disc/Idagio Beethoven Edition</p>
<p>Seventh symphony, opus 92 (part 2)</p>
<p>In continuing our discussion of this under-discussed work, I asked Leonard Slatkin to explain it from the conductor’s viewpoint. Leonard is former music director in St Louis, London, Washington DC, Lyon and Detroit.</p>
<p>What the Seventh Tells Us</p>
<p>By Leonard Slatkin</p>
<p>Ask any conductor what the first Beethoven Symphony they ever led was, and the response is more than likely to be the Seventh. Why is that?</p>
<p>In many ways, this is the least difficult technically to direct. Other than the transition into the Allegro of the first movement and figuring out what to do about the tempo of the trio, the physical act of conducting is not nearly as complicated as in the other works. Even many of the decisions regarding phrasing are fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>What makes a good performance of this work has to do with how the myriad details are presented. Even more important, as with virtually all symphonies, is the ability for the conductor to give each movement a well thought out sense of the architecture. Has the journey felt complete?</p>
<p>The choices about length of notes, articulation and balance are critical to make a really outstanding performance. Even the first chord is up for grabs. Is it short and aggressive or longer and noble? In the introduction, can we always sustain the main tune with all those semi-quavers going on at the same time? Is the upbeat to the Allegro in the tempo of the introduction or the same as what occurs next?</p>
<p>The main body of the movement has one of Beethoven’s trickiest rhythms to bring off successfully. It is usually notated as a quaver, followed by a semi-quaver rest and then another quaver in the 6/8 meter. This is same rhythm that the timpani plays in the Scherzo of the Ninth. In fact, I always tell the orchestra to think of that instrument in order to play it correctly. Just think tim-pani, tim-pani and you will get the idea.</p>
<p>There is always controversy about the tempo of the 2nd movement. Notice that I did not call it the slow movement. After all, it is marked Allegretto. Every conductor I know has struggled with this and changed their minds over and over. George Szell called this, along with the 2nd movement of the Schubert Ninth, the two most difficult pieces to start conducting. There was a time when it was performed regularly as a funereal work, even today sometimes played as a memorial. Current thinking has moved most interpreters to a more forward moving tempo, but there still needs to be dignity.</p>
<p>What to do about those repeats in the Scherzo? Again, each of us changes our mind as we want to be faithful to what Beethoven wrote. but it can sometimes be a bit boring to perform the same music three times. And the equivalent problem pops up again in the Finale. The metronome marking is on the fast side and once in a while we are confronted with the possible lack of technical finesse to make it work with some orchestras. Plus, the acoustics of the environment can also force us into a compromise as regards the speed.</p>
<p>I will not get into matters of adjusting for balances, where the winds and strings need to take breaths, or how loud the triple fortes really should be. This is the first time the composer utilized that dynamic. Therefore, should all the double fortes that precede it be of lesser volume? Choices, choices, choices.</p>
<p>My selections for “best” recordings are incomplete by necessity. I have not heard every performance so more than likely left many behind. But the ones that I chose are those that caught my attention and made me want to hear them again. If you want to know my own personal taste in this masterpiece, you would have to obtain the recording I made with the Detroit Symphony (not on Idagio or Youtube). Does it match up to the ones I selected. No. But it is not bad.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for that, Leonard. Before we move into a consideration tomorrow of the outstanding records of all time, here are a couple of nuggest from the Idagio archives.</p>
<p>Richard Strauss conducting the finale in Berlin, 1922, with astonishing poise and momentum.</p>
<p>Willem Mengelberg in Amsterdam, 1940, immeasurably individualist, uncontainably awkward.</p>
<p>George Szell‘s earlier recording, in 1943, with a New York Philharmonic trained to within an inch of their lives. Quite horrible at times.</p>
<p>King Frederick of Denmark, who conducted like … a king.</p>
<p>And this absolute rarity: Herbert von Karajan conducting the opera orchestra in Berlin in 1941, a time that Wilhelm Furtwängler was using all his influence with the Nazis to get the young contender on a train out of town, preferably to somewhere near a war front. Karajan directs this symphony with panache bordering on insouciance, as if he hadn’t a care in the world. The performance exists almost out of time. Where, with Furtwängler, you cannot fail to be aware there’s a war going on, with Karajan this could be a stroll with a girlfriend in the park. The second movement is romantic, never ominous, and the finale is magnificence itself. You wll come away from this thinking better of Karajan. Myself, I’d recommend this as his most personal, most polished, Beethoven recording.</p>
<p>More tomorrow.
