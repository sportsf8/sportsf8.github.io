<p>“Count all people, including babies,” the U.S. Census Bureau instructs Americans on the questionnaire that will be mailed to every household by April 1, 2020, April Fool’s Day, which also happens to be National Census Day (and has been since 1930). You can answer the door; you can answer by mail; for the first time, you can answer online.</p>
<p>People have been counting people for thousands of years. Count everyone, beginning with babies who have teeth, decreed census-takers in China in the first millennium B.C.E., under the Zhou dynasty. “Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls,” God commands Moses in the Book of Numbers, describing a census, taken around 1500 B.C.E., that counted only men “twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel”—that is, potential conscripts.</p>
<p>Ancient rulers took censuses to measure and gather their strength: to muster armies and levy taxes. Who got counted depended on the purpose of the census. In the United States, which counts “the whole number of persons in each state,” the chief purpose of the census is to apportion representation in Congress. In 2018, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross sought to add a question to the 2020 U.S. census that would have read, “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” Ross is a banker who specialized in bankruptcy before joining the Trump Administration; earlier, he had handled cases involving the insolvency of Donald Trump’s casinos. The Census Bureau objected to the question Ross proposed. Eighteen states, the District of Columbia, fifteen cities and counties, the United Conference of Mayors, and a coalition of non-governmental organizations filed a lawsuit, alleging that the question violated the Constitution.</p>
<p>Last year, United States District Court Judge Jesse Furman, in an opinion for the Southern District, found Ross’s attempt to add the citizenship question to be not only unlawful, and quite possibly unconstitutional, but also, given the way Ross went about trying to get it added to the census, an abuse of power. Furman wrote, “To conclude otherwise and let Secretary Ross’s decision stand would undermine the proposition—central to the rule of law—that ours is a ‘government of laws, and not of men.’ ” There is, therefore, no citizenship question on the 2020 census.</p>
<p>All this, though, may be by the bye, because the census, like most other institutions of democratic government, is under threat. Google and Facebook, after all, know a lot more about you, and about the population of the United States, or any other state, than does the U.S. Census Bureau or any national census agency. This year may be the last time that a census is taken door by door, form by form, or even click by click.</p>
<p>Until ten thousand years ago, only about ten million men, women, and children lived on the entire planet, and any given person had only ever met a few dozen. (One theory holds that this is why some very old languages have no word for numbers.) No one could count any sizable group of people until human populations began to cluster together and to fall under the authority of powerful governments. Taking a census required administrative skills, coercive force, and fiscal resources, which is why the first reliable censuses were taken by Chinese emperors and Roman emperors, as the economist Andrew Whitby explains in “The Sum of the People: How the Census Has Shaped Nations, from the Ancient World to the Modern Age.”</p>
<p>Censuses abound in the Bible, including one ordered by the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus and overseen by Quirinius, the Roman governor of Syria. “And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed,” according to the Gospel of Luke. “This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.” Everyone was supposed to register in the place of his or her birth. That, supposedly, was why Joseph made the journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem, “to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.” (Quirinius’ census of Judea actually took place years later, but it’s a good story.)</p>
<p>The first modern census—one that counted everyone, not just men of fighting age or taxpayers, and noted all their names and ages—dates to 1703, and was taken in Iceland, where astonishingly accurate census-takers counted 50,366 people. (They missed only one farm.) The modern census is a function of the modern state, and also of the scientific revolution. Modern demography began with the study of births and deaths recorded in parish registers and bills of mortality. The Englishman John Graunt, extrapolating from these records in the mid-seventeenth century, worked out the population of London, thereby founding the field that his contemporary William Petty called “political arithmetic.” Another way to do this is to take a census. In 1753, Parliament considered a bill for “taking and registering an annual Account of the total number of people” in order to “ascertain the collective strength of the nation.” This measure was almost single-handedly defeated by the parliamentarian William Thornton of York, who asked, “Can it be pretended, that by the knowledge of our number, or our wealth, either can be increased?” He argued that a census would reveal to England’s enemies the very information England sought to conceal: the size and distribution of its population. Also, it violated liberty. “If any officer, by whatever authority, should demand of me an account of the number and circumstance of my family, I would refuse it,” he announced.</p>
<p>Two years later, in Pennsylvania, Benjamin Franklin published “Observations Concerning the Increase of Mankind.” Franklin had every reason to want to count the people in Britain’s North American colonies. He calculated that they numbered about a million, roughly the population of Scotland, which had forty-five members in the House of Commons and sixteen peers in the House of Lords. How many had the Americans? None.</p>
<p>To make this matter of representation mathematical, enumeration of the people, every ten years, is mandated by the U.S. Constitution. There would be no more than one member of Congress for every thirty thousand people. The Constitution also mandates that any direct tax levied on the states must be proportional to population. The federal government hardly ever levies taxes directly, though. Instead, it’s more likely to provide money and services to the states, and these, too, are almost always allocated in proportion to population. So the accuracy of the census has huge implications. Wilbur Ross’s proposed citizenship question, which was expected to reduce the response rate in congressional districts with large numbers of immigrants, would have reduced the size of the congressional delegations from those districts, and choked off services to them.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Constitution, everyone in the United States was to be counted, except “Indians not taxed” (a phrase that both excluded Native peoples from U.S. citizenship and served as a de-facto acknowledgment of the sovereignty of Native nations). Every person would be counted, and there were three kinds: “free persons”; persons “bound to service for a term of years”; and “all other persons,” the last a sorry euphemism for enslaved people, who were to be counted as three-fifths of a free person. It was a compromise between Northern delegates (who didn’t want to count them at all, to thwart the South from gaining additional seats in Congress) and Southern delegates (who wanted to count them, for the sake of those seats)—a compromise, that is, between zero and one.

<h3 id="visiting-the-vatican-museums-all-you-need-to-know">&ldquo;Visiting the Vatican Museums: All You Need to Know&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.wantedinrome.com/i/preview/storage/uploads/2020/03/Vatican-Museums-1.jpg" alt="img">
The ultimate guide on how to visit the Vatican City, Vatican Gardens and Museums along with practical information including tickets and visiting hours.</p>
<p>For those who are planning a holiday in Rome, here is an itinerary of Vatican City. A visit to the smallest state in the world is absolutely worth doing at least once in a lifetime. From St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica, to the Vatican Gardens, from the Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel to the archaeological points, the beauty of the Vatican is unparalleled, and every corner is rich in art and history.</p>
<p>Let’s start from the beginning: where exactly is the Vatican?</p>
<p>The Vatican is located near the Tiber river, in the heart of Rome. The whole area is surrounded by walls. If you want to stay in the area, but at reasonable prices, consider a hotel in the Prati neighborhood of ​​Rome.</p>
<p>St Peter’s Square and Basilica</p>
<p>The symbol of Vatican City is, and it is from this religious place that we recommend you start your visit. The square was designed byIt is characterised by its elliptical shape and a quadruple row of columns; with a portico above. Theplaced on top of the portico represent the saints.</p>
<p>At the centre of the square rests the Vatican Obelisk, behind which stands the largest church in the world, St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica. The façade is 115 metres wide with the grand &lsquo;cupolone&rsquo; perched on top. Look for the central window, the so-called Loggia delle Benedizioni, from which the pope presents the message of good wishes urbi et orbi (&ldquo;to the city and to the world&rdquo;) immediately after his election, and on the occasion of religious festivities.</p>
<p>The interior of the Basilica contains a number of priceless artworks, such as the Pietà by Michelangelo (considered one of the most precious marble statues the world); a bronze statue of St Peter invites us to the dome, where above the papal altar we find the bronze canopy by Bernini.</p>
<p>In addition to St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica, there are many other churches within the Vatican that are worth visiting, perhaps with an organised tour.</p>
<p>The Vatican Gardens</p>
<p>Leaving St Peter&rsquo;s Square, take a leisurely stroll through the Vatican Gardens (). If the weather permits, it is worth visiting the majestic outdoor spaces that occupy almost two-thirds of Vatican City. The Gardens have been the resting place of the Roman Pontiff since 1279.</p>
<p>Walking through the Italian or English gardens, you come across playful fountains, streams, temples and caves. Below the Basilica of St Peter, you can visit the necropolis, a Roman cemetery, which is the burial place of St Peter - the first pope. Also located in this area are Vatican Grottoes, which house the tombs of all the popes.</p>
<p>The Vatican Museums</p>
<p>Make a day of it</p>
<p>Gregorian Etruscan Museum were both founded by Pope Gregory XVI in 1839 and 1837 to complete the collection of antiques of the Papal Museums and to give a wide overlook on this two civilisations so important for the development of the Mediterranean culture.</p>
<p>With the opening of the Pontifical Villas to the public in 2014, the Vatican Museums offer a ride on an electrical train to visit the Barberini Garden of Castel Gandolfo (24 km from Rome). This day trip is available on Saturdays only (€42).</p>
<p>Practical info</p>
<p>Vatican Museum Visiting Hours: Mon-Sat 09.00-18.00 (latest entry 16.00.)</p>
<p>St Peter’s Basilica Visiting Hours: April to September: 07.00-19.00 - October to March: 07.00-18.00.</p>
<p>Special Notes</p>
<p>Dressing for your visit: Trouserss and skirts must cover the knee and shoulders must be covered. We recommend keeping a shawl or large scarf in your bag, to put on before entering churches.</p>
<p>Watch out for scams: Be aware that there will be plenty of companies over-charging for tours just outside of the Vatican walls. In order to avoid scams, we recommend booking through the Vatican website in advance of your arrival.</p>

<h3 id="not-looking-for-a-new-england-alex-nivens-new-model-island">&ldquo;Not Looking For A New England: Alex Niven&rsquo;s New Model Island&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/quietus_production/images/articles/27571/united-kingdom-marching-band-1128558_1575800692.jpg" alt="img">
Alex Niven&rsquo;s new book delves into the meaning – and the problem – of England. He talks to Michael J. Brooks about Cool Britannia, Corbyn, and the Queen</p>
<p>“What if we abandoned England… and started looking for a replacement?” Such is the mission statement of Alex Niven in his concise, polemical and strikingly timely new book New Model Island: How to Build a Radical Culture beyond the idea of England.</p>
<p>For Niven, the concept of Englishness and of ‘being English’ is not only contradictory but a false endeavour given that, the idea of England as a definable and recognisable nation state has been redundant since the English Revolution. It was the failure of the revolution and the subsequent rise of Empire which set England on a course of de-nationalising itself into an inchoate non-state as a means of absorbing as many other localities and regions as possible.</p>
<p>Niven identifies three kinds of Englishness – the notion of historical curse, the sense that England is subject to an ancient curse; a preoccupation with confinement or constriction; and the feeling of void or lack of identity, the result of the imperialist period and its aftermath. By weaving these theoretical ideas through with elements of memoir, and plenty of analysis of pop culture – Alton Towers, Mark Fisher, Britpop, the 2018 England World Cup football team, and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen – Niven achieves something that is both eminently readable but also challenging.</p>
<p>I found it interesting how you explored the shift from the celebration of Britishness that was the Britpop and &lsquo;Cool Britannia&rsquo; era, adorned with the Union flag – one without, as you say, any particular racial or territorial overtones – to the emergence of a more reactionary and insecure Englishness and the prevalence of the St. George&rsquo;s flag. You identify this in part as being due to the Blair government’s policies of regionalism and devolution of powers. Was that shift an inevitable consequence of our neighbours seeking greater independence or was it a symptom of the execution?</p>
<p>The turn towards Englishness after the millennium was another chapter of our post-imperial malaise. For hundreds of years, England and Britain meant pretty much the same thing – the Anglo-British United Kingdom and its Empire. Since the Empire (mostly) disappeared we’ve been scratching around for a way to understand who we are collectively, with mainly very paltry results. In one sense, as you say, Englishness purports to be a mirror-image of Scottish and Welsh independence movements, and so it was a natural development after those causes reached maturity with the devolutionary moment of the millennium. But the analogy seems to me to be a very weak one.</p>
<p>Scottish and Welsh nationalisms aren’t perfect, but they are a relatively coherent expression of anti-Westminster, anti-imperialist feelings widely held among small-ish populations (Scotland is about 5.5 million, Wales just over 3 million). England has a population of nearly 56 million, so it’s a completely different beast. It has massive cultural variations across its regions, before you even get onto its ethnic diversity arising out of recent migrations.</p>
<p>As such, the quest to uncover or recover an essential Englishness that’s unfolded in a mostly middlebrow context since the millennium is always going to be a futile exercise (even if you try – as some liberal commentators have done – to claim that Englishness is all about diversity, multiculturalism, and so on).</p>
<p>You have to go back hundreds of years, to before the rise of the British Empire, to locate a time when England was a meaningful nation state in its own right. The notion that you can somehow connect that very distant, almost mythical history with a hugely diverse twenty-first century population seems to me to be completely untenable and actually pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p>Your ‘new model island’ idea is to drastically re-energise regionalism and split the British Isles into a ‘south-east corner’ and a ‘north-west corner’, a diagonal line roughly from ‘Lyme Regis to Middlesborough’. Wouldn’t it be simpler and more practicable to advocate a far stronger and more closely-integrated ‘North’, which we know southerners lump all together as one homogeneous region anyway?</p>
<p>To clarify, I don’t actually think there should be a hard border stretching from Lyme Regis to Middlesbrough! My book mainly deals with what Benedict Anderson called ‘imagined communities’, so I’m really trying to outline very tentative alternative ways of reimagining the so-called British Isles beyond nationalism; rather than actual, detailed blueprints for governmental and bureaucratic reform.</p>
<p>But to take ownership of the book’s ideas, I do think that the most important thing culturally and economically is to build up the northern and western parts of the islands as a counterweight to London and the South East, where currently the vast majority of financial and institutional power is hoarded.</p>
<p>So yes, a stronger and more closely integrated ‘North’ is needed – with internal high-speed-rail links, devolved powers and so on. But I also don’t see why these things should be confined to an imagined ‘English’ North. Without wanting to ride roughshod over Scottish, Irish and Welsh nationalist causes, it seems to me that they have common cause in terms of opposing the Westminster establishment with regions like, say, the North East, where I live. As such, why not try to think about fostering those links rather than stopping at national boundaries?</p>
<p>You write of Augustus Pugin that he “dreamed the dead centre of modern England” by designing (with Charles Barry) the Houses of Parliament. With the building soon facing a massive renewal and restoration project (costing an estimated £4bn), is the planned decamp of Parliament to a facsimile on Whitehall a waste of a golden opportunity to raise the geographical anchor of politics from London?</p>
<p>Absolutely. But I think it just serves to underline that the English establishment is never going to relinquish and abandon its geographical powerbase in London of its own accord. The minute you start thinking about an alternative location for an English parliament – let’s say Manchester or even Birmingham – that starts to become very risky for a lot of vested interests whose whole identity going back hundreds of years has been oriented around London and the South East.</p>
<p>I don’t want to be too pejorative about London, because it’s also home to a lot of radicalism and of course cultural diversity, and that ultimately is what will save us all. But it’s just an empirical fact that the English establishment has largely barricaded itself in the South East over the centuries – it’s not going to relocate without a fight.</p>
<p>You quote disparagingly from George Orwell&rsquo;s essay ‘England Your England’ and its reference to “the gentleness of the English character”. I think you misrepresent his views somewhat given that he counterpoises this with the hypocrisy of the English about the Empire, and that character being mixed up with “barbarities and anachronisms”. He could also perhaps be forgiven the generalisations about English identity given the context in which he wrote the essay – in 1941, when (as he writes in the famous opening line) “highly civilised human beings are flying overhead, trying to kill [me]”. Without any idea of what such an experience is like, I can only imagine that regional distinctions would tend to evaporate very quickly into irrelevance under the heat of an active hostile threat of invasion and occupation by a foreign power. So while there may be a reasonable debate to be had about taking him down a peg or two from his pedestal of Englishness, in your eagerness to do just that aren’t you being a tad unfair on old Eric?</p>
<p>Ha! Well yes, as you say, I think a lot of the need for a robust critique of Orwell is based on his hugely inflated reputation, especially among modern liberals. So there is a need to take him down a few pegs. It’s true that if fanboys like Robert Webb didn’t look on him as a sort of secular saint – and use his writing as definitive proof that anything to the left of mild social democracy automatically leads to dystopia – then there wouldn’t be so much leeway for correctives like mine. But even allowing for context, I think describing the English as ‘gentle’ is absurd and unconscionable. And my specific point in that passage is to highlight Orwell’s weird lassitude in outlining a unitary ‘English character’, which for him also includes the Scottish and Irish.</p>
<p>Perhaps as you say the wartime context provides some justification, but that’s quite an unusual backdrop, and I think the fantasy that we’re all permanently living in 1941 is part of the problem when it comes to our identity.</p>
<p>The book ends with reflections on the 2017 General Election: “a crack had opened up again in the facade of what Mark Fisher called capitalist realism”. Are you concerned that in the space of a few weeks, this book could be a historical document if the Tories win a majority and put paid to a the prospect of a transformational socialist project for the foreseeable future?</p>
<p>Of course there’s always the risk that everything will end in disaster. But why not hope it won’t? There will be plenty of time in the event of a Tory victory to rake over the embers and try to work out what went wrong and how to move forward strategically. But even if the Tories do get a majority this time around, you have to be optimistic that we’ll win out in the end.</p>
<p>Corbynism has renovated the Labour Party and indeed British politics in general. Another five years of the Tories will be unspeakable, but they won’t have the Brexit card next time. The left will keep growing and growing unless Johnson somehow magically decides to give millennials cheap housing and rescinds their student loan payments.</p>
<p>If Corbyn loses, we’ll get a new, younger leader, who I very much hope will be Laura Pidcock, a much better speaker and likely a more popular figure than Corbyn. I don’t think there’s anything to be achieved by being pessimistic. We’re all going to die at some point, maybe tomorrow – why not be relentlessly hopeful in the meantime?</p>
<p>In terms of the likely impact of Brexit, it could be seen as proving something of a reckoning for England, which finally has to come to terms with its diminished post-imperial stature, inadequacy and vulnerability, not to mention the real risk that the other nations of the UK will break away. In a masochistic way, is there the opportunity for England to build itself anew up from the scorched earth of Brexit?</p>
<p>Let’s hope so. The book is really addressing this developing context, which is part of the reason why I tried not to reference Brexit too often. It’s difficult to foresee exactly what will happen over the next decade as the dominoes start to fall, and I didn’t want the book to be dated within the space of a few weeks.</p>
<p>The whole weight of the question seems to fall on this term ‘England’. If the probable disintegration of the United Kingdom leads to regional devolution within England and a rebalancing of the power dynamic of the islands away from the South East corner, then great. But as I point out in the book, I find it difficult to see how we’re going to be able to disentangle a positive, radical English nationalism from the much more powerful and better-established version that revolves around conservative and far-right myths woven out of dodgy ethnology and Churchill speeches. England is just such a messed up non-country that it’s going to take a lot of effort to stop it from retreating into itself and its darker impulses post-Brexit.</p>
<p>The Queen is approaching 94. You identify yourself as a republican in the book. How seismic a jolt to Britain&rsquo;s sense of history and self will it be when the inevitable happens and Elizabeth Windsor dies?</p>
<p>Again, let’s hope a big one. But the English Establishment is a remarkably durable entity that is proofed to survive even the most seismic of shocks to its sense of self. The monarchy will suffer a dent in popularity when the queen dies, but this won’t in itself lead to anything truly radical.</p>
<p>The English upper-classes have been fairly adaptable since 1688, when they signed their devil’s pact with the middle-classes – since then the monarchy has risen and fallen in public esteem, but underneath it all there was always the material reality of a hegemonic aristocracy and bourgeoisie empowered by capitalism and imperialism.</p>
<p>We don’t have much of an Empire any more, but there’s still a huge amount of wealth and power hoarded in the upper echelons of our society. It’ll take more than the symbolic figurehead dying to change that.</p>

<h3 id="letters-to-the-editor-105-books-you-didnt-know-were-in-bulawayo">&ldquo;Letters to the Editor: 105 books you didn’t know were in Bulawayo&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/02/A-HISTORY-OF-THE-ZULU-.jpg" alt="img">
Editor — Allow me to paint a short motion picture in your beautiful imagination. With pure intent to entice your curiosity and contribute to the imminent well informed citizen in you.</p>
<p>We start off our journey at the City Hall. The true North side, underneath the shade of many a large Marula tree. Surrounded by cream to brown stone pebble outdoor tiles, meticulously mown meadow green grass, and an explosion of colour and art from the Fife Street flower, sculpture and beadwork vendors.</p>
<p>On our immediate left is the 50-60 feet deep Issels well. So named after a Mr Francois Issels who sank it using explosives in 1895. Once abandoned and filled in, the well was rediscovered and repaired in 1951. Solely so that it would supply the pool we see just a few feet overhead. The Pioneer’s Memorial Pool. A 66 foot body of fountain and sky clear water that leads us to a now absent Coghlan statue and to a gigantic brass relief depiction of the first of four indabas held in the Matopos in 1896 between the Matabele leaders and Rhodes.</p>
<p>We’re now beneath the Town Clock and the Chimes. The Elwyn Chimes in full for they were presented to the city by Mrs E L Wynne, who’d been a Bulawayo resident since 1898. The spellbinding array comprises five bells, the four bell chime thereof being Westminster Chimes. Try to ignore the charm of the cool seemingly ivory tiled foyer now. Don’t give in to the temptation of the staircase on either of our sides. And the picture frames that peep in through the landing. At least not yet, for we have arrived at the library.</p>
<p>A branch of the 1896 founded Bulawayo Public Library, this is the Historic Reference Collection. It was opened on July 31st, 1981, and dear reader this is one of the most interesting depositories of historic gems in this part of the country. Is this your first time here? Such enthusiasm. Well, while you take in the daffodil yellow walls, the eighteen pristine towering glass book shelves and cabinets just redolent with enlightenment, here is list of 105 reasons you should visit here more often. 105 fantastic historic books and where to find them.</p>

<h3 id="squatters-evicted-from-russian-oligarchs-15m-london-home">&ldquo;Squatters evicted from Russian oligarch&rsquo;s £15m London home&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/02/01/16/3CBAEB7800000578-0-image-a-97_1485966428495.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Squatters evicted from a £15million mansion this morning have moved upmarket and taken over a £25million property just yards from Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>The new property is the former home of renowned ethnologist and archeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers, one of Britain&rsquo;s greatest icons of the Victorian era.</p>
<p>The seven floor complex was occupied this morning by 20 members of the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians after they were evicted from a Grade II listed property in Eaton Square.</p>
<p>One squatter, who did not want to be named, said the property, near Victoria Station, was &lsquo;massive&rsquo;, with a chandelier in every room.</p>
<p>Squatters evicted from a £15million mansion this morning have moved upmarket to take over a £25million property just yards from Buckingham Palace. The new property is the former home of archeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers (pictured right)</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s big - it&rsquo;s like seven floors. It&rsquo;s a lot bigger than the other one, he said. &lsquo;I sorted out my room already and I can&rsquo;t find it. It&rsquo;s massive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Squatter Tom Fox found the building within minutes of bailiffs evicting the group earlier today. He said: &lsquo;We found it about two hours ago, there are some awesome rooms here, mine is the one at the top.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me and the other guys who opened the place had a meeting earlier and everyone can choose their own room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s enough for everyone but the guys who open the building get first dibs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the moment there are 20 people here and we will go around and talk to some homeless people and talk to them, if they seem okay they we will invite them back here.</p>

<p>A team of about 10 squatters forced their way through the front door and a basement and evicted 40 or so people from inside</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will stay for as long as we can, we&rsquo;re hoping to get the lift fixed as well and the guys have already got the electricity going.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was really quick (moving from the £15million mansion) and finding this place but it always happens like that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;People here have been squatting for years, they know how to live and how to get the electricity and heating working.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Augustus Pitt-Rivers, an English Army Officer, lived in the mansion and died in 1900 aged 72.</p>
<p>His innovations in archaeology are exhibited in around 22,000 objects at the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>Around 40 activists were forced out of one of Britain&rsquo;s most desirable addresses by a team of ten bailiffs who smashed in the front and basement doors at 8.10am</p>
<p>The 36-year-old handyman, who has a scar along his cheek refused to be named and worked to drill in barricades on a basement door.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;We are going to barricade one half of the front door and the second half we are going to use.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the money I am protecting the people who live here, when we were under attack from the fascists we needed the doors to be barricaded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are only two doors that need to be barricaded, one half of the front door and this one.</p>
<p>One video from the eviction showed a female bailiff from the Sheriffs Office attempting to remove a woman from the home</p>
<p>The bailiffs spent around half an hour banging on doors and removing the squatters from the building in Eaton Square, Belgravia</p>
<p>&lsquo;My power tools are the most important thing, I bought this drill, I am a handyman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we got in the first thing we did was switch off the lift and got the electricity working, hopefully we can get the central heating on, if the heating is cut there is nothing we can do. We&rsquo;ll just have to use electric heaters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It comes after a team of bailiffs arrived in Belgravia Place in the early hours of this morning to evict 40 or so people from a £15million mansion.</p>
<p>Nico Phillips, 36, who has cerebral palsy was one of several who locked themselves in a room to try and keep the bailiffs out.</p>
<p>Squatters made a point of displaying posters and banners as they finally left the property after staying inside for nine days</p>
<p>The group had been staying at the Grade II listed mansion owned by Andrey Goncharenko in Eaton Square for the previous nine days</p>

<p>Squatters who have been living in the mansion over the previous nine days begin to file outside under the watchful eye of court-ordered bailiffs (pictured right: One of the mansion&rsquo;s many Roman-inspired columns)</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;We knew that it was better to stay out of the way of any violence and to stay away from what was happening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some people were trying to kick things off, we were on the ground floor. We were just trying to stay safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jessica Ellis, a member of the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians who opened the squat a week ago was dragged out by bailiffs.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old said: &lsquo;One of them grabbed me for no reason and I was manhandled and I said I have asthma but they didn&rsquo;t listen.</p>
<p>WHO WAS AUGUSTUS PITT RIVERS? August Pitt Rivers, pictured, was a notable soldier and archaeologist during the Victorian era Born in Yorkshire in 1827, Augustus Pitt Rivers led a successful career both in the military and as an archaeologist. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, for six months at the age of fourteen and was later commissioned into the Grenadier Guards in 1845. During a 32-year military career he only saw major action once at the Battle of Alma in 1854, where an Anglo-French force defeated the Russian army in what is considered to be the first conflict of the Crimean War. His prowess and knowledge of weapons led to him founding the Hythe school of Musketry in Kent and serving as principal instructor. Pitt Rivers rose through the ranks to achieve the title of Lt General upon his retirement in 1882. Away from the Army, he began an interest in archaeology and anthropology in the 1850s, earning a reputation for science. He went on to build a collection of 22,000 artifacts from around the world, which became the basis of the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford. Pitt Rivers&rsquo; finds around the Stonehenge site in Wiltshire also led to the creation of an exhibit at the Salisbury Museum in the city of the same name. From 1882 Pitt Rivers was Britain&rsquo;s first Inspector of Ancient Monuments and was charged with protecting significant sites from destruction and development, although he wielded little real power. Two years earlier he inherited a wealthy estate from his cousin Horace Pitt-Rivers, 6th Baron Rivers, on the condition he add Pitt Rivers to his existing name of Augustus Henry Lane-Fox. The father-of-nine died in 1900 aged 73. Advertisement</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a bottle of squash and I threw it at one of them, they shoved me against a fence and I went to head butt another because they were pushing me down the stairs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I was shoved to the floor and eventually they took me round the corner and let me go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Police say they counted 42 squatters leaving the five-storey mansion which is owned by Russian oligarch billionaire Andrey Goncharenko.</p>
<p>A police officer, who was offering for the squatters to go to Westminster police station to keep warm and make phone calls, said: &lsquo;They&rsquo;re all out now. I counted 42 in total, it was quite peaceful there wasn&rsquo;t a lot of protest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He said: &lsquo;When we asked for proper paperwork for our property, we came back one day to find our stuff in the streets and we had to leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Those who took over the building were members of various anti fascist groups, including one called ANAL, which stands for Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians.</p>
<p>But yesterday they lost a county court case against the Russian tycoon and were evicted by bailiffs within hours.</p>
<p>Jed Miller, one of the squatters who was in court yesterday, said they would begin the search for another property.</p>
<p>Mr Miller, 25, a law student, who wore combat style clothing to the hearing, said: &lsquo;It has been a really stressful week and experience.</p>
<p>One of the squatters looks on as bailiffs continue to evict people from the large property, along with their possessions</p>
<p>The squatters originally gained access to the mansion, owned by a Russian oligarch, through an unlocked window</p>
<p>The group of squatters have been at the Grade II listed mansion (pictured) owned by Andrey Goncharenko in Eaton Square, London, for the last nines days</p>
<p>A smashed window on the house in Belgravia, showing a sign that reads &lsquo;class war&rsquo;. Those inside said they were occupying the mansion to bring attention to inequalities</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four or five of us were in court today. We were being represented by a lawyer who lives in the squat. I knew this morning that there was a very good chance that we would lose the case but we will fight on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m obviously disappointed. I think we will be evicted either today or tomorrow and we will be looking for a new property to house everyone in. We are discussing whether to appeal against the decision at the moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What will happen now, is the owner&rsquo;s lawyers will seek a writ of possession from the High Court and that means the bailiffs could come round tonight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Russian oligarch is not believed to have attended the hearing.</p>
<p>Mr Miller said: &lsquo;If I could give him a message, I&rsquo;d say that we have already achieved so much by opening up an empty building.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s been a safe space for the homeless and we have helped educate the homeless. We&rsquo;ve done so much in a week and he had the building empty since 2014.&rsquo;</p>
<p>INSIDE THE £15M HOME NOW LADEN WITH TRASH AND GRAFFITI Just hours after the court ruling, while many of the original squatters have since vacated the property, it was far from empty. The 1820s house was still occupied by various individuals, some identifying as homeless, others calling themselves political activists. One occupant, who wished to be known as Mordecai, first visited the mansion on Friday then moved in after an attack on the mansion on Saturday when masked attackers smashed windows. He says he was inspired to move in, &lsquo;to enforce the extras and support our comrades.&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;Some people think, &lsquo;Oh it&rsquo;s a party&rsquo;, but then you are talking to people and realise this guy is part of an organisation of tens of thousands of people and then this lady, she&rsquo;s a very serious activist. Squatters are shown making themselves at home inside the massive London mansion in Eaton Square, Belgravia &lsquo;I think for the public it&rsquo;s just, you know, &lsquo;Ah, they&rsquo;ve p<em><strong>ed off the big Russian oil baron&rsquo;. &lsquo;There are 1.5 million empty properties, people are dying on the streets. From my perspective it&rsquo;s a message to the capitalist leaders.&rsquo; Fellow squatter Jess Ellis moved in the day before the court ruling to offer support to the cause. She said: &lsquo;On a day to day basis it&rsquo;s changed, there&rsquo;s been different people coming in and out. &lsquo;Basically, we&rsquo;re trying to raise awareness about things the system is failing on: the main one is homelessness, the second is promising people things and then it never happens. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a whole variety of issues that we don&rsquo;t agree with that we are trying to make change from, and if it takes taking over big buildings like this then that&rsquo;s what we will do.&rsquo; Jess, who&rsquo;s now in sheltered accommodation, said: &lsquo;As soon as we get evicted from here a team of us are going out to look for a new building straight away. I&rsquo;m staying here until the bitter end - the bailiffs will have to tell me to leave or drag me out of here.&rsquo; The ground floor hallway was furnished with makeshift shelves, stocked with food supplies and two trestle tables, laden with more snacks and plastic bowls of fruit Everywhere there were signs of the squatters making themselves at home. The ground floor hallway is furnished with makeshift shelves, stocked with food supplies and two trestle tables, laden with more snacks and plastic bowls of fruit. The first floor is emptier, a pair of jeans and sleeping bag crumpled in one corner; in another room, a grand fireplace is decorated with graffiti with slogans like &lsquo;Pu</strong>y&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Who r ur allies They&rsquo;re all spies&rsquo;, and heart-shaped drawings tacked to the white walls with masking tape. The temporary fittings contrast with the grand red carpeted staircase and black and white tiled hall floor. Occupants have plenty of rooms to choose from but in main stay on the ground and first floor. Sitting on the floor beneath windows, which have been barricaded with the property&rsquo;s doors, a group roll cigarettes and appear relaxed about their imminent eviction. One resident, 28-year-old Grant, came to the mansion directly from sleeping on the streets for the past 15 months. Drinking strong black coffee in the house&rsquo;s makeshift kitchen, complete with hotplate and microwave, Grant says his five-day stay at 102 Eaton Square is the longest he&rsquo;s been off drugs in the last few years. One of the squatters is shown preparing a meal for the others ahead of the eviction, whcih took place early on Wednesday morning He said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m rattling. Heroin, crack, valium, pills; you name it. Anything that could take you out of your f</em>**ing mind I took.&rsquo; Prior to sleeping rough in London, Grant lived in Scotland with his wife and 10-year-old son. He said: &lsquo;I had everything, then I lost it on a binge with the drink and drugs and threw it all away. I had my own business, I had a house, my wife and son, a car.&rsquo; Grant claims that being in the squat has been a positive experience. &lsquo;It has been good - shown me that there are a lot of people wanting to help.&rsquo; For Jess too the sense of community, alongside the protest, is powerful. She said: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s community [here]. When you&rsquo;re outside in the real world it&rsquo;s hard to get that feeling, it&rsquo;s hard to have that sense of belonging. &lsquo;Especially for people like us because we are what people call anti-social, reprobates, criminals protesters, annoyances, nuisances, whatever. &lsquo;We may seem like that but we have to be like this to try and change the situation for better. Not just for people like us but for people of all walks of life. &lsquo;If it takes such drastic movements like this to get the government to listen then we know we&rsquo;re doing it for the best.&rsquo; Those who occupied the property said highlighting homelessness in the capital was among the causes it was publicising</p>
<p>Mr Miller said someone had already informed squatters at the property that they had lost the hearing.</p>
<p>Yesterday it emerged the squatters had been attacked by a gang of masked men who hurled missiles and abuse.</p>
<p>YouTube footage shows the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians being attacked by at least a dozen thugs who stationed themselves outside the Belgravia mansion on Saturday.</p>
<p>The squatters were reportedly taking part in a peaceful poetry workshop when the £15million property, owned by oligarch Andrey Goncharenko, was attacked.</p>
<p>The video shows the men, who covered their faces with scarves, shout abuse at the squatters and order them to come downstairs.</p>
<p>Clattering can be heard as the gang start launching missiles, including what appear to be glass bottles, at the home.</p>
<p>The squatters got into the property through an unlocked window. Pictured is Jed Miller, one of the group</p>
<p>The squatters remained in the property and eventually aimed fire extinguishers at the gang in bid to stop the attack.</p>
<p>Between 25 and 30 activists entered the grade II listed mansion last Monday and, since then, have invited in homeless people, screened anarchist films and played football in the library.</p>
<p>The anarchist group had hoped to run a free clothes shop for rough sleepers in the property, which was formerly a Spanish cultural centre.</p>
<p>The Eaton Square mansion is thought to have been empty since it was bought by Mr Goncharenko in 2014.</p>
<p>Tom Fox, 23, said he and his fellow activists intend to make a stand against rich investors leaving similar homes derelict.</p>
<p>The squatters have access to gas, electricity, hot running water and even a WiFi account named &lsquo;Billion&rsquo; and turned what was the mansion&rsquo;s library into a makeshift football pitch, using a DIY ball made with duct tape as a ball.</p>
<p>The men, who covered their faces with scarves, shout abuse at the squatters and order them to come downstairs</p>
<p>The squatters have taken over a £15million mansion in Belgravia, central London, owned by a Russian billionaire</p>
<p>Lat week Mr Fox, who grew up in Manchester and is a qualified plumber, joked that they would leave if Mr Goncharenko gave them £50,000.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;There is so much empty space and so many empty houses because people have invested in these dead assets, these stale assets.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are so many homeless people who need a place to stay. This place is in great condition and we have got nine or ten homeless people living here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are these preconceptions that they are all crack addicts and things but many people are in this situation because they have just slipped through the net.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There would be plenty of people willing to work as minders [for these properties], you could set up CCTV and then let the homeless in. There are people dying on the streets at the moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The anti-fascist group joked they will leave if oligarch Andrey Goncharenko pays them £50,000</p>
<p>A banner which reads &lsquo;USA Anti-Government In Exile&rsquo; hangs above the front door, as well as a black flag with the words &lsquo;Antifaschistische Aktion&rsquo;, an Anti fascist network from continental Europe</p>
<p>The palatial mansion is the latest of 33 high profile central London properties Mr Fox claims to have squatted in.</p>
<p>The anarchist group set up camp in Trafalgar Square&rsquo;s Admiralty Arch in April 2015 and unfurled banners reading &lsquo;Homes for all&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The group gained access to the Eaton Square mansion by sliding open a basement window, then spreading the word via social media.</p>
<p>The alleged computer hacker Laurie Love, 32, who is facing extradition to the US accused of stealing data from American intelligence agencies, has visited friends living in the squat, but did not spend an evening in the home, Mr Fox said.</p>
<p>The house was built around 1825 by the Grosvenor family and was until recently the home of the Instituto Cervantes of London, a Spanish cultural centre.</p>
<p>The squatters were due to appear at the Central London County Court in February but the hearing to get them removed from the property was moved up.

<h3 id="hey-thats-our-stuff-maasai-tribespeople-tackle-oxfords-pitt-rivers-museum">&ldquo;Hey, that&rsquo;s our stuff: Maasai tribespeople tackle Oxford&rsquo;s Pitt Rivers Museum&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e63abd9ece716a26fbc5825f0fef28fd0ac3a8b4/0_240_7239_4344/master/7239.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=1d7fa1175804c8c87243a28b0de76767" alt="img">
Around a large table in a bright room in the University of Oxford’s Pitt Rivers Museum, four members of the Maasai tribe from east Africa are inspecting a small object. It has been carefully placed in front of them by a curator wearing special handling gloves. The Maasai say that it is a bracelet, an orkatar. They talk between themselves, in the maa language, about what the bracelet is used for. “This is something that cannot be sold or given,” says Yannick Ndoinyo, a junior elder from Loliondo, northern Tanzania. The orkatar symbolises the death of a father and is a form of inheritance that passes down the generations. How did it end up in a museum in Oxford? Perhaps it was stolen from the original owner or given away under duress. According to the database, it was “donated” to the Pitt Rivers Museum in 1904 by Alfred Claud Hollis, a colonial administrator in British East Africa.</p>
<p>This encounter between the Pitt Rivers, one of the most important ethnological museums in the world, and the Maasai is part of a process of cultural decolonisation. The relationship began when Maasai activist Samwel Nangiria visited the museum in November last year for a conference. The Pitt Rivers has more than 300,000 objects in its collection, many of which were “acquired” by colonial functionaries, missionaries and anthropologists in the heyday of the British empire. The museum itself is curated in a peculiar style – in line with the request of benefactor Augustus Pitt Rivers – with objects organised according to type rather than place of origin. This Victorian aesthetic has been consciously upheld: the Pitt Rivers is often referred to as a “museum of a museum”. There are shrunken heads from the Amazon and rudimentary tools from India; a magisterial totem pole from the Haida nation in Canada towers above the central, darkened atrium.</p>
<p>Nangiria walked through the museum and stopped when he saw something he was not expecting: his own culture, entombed in a glass cabinet. “When I saw objects from the Maasai community I was a little bit shocked,” he tells me. “[They were] poorly described, with a lack of what the object is meant for [and its] cultural significance.” His heart started beating so fast that it felt like it was vibrating: “Because I know our culture is not dead. It’s a living culture.”</p>

<p>Nangiria, a purposeful and diplomatic presence, expressed his displeasure to the museum’s director, Laura Van Broekhoven. She sent him a copy of the museum’s strategic plan for the future and invited him back. Keenly aware of its problematic origins, the Pitt Rivers, like many museums, engages “originating communities” – in the museum-world lingo – to allow them to reclaim the narrative around their objects. Last month, Nangiria, with four other Maasai from Tanzania and Kenya, and help from the Oxford-based NGO InsightShare, returned to do so.</p>
<p>Curators take great care when holding arrows, assuming their tips are poisoned. Francis, a village elder, confirms this: &lsquo;If it mixes with your blood then you have five minutes left&rsquo;</p>
<p>One purpose of the weeklong visit was to provide the museum with more accurate information. The database was littered with errors and gaps: it transpires that an object marked as a Maasai bracelet is actually an anklet; a trinket made for an unknown purpose in fact plays a vital role in circumcision rituals. After a Maasai sword is laid down on the table, Marina de Alarcón, joint head of collections, tells us that the museum takes great care when holding arrows, assuming that their tips – as is Maasai custom – are poisoned. Francis Shomet Ole Naingisa, a village elder, duly confirms this: “If the poison mixes with your blood then you have five minutes left.”</p>
<p>Of the 60 objects examined, the Maasai came across five that are sacred, which “they would not expect to find elsewhere apart from within their community”. One was the orkatar. Another was an isurutia, a necklace used as a wedding dowry. Nangiria sent a photograph to village elders back home via WhatsApp: “They were astonished to hear that such a thing was here,” he tells me. “They say this particular object might have brought bad omens to the family [who lost possession of it].” For the Maasai, these items are not historical curiosities. They are part of a living culture.</p>

<p>The relationship between European museums and the people from whom their collections were taken has never been more fraught. The same week as the Maasai visit, Tarita Alarcón Rapu, governor of Easter Island, begged for the return of the Hoa Hakananai’a statue from the British Museum in a tearful message that went viral: “You, the British people, have our soul.”</p>
<p>A few days later came the publication of a report commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron, who had expressed his desire to see colonial-era items in France returned to Africa. Macron has his own reasons for this type of cultural diplomacy: it eases the passage of further economic and military cooperation with Francophone Africa. Nonetheless, the report is bold, recommending that France return African treasures if governments request them.</p>
<p>Museums handle the question of repatriation as delicately as their objects. The Museums Association’s policy statement notes that it is a “complex issue involving a range of emotional, ethical, legal and political factors”. In my interviews I heard suspicion from some in the museum world about the politicised nature of state-to-state transactions, while the legal framework governing returns can be ambiguous, as has been with the case with recovering art stolen during the second world war. The British Museum has agreed to hold talks about Hoa Hakananai’a, but a likely conclusion will be a temporary return on loan, as was the case with Nigeria’s Benin bronzes.</p>
<p>Repatriation, however, is not the only form of decolonisation. For the activist Alice Procter, who gives unofficial tours of London museums that foreground their histories of colonialism and slavery, just as urgent is transforming the institution itself. “Decolonisation means rethinking the structure of the museum,” she tells me. “Until people from [originating] communities are actually working in museums with their collections on a permanent and long-term basis, it won’t be truly institutional change.”</p>

<p>Procter tells me that the Pitt Rivers is a good example of a museum working hard to “rethink the role, power and status of museums”, and Van Broekhoven is refreshingly forthright. Fluent in the language of decolonial studies, she admits that the model of originating communities visiting for a week to talk about their customs is not sufficient and that the power dynamic between participants should always be carefully considered. “There are times [in these exchanges] when you think, ‘What are we doing here? Are we decolonising or are we neo-colonising?’” she says. “But that’s why it’s so important to think through the power balances in these relationships. It should certainly never be tokenistic. Decolonising really needs to be a process and as it deeply questions the institutional practices it will often be painful.”</p>
<p>Will the Maasai be able to facilitate the return of sacred objects? Van Broekhoven tells me over email that “in principle”, and provided they find funding, the museum is ready to “learn together how we might envision new ways of redress”. The words are carefully chosen. Nangiria, ever the diplomat, suggests an alternative solution in one of our conversations: inviting elders to perform a spiritual ceremony that will “disconnect” the objects from their cultural function, allowing the Maasai to actively donate them to the museum. The museum will wait to hear from the elders to “jointly decide” on the next steps in the partnership.</p>

<p>At a public event on the final day of their visit, the five Maasai, led by Scholastica Ene Kukutia, a women’s rights activist from Kenya, perform a ritual in the museum. Standing on the balcony overseeing the collection, sporting red shukas and bejewelled with earrings and necklaces that chime as they move, the group sing a melodious incantation that speaks of a meeting between “great cultures”. Attendees cry, as does Nangiria. He thanks the museum for “opening its doors” to them.</p>
<p>But history always finds a way to seep through to the present, especially in a city like Oxford. The day before, I joined the Maasai at the university’s Weston Library. Enduring the November cold, they posed for a photograph on a balcony that frames the city’s skyline: implacable limestone that speaks of centuries of imperial wealth. Inside, they were shown archival maps of Maasai territory. The British engineered a forced migration, at gunpoint, of the Maasai at the turn of the century, moving them from one of the most fertile plains of Kenya to a drier part of Tanzania. Nangiria pores over the maps to see the changing contours of his people’s land.</p>
<p>One book taken from the library’s archives, written in 1901 by Sidney Langford Hinde, a medical officer in British East Africa, is called The Last of the Masai. It is a work of colonial anthropology. Kukutia is intrigued and reads from a chapter: “All Masai [sic] are quick at learning and, since they are both quiet and intelligent, they make excellent servants.” She laughs. And then, after reading a few more lines, lets out a sound of weariness. I ask if she is glad that she came to Oxford. She says yes. She is happy that they have provided the Pitt Rivers Museum with better information for people learning about her culture. What’s more: “Now they have made us at least aware of where our belongings are.”</p>

<h3 id="did-pākehā-painters-goldie-and-lindauer-exploit-their-māori-subjects">&ldquo;Did Pākehā painters Goldie and Lindauer exploit their Māori subjects?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bauerfrodoprod-cdn.azureedge.net/uploads/2e0274ad-7244-4dde-ba22-6ba84a23bc04-ls0519_48_sup_p19-goldie-in-studio.jpg" alt="img">
Celebrated Pākehā portrait painters Charles Goldie and Gottfried Lindauer are said to be guilty of exploiting and romanticising Māori, but their subjects didn’t think so, and nor do the tangata whenua of today.</p>
<p>Artist Charles F Goldie leafs through a book on his tea break. Perched on a chair in the studio, his model, Waikato chief Pātara Te Tuhi, waits patiently. To his left, propped up on an easel, is what seems to be a completed portrait showing the celebrated chief sitting staunch and solemn in full traditional dress, the large hei-tiki, shark’s tooth earring and woven cloak signifying an aged but noble chief.</p>
<p>For readers of the 1901 issue of New Zealand Illustrated Magazine, the portrait ascribes to the romantic notion of a dying race, one of Goldie’s “rest-home Māoris”, wrote one commentator, decked out in old-time cloaks, tiki and pendants. But there is something else going on here. Holding his cup of tea, Te Tuhi appears relaxed. Below the cloak are glimpses of the rangatira’s everyday attire – cuffed trousers and leather shoes. Behind the artist is a neat pile of folded clothes: hat, shirt, waistcoat.</p>

<p>For Goldie, says Roger Blackley, associate professor in art history at Victoria University of Wellington, the photo would have been good publicity, showing the world he had this very famous rangatira as a model, “but it would be wrong to say Te Tuhi is simply a passive prop in Goldie’s colonising agenda”.</p>
<p>Such portraits undoubtedly fed into the conception of a doomed but noble race. As lawyer Richard Singer wrote in 1903, Goldie’s work presents “a true and a brilliant impression not only of the habits and customs, but of the very character, the very life, the idiosyncrasies of nature and of feature of the Māori – characteristics that in a few short years it will no longer be possible to represent, for the old chiefs and chieftainesses, and the old warriors whom this artist chooses as his models, are the last of their race; the tattooed man is dying out”.
