<p>CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has once again gone from reporting the news to being in the news, this time after allegedly getting caught naked in his wife&rsquo;s yoga video on Instagram.</p>
<p>Some of Cristina Greeven Cuomo&rsquo;s 123,000 Instagram followers tuned in late May to watch the mother-of-three wellness guru practice yoga at her home studio, only to get an eyeful of a man&rsquo;s nude backside outside her window overlooking the yard.</p>
<p>The video shot on or around May 27 was almost immediately removed from Instagram Live, but not before some quick-thinking users got screenshots of the man in his birthday suit and shared them on social media, as Page Six first reported.</p>
<p>Cheeky: Cristina Greeven Cuomo&rsquo;s Instagram followers got a glimpse of a naked man standing outside her yoga studio, leading many to speculate it was her CNN host husband</p>
<p>Chris Cuomo, 49, picture with wife Cristina in 2014, has been broadcasting from his basement since March because of the COVID-19 outbreak</p>
<p>The images show an athletic-looking man from behind, with his exposed physique partially blocked by a column. The screengrabs from the now-deleted video do not show the photo-bombing culprit&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>As of Monday afternoon, neither Chris Cuomo nor his wife have addressed the cheeky video.</p>
<p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo&rsquo;s younger brother has been broadcasting his CNN show, Cuomo Prime Time, from the basement of his family&rsquo;s sprawling mansion in Southampton, New York, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In late March, the 49-year-old Chris announced on his show that he had tested positive for COVID-19, which left him shivering from high fever and hallucinating. His wife and their 14-year-old son, Mario, later contracted the illness as well.</p>
<p>Cristina, 50, a self-described &lsquo;wellness worshiper,&rsquo; has been sharing videos of herself practicing yoga in her home studio overlooking the garden</p>
<p>After spending several weeks quarantined in the basement, in mid-April the TV presenter filmed himself reuniting with his family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the dream. Just to be back up here doing normal things,&rsquo; he said as he embraced his wife.</p>
<p>But Cuomo was accused of staging the clip after he revealed he left his home on Easter Sunday - two weeks after testing positive - and confronted a &lsquo;fat biker&rsquo; who asked him why he wasn&rsquo;t in quarantine.</p>
<p>In late April, the CNN host announced he was coronavirus-free, but as recently as last month he admitted that he was still not &lsquo;100 per cent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I still have weird stuff going on with my lungs,&rsquo; Cuomo told his viewers.</p>
<p>At the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City, Cristina, 50, a self-described &lsquo;wellness worshiper,&rsquo; sparked a controversy when she recommended on her blog, The Purist, bathing in one half of a cup of Clorox bleach twice a week to boost her immune system.</p>
<p>Both Chris and Cristina battled the coronavirus in March. In Mid-April, the CNN host filmed himself reuniting with his wife (pictured)</p>
<p>She later defended her use of bleach in an interview with People Magazine, saying in part: &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a huge opposition against holistic medicine, I get that. We are all trying to find tools to help beat this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the now deleted blog post Cristina incorrectly said that the bleach is &lsquo;technically salt&rsquo; and claimed she used it to &lsquo;combat the radiation and metals in my system&rsquo;, in direct contrast to warnings given by Clorox that contact with skin should be avoided.</p>
<p>The blogger also wrote about boosting immunity to the virus through a $300 vitamin C intravenous drip.</p>
<p>For the past month, Cristina has been sharing videos with her 123,000 Instagram followers showing herself practicing yoga.</p>
<p>In her most recent video, uploaded on Sunday, the windows of Cristina&rsquo;s studio were shielded with blinds.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/19/19/28587988-0-image-a-42_1589913836238.jpg" alt="img">
Cristina Cuomo was seen out and about in the Hamptons on Monday with her 10-year-old daughter Carolina and another young girl after beating coronavirus last month.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old wife of CNN anchor Chris Cuomo played it safe and donned a face mask during the outing, and she made sure Carolina and her companion were protected as well.</p>
<p>In addition to having their faces covered, the two girls each wore one latex glove while carrying their cellphones in their opposite hands.</p>
<p>Out and about: Chris Cuomo&rsquo;s wife Cristina, 50, was seen out in the Hamptons with their daughter Carolina, 10, on Monday after beating coronavirus last month</p>
<p>Safety first: The mother and daughter were joined by another young girl, and all three of them wore protective face masks</p>
<p>Cristina was dressed comfortably in a gray T-shirt and cropped black leggings with red and white stripes running down each of the legs.</p>
<p>She topped off the casual look a blazer and black sneakers, and while she was walking, she held her gray leather wallet under her arm.</p>
<p>The mom of three had her highlight brown hair pulled up in a messy ponytail, and her sunglasses sat on top of her head.</p>
<p>Like her youngest daughter and her friend, she also carried her cellphone in her hand, and at one point, she was seen taking a call.</p>
<p>The girls were dressed similarly to Cristina in T-shirts and leggings, though they opted to wear flip flops instead of sneakers.</p>
<p>On the go: Cristina was dressed comfortably in a gray T-shirt and cropped black leggings with red and white stripes running down each of the legs</p>
<p>Added touch: The two girls each wore one latex glove while carrying their cellphones in their opposite hands</p>
<p>Cristina&rsquo;s husband, Chris, 49, was the first in their family to contract coronavirus. He revealed his diagnosis on March 31, and he quickly became one of the most recognizable faces of COVID-19 as he spoke candidly about the illness while filming his show from his basement.</p>
<p>Although he self-isolated away from his family, Cristina started developing symptoms 18 days later. She struggled with intense sinus pressure in mid-April before she tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The couple&rsquo;s 14-year-old son, Mario also contracted the virus and has since recovered. Their daughters Bella, 17, and Carolina have yet to show any symptoms of the illness.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Cristina defended her use of holistic remedies such as bleach baths as a treatment for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The wellness worshiper used her blog, The Purist, to share homeopathic tips on how she recovered from the virus, recommending bathing in one half of a cup of Clorox bleach twice a week.</p>
<p>Health scare: Cristina, Chris, and their son Mario, 14, have all tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered. Their daughters Bella, 17, and Carolina have yet to show any coronavirus symptoms</p>
<p>Regrettable suggestion: Cristina faced backlash for recommending bathing in one half of a cup of Clorox bleach twice a week to recover from the virus</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do it: Clorox lists a warning on its site that users should not bathe in bleach water</p>
<p>Speaking with People, Cristina said that she is &lsquo;feeling well&rsquo; while hitting back at critics who slammed her for her unorthodox and potentially harmful treatment suggestions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a huge opposition against holistic medicine, I get that. We are all trying to find tools to help beat this,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;The fact is, there are no standardized treatments for this virus. My hope is to share information and alternatives that many might not have access to and are interested in hearing about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the now-deleted blog post, Cristina incorrectly shared that the bleach is &lsquo;technically salt&rsquo; and claimed she used it to &lsquo;combat the radiation and metals in [her] system&rsquo; in direct contrast to warnings given by Clorox that contact with skin should be avoided.</p>
<p>The blogger also wrote about boosting immunity to the virus through a $300 vitamin C intravenous drip.</p>
<p>She claims the advice was provided by Dr. Linda Lancaster, who describes herself as an energy medicine and homeopathic physician and lists high-profile names such as Robert Redford among her clients.</p>
<p>The home-trialed remedies were met with a large wave of criticism, coming just days before President Donald Trump caused an uproar by suggesting that cleaning agents injected into the body could be used as a coronavirus cure, along with the use of ultraviolet lights.

<h3 id="press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-chides-chris-cuomo-for-using-quinine-he-called-donald-trumps-hydroxychloroquine-claim-a-beautiful-distraction">&ldquo;Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany Chides Chris Cuomo For Using Quinine; He Called Donald Trump’s Hydroxychloroquine Claim “A Beautiful Distraction”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/shutterstock_editorial_10653313p.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany accused CNN anchor Chris Cuomo of taking a “less safe” version of hydroxychloroquine even though he “mocked” President Donald Trump’s advocacy of the drug.</p>
<p>Trump said this week that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment for the coronavirus. That drew criticism, as the drug is the subject of an FDA warning that it should not be used outside of a hospital setting or clinical trial because of the risk of heart problems.</p>
<p>Cuomo revealed last month that he had the coronavirus, and he has described his recovery process as he has continued to anchor Cuomo PrimeTime. His wife, Cristina, wrote about his protocol on the website she founded, Purist, and described homeopathic treatments that included “potentized quinine (OXO); it’s derived from the nontoxic bark of Peruvian-grown quinine plants.” She described it as a “natural antibiotic” that was among an extensive regimen for her husband. She also was diagnosed with coronavirus and wrote about her own recovery.</p>
<p>At the briefing, McEnany chided a number of media figures, before singling out Cuomo.</p>
<p>“I have seen a lot of apoplectic coverage of hydroxychloroquine,” she told reporters. “You had Jimmy Kimmel saying the president is ‘trying to kill himself’ by taking it. You Joe Scarborough saying ‘this will kill you.’ Neil Cavuto saying, ‘what have you got to lose? One thing you have to lose are lives.’ And you had Chris Cuomo saying ‘the president knows that hydroxychloroquine is not supported by science. He knows it has been flagged by his own people and he has been using it.’ Well, Cuomo mocked the president for this.”</p>
<p>She then added, “Hydroxychloroquine of course is an FDA approved medication with a long proven track record for safety, and it turns out that Chris Cuomo took a less safe version of it called quinine which the FDA removed from the market in 2006 because of its serious side effects including death. So really interesting to have that criticism of the president.”</p>
<p>She also cited a quote that Cuomo’s brother, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, made in March, in which he said that he was an “optimist” and “hopeful about the drugs and that’s why we’ll try it here in New York as soon as we get it.” In April, though, he said that New York’s trials delivered inconclusive results.</p>
<p>A CNN spokesperson did not immediately have a response to McEnany.</p>
<p>Quinine has been used for centuries as an antimalarial treatment.</p>
<p>While there are links between hydroxychloroquine and quinine, there are also significant differences. As Kim Walker, Cassandra Quave and Nataly Olivia A Canales wrote in the non-profit research site The Conversation in March, “Although chloroquine was inspired by the antimalarial activity of quinine, its chemical structure (and pharmacological properties) are quite different from the natural compounds found in cinchona bark.”</p>
<p>The purpose of their article was to outline how the use of cinchona bark, which contains quinine, is unproven.</p>
<p>They wrote, “The benefits, if any, of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 are still not fully understood. Cinchona bark does not contain either of these compounds, and the alkaloids in the bark bear no relation to them. Likewise, there is no evidence of cinchona being able to prevent or treat COVID-19.” She also described serious side effects and noted that the FDA pulled quinine pills for the treatment of leg cramps off the market in 2006.</p>
<p>On her website, Cristina Cuomo wrote of consulting with Dr. Linda Lancaster, who specializes in homeopathy, and that “doctors are finding that quinine potentially slows the breakdown of iron from hemoglobin and the resulting oxidative stress. OXO is an oxygenating formula that works on the liver, and in turn, on the blood that passes through the liver.”</p>
<p>Trump told reporters on Wednesday that he would finish his use of hydroxychloroquine “in a day or two.”</p>
<p>On Cuomo PrimeTime on Monday, Cuomo said of Trump and hydroxychloroquine, “I don’t even know if he’s taking it, by the way. He’s got a letter from his doctor saying that is why he prescribed it.” He called it “all a beautiful distraction.”</p>
<p>Cuomo also said that Trump, in advocating for the use of hydroxychloroquine, is a “winning argument for him” because he’s been able to put the Democrats in the position of being the “party of no.”</p>
<p>“Now, why did he do this? Who cares why? Because it works.”</p>
<p>But Cuomo also made a distinction between using hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment and for use of those who already have been diagnosed with coronavirus. “I have not heard it prescribed prophylactically” Dr. Sanjay Gupta told him. “There has been a lot of discussion about this. There is no evidence … to use this prophylactically.” He said that there are studies being done to look at it for health care workers who have had significant exposure.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/10/19/28230628-0-image-a-60_1589134494720.jpg" alt="img">
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo insisted he&rsquo;s the &lsquo;favorite&rsquo; in a jab at his brother, Chris Cuomo, and other siblings in a live Zoom call during his daily press briefing on Mother&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Andrew took a brief step back from updating New Yorkers on the pandemic to take claim his role as 88-year-old Matilda Cuomo&rsquo;s favorite son.</p>
<p>The Cuomo family joined together for a live Zoom call during the press conference. Matilda was featured on one TV screen and two of his daughters, Cara and Mariah, were on the other.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is going to be over&hellip; and then you can spend more time with me. I know I am your favorite. I know you don’t want to say that because Maria is there,&rsquo; Andrew said, mentioning his sister Maria Cuomo.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo (left) wished Matilda Cuomo (right) a Happy Mother&rsquo;s Day on Sunday during a press briefing</p>
<p>&lsquo;But we’ll get to spend time together and look back at this and we’ll say we’re all the better for it,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Andrew spent the remainder of the heartwarming call praising his mother.</p>
<p>‘Today is Mother’s Day and that dwarfs all else,&rsquo; the governor said.</p>
<p>Pictured: Matilda (left) and daughters Cara and Mariah Cuomo (right) tuning in for a family Zoom call on Sunday</p>
<p>He added that while his father was stern, his mother was &lsquo;pure love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mother has always been pure love. Just pure sweetness, pure goodness, pure affirmation, unconditional love,&rsquo; Andrew said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No matter what I did. No matter how stupid I was, and I can be pretty stupid. '</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love you so, so much and wish I was with you, but I can’t be because I love you,&rsquo; Andrew said to his mother.</p>
<p>Cara Cuomo, the oldest daughter of Cuomo and his former wife Kerry Kennedy, shared a cute story about her grandmother meeting the pope.</p>
<p>Cara Kenned-Cuomo (far right) shared a story about Matilda meeting a pope and being told &lsquo;la familia&rsquo;</p>
<p>Michaela Cuomo (left) praised Matilda (right) for being a &lsquo;good role model&rsquo; for Cuomo and his siblings</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happy Mother’s Day Grandma. I was just thinking today about this story that I love hearing you tell about how you met this Pope,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;…And how he looked you in the eye, took your hand in his and he said &ldquo;la familia.&rdquo; I think he really captured your spirit. Thank you so much for teaching us what the meaning of family is, both from our own little group to the family of New York.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Michaela Cuomo, Andrew&rsquo;s youngest daughter who was in attendance at the press conference, said her grandmother was a &lsquo;great role model&rsquo; for Andrew and his siblings</p>
<p>Cuomo (left) said of his mother: ' &lsquo;My mother has always been pure love. Just pure sweetness, pure goodness, pure affirmation, unconditional love&rsquo;</p>
<p>Andrew took another goodhearted jab his younger brother, Chris Cuomo, in a cute Mother&rsquo;s Day message on Twitter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happy Mother’s Day, Mom,&rsquo; he wrote. &lsquo;Love this photo of you with your favorite son&hellip;and Chris Cuomo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chris hasn&rsquo;t responded to his brother&rsquo;s light dig, but instead shared his own Mother&rsquo;s Day message praising both Matilda and his wife.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo (left) wished his mother Matilda Cuomo (center) a Happy Mother&rsquo;s Day and took a quick jab at Chris Cuomo (right)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two women have shaped me to this point more than any other influences in my life,&rsquo; he wrote in Instagram.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I had a great pop, loving siblings and now three jewels from God and the awesome love and sense of purpose that comes with children&hellip;but&hellip;my mother showed me what love was in action; sacrificing the self for your spouse and kids and even a righteous cause; how to say less when angry and do more when it is needed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added that Matilda told him to marry Cristina Cuomo in the midst of the horrific September 11, 2001 attacks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And mama told me to marry Cristina even though 911 just happened - especially because of it. And mama was right. Cristina has provided every thing and moment that matters to me in my life,&rsquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Chris then thanked his wife for helping him through the &lsquo;covid cataclysm&rsquo; after he tested positive for COVID-19 in March.</p>
<p>Chris Cuomo (right) shared an Instagram post where he applauded his mother, Matilda (center), and his wife, Cristina Cuomo (left)</p>
<p>Pictured: Chris Cuomo&rsquo;s Mother&rsquo;s Day post in Instagram</p>
<p>&lsquo;This picture has me with the two mamas who shaped me at the site of the house my mother told me I would have some day and Cristina made a reality,&rsquo; Chris wrote.</p>
<p>The two brother&rsquo;s have had playful on-air squabbles during recent interviews where Chris, a CNN host, speaks to Andrew about the coronavirus pandemic in New York City.</p>
<p>In April, Chris got the upper hand when he shared an old family photo that showed Andrew as a teenager.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m staying home for these two guys at the front,&rsquo; Chris said in reference to the image, which showed a teenage Andrew wearing a loud pattern shirt, white bell-bottoms and dated afro-like hairstyle next to a much younger and cuter Chris.</p>
<p>Chris clearly enjoyed embarrassing his brother with the unflattering photo while Andrew pretended to sign off from the interview</p>
<p>The governor pretended to be unable to see the embarrassing snap as he defiantly removed his microphone and said: &lsquo;Bye, Chris.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, no, don&rsquo;t do it. Put the mic back on. Don&rsquo;t be like that,&rsquo; Chris pleaded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take the picture down,&rsquo; Andrew replied.</p>
<p>Chris refused, but worked to get back on his brother&rsquo;s good side by offering a heartfelt explanation for his choice.

White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany called out CNN hosts Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon for their recent rhetoric about violent protests during Monday’s news briefing.</p>
<p>A reporter asked if President Trump was sorry for the way peaceful protestors have been treated, as the nation has been flooded with protests, which have sometimes turned violent, since George Floyd’s Memorial Day death in police custody.</p>
<p>“The president is sorry about the fact that Antifa wreaked havoc in our streets, and the failure of some members of the media to note that, like CNN’s Chris Cuomo said, ‘Show me where it says protestors are supposed to be peaceful.’ Well, I point him to the First Amendment where it is said you have the right to ‘peaceably assemble.’ He should go back and read the Constitution,” McEnany said.</p>
<p>CNN&rsquo;S DON LEMON SAYS &lsquo;WE ARE TEETERING ON A DICTATORSHIP&rsquo; FOLLOWING TRUMP&rsquo;S GEORGE FLOYD ADDRESS</p>
<p>“There are many others out there, Don Lemon saying that rioting is a ‘mechanism to restructure our country,’” McEnany said. “The actions of the rioters were not in keeping with the First Amendment and I think the media needs to recognize that there is a discernment between the peaceful protestors, many of whom I have seen, and the rioters.”</p>
<p>McEnany added that Trump &ldquo;will not allow burning buildings.”</p>
<p>CNN&rsquo;S CHRIS CUOMO BLASTED FOR SUGGESTING PROTESTERS DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO BE &lsquo;PEACEFUL&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last week, the “Cuomo Prime Time” namesake raised eyebrows when he suggested that the protesters didn&rsquo;t have to be “polite and peaceful.”</p>
<p>“Now, too many see the protests as the problem. No, the problem is what forced your fellow citizens to take to the streets: persistent, poisonous inequities and injustice,” Cuomo told his viewers. “And please, show me where it says protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful, because I can show you that outraged citizens are what made the country what she is and led to any major milestone. To be honest, this is not a tranquil time.”</p>
<p>Cuomo later added, “Police are the ones required to be peaceful, to deescalate, to remain calm.”</p>
<p>McEnany, who has made a habit out of calling out members of the media for their own behavior when faced with hostile questions, apparently took notice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lemon has suggested that Trump “contributed” to the environment that led to Floyd’s death and has been an outspoken critic of the president.</p>
<p>“We are teetering on a dictatorship. This is chaos. Has the president &ndash; I’m listening, is the president declaring war on Americans? What is happening here? He is saying that he wants to protect peaceful protesters at the same time sending law enforcement and military into the streets to push peaceful protesters back, to be aggressive with peaceful protesters. He is doing the exact opposite of what he said in that speech,” Lemon said last week following Trump’s Rose Garden address when he said he would consider deploying the armed services if states didn’t get riots under control.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/28/USAT/18087f78-4359-4060-ad8e-87743bb38068-VPC_CHRIS_CUOMO_TESTS_NEGATIVE_FOR_COVID19_DESK_THUMB.jpg?crop=1911,1075,x4,y2&amp;width=1911&amp;height=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
CNN&rsquo;s Chris Cuomo is showing off how good he feels after recovering from the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>During &ldquo;Cuomo Prime Time&rdquo; Monday, Cuomo continued to speak up about COVID-19.</p>
<p>“There’s no time to pretend. We have not met the moment. We have not prevailed on testing,&rdquo; he said in response to President Donald Trump’s recent comments about the coronavirus. &ldquo;None of the states that have re-opened, none, has the capacity to test and trace the way they need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CNN presenter showed off his dance moves in a TikTok last week with his teenage daughter Bella after a rough couple of months for him and his family&rsquo;s health. The virus first struck him, then his wife Cristina and then their 14-year-old son, Mario. The family has since recovered from the virus.</p>
<p>In the video posted to Bella&rsquo;s account on the video-sharing app, she is seen dancing before her dad grooves into frame before stopping and shaking his hips where he is blocking Bella. Bella then darts to the other side of the frame to be in the shot. They alternate swapping sides until the quick video, set to a remix of upbeat songs, comes to an end.</p>
<p>Days after busting a few moves with the fam, the journalist celebrated Mother&rsquo;s Day by sharing an Instagram of him, Cristina and his mother Matilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two women have shaped me to this point more than any other influences in my life. Yes, I had a great pop, loving siblings and now three jewels from God and the awesome love and sense of purpose that comes with children&hellip;but&hellip;my mother showed me what love was in action&rdquo; he wrote in the Sunday post. &quot;</p>
<p>Coping with COVID-19:Are you breathing correctly? Plus, more weekend tips and hacks</p>
<p>Fellow CNN personality Don Lemon praised Cuomo&rsquo;s loving post by writing in the comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My favorite of your posts ever!!!!!! Happy Mother’s Day to these two gorgeous, loving, brilliant, exceptional ladies,&rdquo; he wrote with different love-y emojis.</p>
<p>Cuomo also mentioned his family&rsquo;s COVID-19 journey in the post, praising his wife for all she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cristina has provided every thing and moment that matters to me in my life. And this covid cataclysm has proven once more how the missus puts everyone else first even to her own detriment&hellip;literally getting sick to get me well,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Shortly after her April 22 Instagram post revealing her son&rsquo;s diagnosis, Cristina made headlines for the alternative remedies she says she and her family used during their fight against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Her recommendations, including baths using disinfecting Clorox bleach, which the cleaning product company has specifically warned against, have received criticism from medical experts.</p>
