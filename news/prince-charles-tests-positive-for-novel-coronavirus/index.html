London (CNN) Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s son and the heir to the British throne, has tested positive for coronavirus and is now self-isolating in Scotland, his office announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales is only displaying mild symptoms and is otherwise in good health, Clarence House said in a statement. It is unknown how the 71-year-old caught the virus because of his recent busy schedule of public events.</p>
<p>The Queen, 93, remains in &ldquo;good health&rdquo; and is &ldquo;following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare,&rdquo; a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The monarch last saw Prince Charles briefly after an investiture ceremony for public awards at the palace in London on March 12. Charles has been advised he was contagious from March 13, a royal source told CNN.</p>
<p>It is unclear why Prince Charles was advised he was not contagious earlier. The coronavirus incubation period &ndash; the amount of time from exposure to symptoms &ndash; is usually around five or six days, with a maximum of around 12 days, according to research published this month in the medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine.</p>
<p>According to a royal source, Prince Charles started showing symptoms last weekend, meaning he could have been exposed before he saw the Queen on March 12.</p>
<p>He was tested on Monday and received the results on Tuesday, the source told CNN.</p>
<p>Prince Charles&rsquo;s office at Clarence House has not responded to CNN&rsquo;s query regarding the timeline. &ldquo;It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks,&rdquo; his office said earlier.</p>
<p>Both Public Health England and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there are indications people could be contagious before they show symptoms. While people are probably most contagious when they are symptomatic, scientists currently cannot pinpoint exactly when people can start spreading the disease.</p>
<p>Following his last public event on March 12, Prince Charles has had a number of private meetings with individuals, all of whom have been made aware of the situation.</p>
<p>He is self-isolating at his Scottish residence of Birkhall in Aberdeenshire, on the Queen&rsquo;s Balmoral estate, with a small number of staff keeping separate from him, the source added. His wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, is self-isolating separately. She has been tested and does not have the virus, according to the statement from Clarence House.</p>
<p>The tests were carried out by the National Health Service in Aberdeenshire, where the couple met the criteria required to be tested, the statement added.</p>

Hide Caption 52 of 53 Photos: The heir apparent: Britain&rsquo;s Prince Charles Prince Charles speaks at an event in London in March 2020. Later that month, it was announced that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. A statement on March 25 said that Charles was &ldquo;displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.&rdquo; Hide Caption 53 of 53</p>
<p>Prince Charles has not been to hospital, the royal source said Wednesday, adding that he was tested because of his age and medical history. He has spoken to the Queen and to his sons William and Harry, the source said. The medical advice he has been given is that this is &ldquo;unlikely to escalate into a more serious case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Charles continues work and is in &ldquo;good health and indeed good spirits,&rdquo; the royal source told CNN.</p>
<p>The prince has a reputation for working hard, and meets more members of the public than virtually any other member of the royal family. His aides are now racing to determine how, when and where he contracted the virus, and with whom he may have had contact since.</p>
<p>Despite the Queen being in her mid-90s, it is not known whether she has been tested.</p>
<p>The source asked not to be named discussing the royal family&rsquo;s medical condition.</p>
<p>Last week the palace said the Queen was canceling public events &ldquo;as a sensible precaution&rdquo; and that she and her husband, 98-year-old Prince Philip, moved to Windsor Castle on Thursday, a week earlier than planned. She is expected to stay there beyond the Easter period.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the palace as they moved to Windsor, the Queen said the world was entering &ldquo;a period of great concern and uncertainty&rdquo; and warned that many would need to &ldquo;find new ways of staying in touch with each other and making sure that loved ones are safe.&rdquo; She said she and her family were ready to play their part.</p>
<p>Prince Charles is the eldest child of the Queen and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. As someone over 70, he is considered to be at higher risk than average for coronavirus.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, his office said he was not yet self-isolating because UK government and medical advice at the time were not advising over-70s to do so.</p>
<p>On March 13, Prince Charles and his wife announced they were canceling their spring tour due to the escalating coronavirus pandemic. The pair had been set to visit Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cyprus and Jordan.

<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-undertakes-a-series-of-news-photo-1585144656.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.331xh;0,0.0392xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Prince Charles is in “good spirits” despite testing positive for the novel coronavirus after experiencing mild symptoms, a palace source said today. The source said the Prince’s condition is “unlikely to escalate into a more serious case,” and he continues to feel well enough to work from his Scottish home, Birkhall.</p>
<p>Charles, 71, is now in isolation on the estate in Aberdeenshire, including from wife Camilla, 72, who tested negative for the virus. A source said she remains “upbeat” and the couple are following guidelines to isolate for seven days.</p>

<p>The Prince did not go to hospital and was tested at Birkhall on Monday after experiencing symptoms over the weekend. The palace said that he met the NHS criteria for testing, which is understood to take into account age and medical history, although aides would not go into details of his about medical information or symptoms.</p>
<p>Scotland’s Chief Medical officer has also issued a statement, which reads:</p>
<p>“Dr Catherine Calderwood, Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, has confirmed that Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay, were tested for Covid-19 for clinical reasons. She is very pleased to confirm that both remain in good health.”</p>
<p>Prince Charles received his test result on Tuesday, and has spoken to sons William and Harry as well as his mother the Queen to share the news with them.</p>
<p>The Prince last met the Queen in person briefly on the morning of March 12; however, a source said that the most cautious estimate given by doctors is that the Prince would have been infectious no earlier than March 13. On March 13, he traveled to his Gloucestershire residence, Highgrove, where he held meetings with a small number of people who have been informed of his diagnosis. He and Camilla have been in Birkhall since Sunday, March 22.</p>
<p>Before leaving London, the Prince had a busy week of engagements commencing on Monday, March 9, with the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey. The following day he was at a Water Aid event with Prince Albert of Monaco who has also tested positive for the virus. He also attended the Prince’s Trust Awards on March 11, and his last public engagement was a dinner at Mansion House in support of the Australian Bushfires relief fund on March 12.</p>
<p>In a statement today a spokesman pointed out: “It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.”

<p>It is believed he suffered mild symptoms over the weekend while at Highgrove House in Gloucester and flew privately to Scotland on Sunday night where he was tested on Monday.</p>
<p>It is understood he is in good spirits and remains up and about.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace has since confirmed the Queen remains in &ldquo;good health&rdquo; after heading to Windsor last Thursday with Prince Philip a week earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Charles most recently saw the Queen &ldquo;briefly&rdquo; on March 12.</p>
<p>Medical experts believe the earliest Charles would have been contagious was March 13.</p>
<p>Charles has also spoken to both of his sons, Prince William, 37, in Norfolk and Prince Harry, 35, in Canada after the news.</p>
<p>Confirming the news today, Clarence House said: &ldquo;The Prince of Wales has tested positive for Coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been displaying mild symptoms but otherwise remains in good health and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another six members of staff now isolating with them.</p>
<p>Clarence House added: &ldquo;In accordance with Government and medical advice, the Prince and the Duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire where they met the criteria required for testing.</p>
<p>“It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HIGH ALERT</p>
<p>The royal met with Prince Albert of Monaco, who later tested positive for coronavirus, on March 10.</p>
<p>Charles saw the Queen &ldquo;briefly&rdquo; two days later on March 12, before his last public appearance at an event for the bushfires affected Australia.</p>
<p>A source said: &ldquo;He has displayed mild symptoms he is in good spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is working and continuing to work for the last few days as usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medical advice is that it is unlikely that his condition will not escalate into a more serious case here on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince had been avoiding shaking hands with members of the public at a number of events recently, instead choosing to use the namaste gesture.</p>
<p>He last appeared in public with the Queen, along with princes William and Harry and other senior royals, at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 9.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Buckingham Palace said: &ldquo;Her Majesty the Queen remains in good health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Queen last saw the Prince of Wales briefly after the investiture on the morning of the 12th March and is following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They will not comment on whether the Queen has been tested for coronavirus.</p>
<p>Prince William remains in Norfolk meaning the heirs to the throne are not in physical contact.</p>

<p>It comes as the UK death toll hit 422 yesterday in the biggest daily leap of fatalities.</p>
<p>There are now fears that half of the UK population may have already contracted the virus.</p>
<p>University of Oxford research suggested the disease could have become prevalent in the country two months before the first case was diagnosed.</p>
<p>Sunetra Gupta, professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford, led the study and says the UK must now increase testing to discover the true stage of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need immediately to begin large-scale serological surveys - antibody testing - to assess what stage of the epidemic we are in now,&rdquo; he told the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The global death toll from the deadly bug has already hit more than 18,000 across the globe.</p>
