<p>&ldquo;gifts for children whose parents you don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo; So the giant inflatable dinosaur for the family with a large but crammed with stuff house. The little things that toddlers push around as they learn to walk, but the one that makes lots of noise as it does it. That sort of thing. I&rsquo;ve always thought my niece and nephew would like a mini drone, but they live in NYC so it is illegal. But now they are going upstate for two months and if I sent it right as they arrived, the kids could play with it (them, I think some come in two packs) for as long as they last. I expect they would break long before the end of August. Can I do this without asking permission? I love the kids, but I don&rsquo;t dislike their parents. It seems to maybe fall into the &ldquo;gifts for children whose parents you don&rsquo;t like&rdquo; category. The kids are old enough not to scream and cry when the toy breaks.

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/16/us/politics/16lincoln-memo/16lincoln-memo-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Abraham Lincoln may have died 155 years ago, but everyone still wants his endorsement.</p>
<p>He is the star of a new campaign ad for Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, that juxtaposes classic Lincoln phrases (“a house divided against itself cannot stand”) with clips of a peevish President Trump doing things like directing his vice president to ignore governors of virus-ravaged states “if they don’t treat you right.”</p>
<p>He is the namesake for The Lincoln Project, a venture from a group of dismayed Republicans who are seeking to ensure Mr. Trump’s defeat in November. (“We look to Lincoln as our guide and inspiration,” they wrote of their effort.)</p>
<p>And from the other side of the argument, there was Mr. Trump himself earlier this month at the magisterial Lincoln Memorial, that great secular temple to American unity and hope, musing to a Fox News audience about how he sees Lincoln in himself.</p>
<p>“Look, I am greeted with a hostile press the likes of which no president has ever seen,” Mr. Trump said, gesturing to the towering figure looming behind him. “The closest would be that gentleman right up there. They always said Lincoln — nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse.”

In existential crises, we look for historical grounding, and to markers in time for guidance. We may need state-of-the-art new vaccines, but we also need old wisdom. And in the quiet, if unbearable, tension caused by the realization that our society is structurally broken, we need the ancient voices. “In the mystery of prophecy,” wrote the theologian Abraham Heschel, “we are in the presence of the central story of mankind … In decisive hours of history it dawns upon us that we would not trade certain lines in the book of Isaiah for the Seven Wonders of the World.”</p>
<p>The menu of choices is vast. “There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.” Or, “And they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and the spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore.” Or, “Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places made plain.” Or, “I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.” Whether chastening or comforting or impossibly challenging, we may find solace in the prophet’s oracles, so many of which are tales of destruction and rebirth. They are just now profoundly useful to our own hour of history.</p>
<p>They were useful as well in the era of the Civil War, certainly one of our existential crises. Imagine how differently American history might have unfolded if the slaveholders’ republic known as the Confederacy had won the war. In the pivotal election year of 1864, it was still possible for the South to win. A wartime general election in the midst of civil war was unprecedented. Abraham Lincoln, running for a second term, faced stiff opposition to gain the nomination within his own party; when he overcame that, he encountered a bold and overtly racist campaign conducted by the Democratic Party, which ran the former Union General George B. McClellan for president. Democrats portrayed Republicans as radicals so devoted to racial equality that they would turn the country into a sea of “miscegenation” between blacks and whites. The Democrats also promised a vague negotiated peace with the Confederacy that would leave slavery maimed but intact.</p>
<p>The war was in a terrible stalemate in Virginia and Georgia, and death tolls had reached a horrific scale. Many Northerners could no longer bear the suffering and loss in that worst summer in American military history: In the six weeks from May 4 to June 15, the combined Union and Confederate casualties in the Virginia Overland Campaign reached 88,000 dead, wounded, or missing. The dying continued on all fronts through the election in the fall.</p>
<p>Stymied by their own creation—black freedom—some Republicans tried to skirt around or deny that they were the party of emancipation. But the freedom of the slaves was on the ballot in 1864, as was the future existence of a United States in a “rebirth,” as Lincoln had famously said in the Gettysburg Address, somehow around a more capacious vision of freedom. Events on battlefields may have saved Lincoln’s reelection as much as anything: Mobile Bay fell to the Union navy in late August and, most crucial of all, Atlanta fell to General William Sherman in early September. The war now seemed winnable. Hope suddenly reemerged along with the death tolls.

<h3 id="the-fight-to-define-romans-13">&ldquo;The Fight to Define Romans 13&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3a5EZiXStZIqjfsx0m-R-EYvmCM=/0x139:4840x2660/960x500/media/img/mt/2018/06/AP_18164752197587/original.jpg" alt="img">
There were at least three other commonly held interpretations of Romans 13 as it related to the Fugitive Slave Act. Illinois minister Asa Donaldson took the quiescent view that “the scriptures everywhere treat the worst of human governments as better than anarchy,” and that because no one was forced to participate in “buying and selling slaves” everyone was bound to avoid “all acts of hostility against the laws of the land, however corrupt.” Many anti-slavery activists, by contrast, held that the moral law God had ordained took precedence over the government leaders he had ordained. So without threatening to dissolve the union, they refused to participate in bringing “the fugitive slave back to the master and the bondage” and were willing to “suffer the penalty” for civil disobedience rather than “commit the crime” of helping to re-enslave a person. One Vermont author, for example, argued that the United States, “with its enslavement of the Africans and its extermination of the Indians,” stood outside Paul’s command to obedience. But the most radical of abolitionists came to believe that the Bible did justify slavery, and rejected the Bible on precisely those grounds.</p>
<p>Black Christians were accustomed to hearing from white slaveholders a bowlderized gospel that emphasized texts like Romans 13 and Colossians 3 (“Servants, obey in all things your masters.”) But their own readings of the Bible emphasized the book&rsquo;s themes of deliverance from bondage. The Exodus narrative was a more central text than Romans 13. The black abolitionist David Walker compared the United States to slaveholding Egypt and enslaved African Americans to the children of Israel. “All persons who are acquainted with history, and particularly the Bible,” he wrote, and “who can dispense with prejudice long enough to admit that we are men &hellip; and believe that we feel for our fathers, mothers, wives and children, as well as the whites do for theirs” could see plainly that the Bible was on the side of the oppressed and not the oppressor. As Maria Stewart put it in an 1831 address suffused with scripture, “You may kill, tyrannize, and oppress as much as you choose, until our cry shall come up before the throne of God.”</p>
<p>The debates in the 1850s over whether Romans 13 required obedience or resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act, and more broadly over whether the Bible supported enslavement or abolition, fractured the Bible’s authority in the public sphere. Americans’ allegiance to Romans 13 in a democratic society grew even more tenuous. While Southern Christians did keep defending slavery from the Bible even after the Civil War was over, slaveholders could no longer claim that they were “the powers that be.” The text never entered the public discourse again the way that it had in the 1850s.</p>
<p>Where does Jeff Sessions fit in this brief history of Romans 13? Sessions, like so many other Americans throughout history, thinks he has the Bible on his side. The verses Sessions chose to cite, and the interpretation that he has given them, is part of the broader Trump administration strategy of playing to the fears and identities of American evangelicals, who have been bringing Romans 13 back into public discourse since the rise of law-and-order politics and the Christian Right. But the Bible is a text less often read than read into. As many of his “church friends” persist in pointing out, Sessions did not cite the verse later in Romans 13 where Paul writes that God’s laws “are summed up in this word, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself,’” with the word “neighbor” echoing both parable of the Good Samaritan and the countless verses in the Law and the Prophets on treating the stranger and the immigrant with mercy. Sessions may claim the Bible’s contested authority, but what the attorney general actually has on his side is the thread of American history that justifies oppression and domination in the name of law and order.</p>

<h3 id="stop-weaponizing-the-bible-for-trump-no-politician-is-a-cyrus-david-or-caesar">&ldquo;Stop weaponizing the Bible for Trump: No politician is a Cyrus, David or Caesar&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/77SY75USFII6TFLKRDBJDK24HA.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
In March, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sparked further debate by suggesting Trump may be a modern-day Esther, raised up by God to save the Jewish people from Iran. Identifying a biblical type elevates Trump from the mundane to the sacred, imbuing the president with a transcendent, divinely ordained mission of biblical proportions.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, some of Trump’s biblically literate critics have drawn analogies between the president and Scripture’s villains. For instance, in a 2016 editorial in the Hill, Christian writer Rebecca Cusey likened Trump not to Esther but to Haman — the evil, conniving antagonist in the book of Esther who plotted to massacre the Jews.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>So, is Trump Haman or Esther? Or is he a Cyrus, David or Caesar? Our answer: None of the above. We should resist the temptation to link the president — or any politician — with biblical types.</p>
<p>To avoid the weaponizing of Scripture and the sacralizing of politics, we urge our fellow Christians to refrain from using biblical typologies in political life.</p>
<p>That’s not to say we’re against typological thinking altogether. The New Testament is full of typology. Early followers of Christ saw him as the fulfillment of people, events, symbols and institutions in the Hebrew Bible. Jesus was the second Adam, the greater Moses, the better Promised Land, the perfect sacrifice and the true temple. These typologies linked past with present, stitching together the two testaments.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Nor are we against comparisons with biblical types in moral and spiritual formation. After all, Christians strive to cultivate, for instance, “the patience of Job” and “the wisdom of Solomon” and chiefly “the love of Christ.” Emulating the character of commendable biblical characters is part and parcel of Christian piety.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The problem with biblical typologies comes when we try to link them to the political leaders and causes of our day. Whereas New Testament typologies pointed to spiritual claims about Christ and his church and carried for Christians the authority of divine inspiration, typologies of the Trump-as-Esther sort serve partisan agendas and rely on subjective interpretation. As the historian John Coffey argues in his book “Exodus and Liberation,” “The problem was that political typology was inherently debatable.”</p>
<p>It was also deadly. In the 17th century, Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, railed against fellow Christians who used typology to justify killing, coercion and exile for matters of belief.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Williams emphasized the essential political discontinuity between biblical Israel and the post-biblical period. Williams rejected the Puritan idea that the American colonies were a New Israel and decried the dispossession of the American Indians.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>For Williams, biblical kings such as David and Solomon prefigured Christ, not any other future leader. And all the miraculous wars and deliverances in Israel’s history prefigured the spiritual battles of Christ’s church, not the political and military battles of modern states. As Williams put it, “what Country now is Israel’s Parallel and Antitype, but that holy mysticall Nation the Church of God.”</p>
<p>If we search Scripture for parallels to contemporary politics we encounter an inescapable practical problem: As a massive, varied book compiled over centuries, the Bible contains a vast array of possible biblical types that one can cherry-pick to legitimate just about any political leader or partisan agenda.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The biblical data available for political typologizing is simply too plentiful — and too malleable and too potent — to be used responsibly in contemporary politics. Consider how easy it is to find a plausible biblical type for any modern politician. The biblical kingdoms of Israel and Judah had more than 40 monarchs. There were good kings, bad kings, good-and-bad kings, good kings who suffered and bad kings who prospered.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Beyond the Israelite kings, the number of biblical types multiplies when Israel’s many enemies are considered: Amalekites, Babylonians, Canaanites, Edomites, Moabites, Philistines and Romans, to name a few. Each group had political and religious leaders who can be, and have been, used by Christians to justify a mind-boggling diversity of often contradictory political agendas.</p>
<p>Pharaoh is a recurring favorite biblical villain. Understandably, he has a particular resonance for the oppressed. The Bible consistently challenges the oppressor, and so it’s entirely fitting that the oppressed have for centuries invoked biblical motifs and metaphors to fight injustice.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But the use of pharaoh, like other biblical characters, is often hazardous. The narrative is easily turned on the one making the comparison. “Pharaoh” fought on many sides during the British Civil Wars. Revolutionary Americans saw him in several places: Parliament, George III, slaveholders. The links between the exodus and abolition were frequently made throughout the American Civil War, but some typed Abraham Lincoln as a pharaoh because of what they viewed as his imperious policies.</p>

<p>In March, former British foreign minister Boris Johnson invoked the central characters in the Exodus in an appeal for Brexit. In a piece for The Daily Telegraph, he wrote, “It is time for the PM to channel the spirit of Moses in Exodus, and say to Pharaoh in Brussels — LET MY PEOPLE GO.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s rhetoric placed Britain in the grand biblical narrative of liberation, implicitly elevating Brexit to a supernatural mission beyond reproach.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But anyone with a basic level of biblical literacy can play this game. Cheeky critics quickly pointed out that liberation from this European “Pharaoh” might entail decades of isolation in the wilderness until the United Kingdom’s leaders have died off.</p>
<p>When we weaponize biblical types and stone our enemies with them, our opponents can simply pick them up and throw them back at us.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The commonness of the political invocation of Pharaoh and other biblical types is basically the Judeo-Christian equivalent of Godwin’s Law. In 1990 — well over a decade before the rise of social media — the prominent American lawyer, Mike Godwin, observed that, “As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In our highly religionized politics there seems to be a corollary law at work: The longer biblically literate people engage in arguments about politics, the probability of a typological use of the Bible approaches 1. Whether comparisons involve negative biblical types such as Pharaoh and Haman or positive types such as Esther or Moses, they short-circuit discussion by sacralizing or demonizing political actors and agendas.</p>
<p>Godwin has said his “law” was an attempt to encourage “folks who glibly compared someone else to Hitler or to Nazis to think a bit harder about the Holocaust.” Historian Gavriel Rosenfeld echoed this point in a 2018 article for the Atlantic, cautioning that commentators who might want to make an analogy to Hitler “should proceed with a little more humility, a little more circumspection, and, perhaps, a little more creativity.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Rosenfeld’s point also offers good advice for those inclined to defend or malign a politician with reference to a biblical type. There’s no way to eliminate biblical references from our political discourse, nor would it be desirable to do so. The Bible offers centuries of reflection and wisdom on human affairs. But our ability to conclusively identify a contemporary political leader, movement or event with a particular type in the Bible is severely limited and inherently hazardous.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Typological thinking often goes horribly wrong, sometimes excusing terrible injustice and frequently backfiring. Instead, we should cultivate the humility, circumspection and creativity to discuss politicians as real, complicated people, not singular types.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the 2020 election, the choice will not be between Pharaoh or Moses, Haman or Esther, and Caesar or Christ. There will be no candidates of biblical proportions.</p>

<h3 id="mayor-petes-bible-study-ignores-sexual-immorality">&ldquo;Mayor Pete&rsquo;s Bible study ignores sexual immorality&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2020/02/22/B3-piper_c0-136-1800-1186_s1200x700.jpg?9880e4a0925034175082b306bdc75ef4e536ddd3" alt="img">
ANALYSIS/OPINION:</p>
<p>During the past couple of weeks, Pete Buttigieg has been explicitly clear in saying he doesn’t think any true Christian can support the Republican Party.</p>
<p>During recent CNN town hall meetings, Mr. Buttigieg said the following: “If you belong to a faith tradition that tells you that so much depends on how we make ourselves useful to those who are marginalized … I can’t imagine that requires you to be anywhere near this president or what the Republican Party has become … I’m not going to tell other Christians how to be Christian, but I will say [that] I cannot find any compatibility between the way this president conducts himself and anything that I find in Scripture.”</p>
<p>In that candidate Buttigieg just opened the door, via curative admissibility, to the idea that the Bible is the only measure of true Christianity, we can logically assume that he is interested in considering what the entire counsel of Scripture actually says about the matter. After all, it would seem that even Mayor Pete just admitted that it doesn’t matter what you or I think, or even what he thinks. What matters is what Scripture says. Right?</p>
<p>Well, with the Bible as our guide, one thing seems irrefutably clear. No one can claim to be a Christian who hasn’t “died to self,” become a “new creation in Christ” and fully submitted to the teachings of the Bible.</p>
<p>It is simply a theological and ontological fact that you can’t claim Christianity if your default position always runs contrary to the admonitions of Jesus and those of his chosen apostles.</p>
<p>For example, all the earliest instructions from the likes of Peter, Paul, John, James and Jude, indicate that a true follower of Christ cannot continue to imbibe his passions and peccadilloes. The church fathers made this crystal clear. Christians, by definition, are required to confess their sins, not affirm them. Christianity is not hyphenated. Christians find their identity in Christ, not their inclinations, sexual or otherwise. Christians are “born again,” they are not “born that way.”</p>
<p>Here is just a sampling of what the saints told the first Christians in Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, Galatia and Jerusalem regarding their Christian identity and their corresponding moral obligations.</p>
<p>“For this is the will of God … that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body …”</p>
<p>“[Do not be like those who are] futile in their thinking, [those whose] hearts are darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools … God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves. Because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie … God gave them up to a debased mind …”</p>
<p>“For if God did not spare the ancient world … [and] if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, … then the Lord knows how to hold the unrighteous for punishment on the day of judgment. This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the flesh and despise authority.”</p>
<p>“There will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.”</p>
<p>“They promise freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity — for people are slaves to whatever has mastered them …”</p>
<p>“Do not be conformed to this world but be transformed.”</p>
<p>“You were taught … to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the attitude of your minds, and to put on the new self …”</p>
<p>“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here …”</p>
<p>“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”</p>
<p>“If anyone teaches a different doctrine … he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has … a depraved mind and is deprived of the truth.”</p>
<p>You see, at the end of the day, there is nothing in the Bible that tells us that the Democratic solution to serving the “marginalized” is somehow superior to the Republican solution. In fact, there is much in Scripture to the contrary. Both progressives and conservatives can claim membership in the body of Christ when it comes to employing different methods in reaching out to those in need of help. We have the same goals but just differ a bit on how to accomplish them.</p>
<p>But there is everything in the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, that makes it very clear that those who refuse to comply with God’s oft-repeated sexual standards and, instead, celebrate and flaunt their defiance are not in Christ.</p>
<p>God does not beat around the bush. No one who has a “debased mind;” one who “scoffs” at the truth; who is “corrupted by deceitful desires;” and who defines himself by his libido rather than his Lord, is a Christian.</p>
<p>After all, it is Jesus, himself, who makes this abundantly clear when he concludes the very Scriptures to which Mr. Buttigieg just appealed: “Outside are the dogs … those who practice sexual immorality … and deception.” (Revelation 22)</p>
<p>Welcome to the Bible, Mayor Pete. I’m glad you brought it up.</p>

<h3 id="75-things-to-do-while-youre-stuck-at-home-during-the-covid-19-virus-crisis---daily-leader">&ldquo;75 things to do while you’re ‘stuck’ at home during the COVID-19 virus crisis - Daily Leader&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dailyleader.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2020/03/WEB-75-things-5.jpg" alt="img">
OK, so you’re stuck at home (or at work with nothing to do) because of this whole coronavirus COVID-19 scare. Maybe you’re an introvert and social distancing is what you’ve been training for your whole life, or maybe you’re an extrovert and you’re already stir crazy 30 minutes into this.</p>
<p>Don’t fear! We have you covered. Here are some suggestions — some serious, some silly — of things to do while you’re stuck at home.</p>
<p>1 Work the crossword and sudoku puzzles in The Daily Leader.</p>
<p>2 Try a new way to make your coffee or tea — use a French press, or a percolator or boil it over a fire in the backyard. Like a fire in a firepit — don’t just set your backyard on fire in order to try coffee. Or tea.</p>
<p>3 Start a journal, blog or diary about anything you want to write about, even if it’s just for your eyes only.</p>
<p>4 Tune up that guitar or other instrument and learn something new.</p>
<p>5 Pick a website at random and see how many times you can find the word “canceled,” or something similar.</p>
<p>6 Download one of the many free classic movie apps on your phone or tablet and watch a movie you’ve never seen.</p>
<p>7 Call someone you haven’t spoken to in a long time and reconnect. If needed, make apologies or offer forgiveness if that’s why you haven’t spoken.</p>
<p>8 Write a haiku or a limerick. Read it aloud in your best Shakespearean accent.</p>
<p>9 Read a magazine cover to cover.</p>
<p>10 Learn some new phrases in a foreign language — like “Hast du Toilettenpapier?” in German (“Do you have any toilet paper?”).</p>
<p>11 Read one of the Psalms in the Holy Bible. Originally songs, imagine what the psalm may have sounded like when sung.</p>
<p>12 Pull out an old photo album (physical or digital) and flip through some memories.</p>
<p>13 Listen to an audiobook. You can download lots for free, or borrow for free from libraries, like the Lincoln County Public Library at <a href="https://www.llf.lib.ms.us/ebooks">https://www.llf.lib.ms.us/ebooks</a>.</p>
<p>14 Write letters (actual letters or cards) to one or more people in the service industry, like the person who is still out there collecting your bags of trash.</p>
<p>15 Learn calligraphy.</p>
<p>16 Teach yourself how to write — or toss a ball or anything else — with your non-dominant hand.</p>
<p>17 Play a long board game with the people “stuck” at home with you.</p>
<p>18 Tell a story as a family. One person starts with a phrase or sentence, the next continues with an added phrase/sentence, and so on. Continue until a logical place to end. Make it a funny or scary story, or whatever your group enjoys.</p>
<p>19 Watch a TV show on mute. Create your own dialogue.</p>
<p>20 Sort out that junk drawer. Or drawers.</p>
<p>21 Organize your socks; see if you can finally find mates for them all.</p>
<p>22 Make sock puppets out of the non-matched socks, or ball toys for your pets.</p>
<p>23 Clean your pet’s aquarium or bed.</p>
<p>24 Bake a cake or some cookies.</p>
<p>25 Watch a movie in a language you don’t know.</p>

<p>36 Exercise.</p>

<p>45 Find out what local businesses are still open and support them as best you can.</p>
<p>46 Call your neighbors — especially the elderly, those with small children or who have special health needs — and see if they’re OK.</p>
