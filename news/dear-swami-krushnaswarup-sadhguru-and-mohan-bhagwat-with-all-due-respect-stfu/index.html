<p>When Indian actors and stand-up comedians began expressing their opinions about religion and politics, they were told to STFU. The argument was that they weren’t qualified to talk about it. But what other choice did they have, considering their livelihood is being usurped by our current crop of politicians and godmen, who’ve taken their spot as comedians cracking jokes that’ll make you laugh for days. In fact, this past week has been just stellar in terms of comedy—RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat blamed education for high divorce rates; one Swami Krushnaswarup Dasji said women who cook food during periods would be reborn as bitches; and an old video of Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev had him saying that women produce two different kinds of breast milk from each of their breasts.</p>
<p>Did you see that? Was that hilarious or what? Aren’t these men the real funny guys who deserve their own shows on primetime television? Kapil Sharma who? ICYMI, time for some context.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, shall we?</p>
<p>This Indian Yogi is a man of many talents—he can comment with as much half-baked knowledge on women as he can on CAA. Recently, a 2017 video of Sadhguru began attracting criticism online for making ridiculous statements. In the video, he is heard claiming that when a woman delivers twins—a boy and a girl—one breast produces one type of milk and the other produces other type of milk. Naturally, this HAS to be a part of his standup comedy set, because how else do you explain making such claims during—wait for it—a conference of gynaecologists?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a woman delivers twins, one breast will produce one type of milk and the other will produce other type of milk&rdquo; - Actual quote from Jaggi</p>
<p>This guy is invited to national conference of Gynaecologists as a speaker. pic.twitter.com/ZaZgHzpt3K — Indian Atheists (@IndianAtheists) February 16, 2020</p>
<p>Now your insides might be bursting with laughter, while trying to wonder if this shit is indeed scientifically correct. Well, I did the requisite research (unlike Sadhguru), and discovered that while lactating mothers do produce milk with different nutrients depending on their own dietary intakes, the baby’s gender and needs, there is no proof to suggest what Sadhguru JV has so confidently proclaimed is true.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this isn’t the first time the man has recited fiction with axiomatic conviction, which makes us believe he has an elevated sense of humour. A cult favourite joke of his is the one where he urged people to celebrate Valentine’s Day as ‘Parents Worship Day’.</p>
<p>Our next guest needs some introduction, especially if you haven’t been reading news lately. Because boy, he’s been the talk of the town.</p>
<p>Meet Swami Krushnaswarup Dasji of the Swaminarayan Temple in Bhuj, Gujarat.</p>
<p>Swamiji belongs to the ‘Nar-Narayan Devgadi’ of the Swami Narayan sect, but as a side-hustle, he is a secret keeper of the Gods, and has read all the scriptures that Gods faxed to us humans from heaven. And just because this bibliophile has read all of the scriptures, he feels entitled to tell menstruating women what they can and cannot do.</p>
<p>In a sermon that Ahmedabad Mirror reports is from last year, Swamiji can be heard preaching the Bhuj ratri sabha that if a man eats food that is cooked by a woman who is on her periods, then he is destined to be reborn as an ox in his next birth. <em>insert laugh track here</em></p>
<p>That’s not all. The highly clairvoyant Swamiji also declared that if a menstruating woman cooks for her husband and feeds him, then she will be born as a bitch. Wait, it sounds super sophisticated when you say it in English. The word he used was ‘kutri’.</p>
<p>Consider yourself lucky that Swami Krushnaswarup Dasji broke his 10-year-long promise to impart this vital piece of information to us. Apparently, the saints had prohibited him from divulging these precious secrets of the religion. But Swamij had to do it, because otherwise how will we learn? (Thanks, man, but that ship might’ve sailed in my previous janam, because I’ve been already been told in this janam that I maybe a bitch).</p>
<p>But hey, that was rib-tickling! Especially, the bit of improvisation from the Bhuj institute (which is run by the same Swaminarayan Bhuj Mandir) earlier this week, where 68 female hostelites were forced to strip, to check if they were menstruating or not. Turns out, the college principal and staff took Swamiji’s jokes about menstruation seriously.</p>
<p>But, don’t LMAO just yet, because this final performer will bring the house down. His jokes might feel a little orthodox and conservative, but hey, a performer must know his audience. And a majority of this country is both those things.</p>
<p>RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, ladies and gents, would like you to know that divorce is more rampant in educated, affluent families.</p>
<p>And technically, he is right. Not only can affluent families afford education, thereby enabling them to understand that divorce isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, but they can also afford expensive divorce lawyers and court cases instead of dying everyday in an unhappy marriage.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, you don&rsquo;t need to be educated to understand why this is funny. But it sure helps if you plan to be some kind of a leader in this country. God knows, we need politicians and godmen who&rsquo;ve actually read books in their lives and whose CVs are more substantial than their rap criminal sheets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I hate to break it to you, but these men, and a lot of our politicians who make such preposterous statements on a national platform, aren&rsquo;t joking.</p>
<p>I wish they were, because, you know, women can take a good joke unlike men. But they&rsquo;re dead serious. These men neither understand women, nor do they care about their upliftment. For them feminism is unnecessary din, equality is out of the question, and feminists are just women who need to STFU (just like the comedians who troll them after they&rsquo;ve made these statements). They cloak their sermons in a garb of progressiveness and upliftment of the society, but how can they achieve that when they&rsquo;re alienating half of its population with their bigoted ideals?</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s worse is, their claims are evidently based off of ancient regressive notions that birthed the very patriarchy that subdued women. Who came up with these scriptures in the first place? Men. Isn&rsquo;t that convenient? Women are either seen as goddesses, put on a pedestal and turned into these perfect beings who should do no wrong. Or they are treated as sinners, who menstruate as a form of penance and who are destined to remain under the dominion of men because they are weak and need to be protected.</p>
<p>As a woman who has to wake up everyday to news and videos about entitled men claiming they know what&rsquo;s best for women, here&rsquo;s a heartfelt message&hellip;.</p>
<p>Dear Swami Krushnaswarup, Sadhguru and Mohan Bhagwat, and all other men who think like them, with all due respect, please STFU. You really do not know what you are talking about, and ignorant ramblings are the last thing we need right now. In case you didn&rsquo;t get the memo, the world has zero tolerance for fake news anymore.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re supposed to be headed into a future that is bright and better than our past, and it is strong, educated, free women who will lead us into it. As for you, you&rsquo;re leading us back into the dark ages with your regressive thoughts. If anything, THAT is against our scriptures. In fact, I&rsquo;ve even got a Sanskrit mantra, straight outta the the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad for you, that is like a Google Map of the path that we are supposed to follow, led by God Herself (I mean, of course, she is a woman):</p>
<p>asato mā sadgamaya,</p>
<p>tamaso mā jyotirgamaya,</p>
<p>mṛtyor mā&rsquo;mṛtaṃ gamaya,</p>
<p>which translates to,</p>
<p>From falsehood lead me to truth,</p>
<p>From darkness lead me to the light,</p>
<p>From death lead me to immortality.</p>
<p>Now who&rsquo;s on the wrong side of the scriptures, eh?</p>
