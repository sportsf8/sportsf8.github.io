Robert Irwin got his learner's licence and, in a sweet tribute, he is learning to drive the ute that once belonged to his late father, Steve Irwin.

The youngster shared a photo on Instagram of his first time behind the wheel, which comes three months after his 16th birthday on December 1.

"Here we go! I'm so excited to finally start driving... and happy to be learning in the best car — Dad's old Ute!!" he gushed on Instagram, alongside a photo of himself standing by the utility vehicle with the 'L' plates clearly displayed.

"So proud of you!!!!" his big sister Bindi Irwin, 21, commented on the photo.

The siblings lost wildlife warrior Steve in a tragic accident in 2006, when Bindi was just eight years old and Robert was two. Steve was 44 when he died.

During Steve's memorial service, his beloved ute was front and centre of the event, which was held at the Crocoseum in Australia Zoo — a wildlife reserve run by the family on Queensland's Sunshine Coast.

Back in 2016, it was Bindi who first inherited the car from their father. Then 17, she even used Steve's ute to take her provisional licence test, which she passed first go.

"It was wonderful to take my test in St George and pass the first time and in my Dad's giant old ute!" she said of the milestone moment on Instagram.

No word yet if the beloved ute will make a cameo at Bindi's upcoming wedding to Chandler Powell, but the Irwin family will make sure Steve's presence is felt during the ceremony.

"We want to acknowledge Steve by all of us lighting this candle for him," his widow Terri Irwin told the Courier Mail this week. "I guess in some ways it's not necessary because Steve will be there anyway. I believe the people we love always are."
