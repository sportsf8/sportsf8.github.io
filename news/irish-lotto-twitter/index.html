<p>A LUCKY punter has won €1 million in the Lotto Plus 1 draw tonight - but there were no winners of the €3.6million top prize.</p>
<p>In the main lottery, the numbers pulled were 7, 14, 20, 23, 27, 46 and the bonus was 25.</p>
<p>1 The numbers have been drawn in tonight&rsquo;s Irish Lotto as a jackpot worth nearly €3.6 million was up for grabs Credit: @NationalLottery</p>
<p>In the Lotto Plus One, where €1 million is the top prize on offer, tonight’s numbers were 10, 14, 19, 21, 37, 38 and the bonus was 1.</p>
<p>And in the Lotto Plus 2, where €250,000 could be won, the numbers drawn were 18, 20, 24, 31, 34, 39 and the bonus was 11.</p>
<p>One lucky punter managed to scoop €1 million prize in the Lotto Plus 1 draw.</p>
<p>The Irish National Lottery took to Twitter to congratulate the winner.</p>
<p>They said in a Tweet: &ldquo;We have a winner!!! Congratulations to an online player who has won the €1 MILLION top prize on tonight’s Lotto Plus 1 draw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although no one won the main Lotto jackpot, in total, over 73,000 players won prizes.</p>
<p>EUR A WINNER</p>
<p>A winning EuroMillions ticket worth €500,000 was sold in a Meath shop, Lotto bosses have revealed.</p>
<p>The lucky slip was purchased at Day Today News in the Johnstown Shopping Centre in Navan.</p>
<p>Padraig Lonergan, who co-owns the Day Today News with Philip Keegan, said: “It’s the first time we have sold a major National Lottery prize winning ticket in our 15 years of business so we can’t wait to spread the news to our customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of our trade is from the local area and more so since the current health restrictions, so I’d guess it is a Navan local.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However I’ve no idea who it could be but whoever the winner is, I hope the €500,000 brings them a lot of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The winning EuroMillions Plus numbers for last night’s draw were: 03, 08, 09, 19 and 49.</p>
<p>NEW MILLIONAIRE</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ireland&rsquo;s newest millionaire will have to wait to claim their fortune as the Covid-19 pandemic continues.</p>
<p>The Kerry winner of a mega €9.7 million made contact with Lotto bosses last week.</p>
<p>The player won big on the Saturday night draw after buying their golden ticket at Daly’s Supervalu store in Killarney, Co Kerry.</p>
<p>The €9,772,175 million prize is Kerry’s largest ever Lotto jackpot win.</p>
<p>A National Lottery spokesperson said: &ldquo;We can confirm that we have been contacted this afternoon by the lucky ticketholder and arrangements are currently being made for the claim to be made once restrictions are lifted due to the on-going public health emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lotto players in Dublin are being asked to check their National Lottery accounts and emails as two different players from the capital won the Lotto Plus 2 top prize of €250,000 and the Lotto Match 5 + Bonus prize of €37,258 in last Wednesday’s draw.</p>
<p>A National Lottery spokesperson advised that the winners will have already been notified by email.</p>
<p>They said: &ldquo;These two lucky winners from last night’s Lotto draw have already been alerted that they have won their respective prizes of €250,000 and €37,258 and what a nice email to receive!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are appealing to all of our online players who live in Dublin to check their emails to see if they are the lucky winners.&rdquo;
