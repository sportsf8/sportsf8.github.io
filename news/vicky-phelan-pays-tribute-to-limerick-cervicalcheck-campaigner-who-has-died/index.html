<p>THE CervicalCheck campaigner, Ruth Morrissey, of Schoolhouse Road, Monaleen, has passed away.</p>
<p>She was 39.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey and her husband Paul initiated High Court action for damages against the Health Service Executive and two laboratories in 2018. They claim that smear tests that were carried out on her were wrongly reported as being normal. The smear tests were carried in 2009 and 2012.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey was diagnosed with cervical cancer in May 2014 and it recurred in 2018.</p>
<p>Only days ago the Supreme Court was told that Ms Morrissey and her husband Paul had been paid the full sum of €2.16 million damages awarded to them by the High Court over misreading of her cervical smear tests.</p>
<p>Fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Vicky Phelan has paid a moving tribute to her friend on social media.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth was one of the strongest women I know, and also one of the most positive. I never once saw her without a smile on her face and I saw her when she was very ill. My thoughts today are with Ruth&rsquo;s husband, Paul and their beautiful daughter, Libby who Ruth adored,&rdquo; said Ms Phelan.

Brave until the end — that is what Ruth Morrissey was.</p>
<p>Here was a woman who had to step into the limelight to try and get justice for herself, but more importantly for the husband and young daughter she had to leave behind.</p>
<p>As Ruth battled a spreading cancer and took on a massive legal battle against the HSE and two US laboratories over her cervical smears, taken under the CervicalCheck screening programme, I got to know the woman as well as the litigant.</p>
<p>Ruth never wanted to be on the front pages and on the TV news, but she threw off the cloak of anonymity so that other women, those also battling with cervical cancer, would know clearly what was happening — that a young mother of one caught up in this CervicalCheck controversy and already fighting a relentless, nasty disease, was being dragged through the courts, something the then-taoiseach Leo Varadkar pledged would not happen.</p>
<p>Ruth, in the last years of her life, was embroiled in a long-running legal battle that started when proceedings were initiated in May 2018.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ruth and her husband Paul only realised they may have a case when they saw Vicky Phelan on television. Ms Phelan has become a champion for women stricken by cervical cancer and settled her own legal case for €2.5m.</p>
<p>Little did the Morrisseys know then, that Ruth’s case would take so long and become a landmark action which students of law will learn about in the future.</p>
<p>Ruth Morrissey with Vicky Phelan, who said in a tweet: &lsquo;I was on my own this morning at home when I received the news that I have been dreading for some time now; the news that my good friend and fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died.&rsquo; Picture: @PhelanVicky</p>
<p>There are commentators who talk about “the Morrissey case”, &ldquo;the Morrissey Judgment&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;landmark Supreme Court decision&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But we should not forget about Ruth Morrissey the daughter, the sister, the wife, and the mother, who had to spend her last days caught up in a legal fight over circumstances that never were of her making.</p>
<p>We should not forget she spent most of her daughter’s seventh birthday sitting on the hard benches of the High Court in the Four Courts.</p>
<p>Neither should we forget that this woman endured days when others took to the airwaves, talking coldly about her case and claiming that screening programmes in general were in jeopardy after the Morrissey High Court judgment.</p>
<p>She came to the Four Courts that first time last July in a pretty, flowery, summer dress. She didn’t wear a wig, and her head was bare after several sessions of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>She gripped her husband Paul’s hand and when the time came for her to give her evidence, she did so in a quiet voice to a hushed courtroom.</p>
<p>What she had to say was devastating. She wept in the witness box in the Four Courts as she recounted telling her daughter Libby, just seven years of age, of her cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probably the most difficult conversation I had to have,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She did not want Mammy to pass away.”</p>
<p>Ruth said she told Libby she could not promise she would not pass away, but she made a promise that she would fight as hard as she could.</p>
<p>Paul broke down in the witness box as he told how at bedtime he had heard Libby ask her mother not to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear her at bedtime say &lsquo;Mammy, don’t die; don’t leave me&rsquo;. It is devastating,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is like a bad dream you can&rsquo;t wake up from. Just imagine if it was your wife, the love of your life — it seems to be one thing after another. It is heartbreaking, terrifying, and unimaginable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Ruth knew she was the luckiest woman in the world to have the love of Paul — they met when she was 17 and he was 19 — and Libby, the daughter she adored.</p>
<p>Read More Ruth Morrissey was brave and kind to the end as she took on CervicalCheck battle</p>
<p>She also knew she was the unluckiest to have been one of the women caught up in the CervicalCheck nightmare.</p>
<p>Ruth never took out her feelings about her bad luck on those around her.</p>
<p>Yes, she felt let down by what happened.</p>
<p>Yes, she was angry and devastated and afraid of an uncertain future, but every time she came to the Four Courts she did so with her head held high, and with a smile for familiar faces.</p>
<p>She remembered everybody’s name; the small details of their lives which made them feel good. When her condition was mentioned in conversation, she brushed away any suggestions of her bravery.</p>
<p>But Ruth was brave. She had the bravery of a mother fighting to stay with her daughter and husband.</p>
<p>She had the bravery of a woman dealt a terrible blow.</p>
<p>She had the bravery of a woman who wanted to effect change and help other women.</p>
<p>Ruth hoped she had made a difference — that and the love of her family is what kept her going.</p>
<p>She said to me once: “I don’t know if bravery is anything to do with it. When your back is against the wall, you come out fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bravery had everything to do with it. She fought for her family and for other women.</p>
<p>She did make a difference, in a very big way, through her legal action, but also to those who had the privilege to meet her in the Four Courts.</p>
<p>Brave and kind to the end…Ruth Morrissey.

Ruth Morrissey, a cervical check campaigner, who sued the HSE over the misreading of her cervical smear tests has died.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey had only received the full payment of the €2.16m she won in court during the week.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Supreme Court heard that the entire payment had been received by Morrissey and her husband, despite an allowed appeal for over €500k of the damages concerning one of the laboratories.</p>
<p>Ms Morrisey had to wait until 2018 to discover that a 2014 review of tests she had been given in 2009 and 2012 were incorrect.</p>
<p>I was on my own this morning at home when I received the news that I have been dreading for some time now, the news that my good friend and fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died.

<p>Fellow campaigner Vicky Phelan posted a tribute to her friend online, saying ‘I was on my own this morning at home when I received the news that I have been dreading for some time now, the news that my good friend and fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died. Ruth passed away peacefully at Milford Hospice.’</p>
<p>While another survivor and patient advocate, Lorraine Walsh said ‘Rest in Peace @RuthMorrissey a beautiful, gentle lady, your life has been cut short far too soon, you shouldered a great burden for many of us, @221plus my sincere condolences to Paul &amp; Libby and your family, May your gentle soul rest in peace.’

<p>CervicalCheck whistleblower and cancer screening campaigner Vicky Phelan is backing our Better Ireland campaign.</p>
<p>Today she writes for the Irish Sunday Mirror outlining her hopes for a fairer, more efficient health service&hellip;</p>
<p>A better Ireland: What do we need to do to have a fairer, more efficient health service in this country?</p>
<p>Our health service and related structures of Government moved with admirable speed and intent to meet the challenge of Covid-19 head on in mid-March.</p>
<p>Over the past 16 weeks we have seen our health service transform in ways we were told could never happen.</p>
<p>None of us wants to go back to the trolley numbers and waiting lists of the past.</p>
<p>Some good can and must come from this Covid crisis, not only to honour the memories of the 1,744 people who have died.</p>
<p>Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now</p>
<p>We must also honour our healthcare workers who, I would imagine, would much rather work in a functioning health service than get virtually patted on the back for the amazing work they have done over the past four and a half months.</p>
<p>We have all been asked to pull together during this pandemic and we have shown what we can achieve, working together for the good of the nation.</p>
<p>It is time for our new Government to pin their colours to the mast and to take some bold steps for the good of the country.</p>
<p>One campaign issue that united everyone in the country, regardless of their party preferences at the time of the recent elections, was an overwhelming dissatisfaction with our health service.</p>
<p>We all understand that tough financial decisions will have to be made in order to reduce our huge national debt following heavy borrowing during this Covid crisis.</p>
<p>I really hope, for the sake of the health of every citizen in this country, that health will not be targeted as it was following the financial crash in 2008.</p>
<p>At that time, drastic cuts were made to our health service from which we have still not recovered.</p>
<p>Ireland still has the lowest number of hospital specialist doctors and the fourth lowest number of hospital beds in the OECD.</p>
<p>We also have one of the longest hospital waiting times for outpatient procedures in Europe, according to a European Health Consumer Index study carried out in 2016, a situation that worsened during the term of the last two Fine Gael-led Governments.</p>
<p>Between November 2014 and November 2019, the number of outpatients waiting 18 months or more increased by 579.4%.</p>
<p>An opinion piece by a vocal hospital consultant on this issue, Dr Anthony O’Connor, recently predicted “astronomical waiting lists will become intergalactic ones” once we get through this Covid crisis. Investment in public health is long overdue in this country.</p>
<p>Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now</p>
<p>Previous Governments have been far too cautious about funding public health services in this country.</p>
<p>If we are to learn anything from this pandemic, it must be that the needs of the patient, regardless of their ability to pay, must come first.</p>
<p>The Covid crisis has shown us that when public and private hospitals come together with the sole aim of meeting patients’ needs, marvellous things can happen.</p>
<p>For example, I am a public patient at St Vincent’s University Hospital. I had to move to the private hospital for treatment during the Covid crisis. I was due a CT scan and expected to have to wait for weeks to get an appointment.</p>
<p>I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to have one done on the same day as my treatment and to get the report back within a few days. I normally have to wait for weeks, and sometimes months in the public</p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way. The Covid crisis has given us a glimpse of the way things can, and should, be. And the solution is not Slaintecare.</p>
<p>Those in favour of Slaintecare repeatedly tell us it will deliver a single-tier hospital service.</p>
<p>However, this is not possible. Slaintecare is leaving private health insurance in place. As long as we have a private health insurance funded private hospital system sitting</p>
<p>alongside our tax-funded public hospital system, we will never have a single-tier hospital service.</p>
<p>The inequality that exists in our health system will simply be hidden from plain sight by providing public and private care in different hospitals.</p>
<p>Slaintecare does not go far enough and we have already waited long enough for it.</p>
<p>Why not take the bold step of shelving it and doing the right thing for once and put in place a universal single-tier healthcare model, similar to the system operating in Germany?</p>
<p>It has a robust public healthcare system which has been much lauded during the Covid crisis.</p>
<p>Germany’s spending on healthcare per capita is amongst the highest in the world.</p>
<p>However, it is based on the principle that all citizens contribute and pay health insurance. Higher earners pay more than lower earners but everyone gets the same cover. We already</p>
<p>have a heavily socialised system like that here in Ireland.</p>
<p>It is VHI. It is owned and regulated by the Government.</p>
<p>If VHI was reformed and made universal, with higher earners paying higher premia and free premia for the unemployed, we could have a single-tier healthcare system in Ireland that would be fair, efficient and provide equity of access to all patients, something we do not have right now.</p>
<p>(Image: Gareth Chaney/Collins)</p>
<p>We have a new Minister for Health, Stephen Donnelly. Let’s see how brave and ambitious he really is.</p>
<p>I note from his educational qualifications that he studied international development with a focus on protecting and strengthening vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Do the morally right thing, minister, and protect our most vulnerable citizens in their time of need and give them the healthcare system they deserve – one that is based on need and not on the ability to pay.

CERVICALCHECK CAMPAIGNER Ruth Morrissey has died.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey passed at Milford Hospice in Limerick. She was just 39.</p>
<p>The mother-of-one was among 221 women in Ireland to be affected in the CervicalCheck scandal in which a number of incorrect test results were provided to patients undergoing cervical smear tests.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey was first diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2014.</p>
<p>Though she made an initial recovery, the cancer returned in 2018 and eventually became terminal.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>An audit of the labs used to test the slides used in these checks subsequently revealed that several had been incorrectly reported – including Ms Morrissey&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>She was one of several women to initiate legal proceedings against the HSE and the two laboratories involved in the examination of the cervical smear tests.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey and her husband Paul were eventually handed damages in the amount of €2.1 million.</p>
<p>Much like fellow campaigners Vicky Phelan, Lorraine Walsh, Stephen Teap and the late Emma Mhic Mhathúna, Ms Morrissey showed incredible courage in the fight for justice.</p>
<p>A symbol for bravery and honour, she showed remarkable bravery and determination to continue attending court throughout proceedings despite her terminal diagnosis.</p>
<p>Never one for the limelight, her quest for justice was one that won her huge support and admiration across Ireland.</p>
<p>She gave a voice to the 221 women affected by the CervicalCheck screening scandal and fought for justice and a better future for her husband and their beloved daughter Libby.</p>

<p>Fellow campaigner Phelan was among those to pay tribute to her friend, reminding many of the underlying tragedy and impact of those fateful mistakes.</p>
<p>“I was on my own this morning at home when I received the news that I have been dreading for some time now, the news that my good friend and fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died,” she said on Twitter.</p>
<p>“My children are away for a few days at my parents. I am so glad they are not here. I don&rsquo;t have to try to put on a brave face and can just sit here with my feelings and grieve for Ruth and for the life that she didn&rsquo;t get to live, for the time she didn&rsquo;t get to spend with Libby.</p>
<p>“Ruth was one of the strongest women I know, and also one of the most positive. I never once saw her without a smile on her face and I saw her when she was very ill. My thoughts today are with Ruth&rsquo;s husband, Paul and their beautiful daughter, Libby who Ruth adored.”

<p>Stephen Teap has opened up about raising his two young sons while dealing with grief after the loss of his wife Irene in 2017.</p>
<p>Irene was one of 17 women who passed away from cervical cancer not knowing that her smear tests were incorrect.</p>
<p>Over 400 women were affected by the CervicalCheck scandal across the country.</p>
<p>Stephen never expected to lose his soulmate at the age of 36. But after nearly three years in the role of single dad he feels he’s found his stride.</p>
<p>He told the Irish Sunday Mirror: “Irene died when she was 35 and I was 36, Oscar was four and Noah was just two, still in nappies. There isn’t a manual or a guide.</p>
<p>“The first morning when I woke up without Irene, I said, ‘How the hell… what will I do’ then the boys came in and said, ‘Where’s breakfast’.</p>
<p>“Then came lunch, then came dinner, so it became about building a structure around them.</p>
<p>“That is how you cope, it was about putting a structure in place for the two boys, basically just trying to survive.</p>
<p>“I can only gauge my success as a parent by the smiles on their faces. There are, thankfully, plenty of smiles.”</p>
<p>Stephen spoke to us from his home in Carrigaline, where his younger son was born and Irene sadly passed away at the age of 35.</p>
<p>He is determined that the boys will have fond memories of their mother to cherish.</p>
<p>He explained: “I talk to the boys about Irene all the time. It’s very important that I do. One of the things Irene said to me highlighted the importance of this.</p>
<p>“After getting the news that she was going to die, she said that Noah will grow up and he won’t remember her because he’s far too young.</p>
<p>“It was nearly that that overshadowed dying for her. That was the conversation that was had, that was why it was so important to tell the boys and share the stories.”</p>
<p>The CervicalCheck scandal – brought into the public eye by Vicky Phelan – rocked the health system and continues to affect hundreds of women.</p>
<p>Stephen, one of the co-founders of the 221+ lobby and support group, admits he is still angry about his wife’s death because it could have been avoided.</p>
<p>He said: “Irene was failed by our healthcare system on more than one occasion. She should still be here; the boys should have their mother.</p>
<p>“It [motherhood] was taken from her when she didn’t want to go. She was such a fantastic mother and it was all she lived for.</p>
<p>“Her milestone when she got the terminal diagnosis was she wanted to see Oscar start school and even that was taken from her.”</p>
<p>Oscar, now seven, started school just one month after his mother died. Noah, now five, is due to start school in September.</p>
<p>Stephen said: “It’s bitter sweet, even silly things trip you up along the way.</p>
<p>“I remember teaching Oscar how to cycle without stabilisers and it was a great triumph, but then you’re struck with the guilt that Irene is not here.</p>

<p>“Then with Noah, 52 days it took to get Noah off stabilisers. But he finally did it, these are the things that remind you she should be here.</p>
<p>“Irene died on 26th of July – in August, Oscar started school. It was still very, very raw.</p>
<p>“It’s a big deal driving your first born to school, you’re going there and being the only person there was so raw.</p>
<p>“I was very proud of him, but very said at the same time to see him so grown up. I carry all the emotion of any parent who sends their child to school for the first time.</p>
<p>“But there’s more emotion – the unfairness of it, the unfairness of what Irene went through, the unfairness that Noah doesn’t have his mum with him on his first day of school.”</p>
<p>Stephen, who was named Cork Person of the Year in 2019, is due to quit his job at the end of this month so he can rebuild his career around his precious boys.</p>
<p>He said: “I think dads probably don’t get as much respect as they should do, but I also think it has changed over the past few years.</p>
<p>“These days both parents are out earning to pay the mortgage, so responsibilities are more split in the house.</p>
<p>“All my friends who are dads are fantastic dads. They and their wives work, they share the responsibilities and share the time</p>
<p>I think the struggle these days is finding a work life balance.</p>
<p>“One thing positive coming out of Covid-19 is people working from home, not sitting in their car for hours, seeing these extra hours they can gain with their families.”

<h3 id="two-of-three-cervicalcheck-tribunal-judges-no-longer-available">&ldquo;Two of three CervicalCheck Tribunal judges no longer available&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305380.1594837070!/image/image.jpg" alt="img">
Two of the three judges, including the chair, who were to sit on the three-person CervicalCheck Tribunal, will not now be taking up their positions, it has emerged.</p>
<p>The development is likely to contribute further to the delay in getting the tribunal up and running.</p>
<p>In April it was announced that the establishment of the tribunal was being delayed because of Covid-19 and social distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>A recent notice on the tribunal’s website states that because of her appointment as President of the High Court in June, Ms Justice Mary Irvine is no longer in a position to act as the tribunal’s chair.</p>
<p>“Separately, Mr Justice Michael Peart who was nominated for appointment as an ordinary member of the tribunal, has informed the Government that he will not be taking up that post,” the notice said. The reason for the judge’s decision is not disclosed.</p>
<p>The decision to establish the tribunal was made in December 2018 and legislation to set it up was passed in July 2019.</p>
<p>In January of this year it was announced that Mr Peart, a retired judge of the Court of Appeal, and Mr Justice Brian McGovern, of the Court of Appeal, would sit on the tribunal, along with Ms Justice Irvine, who had earlier been identified as the judge who would chair it.</p>
<p>The CervicalCheck Tribunal Act requires that the tribunal consists of a chairperson and at least two ordinary members.</p>
<p>It will not be possible to establish the tribunal until suitable persons have been identified to take up the posts, the tribunal notice states. In the meantime, the tribunal is not in a position to accept claims from affected parties.</p>
<p>The tribunal has offices and a website but is not officially established yet. It is only when there is an establishment date that the time allowed for making a claim will begin to run, according to the website.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health said recommendations on a new chair and ordinary member of the tribunal were expected shortly.</p>
<p>The department said the delay in establishing the tribunal had provided an opportunity to further prepare the tribunal’s premises for operating within the context of Covid-19.</p>
<p>“Protocols have been developed for attendance at the building and screens and other measures are being put in place.”</p>
<p>The tribunal was established to allow an alternative to going to court for claims arising out of the CervicalCheck controversy.</p>
<p>The controversy over the screening programme was sparked by Limerick woman Vicky Phelan, who has cervical cancer, settling a High Court action in April 2018 over the reading of her smear test. It later emerged more than 100 other women were not informed of an audit which revised their earlier, negative smear tests. Some are taking legal cases against the testing labs and the HSE.
