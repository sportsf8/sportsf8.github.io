<p>Photo: Bike Penticton</p>
<p>A Kelowna man has died while mountain biking the Three Blind Mice Trails in Penticton on Saturday.</p>
<p>Leah West, a Canadian indie-pop singer identified the man as her husband on social media Sunday morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beyond devastated. My husband and best friend of 18 years and the father of my son is dead. A police officer came to my door last night to tell me he had passed away while mountain biking in Penticton,&rdquo; West wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still don’t have cause of death, but they think it may have been a heart attack. I haven’t been able to see him yet. I’m weeping nonstop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Bike Pentiction, the Three Blind Mice area, overlooks Okanagan Lake and has over 80 trails in the network.

Mr Floyd died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes during an arrest in which there was no sign of a struggle. Mr Chauvin has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Ms Martin-Brown said of the peaceful protest: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way I wasn&rsquo;t going to turn up and show solidarity and be an ally because white silence is part of the problem in America.&rdquo; But, after hours of non-violent protest, things took a turn for the &ldquo;terrifying&rdquo; late on Saturday, LA time, leading the city to be locked down from 8pm Saturday to 5.30am on Sunday. &ldquo;From about 6pm onwards until about 9 there were just explosions and people smashing things,&rdquo; said Ms Martin-Brown, who lives in the Park La Brea area of LA near The Grove shopping district, which was hit by looters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the march, it wasn&rsquo;t like that. It was very emotional, of course, people were angry, but not violent,&rdquo; she said. Australian actor Lincoln Younes, whose credits include the US drama Grand Hotel as well the home-grown Home and Away and Tangle, also attended the protest. The rioting in LA and, inset, Lincoln Younes. Credit:Lincoln Younes &ldquo;The only way for us to start moving towards a world where African Americans are not discriminated against is for there to be an understanding of things like white privilege,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Younes said the death of George Floyd, which followed the shooting death in February of African American man Ahmaud Arbery, were &ldquo;tiny parts of an injustice and institutional racism that has been occurring for many, many years&rdquo;. &ldquo;The difference with this was that it was caught on video,&rdquo; Mr Younes said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m angry. You&rsquo;d have to be a sociopath not to be angry. I want us to do better.&rdquo; The 28-year-old, who captured dramatic images of the rioting including a burning police car, said the protests &ldquo;escalated very quickly&rdquo;. He left shortly after protests turned violent. Sam Cook, a Nyikina woman originally from the Kimberley region from West Australia, has lived in LA since 2017 as a permanent US resident.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old lives seven minutes from the epicentre of the protests in Downtown LA and said the scenes across the country were a &ldquo;composite of compounding issues coming to a crucial head&rdquo;. Loading She said the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures, a rent crisis and a lack of a social safety net in the US meant the death of Mr Floyd was &ldquo;the tinder for the fire&rdquo; of frustrations. Communities were &ldquo;galvanising together to say that the new way forward post-coronavirus lockdown has to be a more peaceful, serve-and-protect model of policing&rdquo;, she said. Ms Cook is planning to attend another protest tomorrow with an Australian Aboriginal flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There’s a similar situation of deaths in custody in Australia that’s not being addressed &hellip; so this is a global, &lsquo;the world is watching&rsquo; moment,&rdquo; she said. Elke Osadnik, an Australian actress who has lived in LA for over nine years, could see thousands of people at the end of her street, as well as smoke from car fires, looted stores and tear gas. &ldquo;For the most part, the majority of people are calm and respectful and just saying their bit,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;But it was almost like another group of people who just wanted to cause trouble&rdquo;. Brisbane native Tim Davies, a long-time LA resident who has conducted the scores of major Hollywood films including La La Land, said LA mayor Eric Garcetti had been &ldquo;adamant&rdquo; residents had a right to protest but later on Saturday &ldquo;all hell broke loose&rdquo;. The 46-year-old said the looters appeared to be &ldquo;opportunists&rdquo; rather than protesters.

Dylanfest 30: Live-streaming this weekend</p>
<p>Live-streamed Friday through Sunday</p>
<p>by Bondo Wyszpolski</p>
<p>This year’s Dylanfest, presented by the South Bay music duo Andy and Renee, is celebrating its 30th anniversary. The live concert was scheduled for May 30. Not surprisingly, some changes were made, but it all comes down to this: The show will go on, live-streamed this Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and tentatively returning on stage in September. Here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Easy Reader: When did it hit you that the scheduled all-day concert wouldn’t go on? Was it when you were informed by the Torrance Cultural Arts Center, or before?</p>
<p>Andy and Renee: “We didn’t cancel until we heard from the TCAC. Tickets had gone on sale in January and we’re happy to report that most patrons are applying the funds to the possible Sept. 26 show.”</p>
<p>ER: What were your first reactions, apart from the inevitable disappointment?</p>
<p>A&amp;R: “Well, when the pandemic hit, a bigger question for us than Dylanfest was ‘How do we make a living?’ Ten years ago we had experimented with online streaming, and we hated it. But Renee had the perfect combination of intelligence, determination, and most of all nerve, to take it on the second time around. We began producing shows before we knew what we were doing. It was like when we were both little kids: We’d go around the neighborhood and sell tickets to the play we were going to do later that afternoon… Then we’d sit down to write the play, etc…Our first shows had a multitude of issues. Within two to three weeks we were streaming pretty good quality stuff in terms of both sound and picture. Our audience is generous and forgiving and stuck with us along the learning curve.</p>
<dl>
<dt>“All of this is to say that Dylanfest, normally looming like a thundercloud over our heads at this time of the year, was on the back burner. We’d think about it, panic appropriately, and then have to get back to a more immediate pressing issue. When it was finally officially postponed, we had our sea legs as far as live streaming goes, and that gave us the mental space to imagine a virtual Dylanfest.”</dt>
<dd>
<p>Did you envision the live-streaming event taking place in three-hour increments over three days, or did that come later?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A&amp;R: “Pretty quickly we felt that although a lot of people will travel to a beautiful arts plaza, where they can buy food and drinks and sit in the warmth of the sun all day, and enjoy the entertainment of 60 musicians over the course of eight hours, not many people will sit in front of their computer screen for an eight-hour stretch. So we quickly embraced the idea of three three-hour segments. Which opened up other possibilities as well.”</p>
<p>ER: With the live-streaming event now set, have you cancelled the Sept. 26 show, or would you possibly still hold a concert on that date if there’s an “all clear” from the city? (I know this sounds like I’m asking if there could possibly be two Dylanfests in 2020, but on the other hand the first one isn’t taking place before a live audience.)</p>
<p>A&amp;R: “Our first calling is live performance so, yes, if the city opens up we will do a live show Sept. 26, for a live audience. With everyone in isolation, most performances for virtual Dylanfest are solos. Often these recordings are powerful and intimate, like many of the great Dylan recordings themselves. But it means that many great musicians who are not necessarily singers are absent. These people are not just talented players. Some are dear friends. So for us, one of the specific honors of the live show, if we can do it, will be to once again share the stage with these folks creating that sound. So we shall see.”</p>
<p>ER: If you’re presenting three events at three hours each that equals nine hours, and usually (if I’m not mistaken) the Dylanfest events run eight hours. If so, does this mean you’ll present more music (more acts) than usual?</p>
<dl>
<dt>A&amp;R: “Yes! There is not much good that comes out of a pandemic. But there is a little. Cleaner air, less traffic, less crime and we don’t have to shut down at 8:30!”</dt>
<dd>
<p>This question ties in with the one above: Don’t you usually feature about 40 artists, doing about 60 songs total? Will it be relatively the same figures this time?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A&amp;R: “We usually get through at least 60 songs. I think the world record was about 65 in the olden days when we were still in the backyard going ‘til midnight and getting shut down by the cops. This year, since there will be zero time needed to switch from one artist to the next we can fill up all that changeover time with more songs! Each segment will feature 24 songs, so a record 72 songs, with NO repeats! We are especially delighted by this part.</p>
<p>“The other great thing is that we will be joined by some artists that have either never performed or rarely performed, because of geographical or scheduling issues. Wade Preston will be with us. He lives in Pennsylvania and was a fixture in the South Bay in the late ‘80s and ‘90s, but relocated to perform on Broadway. Shana Morrison, daughter of Van Morrison will be a first timer. Aimee Mann of ‘Til Tuesday (“Voices Carry”) has submitted a song. International guests include Leah West and Mike Tanner from Canada and Al Diesen from Italy.”</p>
<p>ER: How much work was it to get all of this coordinated and organized? Was it more work than usual, or just different? And, for that matter, were there some artists who wanted to participate but who maybe didn’t have access to the requisite technology?</p>
<p>A&amp;R: “Way more work—but worse, work that we didn’t know how to do. I bow at the altar of Renee Safier for taking this on. I’ve said many times before, that if it were up to me, there would still be 29 Dylanfests before us and they would include some amazing guests. But the fact that there is anyone in the audience, anyone watching it on YouTube or Facebook, anyone buying a ticket or a shirt or mug? That is all Renee. What she doesn’t know, she learns, and I’m lucky to have hitched my wagon to that star.</p>
<dl>
<dt>“We did have a few people who declined because of the technical issues.”</dt>
<dd>
<p>There’s not room to mention all 40 artists and what each will perform, but are there maybe four or five artists that you’d like to single out and say a few words about?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A&amp;R: “In addition to the aforementioned new artists, we’re delighted to welcome Ryan Hedgecock, formerly the guitar player for Lone Justice, who tells a fascinating story of the day he met Dylan to learn one of his songs. Viewers will love Joel Raphael, Jamie Daniels of the Jack of Hearts Band, Kelly Fitzgerald (finally!), singer/piano player from John Fogerty’s band Bob Malone, and of course our own Marty Rifkin on pedal steel, and the rest of the guys in Hard Rain.”</p>
<p>ER: Are we going to hear some older Dylan songs for the first time? I know that when we spoke at length in advance of Dylanfest #27 there were many, many that hadn’t yet made an appearance at one of your events.</p>
<p>A&amp;R: “You bet. There are five songs this year that have never been performed in 29 previous years. Maybe the most interesting is “Go Away Little Boy”. The song was written by Dylan for Maria McKee of Lone Justice in the ‘80s, and was not even listed on Dylan’s website.”</p>
<p>ER: Speaking of which, the Master recently released two new songs, one of which is about as long as “Highlands” on the “Time Out of Mind” album. Will these be performed?</p>
<p>A&amp;R: “No! To the surprise of exactly no one, The 17-minute epic “Murder Most Foul”, which I listened to six times straight the night it dropped, was not selected by any of the artists.”</p>
<p>ER: What are you most looking forward to regarding Dylanfest #30? And how do you think live-streaming it will affect future Dylanfests in the years to come?</p>
<p>A&amp;R: “There’s a chance that we’ll be able to enjoy more of the show, since so much of it is prerecorded. When it’s live, we are only offstage for a song or two at a time, and so we only get to hear things when we listen to the recording later. It will be nice to experience a lot of the show with the audience members.</p>
<p>“Live-streaming will be part of our shows in general from here on out. It’s our hope that with live-streaming, Dylanfest might reach beyond our local audience.”</p>
<p>Dylanfest 30 is online with 3 shows, Fri-Sat-Sun, May 29-30-31, 5-8pm PT each day on YouTube.</p>
<p>Friday, May 29th, 5-8pm PT:</p>
<p>Saturday, May 30th, 5-8pm PT:</p>
<p>Sunday, May 31st, 5-8pm PT:</p>
<p>The three Dylanfest shows are free to watch, but the option to contribute will be there for those who are in a position to do so. You can contribute now at <a href="http://www.andyandrenee.com/store.php,">www.andyandrenee.com/store.php,</a> PayPal (paypal.me/andyandrenee) or Venmo, (venmo.com/Renee-Safier). A portion of the proceeds will go to the Los Angeles Midnight Mission and Feeding America. We are sustained by the generosity and support of the fans who love the music, and who donate as they are able. ER

<h3 id="tracks-of-the-week-new-music-from-the-cadillac-three-black-star-riders-and-more">&ldquo;Tracks of the Week: new music from The Cadillac Three, Black Star Riders and more&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3fUCxB9SpKX4cLyPFganH-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s that time of the week when we review the cream of rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roll&rsquo;s latest, and YOU tell us which one&rsquo;s the best. Whether you spot something by an old favourite of yours – or pick up on a band you&rsquo;d never heard before – we hope there&rsquo;s something for you here.</p>
<p>Last week Cruel Hearts Club came out on top, followed by Massive Wagons in second place and Toby Jepson (aka Toby &amp; The Whole Truth) in third. Well played, everyone! Check out CHC&rsquo;s winning single below, then dive into this week&rsquo;s list and vote for your favourite at the foot of the page.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>The Cadillac Three - The Jam (+ Fuzz)</p>
<p>Originally released as part of the Country Fuzz album, this highly danceable &lsquo;choon has been roughened and amped up for this latest TC3 output. It had actually been poised to appear on the new Florida Georgia Line record (singer/guitarist Jaren Johnston co-wrote it with Brian Kelley from FGL) before winding up on Country Fuzz. Now oomphed with distortion, but still bouncy and funky as fuck, it’s all the things we want right now.</p>
<p>Check out music, merch and tour updates</p>
<p>Ricky Warwick puts it best. “It’s a rocker!” the BSR frontman says. “A Scott Gorham and Christian Martucci guitar onslaught. A song about the politics of dancing while the politicians dance around the truth!” Indeed, the politicians part isn’t exactly veiled (‘I’m your candidate for heartbreak/come on and vote for me!&hellip;Build myself a higher wall!’ Warwick declares with venom) but Candidate For Heartbreak still carries the sort of no-bullshit rock energy and restorative catharsis we could all use sometimes.</p>
<p>Order the album Another State Of Grace</p>
<p>Goldray - How Do You Know</p>
<p>Since parting ways with 90s rockers Reef, guitarist Kenwyn House has dived head-first into a lava lamp-lit world of West Coast 60s psychedelia with singer Leah Rasmussen. On this commanding, tripped-out new single (part of a double A-side) Goldray mix flavours of Jefferson Airplane with Led Zeppelin-esque hoodoo. The fact that they look like they’ve stepped out of the Axis Bold As Love shoot – via some sort of gothic fairytale – reflects their immersion in these sounds. Not so much a fashion choice as a way of life.</p>
<p>Pre-order the new album, Feel The Change</p>
<p>Larkin Poe - Back Down South (feat Tyler Bryant)</p>
<p>Back Down South may initially seem like a fairly straight-ahead southern rock-come-blues banger. In truth it’s quite a bit smarter than that. Joined by singer Rebecca’s husband Tyler Bryant on guitar, the Lovell sisters build on stompy Georgia-fried rock’n’roll foundations with airy chorus harmonies – light as a feather and packed with soul – and the sort of lyrics that make well-worn bluesy tropes feel fresh and engaging again.</p>
<p>Pre-order Self Made Man I Check out tour updates and pre-order tickets</p>
<p>Patrón - Very Bad Boy</p>
<p>The brainchild of Lo (frontman of LA rockers Loading Data), these guys have said their music “could be the premonitory soundtrack to Roberto Rodriguez&rsquo;s next feature film, if it were set in a post-apocalyptic and degenerative Las Vegas where the only chance of salvation would be Barry White&rsquo;s resurrection.” This taste of their new album is moodier and smokier than (previous TOTW entry) Who Do You Dance For, but just as infectious – Lo’s 50s crooner purr goes brilliantly with the deep, desert-y grooves and 80s pop sensibilities at work.</p>
<p>Order the album, Room With A View</p>
<p>Marisa &amp; The Moths - Skin (Stripped)</p>
<p>Marisa &amp; The Moths have cut this acoustic-based rendition of Skin during lockdown. The high-octane original kicked ass, but the song sits excellently in this moody, atmospheric framework (cello and electric guitars playing off one another), singer Marisa Rodriguez channelling the likes of Lzzy Hale and Maria Brink at their most ballad-y.</p>
<p>Buy the self-titled debut album I Check out merchandise</p>
<p>Joe Bonamassa - When One Door Opens</p>
<p>Part love letter to the British blues boom, part Bond theme in the making (with its sweeping strings, hummable melody and brooding grandeur), Joe’s new single surprised us by sharply changing gear just over half-way through. From there a blast of military-march drums, chugging guitars and soul-belter backing vocals – which then dropped into a gentler finale – revealed a modern-day blues giant setting himself high standards (as a songwriter, not just a guitarist) and succeeding.</p>
<p>Gig/tour updates I Check out merchandise</p>
<p>Vandenberg - Shitstorm</p>
<p>You’d want to be the local radio announcer introducing this; “and now, boys and girls, the new song from Vandenberg&hellip; Shitstorm!” Adrian Vandenberg wears his 80s Whitesnake tenure on his sleeve here, riffing out while Chilean singer (also of present-day Rainbow) Ronnie Romero cries out ‘riding in a shitstorm!’ over and over. It’s sort of idiotic and yet awesome and we kind of love it.</p>

<h3 id="voices-lifted-in-love-comfort-and-hope">&ldquo;Voices Lifted in Love, Comfort and Hope&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.westsidespirit.com/binrepository/480x270/0c10/480d250/none/3502612/RQPO/01-wyntonmarsalis_4-809898_20200520165245.jpg" alt="img">
Writers aren&rsquo;t ordinarily at a loss for words, but these are not ordinary times. Watching Lincoln Center&rsquo;s Sunday evening &ldquo;Memorial For Us All&rdquo; performances with my family has left us speechless. So many names, so many gifts, so much love and loss.</p>
<p>New York&rsquo;s experience of COVID-19 isn&rsquo;t like anyplace else&rsquo;s, nor has our response been. When it became impossible to gather together to mourn the community&rsquo;s losses, an interfaith collaboration with religious leaders, musicians, Lincoln Center, and the public became a weekly secular service, with music as its healing homily.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis, co-founder and artistic director for Jazz at Lincoln Center joined virtually with 15 other musicians to perform the inaugural &ldquo;Memorial For Us All&rdquo; with New Orleans style jazz that was both somber and uplifting, as names of some of those who&rsquo;ve died during this pandemic appeared onscreen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serving a need in our city was the driving force behind &lsquo;Memorial For Us All,'&rdquo; explained Leah Johnson, Lincoln Center&rsquo;s executive vice president. &ldquo;Families and friends are unable to have proper funerals during this time. It has radically altered how we&rsquo;re able to process grief and honor those who have passed away. Together with our interfaith partners, led by Rev. Dr. Chloe Breyer of The Interfaith Center of New York, we started thinking of ways to create community around remembrance and a virtual space where those who have been lost could be remembered.&rdquo; Also participating are the New York Disaster Interfaith Services, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, The Center for Faith and Community Partnerships, The New York Board of Rabbis, the Union Theological Seminary, the Mayor&rsquo;s office, and Jazz at Lincoln Center.</p>
<p>Wynton Marsalis performed on May 3rd. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma, who&rsquo;s been sharing music with the world via social media with the hashtag #SongsOfComfort, performed on May 10th. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re feeling very isolated from each other, but no one is alone,&rdquo; said baritone Norm Lewis, before he sang &ldquo;No One is Alone,&rdquo; &ldquo;We Live on Borrowed Time,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bring Him Home,&rdquo; on May 17th. Actress/singer Kelli O’Hara performed on May 24th, and opera singer Ailyn Pérez will present the memorial on May 31st. Future memorials are planned for each Sunday at 6 p.m. They can be live streamed on Lincoln Center&rsquo;s website, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube pages, where they remain online to be viewed later. The public is invited to submit names they&rsquo;d like to see remembered in future presentations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arts help us understand ourselves and one another,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;Now more than ever in the midst of this pandemic, the arts play a vital role in helping us build empathy, create community and connect with one another. This is critical here in our city and around the world. Regardless of belief systems, music is intertwined with so many forms of remembrance. We hope &ldquo;Memorial For Us All&rdquo; can provide a weekly moment of remembrance, unity, and comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The names of more than 1,400 people have been broadcast and remembered. Sadly, the list keeps getting longer, but the music will keep playing. While Wynton Marsalis and musicians sang &ldquo;Oh! Didn&rsquo;t He Ramble,&rdquo; the lyrics appeared on screen, so that all could join in, lifting voices in mournful, joyful, hopeful, respectful, soothing, songs of remembrance. We&rsquo;re isolated, but in this together.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-182628/social" alt="img">
In the fall of 1977, Carly Simon’s sultry rendition of “Nobody Does It Better” rose to No. 2 on Billboard’s pop chart, casting James Bond in a new light.</p>
<p>Written by Carole Bayer Sager (words) and Marvin Hamlisch (music) for “The Spy Who Loved Me,” the Bond theme was the first to be titled differently from the movie.</p>
