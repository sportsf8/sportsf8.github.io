<p>Hollywood loves a happy ending and Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series of the same name is no exception. This seductively glossy drama is a speculative story about postwar Hollywood, a revisionist fantasy in which a group of gay men and people of colour sweep prejudice aside on the road to box-office victory and Oscar glory. Thanks to the show’s attention to set design, costuming and name-dropping, it certainly looks a lot like 1947, but the events that take place bear a complex, ironic relationship to history.</p>
<p>Murphy, the creator of hits including Glee, Pose and Feud, about the rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, has taken inspiration from the cheerfully lewd, largely unverifiable memoirs of Scotty Bowers. In his book Full Service, best read with a shaker or two of salt to hand, Bowers recalls decades spent hooking up with stars or supplying them with sex partners, starting with the days when he picked up clients while working at a petrol station in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Murphy’s show professionalises that operation, with Dylan McDermott playing Ernie: a likable, brisk chap who marshals an army of young men and women into the beds of the Hollywood elite from his forecourt. Those giving and receiving the password “Dreamland” at the pumps include such made-up characters as aspiring actor Jack Castello (David Corenswet), gay black screenwriter Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope), and Avis Amberg (Patti LuPone), the neglected wife of a studio mogul. Historical figures using the service include Cole Porter and Rock Hudson (played by Jake Picking), who in this version of reality falls in love with Coleman.</p>

<p>Many other Hollywood names appear in the series, often in roughly sketched caricatures, from George Cukor, Hattie McDaniel, Anna May Wong and Vivien Leigh, to lesser-known names such as Henry Willson (Jim Parsons) a gay man who was Hudson’s agent, and promoted many hunky “beefcake” stars of the 1950s. In the show, he uses mob connections to keep a story about Hudson’s sexuality out of the press – in real life Willson did this in 1955 by selling scandal on two other stars to the magazine in question.</p>
<p>While Hollywood revels in often-retold stories about orgies, arrests and eccentricities, it lands on two facts that are unequivocally true: that many people working in golden age Hollywood were gay (although not out to the public), and that the careers of talented people of colour suffered because of ingrained racism. This was true for Wong and McDaniel, but also figures such as Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, who have inspired another key fictional character in the show, actor Camille Washington, played by Laura Harrier.</p>
<p>In the show, Archie has written a screenplay called Peg that alludes to the outsider status shared by Washington, himself and many others. It dramatises the tragedy of Peg Entwistle, a young British actor who killed herself by jumping from the H of the Hollywoodland sign in 1932, after struggling to get into the movies. At first Coleman sees a symbol for his own exclusion in Peg’s history, but after he finds a director and studio to make the film, he starts rewriting history, eventually dismissing Entwistle as a “dumb-ass white girl”. Camille suggests that the film should be Meg, not Peg – the story of a black woman who comes to Hollywood to be a star, but ends up rejected and depressed as Entwistle did. It’s a far bolder choice.</p>

<p>Avis, temporarily in charge of her husband’s studio (something the show presents as a first, although there had been female studio bosses in the silent era), gives Meg the green light, encouraged by a gay male executive and a visit from Eleanor Roosevelt. Camille is the best person to play the lead, although she has only had one film role before, a demeaning maid role far beneath her talents. Jack plays her love interest, beating Rock Hudson, who flunks his screen test by mixing up his lines. Hudson did indeed need repeated takes early in his career, though he wasn’t quite the clot this show makes him out to be.</p>
<p>Avis sets the budget for Meg very low (although it is still referred to as a “major motion picture”) and retains some understandable concerns: that there will be protests against the studio, and that the film won’t recoup its costs because it can’t be shown in the South. Despite the KKK burning crosses on studio lawns, the production continues and the team eventually give Meg a happy ending, in which she climbs down from the sign and into the arms of her boyfriend.</p>

<p>What Avis doesn’t take into account is that censorship would have nixed Meg from the start. In real life, the villains of this piece weren’t protesters from outside but Hollywood’s own Joseph Breen and the Production Code he enforced. So-called miscegenation, the romance between Meg and her white boyfriend, was not allowed on screen, a rule that was relaxed only slightly for the real Pinky, made two years later. Pinky features a young black woman who passes for white, who was in fact played by a white actor, Jeanne Crain. Both Dandridge and Horne wanted that role, but women of colour were not cast as romantic leads in Hollywood at that time.</p>
<p>Breen’s influence is revealed in the casting of Fannie Hurst’s novel, Imitation of Life, which was filmed twice. In 1934, just as Breen began enforcing the Code, Fredi Washington, a woman of colour, played the white-passing lead, but in the 1959 remake the part was taken by a white actor, Susan Kohner. In 1951, black actor-singer Horne lobbied for a lead role in the musical Show Boat, but was rejected in favour of the white Ava Gardner, whose singing voice had to be dubbed. Hollywood refers to this kind of whitewashing by re-enacting Wong’s failure to win the lead role of The Good Earth despite being the only Asian star – and the best actor – to audition, but implies it is all in the past.</p>
<p>One historical angle oddly absent from Murphy’s reconstruction is the Hollywood blacklist, first drawn up in 1947 after growing unrest in the industry about the corrupting influence of creatives with communist sympathies. Studios scoured movie scripts for subversive leftwing messages, and in any other version of 1947 Meg would have been heavily scrutinised.</p>

<p>Which is not to say that progressive films weren’t made at that time, including two of Meg’s competitors at the 1948 Oscars, both taking antisemitism as their subject. The big winner that year was Gentleman’s Agreement, directed by former Communist party member Elia Kazan (he also directed Pinky, and would testify against his friends), in which Gregory Peck plays an investigative journalist going undercover to expose antisemitism.</p>
<p>The other was Crossfire, a B-movie directed by Edward Dmytryk, one of the original blacklisted Hollywood Ten. It was actually based on a novel about about homophobia, but homosexuality was another subject that the Production Code prohibited. Arguably, it was because of the success of these “message pictures”, that Hollywood turned its attention to race prejudice with Pinky and another popular 1949 film, Home of the Brave. The latter was based on a play about antisemitism in the armed forces but was given a black lead because, as its gay author Arthur Laurents was told: “Jews have been done.” Hollywood picks its causes and progressiveness is not always linear. As with many more movie treatments of racism from Broken Blossoms to Green Book, these films are deeply compromised if well-intentioned.</p>
<p>Regardless, in Murphy’s revisionist world Meg does indeed get made, with a little financial boost from Ernie and his gas-station hustlers. It is a hit with the public, after opening in the kind of “wide” release across the US that wouldn’t be seen until the 70s. In real life, the biggest box-office hit of 1947 was musical comedy Welcome Stranger, starring Bing Crosby as a singing doctor.</p>

<p>Meg also sweeps up at the Academy Awards, where Archie and Hudson share a very public kiss. This romantic moment sadly defies credibility. Although there were rumours, the culture of secrecy around homosexuality meant that Hudson’s sexuality was not public knowledge until it was confirmed by friends shortly before his Aids-related death in 1985. Hudson may have been a huge star, but studio “morality clauses” kept him in the closet. The show refers to the story of William Haines, whose career ended in the 1930s after he rejected MGM’s demand that he enter a lavender marriage. In the mid-50s, Hudson was married to Willson’s secretary Phyllis Gates.</p>
<p>Later in the ceremony, when Camille clutches her best actress Oscar for playing Meg, we witness a moment of triumph for women of colour in film that would not actually take place until the following century, when Halle Berry won for Monster’s Ball in 2001 and began her speech by saying: “This moment is so much bigger than me…” McDaniel was not even allowed in the room until the moment she was ushered in to accept her best supporting actress award for playing Mammy in 1939’s Gone With the Wind.</p>
<p>Camille is banned from the room, too, as it happens, but she gathers her nerve and successfully demands a seat on the front row. Murphy seems to be implying that a woman of colour only needs to ask for a seat at the table, which is an offensive lie when you consider that even now the Oscars remain #SoWhite, and the industry wildly unbalanced in terms of gender, race, sexuality and class diversity.</p>
<p>In its own well-meaning way, Murphy’s Hollywood is a rescue fantasy as outlandish as Quentin Tarantino’s re-enactment of the Manson murders, in which Sharon and her unborn child are saved by the intervention of a stuntman. Murphy has imagined away decades of institutional prejudice in favour of an ahistorical narrative about optimists pluckily seizing control of the power structures. In the same way that Meg twists the tragic story of Peg Entwistle, Hollywood betrays the legacy of those who had to fight for their rightful place in the film industry. Hollywood suggests a happy ending is just within our grasp – but that only happens at the movies.

<p><img src="https://i.inews.co.uk/content/uploads/2020/06/20513975-low_res-peter-crouch-save-our-summer-scaled.jpg" alt="img">
What’s on TV tonight: Peter Crouch enlists Maya Jama and Alex Horne to save our summer Also Alan Carr plays The Price Is Right on his Epic Gameshow and Andrew Marr takes a closer look at Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa</p>
<p>Pick of the day: Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer</p>
<p>9.15pm, BBC One</p>
<p>With the cancellation of Wimbledon, Glastonbury, Euro 2020 and the Olympics, the BBC’s schedules have an awful lot of gaps that need filling, with this unlikely sounding entertainment show being one such rescue package. No surprises that video-link technology is heavily employed as the footballer turned podcaster is joined (virtually) in each episode by radio presenter Maya Jama and Taskmaster’s Alex Horne, while the show will “incorporate elements of music festivals, sports tournaments and live events that have all been cancelled”.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer US</p>
<p>The i newsletter cut through the noise Email address is invalid Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry, there was a problem with your subscription.</p>
<p>4.35pm, ITV</p>
<p>Anyone underwhelmed by the unmasked celebrities in the British version of the bizarre South Korean singing contest (a surprise hit for ITV earlier this year) will likely be utterly flummoxed by the disguised warblers in the American version. Nick Cannon is the presenter and the identity-guessing panellists are Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, and regular star of the British spin-off, Ken Jeong.</p>
<p>Alan Carr’s Epic Gameshow</p>
<p>7.30pm, ITV</p>
<p>Leslie Crowther, Bruce Forsyth and Joe Pasquale have all commanded contestants to “come on down!” across the decades, and The Price Is Right is the latest enduring game show to be resurrected by Alan Carr in his nostalgia-driven series recycling old formats.</p>
<p>Michael McIntyre’s Big Laughs</p>
<p>8.15pm, BBC One</p>
<p>The goofy Marmite comedian’s Big Show recycled into “best bits”, and which may have cynics wondering again whether the celebrities taking part in Send To All (the segment where they surrender their phones to McIntyre) do so only so that they show off about their famous contacts. Holly Willoughby and Jamie Oliver are recalled doing so tonight, while Judge Rinder is woken in the middle of the night in Midnight Game Show.</p>
<p>Great Paintings of the World with Andrew Marr</p>
<p>8.15pm, Channel 5</p>
<p>The broadcaster takes time off from grilling politicians to front a straightforward series examining the stories behind famous works of art, beginning with perhaps most famous of all, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa. He begins at the Louvre, where, until recently, millions of visitors queued for a fleeting glimpse of the iconic work, no doubt only seeing it through the lens of their phone cameras. Marr traces the portrait’s history, one of groundbreaking artistic experimentation and a daring theft that made its reputation.</p>
<p>Eric Clapton: Life in 12 Bars</p>
<p>9.15pm, BBC Two</p>
<p>Another chance to catch this absorbing documentary about the blues guitarist, narrated by the man himself, as he charts why his insatiable desire to grow his artistic voice led him to quit a stream of successful bands, from The Yardbirds and John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers to short-lived supergroups Cream and Blind Faith. Clapton also talks about his battles with drugs and alcohol, his love for George Harrison’s wife, Pattie Boyd, and the tragic loss of his infant son in an accident.

<h3 id="from-a-nightclub-performer-at-age-16-lena-horne-ruled-hollywood-and-got-blacklisted-for-7-years">&ldquo;From a nightclub performer at age 16, Lena Horne ruled Hollywood and got blacklisted for 7 years&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.face2faceafrica.com/www/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Lena-Horne-via-Vintage-Photographs-of-African-Americans.jpeg" alt="img">
Michael Eli Dokosi is a journalist and a formidable writer with a decade&rsquo;s experience. He is a blogger, voice-over artist and MC. Dokosi is fluid with both spoken and written communication. He is for the African cause and reckons Africa shall regain its rightful place in world affairs soon.</p>
<p>In the early 1940s, Walter White, the leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) took a stand that portrayals of black American females as maids and men as coons in Hollywood had to stop. In furtherance of that motive, the NAACP took interest in the career progression of Lena Horne as an actress.</p>
<p>Her wealthy father connected to banking and gambling took interest in his daughter’s career and had to escort her in signing a seven-year contract with MGM Studios. On being told his daughter could play a film role as a maid, he informed the MGM boss Louis B Mayer that he could afford to hire his own maids and didn’t need to have his offspring playing one.</p>
<p>Having powerful forces backing her, Horne was then cast in groundbreaking films Cabin in the Sky and Stormy Weather (both 1943) which saw the first pivotal movie roles for African-Americans. Cabin in the Sky also featured black notable like Ethel Waters, Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington.</p>
<p>By 1944, Horne had won the Motion Picture Unity Award for “outstanding colored actress of the year,” leaving no doubt about her acting gift. She became the highest-paid black entertainer at the time.</p>
<p>But racist white studio executives were not going away without a fight so in certain productions, she was given parts that were not leads. In one MGM musical after another, she showed up in small roles – musical interludes that had little to do with the main story. In some states, where theaters couldn’t show black performers, her scenes were edited out altogether.</p>
<p>In a career spanning seven decades, Horne became a film, music, television and stage star as well as a formidable force for civil rights.</p>
<p>In 1981, the singer/actress made a triumphant return to Broadway with her one-woman show Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music. The acclaimed production ran on Broadway for 14 months, then toured in the United States and abroad. The show won a Drama Desk Award and a special Tony, as well as two Grammys for its soundtrack.</p>
<p>Two years later, she earned an NAACP medal that had previously been awarded to Martin Luther King, Jr., Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, and Rosa Parks.</p>
<p>Horne born on June 30, 1917, in Brooklyn, New York, was the daughter of parents who had a mixed heritage of African American, European American and Native American descent. Her peculiar background enabled whites to reject her as not being pure enough while blacks also accused her of passing for black.</p>
<p>It was therefore under that cloud that one night after a show, 43-year-old black stage and film star Paul Robeson came to her dressing room to pay his respects. She became a close friend of Robeson whom she confided in and who suggested union groups to join, which championed her causes including black rights.</p>
<p>But when Robeson was pursued for his alleged communist sympathies by the McCarthy witch-hunts of the 1950s, they affected Horne too, and prevented her from appearing on film and television over a seven-year period when she was reaching her creative peak.</p>
<p>Horne who had shared stages with Count Basie, Tony Bennett, Billy Eckstine, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and many other legends of American music for a brief period in the early 1950s appeared to have lost her career. Her name had appeared in Red Channels, a report that listed more than 100 entertainers who appeared to have communist leanings.</p>
<p>Now struggling to get work in the TV or film industries, Horne continued to perform at nightclubs. After all she had joined the chorus of the Cotton Club at the age of 16 and became a nightclub performer before moving to Hollywood.</p>
<p>On the civil rights front, Horne remained active in the Civil Rights Movement, performing at rallies around the country on behalf of the NAACP and the National Council for Negro Women even participating in the 1963 March on Washington.</p>
<p>Horne made her Broadway debut in the fall 1934 production Dance With Your Gods, joining Noble Sissle &amp; His Orchestra as a singer, using the name Helena Horne. She then appeared in the Broadway musical revue Lew Leslie’s Blackbirds of 1939. She then joined a well-known white swing band, the Charlie Barnet Orchestra as Barnet was one of the first bandleaders to integrate his band, but because of racial prejudice, Horne was unable to stay or socialize at many of the venues in which the orchestra performed, and she soon left the tour.</p>
<p>Her film credits include Swings Cheer (1943) and Broadway Rhythm (1944), Cabin in the Sky and Stormy Weather, ‘Death of a Gunfighter’ and ‘The Wiz.’</p>
<p>On the singing front, her albums It’s Love (1955) and Stormy Weather (1957) Feelin Good (1965) and Lena in Hollywood (1966) have proved to be enduring.</p>
<p>The ban had eased by the mid-1950s thanks to the instrumental work of Roy Brewer and Horne returned to the screen in the 1956 comedy Meet Me in Las Vegas. In 1970 and 1971, Horne’s son, father and brother died. She spent several years in deep mourning and was less visible.</p>
<p>In 1994, Horne gave one of her last concerts at New York’s Supper Club. The performance was recorded and released in 1995 as An Evening With Lena Horne: Live at the Supper Club, which won a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Album.</p>
<p>Horne, at age 19 married Louis Jones from 1937 to 1944 producing two children Gail and Teddy. She married Lennie Hayton, a white bandleader, in December 1947 in Paris, France, but they kept their marriage a secret for three years. They eventually separated in the 1960s but never divorced.</p>
<p>She died of heart failure in New York City on May 9, 2010 aged 92.

Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer</p>
<p>(BBC1, 9.15pm)</p>
<p>Saturday nights have long been the home of shiny-floor spectaculars such as Strictly Come Dancing and any number of other comedies, game and talent shows. The likes of Bruce Forsyth, Leslie Crowther and other TV legends have featured in this slot, but few would ever have imagined that lanky former England footballer Peter Crouch would one day be adding his name to that list. But we’re living in strange times at the moment, so here he is, becoming a variety show host. Maya Jama and Alex Horne and his band The Horne Section will also feature. Together they aim to give the public a taste of some of the major events they’re being forced to miss this summer.</p>
<p>John and Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen</p>
<p>(STV, 11.35am)</p>
<p>PEOPLE are cooking more than ever, but it’s getting harder and harder to be creative in response to the dreaded “What’s for tea?” question. Luckily, husband-and-wife duo professional chef John Torode and home cook Lisa Faulkner are back with a fourth series of the show which helps viewers easily find an answer.</p>
<p>In the first episode, the food theme is “It’s All Greek to Me”, where John and Lisa will provide viewers at home with simple and sunny Greek-inspired flavours. Recipes include a rack of roast Greek lamb with orzo and olives, prawn saganaki pies, a veggie cheat’s moussaka and a deceptively easy baklava for dessert.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer US</p>
<p>(STV, 4.40pm)</p>
<p>A CHANCE to catch the original US version of the show in the UK for the first time. Mystery celebrities battle it out in a singing contest while dressed head to toe in elaborate costumes, while a panel of more famous faces tries to guess their identities. Nick Cannon oversees the contest, as mystery singers dressed as Butterfly, Egg, Thingamajig and Skeleton take to the stage, while panellists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy and Nicole Scherzinger try to work out who is behind the mask.</p>
<p>Great Paintings of the World with Andrew Marr</p>
<p>(C5, 8.15pm)</p>
<p>HAVING made his name grilling politicians during his long career with the BBC, Andrew Marr may seem like an odd choice to front a programme about art. However, he’s an accomplished artist in his own right and has written books on the subject – cunningly titled A Short Book About Painting and A Short Book About Drawing. In this three-part programme Marr examines the enduring popularity of several works, and discusses the often fascinating stories behind them. He begins at the Louvre in Paris, home of perhaps the world’s most recognisable painting – Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa.

<p>Peter Crouch was on television this evening presenting his new show, Save Our Summer during BBC One’s prime time Saturday night slot. However, those watching at home were less than impressed by the channel’s new offering and took to Twitter to discuss.</p>
<p>Peter Crouch Save Our Summer release date: When is the new show on TV?</p>
<p>The former football was hosting a new varsity entertainment show, which featured live music, comedy skins and a host of celebrity guests - both in the studio and via live video links.</p>
<p>Peter wasn’t alone presenting the show, he was joined by BBC Radio 1 host and TV star Maya Jama, as well as Taskmaster’s Alex Horne and his comedy band the Horne section.</p>
<p>Comedian Chris Ramsey was also a guest as well as fellow footballer Rio Ferdinand.</p>
<p>This episode was the first of many and while some enjoyed the alternative offering from BBC One, some were not convinced.</p>

<h3 id="the-best-live-theater-to-stream-online-today">&ldquo;The Best Live Theater to Stream Online Today&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105658208/image.jpg" alt="img">
The current crisis has had a devastating effect on the performing arts. Broadway has shut down, and the ban on gatherings in New York extends to all other performance spaces as well. So the show must go online—and, luckily, streaming video makes that possible. Here are some of the best theater, opera, dance and cabaret performances you can watch today without leaving home, many of which will help you support the artists involved.</p>
<p>Events that go live today are at the top of the list; scroll down past the daily listings to find events you can still stream for a limited time and, below that, a bonus section of videos that have no expiration date. We update this page every day, so please feel free to bookmark it and check back. NOTE: Several events that had been scheduled to stream this week have been postponed in response to ongoing protests for racial equality.</p>
<p>Wilma Theater: Kill Move Paradise</p>
<p>Ongoing (through June 21)</p>
<p>Three African-American men and one younger boy, untimely ripped from their earthly lives by violence, find out what purgatory has in store for them in James Ijames’s expressionistic drama, which was inspired by the deaths of Tamir Rice and others. It’s provocative material, with a tone that moves rapidly from playful to intense. Blanka Zizka directs this 2018 production for Philadelphia’s Wilma Theater; the cast of four, performing on a striking white sloped set, comprises Avery Hannon, Anthony Martinez-Briggs, Brandon J. Pierce, and Lindsay Smiling. A donation of any size will get you a ticket, and all proceeds benefit Black Lives Matter Philly.</p>

<p>Zach Theatre: Notes from the Field</p>
<p>Ongoing (through June 14th)</p>
<p>Anna Deavere Smith delves into poverty, police brutality, mass incarceration and educational failure in her urgent, timely and mind-opening 2016 docutheater piece, which was drawn from more than 250 interviews. As the play shifts among characters of different sexes and races, Smith’s probing intelligence and fair-mindedness retain a tangible presence; she holds her subjects in a tough but loving embrace. The playwright originally performed the piece as a solo, but in this version, directed by Dave Steakley for Austin’s Zach Theatre in 2019, the parts are divided among four actors: Michelle Alexander, Zell Miller III, Carla Nickerson and Kriston Woodreaux. The theater is streaming a video of the production for free through Sunday.</p>

The latest offering, and the series’s first production from outside London, is Nottingham Playhouse’s 2018 revival of Alan Bennett’s historical drama The Madness of George III, which examines the harrowing mental illness that descending upon the King of England in 1788, several years after his forces lost a chunk of the empire in the American Revolution. Adam Penford directs a cast led by Mark Gatiss as the unruly ruler, Debra Gillett as his queen and Adrian Scarborough as his primary physician.</p>

Twice a day, at 2pm and 8pm, they play host to different theater stars in a live, chatty interview often interspersed with songs. (Rudetsky is an expert at sussing out good stories.)

Today&rsquo;s guests include Denise Lee, founder of the nonprofit outreach and education group Change the Perception.</p>

<p>Theater of War: The King Lear Project</p>
<p>7pm EDT / midnight BST (live only)</p>
<p>The community-oriented Theater of War Productions specializes in combining classical texts with burning contemporary issues, including in its 2018 production Antigone in Ferguson. Its extraordinary live Zoom performance of Oedipus the King last month—starring Oscar Isaac, Frances McDormand, Jeffrey Wright and John Turturro—was one of the theatrical high points of the isolation period. (There will be an encore on June 24.) In today’s live-only event, director Bryan Doerries uses selected scenes from Shakespeare’s King Lear as an entry point for a conversation about aging, dementia, elder care and family dynamics. The cast includes Frankie Faison, Amy Ryan, Kathryn Erbe, Marjolaine Goldsmith, David Zayas and NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. Reservations are required to Zoom in.</p>

<h3 id="northwest-notes-nuggets-jazz-blazers-roberson">&ldquo;Northwest Notes: Nuggets, Jazz, Blazers, Roberson&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hoopsrumors.com/files/2020/04/Nikola-Jokic-900x601.jpg" alt="img">
While the Trail Blazers were the only NBA team to vote against the NBA’s return-to-play plan, they weren’t the only Northwest club that would have preferred a solution besides the 22-team format the league settled on.</p>
<p>Two league sources tell Mike Singer of The Denver Post that the Nuggets initially voted in favor of a plan that would have sent the 16 current playoff teams immediately to the postseason. According to Singer, Denver was “strongly” opposed to a 20-team format that would’ve involved a World Cup-style group stage, believing it undermined the team’s regular season success.</p>
<p>While those 16- and 20-team plans received consideration, Silver ultimately decided that the 22-team format was in the NBA’s best interest, and when he brought it to the league’s Board of Governors for a vote on Thursday, the Nuggets voted to approve it.</p>
<p>Here’s more from around the Northwest:
