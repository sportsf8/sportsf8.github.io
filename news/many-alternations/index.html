<p>Schockmoment in der aktuellen &ldquo;Spezial&rdquo;-Ausgabe von &ldquo;Shopping Queen&rdquo;: Designerin Monella Caspar griff bei ihrem Color-Blocking-Outfit zu einer Stola aus Echtfell. Guido Maria Kretschmer fand harte Worte für die aus seiner Sicht untragbare Entscheidung.</p>
<p>Bunt, bunter, Paradiesvogel: In der aktuellen &ldquo;Spezial&rdquo;-Ausgabe von &ldquo;Shopping Queen&rdquo; ( VOX) wünschte sich Designer Guido Maria Kretschmer, dass es seine Kandidaten richtig bunt treiben. Das Motto: &ldquo;Color-Blocking für Profis: Sei der farbenfrohe Hingucker auf einer Party!&rdquo; Gewollt war ein aufsehenerregender Style, der sich aus mindestens drei knalligen Farben zusammensetzt. Wahrsagerin Lilo von Kiesenwetter (bekannt aus &quot; Promi Big Brother&quot;) sah bei der Aufgabe jedoch nur eine Farbe: rot: &ldquo;Schlimmer kann es nicht kommen&rdquo;, stöhnte sie. &ldquo;Was hat der für ein Sch&hellip;-Motto ausgesucht?&rdquo;, ätzte sie über die Aufgabe.</p>
<p>Neben Kiesenwetter (&ldquo;Wenn mich jemand fragt, wie alt ich bin, sage ich immer 60 plus&rdquo;) stellten sich Sängerin und Designerin Monella Casper, Friseur und Influencer Robin Rayaninan und Illustratorin und Designerin Sarah Settgast der Aufgabe. &ldquo;Ich sehe schon: eine Dicke und drei Schmale, Ihr habt es einfacher&rdquo;, begrüßte von Kiesenwetter ihre Konkurrenz bei sich zu Hause in Siegburg bei Bonn. &ldquo;Vielleicht kaufe ich mir was in Latex, aber da komm ich ja nie wieder raus&rdquo;, so die Seherin.</p>
<p>Guido Maria Kretschmer war fasziniert von den seherischen Fähigkeiten seiner Kandidatin - und outete sich überraschend als Bruder im Geiste. &ldquo;Ich kann das ja auch: Manchmal sehe ich, wann es bei Menschen zu Ende geht&rdquo;, orakelte er. Bevor es zu spooky wurde, konzentrierte er sich wieder auf seine Kandidatin und deren Faible für großen, auffälligen Halsschmuck: &ldquo;An der Kette kannst du ein handelsübliches Containerschiff festmachen&rdquo;, feixte er mit Hinblick auf ein besonders wuchtiges Accessoire, das bei von Kiesenwetter am Hals baumelte.</p>
<p>Am Ende kaufte sie aber ein für sie vergleichsweise gesetztes Outfit: einen dunkelblauen Mantel mit Perlenbesatz, eine türkisfarbene Hose, ein rotes T-Shirt sowie eine rote Sonnenbrille. Shopping-Begleitung Shirin war dennoch siegessicher: &ldquo;Wenn das nicht Color-Blocking ist, was dann?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shopping Queen&rdquo; ( VOX ): Kandidatin kauft echten Pelz - Guido Maria Kretschmer ist entsetzt Monella Caspar (&ldquo;Ich bin alterslos, furchtlos, aber nicht faltenlos&rdquo;) war als Nächste an der Reihe. Die Frau, die sich selbst als Verwandlungskünstlerin beschreibt, fällt vor allem durch ihre schrägen Kopfbedeckungen auf: &ldquo;Das ist mein berühmter Croissanthut, wo ich hinten einen Sender drauf habe&rdquo;, erklärte sie ihren staunenden Shopping-Kolleginnen eines ihrer Modelle.</p>
<p>Gemeinsam mit ihrem Gesangspartner Ben Zucker von &ldquo;Schwarzblond&rdquo; stellte sie sich ein Outfit aus pinkfarbenem Bleistiftock, gemusterter Corsage, giftgrüner Tasche und passenden Ohrringen sowie einem dunklen Fascinator zusammen. In einem Second-Hand-Laden entdeckte sie eine roséfarbene Pelzstola. Kretschmer: &ldquo;Lieber Gott, lass es einen unechten Nerz sein!&rdquo; Der Designer ist bekanntermaßen erbitterter Gegner von Echtfell. &ldquo;Das ist wirklich Mord. Sie wird im Nirwana gebissen werden, wenn sie um die Ecke kommt&rdquo;, kritisierte er die Kaufentscheidung der Kandidatin.</p>
<p>Die war sich keiner Schuld bewusst: &ldquo;Ich sehe das bei Fellbesätzen nicht so streng.&rdquo; Anders als ihre Konkurrenz: &quot; Pelz geht gar nicht&quot;, kommentierte Sarah Settgast. Lilo von Kiesenwetter sah es ähnlich: &ldquo;Du bist ein Gesamtkunstwerk, aber ich habe immer Probleme mit Fell.&rdquo; Nur Robin Rayanian war geflasht: &ldquo;Du siehst so viel jünger aus!&rdquo;, lobte er Monella Caspar und ihr Outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shopping Queen&rdquo; ( VOX ): 20er-Jahre treffen auf Ganzkörper-Tattoos Völlig begeistert war wiederum Guido Maria Kretschmer von Sarah Settgast. Die Berlinerin stylt sich konsequent im Stil der 1920er-Jahre und ist noch dazu ganzkörpertätowiert. &ldquo;Ich finde es Hammer, wie bei ihr dieser Retrostil mit den modernen Tattoos verschmilzt&rdquo;, war der &ldquo;Shopping Queen&rdquo;-Maestro angetan. Sarahs Shopping-Begleiter war kein Unbekannter: Rolf &ldquo;Rolfe&rdquo; Scheider, einst Juror an der Seite von Heidi Klum bei GNTM, unterstütze die Inhaberin eines Buchverlags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ich habe Gänsehaut! C&rsquo;est magnifique!&rdquo; frohlockte er, als sie das Outfit zusammenhatten: ein türkisfarbenes Kleid im Charleston-Stil, eine lila Stola, ein Hut in genau der gleichen Farbkombination und knallig-gelbe Handschuhe. &ldquo;Ich glaube, ich gebe zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben 11 Punkte!&rdquo;, jubelte Guido Maria Kretschmer über das Ergebnis. &ldquo;Du bist eine Offenbarung für mich, das habe ich selten gesehen, ich finde deinen Look virtuos&rdquo;, überschlug er sich geradezu mit Komplimenten.</p>
<p>Lilo von Kiesenwetter war ebenfalls angetan: &ldquo;Das ist so, als wenn jemand aus einem Film raus getanzt kommt!&rdquo;, kommentierte sie den Auftritt ihrer Konkurrenz. Mit einer Ausnahme: &ldquo;Die Handschuhe fand ich doch komisch, aber das ist ja vielleicht doch Color-Blocking?&rdquo;, rätselte sie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shopping Queen&rdquo; ( VOX ): &ldquo;So geil!&rdquo; - Robin Rayanian im silbernen Glitzerhöschen Keine Fragen offen ließ das Outfit von Paradiesvogel Robin Rayanian. &ldquo;Sein Stil? Verrückt! Nackt, halbnackt!&rdquo;, so Sarah Settgast. Der Mann, der in Berlin einen Friseursalon mit Mann Philipp führt, hatte sein grellbuntes Outfit schnell gefunden: pinkfarbenes Jackett, gelbes T-Shirt und kurze, silbern-glitzerndes Shorts. Die schlichten weißen Sneakers pimpte er mit bunten, gehäkelten Teddybären, dazu noch eine Langhaarperücke in pink-orange, Rainbow-Fahne und Clutch und ab dafür. &ldquo;Das ist so geil!&rdquo; - Robins Lieblingsspruch passte auch hier.

<h3 id="thousands-of-migrants-face-eviction-in-greece-sparking-fears-over-homelessness">&ldquo;Thousands of migrants face eviction in Greece sparking fears over homelessness&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/64/83/22/1000x563_cmsv2_5802d397-3c70-5f13-8827-5d0cf4adf14f-4648322.jpg" alt="img">
Thousands of recognised refugees in Greece face the prospect of being left homeless after their right to stay in temporary accommodation expired on Monday (June 1).</p>
<p>It comes after a new law, passed in November, reduced the period they could be sheltered from six months to just one.</p>
<p>The Emergency Support to Integration and Accommodation (ESTIA) scheme sees them hosted in apartments in Athens.</p>
<p>The UN&rsquo;s refugee agency (UNHCR) told Euronews that at least 8,500 refugees would be affected by the change.</p>
<p>Athens said the move was necessary to alleviate pressure on the more than 32,500 migrants living in squalid camps on the Greek islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is normal that those who have been in Greece for longer can leave their place,&rdquo; said Manos Logothetis, secretary of the Greek asylum service. &ldquo;There must be a limit, and the refugees integrate and find a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for Boris Cheshirkov, the UNHCR spokesman in Athens, the move is worrying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Refugees will have to leave this form of assistance without effective access to Greek social services,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In theory, they are entitled to assistance but in reality for those who do not speak the language, navigating the Greek bureaucracy can be extremely difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people now leaving the housing program are single parents who have been through violence, even torture, who may be traumatized and have not yet learned Greek, he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to see credible programs that are effectively allowing people to stand on their own feet before they&rsquo;re leaving on such short notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fears of a humanitarian crisis</p>
<p>Most of the accommodation provided by the scheme is in Athens and evicting so many refugees could trigger a humanitarian crisis in the city.</p>
<p>Greek newspaper Efsyn said it would be &ldquo;devastating and not just for the refugees&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ESTIA scheme was created to support migrants who are waiting to get their asylum request examined.</p>
<p>Though the scheme is funded by the EU, it is the Greek government that decides who can access it.</p>
<p>Efsyn accused Greek Immigration Minister Panagiotis Mitarachis of aligning with &ldquo;xenophobic and extremist groups&rdquo;, adding that the decision was taken only because of &ldquo;the urgent need of alleviating (migrant pressure) on the islands, where most of his voters are based&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Athens&rsquo;s city council, as well as pro-migrant groups, are working to find new shelters for the refugees as well as to provide them with basic necessities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;UNHCR has continuously raised its concerns that recognized refugees are expected to leave assistance but they do not have effective access to social benefits and support,&rdquo; the UN&rsquo;s refugee agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of those affected are vulnerable, including but not only most staying in ESTIA accommodation. Their effective inclusion in national systems offering services and for cash or in-kind support has not been possible so far. The situation is aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The risk of tensions are also increasing, and many people may be unable or unwilling to comply with the decision to leave their accommodation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;UNHCR has been urging a phased approach for refugees to leave assistance and a higher threshold to support vulnerable people who cannot leave their assistance at this stage in combination with other quick impact interventions to cover their basic needs.&rdquo;

<h3 id="extreme-weather-exiles-how-climate-change-is-turning-europeans-into-migrants">&ldquo;Extreme weather exiles: how climate change is turning Europeans into migrants&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/51/97/88/1000x563_cmsv2_c745d9af-ff64-5eb0-a958-264e1deb36d9-4519788.jpg" alt="img">
Climate change could leave you homeless overnight – right here, in Europe.</p>
<p>Flash floods, mudslides and wildfires triggered by heatwaves are among the extreme weather events becoming increasingly common, thanks to climate change.</p>
<p>Those who lose their homes and livelihoods in these disasters run the risk of being displaced, and becoming climate migrants – just like Iris, or Anne and Jean or Álvaro, Magdalena, Ana and Zekira or Julie and Chris, the people you will meet throughout this series of articles and videos. People whose stories have so far remained unreported.</p>
<p>“It’s a reality in Europe, not something that will happen in centuries,” says Dina Ionesco, who leads the work being done on migration and climate change at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).</p>
<p>Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move either within their country or abroad IOM (2011:33)</p>
<p>To find Europe’s environmental migrants, we travelled to the countries that have seen the highest number of displacements due to climate events on the continent, according to data provided by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC): Bosnia and Herzegovina, Spain,France and Germany.</p>
<p>We also went to Moldova – ranked as the most climate-vulnerable country in Europe – and to Portugal, the European country with the highest annual number of wildfires since 2015.</p>
<p>“Disaster displacement is very much a global phenomenon, even in high- income countries like the ones in Europe,” says Alexandra Bilak, director of the IDMC.</p>
<p>Euronews - Data provided by IDMC</p>
<p>More extreme weather events, more dangerous, more often</p>
<p>Climate events causing displacement in Europe have more than doubled in the last four years, from 43 in 2016 to 100 in 2019. By February 2020, four storms – Gloria, Brendan, Ciara and Dennis – had already wreaked havoc on the continent’s northern and western coasts.</p>
<p>The science is abundantly clear – climate change aggravates extreme weather events, making them deadlier and increasing the chance of them becoming more widespread. “Our climate projections show that the events that we are now classifying as extreme will become more frequent in the future. They will become the new normal,'' says Gianmaria Sannino, head of the Climate Modelling Laboratory at the Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA).</p>
<p>Euronews - Data provided by IDMC</p>
<p>Every number hides a human story</p>
<p>For every disaster in Europe that becomes a database entry, there are people who have lost everything. Most manage to rebuild their homes and return. But some are not as lucky.</p>
<p>Statistics show there are more heatwaves in Spain now than ever before. In the last five years, they have lasted an average of 15 days each. Between 1975 and 2014, Spanish heatwaves typically lasted for about five days.</p>
<p>Numbers like these become the backdrop for stories of people like Álvaro García Río-Miranda.</p>
<p>Álvaro García Río-Miranda, a 30-year-old goatherd, pictured in Descargamaría, Sierra de Gata, in November 2019 - Photo: Marta Rodriguez</p>
<p>In 2015, the 30-year-old goatherd had just begun working in the valley of Sierra de Gata, near Spain’s border with Portugal, when a wildfire killed half of his herd. Like many young farmers in Spain, Álvaro García Río-Miranda had been unable to afford insurance for his goats. He decided to sell the ones that survived, and moved abroad to find work.</p>
<p>The fire in Sierra de Gata was fuelled by the longest heatwave ever recorded in the country. The goatherd remembers: “I was running with [my animals] for four days. I didn’t know where to put them. They almost got burned alive in the village. Until it happens to you, you don’t understand its power.”</p>
<p>In other parts of Europe, flash floods have begun to strike places we might not have seen as vulnerable.</p>
<p>In 2010, La Faute-sur-Mer, a sleepy retirement town on France’s Atlantic coast, was devastated by a flood aggravated by the rising sea level. The water killed 29 people and displaced hundreds. Elisabeth Tabary lost her husband and grandson when her home flooded in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>700,000 displacements in Europe in the last decade</p>
<p>There have been 700,000 such stories of loss in Europe in the last decade. Avalanches, storms, floods and wildfires – by nature – often hit the same locations multiple times.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m not sure that only one episode promotes population displacement,” says Yves Tramblay, a scientist at the French Institute of Research for Development who specialises in hydrological hazards. “However, I think if these episodes repeat in the same areas that are frequently affected, they can actually push people to relocate elsewhere, if they have the possibility”.</p>
<p>After a few years abroad, the young goatherd Álvaro gave Sierra de Gata another chance and returned with a new herd. But the constant threat of fire made him paranoid every summer. Knowing he could not live through another one, he has decided to leave for Switzerland – this time for good.</p>

<p>Would you call yourself a climate migrant?</p>
<p>The impact of climate change in Europe is a recent enough phenomenon that it does not occur to most climate migrants that that is what they are. Nor is there an official definition. Beatriz Felipe, a Spanish climate migration researcher, says: “In reports, studies and scientific articles you find that different definitions are used: displaced persons, refugees, migrants. This leads to a great deal of confusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 2009 UN convention to combat desertification found that migrants also tend to underestimate climate as a factor in their situation. Most explain their displacement in terms of poverty, often overlooking the root cause behind the deterioration of their homes and land, and the resulting loss of productivity.</p>
<p>“Even for those cases in which it is very clear that climate impacts are directly driving people&rsquo;s migration – such as severe drought – people will hardly acknowledge that”, says Felipe.</p>

<p>After a catastrophic flood in 2014, Ana, a Bosnian woman who didn&rsquo;t want to use her real name, moved from Domaljevac, a small town on the border of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, to Germany.</p>
<p>When the river Sava broke levees after three weeks of torrential rain, 98 per cent of her hometown was submerged and her newly built house was destroyed.</p>
<p>“These events changed me profoundly, even though I always wanted to stay and live here”, she says over the phone from her home in Frankfurt, where she joined her husband with her son. “The floods made me think about what I would be able to offer my child in that village, in Bosnia, in two, three or 10 years’ time.”</p>
<p>However, she says she is not sure that the floods were her reason for moving abroad. She thinks they were “the cherry on top in our decision-making process”.</p>
<p>The fact that migration after an extreme weather event can seem, and even feel, voluntary, particularly when the migrants in question have the choices that come with economic means, adds to the lack of clarity. As an IOM report states, environmental migration is sometimes forced, sometimes voluntary, more often somewhere in between.</p>
<p>When you are forced to do something because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, it’s not the same as making a decision because you want to. Anne Birault Displaced resident (La Faute-sur-Mer, France)</p>
<p>How can you prove persecution by climate change?</p>
<p>Use of the term “climate refugee” creates a lot of buzz, according to Maeve Patterson of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), “but also a lot of confusion, as it doesn’t exist in international law.”</p>
<p>It is necessary to demonstrate persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group in order to request refugee status. “But you cannot show persecution from climate change,” says Ionesco, of the IOM.</p>
<p>She says there is currently an international debate over the necessity of differentiating climate refugees from climate migrants. The IOM’s position is that opening up the 1951 Refugee Convention to include climate change-related flight could weaken the integrity of the existing refugee status.</p>
<p>Ionesco believes that existing migration policies – such as temporary protection given to someone who crosses a border because of a natural disaster – can be part of the response.</p>
<p>While refugee status is also dependent on the individual having crossed a border, Patterson points out that climate change “typically creates internal displacement before it reaches a level where it displaces people across borders”.</p>
<p>In most countries, relevant laws on internal displacement, if they exist at all, are focused on the consequences of conflict – as is the case in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its laws were developed following the Dayton Agreement, the peace accord that put an end to the Bosnian War. While some of the principles apply to disaster displacement, it has been largely neglected in domestic law.</p>

<p>The legal challenge</p>
<p>Many of the climate migrants we interviewed told us that a natural disaster was one among many factors that brought about their decision to leave home. This is typical of of most climate migrants’ narratives. This makes climate change tricky to isolate as the sole driver behind migration, which makes it difficult to hold it up in court.</p>
<p>“If you are exposed to a chemical product and you get cancer, you will have a hard time saying in court that the cancer was produced by the chemical agents,” says Corinne Lepage, former French environment minister and the country’s most high-profile environmental lawyer. Lepage represented the victims of 2010’s Storm Xynthia in La Faute-sur-Mer when they successfully sued the town’s mayor.</p>
<p>“It is [sort of] the same thing for climate: even if there is a strong presumption, it is very difficult to prove that [these] things would not have happened otherwise.”</p>
<p>Lepage says the case of La Faute-Sur-Mer should be a lesson in climate change law, adding that there is work to be done, given the lack of existing legislation in France to cover increasingly common climate-related disasters.</p>
<p>In this field, Europe as a whole lags behind Africa. The African Union has adopted the comprehensive and legally binding Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa. Also known as the Kampala Convention, it acknowledges climate change as a man-made disaster creating displacement. The EU has no such equivalent region-wide convention.</p>
<p>“Except Finland, Italy and Sweden, no [European] country has a climate element in their protection system,” says Jean-Christophe Dumont of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). He adds that this makes an EU legal framework for environmental protection very difficult.</p>

<p>The Moldovan example</p>
<p>Moldova, the poorest country in Europe and the most vulnerable to climate change, lacks a clear definition of internally displaced persons in its legislative framework.</p>
<p>Laws governing migration in the country focus on refugees and asylum seekers and the term “displaced persons” refers only to foreigners.</p>
<p>Asked about the need to adapt the country’s policies to include climate change, Moldova’s president Igor Dodon told Euronews: &ldquo;The issue is not that of one country or nation, but a global one.” He said there were several plans to mitigate its effects in his country, but did not mention any specifically.</p>
<p>According to the UN, Moldova suffered eleven droughts between 1990 and 2015, costing the country more than €1 billion.</p>
<p>It is very problematic to say how many [people] have migrated due to weather conditions. Vasile Scorpan Manager of Moldova&rsquo;s Climate Change Office</p>
<p>The true scale of an under-reported phenomenon</p>
<p>Studies and reports in recent years have joined the dots between migration, climate change and environmental degradation. However, all of them cite Europe only as a “recipient” in these migration patterns.</p>
<p>“In the common imagination, migration flows only come from Africa or from developing countries,” says ENEA scientist Sannino.</p>
<p>The difficulty in tracking voluntary (if under duress) movement of people from one European country to another, like Ana’s migration from Bosnia and Herzegovina to Germany, leads to widespread under-reporting, both by the media and academic institutions.</p>
<p>“Even if there are much higher levels of preparedness in European countries than others, there’s actually less information available,” says Alexandra Bilak of IDMC. “Not just about the number of people becoming displaced every year, but also about what happens to them in the long run.”</p>
<p>The area is clearly under-researched, admits the OECD’s Dumont, citing reasons from the relatively small scale of displacements to the absence of official reports on the return flows after a disaster, and the lack of legal definition at national and international level.</p>

<p>A question of economics</p>
<p>“We fear disaster displacement risks exacerbating socio-economic inequalities,” says Bilak. She explains that lower-income families are disproportionately exposed to such disasters and are at greater risk of being displaced by them, and remaining so for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>In central Bosnia and Herzegovina, many of those affected by the 2014 flood were older people living off an annual pension of €2,500. Mudslides demolished their houses, causing €50,000 of damage in some cases, making any recovery utterly unaffordable.</p>
<p>The UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Philip Alston, believes humankind is heading towards what he calls &ldquo;climate apartheid&rdquo;.</p>
<p>“We’re concerned that many low-income households are buying cheaper land to build cheaper houses in areas that are going to be more vulnerable to these types of events in the future, and therefore this pattern of poverty and vulnerability will only be perpetuated and exacerbated by these events in the future”, says Bilak.</p>

<p>However, even in Bavaria, south-east Germany, one of Europe’s wealthiest regions, some residents cannot afford to insure their houses against the effects of climate events. It took pensioner Karl Bretzendorfer more than six years to rebuild his home after the floods of 2013. If the floods come again, he won’t get financial aid to do so – in 2019, Bavaria’s regional government stopped public economic support for victims of natural disasters who don&rsquo;t have home insurance. Insurance would cost Karl Bretzendorfer €1,000 a year. His only income is his pension – €850 per month.</p>
<p>As climate change-related events become more frequent, the capacity to support its victims economically will be a challenge for European governments.</p>
<p>“I think that the problem today is a problem of cost, because in France most of the work to protect houses against the sea, home repairs and compensation are covered by the public sector, and I think that we are reaching the end of [the line with that] system,” says Catherine Meur-Férec, an expert in coastal geography at the Université de Bretagne Occidentale.</p>
<p>“Even though the primary responsibility has to rest with national governments we do think there could be an increased role to play by the private sector and by insurance companies,” says Bilak.</p>
<p>Where do Europe’s climate migrants go?</p>
<p>In most cases, displacement due to climate change occurs within the affected country&rsquo;s borders. But despite being forced to abandon their homes and livelihoods, the internally displaced “are often the most forgotten and neglected people in the many forgotten and neglected emergencies around the world,” according to Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, a set of international principles all countries are bound by under international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Internally displaced people are often refugees in all but name, but they are seen to be the poor relations to refugees: their vulnerability and visibility are less newsworthy, if only because they have not had to cross a border IDMC</p>
<p>After the tragedy of Xynthia, Anne and Jean Birault lost their home in La Faute-sur-Mer. Unlike many other Europeans, they were compensated by the French state and decided to move 30 kilometres away, rather than live with the fear that another storm would hit them as they slept.</p>

<p>But for them, it is not a matter of distance. They say money cannot buy back what they lost when they left their home and the memories of the family they raised there.</p>
<p>Many victims of extreme weather events are forced to move in with family in the aftermath, some having to cross borders to do so. Ionesco explains: “Very often, people are already in a migration story that is very complex, with parts of their families living in different countries.”</p>
<p>“A friend of mine was picked up on the day of the floods by her husband,” recalls Ivana (not her real name), a Bosnian nurse from Domaljevac. “He came for her from Germany, she got in the car and left. And her house wasn’t even flooded. For her it was simply a trigger to leave and never come back”.</p>
<p>According to Ionesco, the discussion at international level has to be not just political but also technical, involving, for example, how the right consular services can be made available to those who move as a result of a climate change-related event.</p>
<p>Bilak echoes this, saying: “It should be up to national governments, as first responders, to start with data collection, with monitoring this situation over time and then putting in place the right kind of systems to either relocate or compensate people.”</p>
<p>Towards a new urban exodus?</p>
<p>Rural areas are by nature more vulnerable than cities to climate change, given that “human economic activities are more linked to the land, which is being affected by floods and droughts,” says Spanish researcher Felipe. “In the end, if the land no longer [provides], people have to adapt or move.”</p>
<p>Bilak points out that, as a result, people living in rural areas will tend to flee towards urban areas, and that enabling cities to be better prepared for this flow of people has to be a priority for the future.</p>

<p>In addition, depopulation of rural areas and vulnerability to climate change are mutually reinforcing processes.</p>
<p>The lesson learned in the Spanish region of Sierra de Gata after the 2015 fire can be applied across Europe. “Here, mountains have no virgin forests. It is a humanised landscape that has been modified over thousands of years,” says Carmen Hernández Mancha, a local environmental journalist. “In order for it to be healthy and resist climate change and fires, it needs people to live there.”</p>
<p>The emotional legacy</p>

<p>In Portugal, Julie Jennings and Chris Nilton, British pensioners who survived the 2017 wildfires in Pedrógão Grande, are now packing up and migrating to the coast. Julie cannot live with the rising heat in the region, and memories of the fire haunt them at night. As they pack their belongings, they talk of not being able to sleep, and feeling anxious and scared.</p>
<p>After losing everything in the 2013 flood in Bavaria, Iris Hirschauer decided to move with her family to a neighbouring village to avoid a repeat of the trauma they had suffered. “We never want to be evacuated again and have to lean on strangers,” she said.</p>

<p>In Bosnia and Herzegovina, 68-year-old Šefik Čolić lost his house in the 2014 mudslides and was relocated three times before finally settling in a run-down town a few kilometres from his home. He says that he and his wife “needed psychological assistance for a while”.</p>

<p>Uprooted: the challenges of relocation</p>
<p>In 2012, France developed a national strategy on the possibility of relocating coastal communities deemed to be at risk. “But there is very strong resistance at the local level, even with the right compensation,” says Catherine Meur-Férec of the Université de Bretagne Occidentale.</p>
<p>“In France,” scientist Freddy Vinet, expert in disaster management, explains, “we are in a culture where people are very attached to their private property, to their land and their house. There is no tradition of mobility.” He says the conversation is about places where generations of families have lived, died and been buried.</p>

<p>“We know sea levels are rising, so the real issue is, how do we [retreat from the coast] and reconstruct our lives with the minimum social and economic impact? We have absolutely no means to finance a mass-coastal retreat”, says Laurent Huger, deputy mayor of La Faute-sur-Mer.</p>
<p>Some communities resist moving at any cost.</p>
<p>In Cotul Morii, a Moldovan village on the border with Romania, we met families that have been living in a ghost town for more than a decade. After a catastrophic flood, Moldova’s government built them new houses in a village 15km away, but they refused to leave their homes.</p>
<p>“Very little has been said about those who can’t migrate, because they have no resources, and about those who do not want to leave,” says Felipe. “Within the planning of relocations, the rights of people who don&rsquo;t want to leave have to be taken into account.”</p>
<p>What next? Five things governments should be doing now</p>
<p>The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre recommends that European countries develop policies covering five key points: Effective monitoring systems to better understand who will be most affected by weather-related events and disasters in general, for how to help the most vulnerable; Improved alert systems to give people enough time to evacuate themselves safely if they can; Evacuation plans adapted to the newly increased level of risk, which should be as efficient and dignified as possible, and made in consultation with residents; Better communication between local and national authorities, in order to better monitor what happens to displaced people in the long run and share data with institutions and at an international level; Better sharing of information with the public, learning lessons from countries outside Europe used to dealing with extreme weather events, such as Japan.</p>
<p>An opportunity to build more resilient societies</p>
<p>According to Felipe: “In Europe we have the technical and economic possibilities to adapt to climate change. We are only lacking political will.”</p>
<p>Bilak adds that European governments still need better flood-risk mapping and policies, and to work on compensation mechanisms to ensure that displaced residents can either return to their homes safely or build elsewhere, in safer areas.</p>
<p>After extreme weather events, governments often rush to announce that everything has been rebuilt exactly as it was, reassuring their populations that the status quo has been restored. In Serbia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, river banks were not raised any higher than they were doing the 2014 floods, says Vladimir Djurdjevic, a climatologist at the University of Belgrade.</p>
<p>“They don’t realise that, since we have to expect more floods, and bigger ones, when you reconstruct things the way they used to be, you are not protecting people from future impact.”</p>
<p>But more resilient communities can rise from the ashes. When you ask residents of Sierra de Gata about the aftermath of the 2015 fire, many use the word &ldquo;opportunity”.</p>

<p>One local man, Rodrigo &ldquo;Bongui&rdquo; Ibarrondo, initiated a programme to reforest the burned areas with tree species more resistant to fire. “The landscape was crying out for a change and what is clear is that the pine monocultures were the factor that made the fires happen at that magnitude,” he says.</p>
<p>In La Faute-sur-Mer, deputy mayor Huger says: “We have created a network that, in case of a storm, has an obligation to look out for older or disabled neighbours.”</p>
<p>Ion Sandu, resident of old Cotul Mori, Moldova, stands in front of the house he refused to abandon. Photo: Victor Ciobanu</p>
<p>In Moldova&rsquo;s capital Chisinau, it is difficult to find younger people who believe climate change is impacting their lives. But just under 100 kilometres to the west, in the remnants of the small town of Cotul Morii, which was swallowed up by floods in 2010, the elderly residents are all too aware that it is.</p>
<p>Ion Sandu, 85, wrote a poem in 2017 upon waking up and seeing snow outside – in April.</p>
<p>The village he lives in no longer officially exists.</p>
<p>Winter comes on the eve of May</p>
<p>And it settles on my homeland</p>
<p>Winter comes in April</p>
<p>And it only brings us cold</p>
<p>What fault would it be</p>
<p>Of a small tulip</p>
<p>That lies under the snow</p>
<p>Wanting a bit of warmth</p>
<p>And the trees blossomed</p>
<p>A rich harvest announced</p>
<p>One night it all froze</p>
<p>What a tragedy</p>
<p>Maybe the climate has changed</p>
<p>Or maybe the world is broken.</p>
<p>Sandu&rsquo;s house had flooded during the 2010 storm. He and his wife, who has since passed away, were evacuated by the army. When the government offered him a home in the new village it had built for those affected by the water, he refused to leave the house he had lived in all his life. He had inherited it when his parents died, and promised his father he would take care of his vineyard.</p>
<p>If the house floods again, he will not be evacuated – the village he lives in no longer officially exists.

“In 2014, when the floods came and ravaged the ground floor of our newly built house, we began to talk frequently about moving to Germany.”</p>
<p>Ana (who did not want us to use her real name) and her son packed their belongings and, thanks to her Croatian passport, left the town of Domaljevac to join her husband in Frankfurt, where they have been living together ever since.</p>
<p>“Those events changed me profoundly,” she told Euronews. “I had always wanted to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ivana (also not her real name), a nurse at Domaljevac hospital, recalls others fleeing the floods: “A friend of mine was picked up on the first day of the floods by her husband, who came for her from Germany. She just got in the car and left, her house wasn’t even flooded. For her it was the trigger. She left and never came back.”</p>
<p>Euronews</p>
<p>The North Pole, global warming and a real impact in Europe</p>
<p>The 2014 Balkan flooding has been directly linked to climate change.</p>
<p>“The globe is connected to a huge climate system, so big changes in some parts of the globe can lead to drastic consequences in another,” explains Vladimir Đurđević, a climatologist at the University of Belgrade. The warming of the North Pole, he says, triggers drastic changes in atmospheric circulation. Put simply, this means that rising temperatures in one location can affect wind patterns thousands of kilometres away.</p>
<p>In May 2014 a massive cyclone touched down in the Balkans. What was unusual was that it remained stationary. It sat over the region for too long, bringing relentless, heavy rainfall; in some areas, it rained for 21 consecutive days. The soil was completely saturated. This caused flash floods, erosion and landslides, which destroyed properties and livelihoods along small watercourses. The disastrous flooding along River Sava and its tributaries was described as “biblical” by Serbian newspapers.</p>
<p>Residents rescue horses and ponies in the flooded village of Domaljevac, near Orašje, northern Bosnia, on 23 May, 2014 Elvis BarukčIć/AFP</p>
<p>The biggest rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia all broke levees: the Bosna, the Vrbas, the Una and the Sava, the greatest tributary of Danube. The water did not subside for three days.</p>
<p>During the crisis, authorities feared damages could exceed those caused during the entire Balkan conflict fought between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats between 1992 and 1995.</p>
<p>Depopulation: Europe&rsquo;s first international climate migrants?</p>
<p>The migration that followed is not simply a Bosnian story, but a European one.</p>
<p>In this part of the country, at the border with Croatia, there are entire villages that are majority Catholic Croat; driving around, however, it is not unusual to spot mosques or Serbian Orthodox churches. The Croatian passport, which is only available to Bosnian Croats, opens doors to the European Union but it is not a luxury that most Bosnians have. Following the floods, many of those lucky enough to have one, left to look for opportunities in countries such as Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy.</p>
<p>The floods may not have been the only factor pushing people to leave the country, but for many it was the tipping point.</p>
<p>“The floods were the final straw in our decision-making,” says Ana.</p>
<p>“This is a type of climate migration,” suggests Miroslav Lucić, deputy mayor of Domaljevac-Šamac, who confirms an increased outward trend after 2014. “In the &rsquo;90s there was war-provoked emigration. Parts of our local community were basically annihilated. Then people came back and started living normally and moved on with their lives. Then the floods happened and took them five steps back. People did not have a sense of safety for their families while continuing to live here”.</p>
<p>Domaljevac, like many other villages in the small Posavska region, was almost completely submerged: 95.5 per cent of its houses were affected by floods.</p>
<p>In this area “the emigration began as soon as a natural disaster emergency was declared,” explains Tihomir Bijelić, editor and director of Radio Orašje, a local FM station. “Often, male members of the families were already working abroad: after the flooding, the rest of their family members followed suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have no way of measuring the number of people emigrating, but the World Bank estimates that the number of Bosnians living outside the country is nearly half the entire population.</p>
<p>In 2014, international news wires wrote that the disaster “triggered the worst exodus since the war”.</p>
<p>Ivo Marković, president of the municipality of Kopanice, estimates that 15-20 per cent of residents moved away. The local population now stands at 280.</p>

<p>For those who stayed, many did not receive any help from the state. Mara, a pensioner living in the village of Vidovice, right next to Kopanice, who has eight daughters all living abroad, says she “didn’t receive a single Mark”.</p>
<p>In Orašje, a bigger town just a few kilometres away, the town hall told Euronews that no statistical data existed but that “probably half of the working-age population had left. Floods had only been a trigger”.</p>

<p>A combination of its complicated political situation and location between richer neighbouring countries leaves Bosnia and Herzegovina in a difficult position when it comes to addressing its demographic crisis, writesBalkan Insight. Driving around the countryside, it is impossible not to notice the large number of empty houses, their shutters down.</p>
<p>‘I feel like a migrant in my own country’: Internally displaced people rebuild their lives</p>
<p>Up in the mountains of central and eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, where communities are majority Bosnian Muslim, the same extreme weather events set off landslides that destroyed entire villages.</p>
<p>Residents try to excavate a car trapped in the mud caused by a landslide at the village of Topčić Polje on 20 May, 2014 Sulejman Omerbašić/AP</p>
<p>Small towns, such as Maglaj, faced reconstruction bills of up to €85 million. To put that into context, the municipality’s annual budget is just €4 million.</p>
<p>Displacement in these areas was mainly internal. These communities didn’t have the option of moving internationally, so they stayed put, or in some cases moved a few kilometres away, where they were relocated into purpose-built, functional but characterless towns.</p>
<p>“The financial support from authorities was very weak because they hadn’t planned for that. They never expected such a large-scale disaster. No authorities in Bosnia had much budget for that,” says Alen Ćosić, a local representative of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) mission.</p>
<p>Muhamed Jusufović, president of the municipal council of Žepče, which lost an entire neighbourhood in the village of Željezno Polje – today a ghost area of the town – told Euronews that the average annual income was between 4,000 and 5,000 BAM (€2,500), while the damage faced by residents “was between 50,000 and 100,000 BAM (€50,000)”.</p>

<p>One resident of this area admits he was only able to reconstruct his house thanks to “private donations from some wealthy people from Mostar”, in the south of the country.</p>
<p>Pensioner Šefik Čolić, 68, used to live uphill, in Žepče. After the mudslides, international donations made it possible for him to relocate downhill, in a newly built village on the banks of the Bosna river. He moved three times before finally settling down with his wife. “It is not how it used to be,” he says. “Me and my wife needed psychological assistance for quite a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, such as Kalesija, reconstruction was only possible thanks to a joint effort from the Red Cross, the UN’s Organisation for Migration (IOM) and federal government funding, as well as donations from Bosnian families living abroad.</p>
<p>“Personally, I feel like a migrant because I had to move away from my own home… even though I stayed in my own country,” says Zekira Ikanović, whose house in Hrasno Gornje was destroyed by a landslide on 15 May, 2014.</p>
<p>She and her family were moved to military barracks for six months, then assigned to collective accommodation for two years before finally being able to build a new house in Memići – 40km away from her original home – thanks to donations.</p>

<p>Today she is unemployed. Her husband was a farmer but he had to take on new work doing occasional home repairs, a role that forces him to travel most of the time.</p>
<p>“We had taken a bank loan to build our previous house, but then the house got destroyed, and even then I had to keep paying back the loan until it was entirely paid off. They came searching for me,” Zekira says.</p>
<p>Unprepared and ill-equipped for large-scale disaster</p>
<p>“Before 2014, I had never heard of anyone having to move away for a natural disaster,” Zekira said. “I&rsquo;m scared to even think about such a thing happening again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, the chance of another large-scale disaster hitting Bosnia and Herzegovina is far from remote.</p>
<p>“People put climate change at the bottom of their problem list. When authorities carry out reconstruction work, they just try to make things look the same as before, instead of preparing infrastructure to be resilient for future, stronger impacts,” warns climatologist Vladimir Đurđević. “We can expect to see more and more super-extreme weather events, leading to huge damage and to the suffering of people – with even more amplitude.”</p>
<p>“Rural areas are even more sensitive to climate change than cities and will not have the strength to recover when houses are blown away,” says Gianmaria Sannino, head of the Climate Modelling Laboratory and Impacts at ENEA.</p>
<p>In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the feeling is that people don’t have the means – financial or emotional – to face a similar disaster again.</p>
<p>“People here say they cannot stand another flood. I think young families could see it as a trigger to leave permanently,” says OSCE representative Ćosić.</p>
<p>“In terms of starting a new home or living in this country, when they weigh [up] the two options, they would rather opt for leaving Bosnia and [going] to Germany and starting a new job, a new life, rather than asking for a bank loan and getting themselves in debt for the next few years”.

<p><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/library/111/43/34/14/1114348afd201a8b67e8df6aa3fd42d4d341401a7aa1/1000x563_cmsv2_b76aaad3-c5ec-538d-9515-96ef0d95b826-1114348afd201a8b67e8df6aa3fd42d4d341401a7aa1.jpg" alt="img">
When you live by the sea, storms are a part of life.</p>
<p>On the night of 28 February, 2010, the forecast predicted strong winds and some rain for La Faute-sur-Mer, a French town that sticks out into the Atlantic Ocean like a tongue of sand.</p>
<p>Jean and Anne Birault took their usual precautions, removing anything from the garden that could fly away. Everything seemed quiet when they went to sleep.</p>
<p>The sound of leaking water woke them a few hours later. Anne got up to investigate. Looking out of the window, she saw a wall of water 1.5m high, pushing at their door and windows to get in. She immediately understood what was happening: &ldquo;The sea was invading us.” She knew that she and her husband had just 15 minutes to get out.</p>
<p>Anne’s neighbour François Anil was one of the few residents of La Faute-sur-Mer who had researched what would happen in the event of a sea flood and what to do, and had warned Anne and Jean about the dangers.</p>
<p>On that night, 29 of their neighbours drowned in freezing water, in what came to be known as “la cuvette de la mort” – the basin of death. And Jean and Anne became climate migrants.</p>
<p>Xynthia was a perfect storm of hurricane-force winds, surging seas and driving rain that smashed into the western coasts of France and Spain overnight, wreaking havoc as far inland as Germany and leaving more than a million households without power. Fifty people were killed.</p>
<p>Neither the storm nor the flood were exceptional weather events. What made them so destructive was climate change.</p>
<p>If Xynthia had taken place a century ago its impact would have been far less severe, explains Freddy Vinet, a lecturer in Disaster and Natural Risk Management at the University of Montpellier.</p>
<p>“The aggravating factor related to climate change is the rise in sea levels, so for the same [severity of] storm, a rise in sea levels will result in a higher flood.”</p>
<p>In some oceans, the rise in sea levels has been as much as 20 centimetres since satellite records began in 1993, with the rate of increase more than doubling in the early years of the 21st century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that sea levels could rise by a metre by 2100.</p>
<p>Firefighters arrived late at La Faute-sur-Mer, overwhelmed by calls from other towns. In the basin of death, phones – already underwater – were silent.</p>

<p>The night of the storm</p>
<p>The water surprised Elisabeth Tabary as she slept. She and her husband had decided to spend their retirement years in La Faute-sur-Mer. Her son, daughter-in-law and two-year-old grandson, Raphaël, had come to stay.</p>
<p>Elisabeth, who was sleeping downstairs with her husband and Raphaël, fled to the kitchen. Trying to stay above the water, she climbed up the door, with her feet on the handle and her grandson in her arms. Her husband drowned in front of her eyes. Hours later, her grandson died of hypothermia in her arms. &ldquo;At that point, I wanted to drown myself,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Tabary looks at a picture of her former house in La Faute-sur-Mer. Picture taken in September 2019 Lillo Montalto Monella</p>
<p>Elisabeth put the baby’s body behind the kitchen door, to protect him from being washed away by the water, dragged out by the low tide. Then she lost consciousness. Firefighters did not know Raphaël was behind the door and Elisabeth, who by the time they were searching was in a coma, could not tell them. They didn´t find him until 24 hours later.</p>
<p>Her son found Elisabeth at dawn, delirious. He and his wife had slept through it all on the second floor and he had no idea what was to greet him when he came downstairs. When Elisabeth awoke from her coma, she had a stroke. Today, she has problems remembering not just the night of the storm, but her life before it.</p>
<p>On the day of the funerals for her husband and grandson, she made the decision never to leave the town again, which she says would be like “abandoning the members of my family who died here”. Her son’s wife, Raphaël’s mother, has never set foot in the town again.</p>
<p>After Xynthia, more than 600 houses in the town had to be demolished and around 400 of the 1,000 residents who lost their homes decided to leave.</p>
<p>When flooding devastated the French town of La Faute-sur-Mer in 2010&rsquo;s storm Xynthia, 29 people lost their lives and many more their homes. 1 2 Firefighters wade down a flooded street in La Faute-sur-Mer AP/David Vincent 1 2 The whole town was submerged in the aftermath of Xynthia AP/Frank Perry 1 2 A gate floats down a flooded street in the southwestern French town AP/David Vincent 1 2 A resident is evacuated by firefighters on 1 March, 2010 AP/David Vincent 1 2 La Faute-sur-Mer, on the Atlantic coast, is vulnerable to sea floods AP/Frank Perry 1 2 Flooded houses and a car are seen in La Faute-sur-Mer after the storm AP/David Vincent 1 2 When the streets flooded, 29 locals lost their lives AP/David Vincent 1 2 The town lies on the Atlantic coast in southwestern France AP/Frank Perry 1 2 A woman surveys the destruction in her house after storm Xynthia AFP 1 2 Residents were evacuated by firefighters AP/David Vincent</p>
<p>Leaving your life behind</p>
<p>Anne and Jean couldn’t live with the idea that something like this could happen to them again. Once the French state had bought their destroyed house from them, they relocated to Jard-sur-Mer, a town 30km away. For Anne, being a migrant is not a matter of distance, but of leaving behind the life they had built over decades, the home of their memories and where they raised their family.</p>

<p>In 2007, Ahmed Bounaceur, an intensive care doctor, bought a piece of land in the town. He was granted a building permit in less than two weeks. On the night of the flood, he lost his mother, wife and sons, Ismaël (5) and Camil (13). Only his daughter survived, and he left La Faute-sur-Mer for good, soon afterwards.</p>
<p>Anne and Jean Birault, former residents of La Faute-sur-Mer, decided to move away after they lost their house in storm Xynthia Lillo Montalto Monella</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the story François Anil tells about his neighbour, a woman “with a German-Swiss accent who was living here in front of the sea. When the water arrived, her dog swam her to safety. Shocked, she left La Faute-sur-Mer for good and never came back”.</p>
<p>Hairdresser Adeline Baffart was six months’ pregnant when she and her husband had to climb on to the roof of their flooded house the night of the storm, where firefighters found them the following morning.</p>
<p>After Xynthia, she sold what was left of her house to the government and moved with her family to Triaize, 20km away, settling down in the apartment of her late grandmother. She gave birth to Julia, and a few years later, another daughter, Lilou, arrived.</p>
<p>Adeline, who doesn’t consider herself a climate migrant, still works in La Faute-Sur-Mer as all her clients are based there.</p>
<p>“Maybe one day we will go back to retire there when our daughters are grown up, but we will see,” she said.</p>
<p>France has the third-highest number of people displaced due to weather disasters in the EU, according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (IDMC). More than 47,000 were uprooted between 2008 and 2019.</p>
<p>And 17 million people in the country currently live at risk of flooding, according to the European Centre for the Prevention of Flood Risks (CEPRI) – 20 per cent of French households.</p>
<p>The blame game</p>
<p>Today, a golf club stands where Jean and Anne once lived, with cypress trees marking where people drowned.</p>
<p>The area was known to local authorities to be a flood risk when their house was built – but not to them. Maps from the time indicate where flooding was likely, but these were not taken into account when building permits were being issued and not shared when houses were being bought.</p>
<p>Deputy Mayor Laurent Huger says that 80% of those who left ‘had no choice’ Lillo Montalto Monella</p>
<p>“If we had been informed, we would never have built a house where we built it,” says Anne.</p>
<p>After Xynthia, René Marratier, mayor of La Faute-sur-Mer from 1989 to 2014, was initially given a four-year jail term for manslaughter, reduced on appeal to a two-year suspended sentence.</p>
<p>During his trial, an expert witness stated that: “The freedom to build in the area at risk of flooding was absolute.”</p>
<p>Thierry Sauzeau, a specialist in maritime history at the University of Poitiers who had been studying the urbanisation of France’s west coast and, in parallel, marine submersions, added: “[There were] stacks of building permits to distribute, the procedure was being reduced to a mere formality.”</p>
<p>René Marratier, mayor of La Faute-sur-Mer from 1989-2014, and Corinne LePage, former environment minister and the lawyer who represented the victims AFP</p>
<p>Corinne LePage, France&rsquo;s former environment minister and lawyer, who represented the victims, told Euronews: “La Faute-sur-Mer is a textbook case of climate change in the sense that there was well-made legislation against the risk of flooding that wasn’t applied.”</p>
<p>Marratier, who to this day proclaims his innocence but declined to comment for this article, was found to have knowingly refused to take any measures to protect his constituency, failed to implement a flood risk prevention plan (PPRI) and to have failed to provide information to residents.</p>
<p>After a decade away from public service, he is running again in the local elections in March 2020. He cannot stand for mayor but will try to get on to the town council.</p>
<p>Euronews</p>
<p>The French state deemed it unsafe to rebuild homes in the areas flooded during Xynthia and risk prevention maps were updated in 2012 and 2017.</p>
<p>“This is a laboratory. It was the first time we had to tell people we need to demolish your house; that they would be reimbursed and that they did not have the right to build on their land anymore,” said deputy mayor Laurent Huger.</p>
<p>La Faute-sur-Mer now has evacuation plans that the mayor can make mandatory in the event of severe flooding, and the town hall has provided emergency training for all residents. Many have installed water detectors – similar to smoke alarms – on the ground floors of their houses.</p>
<p>“It is like a state of war. Now the majority of people at La Faute-Sur-Mer know what nature can do to their daily life,” said Huger.</p>

<p>Trying to move on</p>
<p>The tragedy of Xynthia prompted a national reflection on risk management linked to coastal erosion. There have also been calls to better protect those living by the sea.</p>
<p>LePage said this was necessary because it was difficult to prove a link between climate change and a catastrophic weather event.</p>
<p>“If you are exposed to a chemical product and you get cancer, you will have a hard time to say in court that the cancer is produced by the chemical agents,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s similar for the climate. There is a strong presumption, but absolute proof that [these] things would not have happened [without climate change], it is just very difficult to have.”</p>
<p>Back in La Faute-sur-Mer, house prices are holding up. In France, living by the sea is not associated with risk, but rather with status.</p>
<p>Euronews</p>
<p>In surveys carried out after Xynthia, the majority of people in the town said they were not afraid to remain living by the sea.</p>
<p>But for Anne, the memories are just too painful.</p>
<p>“The things that happened to us were too much,” she said. “When these things happen in other parts of the world, like the tsunami in Japan, I shake from the top of my head to my feet”.</p>
<p>Anne and Jean’s son stayed and opened a bar in the town centre. Now, a decade on, La Faute-sur-Mer is once again a golden retreat for pensioners and tourists.</p>
<p>“We had to reconstruct our image and soul,” said Huger. “It took us six to seven years, we raised the dykes and stopped the construction of new houses.”</p>
<p>But, despite the talk of the town’s resurrection, he sounded caution over forgetting a key lesson.</p>
<p>“We need to tell people that even if the state has told you the area is safe, and the town hall has built dykes, you need to know that, one day, the water could still come.”</p>
