<p>A German state finance minister took his own life after expressing “despair” over how to handle the economic fallout from coronavirus, an official said.</p>
<p>Thomas Schaefer, who was the finance minister of Germany’s Hesse region, was found dead by suicide Saturday on railway tracks at Hochheim, which is near Frankfurt.</p>
<p>State governor Volker Bouffier said Sunday that the 54-year-old had become consumed with how to handle the coronavirus crisis sending the global markets into freefall.</p>
<p>He said Schaefer was particularly concerned about “whether it would be possible to succeed in fulfilling the population’s huge expectations, particularly of financial help.”</p>
<p>“I have to assume that these worries overwhelmed him,” Bouffier said. “He apparently couldn’t find a way out. He was in despair and left us.”</p>
<p>Authorities investigating Schaefer’s death said questioning witnesses led them to conclude that he died by suicide.</p>
<p>Schaefer was a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and had held his position for a decade.</p>

<h3 id="esm-not-eurobonds-is-the-mechanism-to-share-burden---german-finance-minister">ESM, not Eurobonds is the mechanism to share burden - German finance minister</h3>
<p><img src="https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png" alt="img">
BERLIN, March 29 (Reuters) - The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) is the right instrument to share the economic burden of the coronavirus crisis, German finance minister Olaf Scholz said on Sunday, reiterating that jointly issued debt by euro zone members was not the right way to counter the impact of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“The proposal that we are now discussing very concretely is to activate the European Stability Mechanism, which would make it possible to mobilise a lot of money”, he said.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has called for special “coronavirus bonds” to help EU states finance health spending and economic rescue programmes. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde asked euro zone finance ministers to seriously consider a one-off joint debt issue of “coronabonds.</p>
<p>But Germany and other Northern countries such as the Netherlands have rebuffed the idea of issuing eurobonds.</p>
<p>“We are — in addition to securing funds from the European budget and the European Investment Bank — working on making sure that the (individual) countries are able to cope with the difficult tasks and the additional loans they take out”, Scholz said, adding that a separate project will be needed to animate the European economy once the crisis has been overcome.</p>
<p>“Solidarity must mean that we cling together financially”, he said.</p>
<p>Separately, he said that German employees will be able to receive a tax break on bonuses of up to 1500 euros, to reward hard-working people especially in the healthcare and retail sectors.</p>
<p>“In the future, it will be crucial that better wages are paid (in these sectors)”, he said. According to a report in weekly Bild am Sonntag Scholz has called for the minimum wage in Germany to be hiked to 12 euros from 9.35 euros per hour.

It was announced that Thomas Schaefer, the Minister of Finance of the Hessen state in Germany, was found dead on the high-speed line.</p>
<p>In a joint written statement from the German Wiesbaden Prosecutor&rsquo;s Office and the Westhessen Police Department, it was stated that there was a male corpse on the high-speed train line in the city of Hochheim in the area where the rails were located.</p>
<p>In the statement, which was not immediately identified because of the scars on the body of the deceased, it was informed by the Westhessen Police Department that the body was found to belong to 54-year-old Thomas Schaefer, the Finance Minister of Hessen.</p>
<p>Hessen State Prime Minister Volker Bouffier expressed his condolences to Schaefer&rsquo;s family in a statement on social media. Married and father of two children, Schaefer has been the state minister of finance since 2010.</p>
<p>According to the German press, Schaefer was considered one of the candidates to replace State Prime Minister Bouffier.</p>
