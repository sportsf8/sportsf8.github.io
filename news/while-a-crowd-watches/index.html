<p>44A. Don’t overthink this one: “William and Mary, e.g.” are just NAMES.</p>
<p>51A. Hi, kids! Back in the day, television sets did not operate via telepathy like they do now. (Sorry, I meant to say remote controls, but you just know that somewhere, someone is working on a set where you can change the channel using brain waves.)</p>
<p>Anyway, you or a designated small child used to have to go over to the actual set to turn it on, change the channel or adjust the picture. You did this via large knobs that the product designers thoughtlessly placed on the front of the TV, taking up perfectly good space that could have been part of the screen. In fact, judging by the relative size of the screen versus the dials on early TVs, it’s entirely possible that the priority back then was less about watching programs and more about fiddling with the knobs just so you could say: “Hang on, Marge. I think I can see Perry Como!”</p>
<p>Sorry, I drifted. The answer is HOR, for adjusting the HORIzontal lines of the picture.</p>
<p>73A. Fleece is soft on its own; it doesn’t really have a “component” that makes it soft. So the clue “Soft component of fleece?” must be referring to something else. In this puzzle, it’s hinting at something soft in the word “fleece” itself. The answer is the soft CEE.</p>
<p>2D. Gertrude EDERLE was the first woman to swim the English Channel and to receive a ticker-tape parade in her honor. What is ticker-tape, you ask? Ticker-tape was the output of one of the first devices for transmitting financial news and stock prices via telegraph. Once the contents of the tape had been read, it was customary to fling it out the window, onto the heads of passing sports honorees or war heroes. We just don’t have traditions like that anymore.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Man, did this one ever take me down. Congratulations to the constructor, Tracy Bennett. You win. And it’s only Thursday.</p>
<p>Maybe I just wasn’t on the same wavelength with her today, because this is a great puzzle. It’s clean and filled with a lot of exciting entries, AS NEAT notwithstanding. The theme is excellent. And yet it gave me more trouble than the average Saturday puzzle.</p>
<p>At first I thought it might contain a rebus element, because that is often the culprit when I am struggling to make progress in a crossword. It’s not a rebus puzzle.</p>
<p>There was a lot of general knowledge in Ms. Bennett’s puzzle, and the clues seemed a bit tougher than usual, but in general I think I just wasn’t braining well today. These things happen.

<h3 id="shifting-sounds">&ldquo;Shifting Sounds&rdquo;</h3>

123A: Give doctors any and every award, but a documentary can get an OSCAR.</p>
<p>63D: My knowledge of crime families and international law degree terminology is paltry, so I had no idea what to put as the fourth letter of this entry. Because of its proximity to an affectionate description I use for my partner, HIMBO, I got a laugh at the notion of “carbo” here. Call me Creta Carbo, I want to be alone with my quarantine waffles. This clue actually refers to CARLO Gambino, who the Mob Museum refers to as “the face of organized crime in New York City,” but who I still can’t picture. LLB, at 75A, stands for “Legum Baccalaureus” or Bachelor of Laws; the double “L” is how Latin plurals are abbreviated, like “pp.” for pages.</p>
<p>Today’s Theme</p>
<p>Today’s theme consists of eight entries, at 23-, 29-, 58-, 76-, 107- and 117-Across, and 3- and 79-Down. Depending on the trajectory of your solve, the puzzle’s title — “Shifting Sounds” — might have been a giveaway, or it might have been a misdirect! Let me elucidate by explaining the first clue that I solved, at 3-Down, because that was the way the cookie crumbled for me.</p>
<p>It’s really because THEIR and AA MILNE were quick lit fill-ins for me, which led me to notice and get wrapped up in the interesting three-step dance of SHIPMEN, AHOY and KINSHIP. I jumped on “Bad shot by Dracula?” and answered it correctly — COUNTMISS — but for the wrong reason. I figured that “Shifting Sounds” was just an indication of homonyms (“Sounds”) that change position (“Shifting”) so COUNT MISS was the theme-ization of MISCOUNT, which isn’t the cleanest way to say “Bad shot” but it was good enough for me for a minute. I needed to fully solve another example for things to snap together correctly. At 23-Across, “Dog’s order at a malt shop?” looked like “hound” something right away (I wanted something that would transform to “newshound” by moving its parts around, if you catch my drift). I didn’t know what to do with HOUNDSHAKE — hound’s hake? Voilà: HOUND SHAKE is handshake, transformed; COUNT MISS is can’t miss. In other (spoken) words, you’re shifting “sands” to “sounds;” anywhere in the theme entries that you want to say “wa” say “wou” instead (you want phthongs? Read the constructor notes).</p>
<p>Even if you can wrap your head (or the mouth in your head) around the “shift” you need to make, none of the rest of the theme entries solve themselves. There’s a great mix of cultural references: Chess and the “magic kingdom,” to name a couple. My favorite was at 29-Across, where the clue referenced a show I knew absolutely nothing about but the entry is a beloved icon from “The Simpsons,” trying to stride the Scottish highlands — NED FLOUNDERS. Here’s evidence that “The Simpsons” touches every touchstone, including this puzzle, as there’s a clear reference to another theme entry.

<h3 id="how-binge-watching-has-become-a-cultural-touchstone-in-the-season-of-the-virus">&ldquo;How binge watching has become a cultural touchstone in the season of the virus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://naples.floridaweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2020-05-28/1p1.jpg" alt="img">
During the first months of the pandemic lockdown, for someone lucky enough to have a great job and comfortable East Fort Myers studio, whose main obligation to society seemed to be to simply exist, life could sometimes feel like an endless snow day during high school in Kansas. Buffeted yet protected by the chaos outside, the noise on everything was turned down because social and commercial pressures that normally existed had suddenly dissipated, and something spinning inside me came to rest.</p>
<p>I started reading every morning, fiddling around again on a guitar, taking long walks with no phone. And I spent long stretches of six, seven hours or more watching — “streaming,” “binge watching” — movies I had wanted to see like “The Long Goodbye” and “Double Indemnity” and “The Andromeda Strain,” and returning to ones that once brought me joy like “Top Gun” and “Field of Dreams” and anything with Gene Hackman. One endless Sunday afternoon after watching Kevin Costner build a baseball diamond in an Iowa cornfield, I took in a double feature, “Escape from New York” and “Escape from LA.”</p>
<p>I was alone but not alone, at least in this regard: people were in, streaming was up, and the idea of “binge watching” (however you wanted to define it) was peaking as the way of the moment to consume “content,” that strange, corporate word for often beautifully realized works of art; though it serves well overall as a way to describe the ocean of crap that is streaming media, hundreds of shows and endless hours of video emptying into it every season, disappearing into an abyss.</p>
<p>The word “binge” was first used in the mid-1800s and meant “to soak,” says the Macmillan Dictionary blog. It was used to refer to eating and drinking in excess near the time of World War I. The phrase “binge watching” appeared in 2003, but not in common conversation until 2012.</p>
<p>As consumers turned to streaming platforms for TV, binge watching began. When the coronavirus caused us to stay home, it exploded. Streaming platforms hustled to add content — and resurrected past movies and shows that quickly jumped in popularity — at a time when Hollywood was shut down. Subscribers received emails and text messages hawking what’s new — and what viewers should watch now. The platforms, after all, know what you’re watching.</p>
<p>Everyone, it seems, has binged at least a show or two.</p>
<p>“One … it was on Netflix … it was ‘Good Girls,’” said Matthew Oliver, 44, owner of Oliver’s Barber Shop in Naples. “And then I’ve been watching ‘War of the Worlds’ on Epix. And then what else was it? I binge-watched ‘Snowfall,’ that was on FX.”</p>
<p>One of the early binged-watched streaming shows, “House of Cards,” debuted in 2013. That same year, the classic “Breaking Bad” reached its finale.</p>
<p>“The first time I binged was ‘Breaking Bad’ when I visited my parents in Buffalo, N.Y., a few summers ago,” said Jennifer Huber, a travel blogger known as Solo Travel Girl and public relations manager for Punta Gorda/Englewood Beach Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau. “It got to be 1 a.m. and although I was tired, I remember telling (my dad), ‘Just one more!’ It ended up being three more until I fell asleep.”</p>
<p>Since 2012, internet streaming has surged along with the number of new shows. The fastest growing platform for new shows is on streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon and on the Disney+ and Apple TV+ platforms, and the number of streamers will only increase with NBCUniversal’s Peacock and WarnerMedia-backed HBO Max, the Hollywood Reporter says.</p>
<p>FX says there were 530 new scripted shows distributed in 2019 alone, up 7 percent from the year before.</p>
<p>But it was not until the virus that binge watching really boomed.</p>
<p>Esquire magazine posted suggestions for people “looking for a new suspenseful binge.” “Binge-watch” debuted in The New York Times Crossword puzzle on Feb. 28 with the clue “See the seasons pass quickly?” Stephanie Davis, a Fort Myers writer and actor, recently posted on Facebook, “Just binged ‘Hollywood’ — 7 episodes in 48 hours — so good!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Netflix reported 15 million new subscribers in the first quarter of 2020 (through March).</p>
<p>Binge watching began to be something people referenced more often online, even if they didn’t understand exactly what it means.</p>
<p>“What if we binged on six straight hours of people searching fields with metal detectors on YouTube?” asked Southwest Florida attorney Mary Elizabeth Fletcher. “Because I did that. On a Saturday. Three weeks ago.”</p>
<p>Well, Mary, that counts. For the record, Macmillan defines binge watching simply as “the activity of watching TV for an extended period, e.g., several episodes of a series.” But the dictionary is only a starting point; the real meaning of words evolves in conversation.</p>
<p>The writer and cultural commentator Glenn Miller posted, “I don’t think I ever binge-watched anything before the pandemic. I’m not even sure of the definition of binge watching. But hunkered down in The Hovel, my book-cluttered Fort Myers condo, I now have free HBO access. I’ve binge-watched ‘John Adams’ and ‘The Plot Against America’ and ‘Band of Brothers’ and ‘Catherine the Great.’ I’m currently bingeing on and enjoying ‘The Newsroom.’”</p>
<p>Other old favorites were coming back for rounds of bingeing as well, from old movies to beloved sitcoms, as people looked to comfort viewing.</p>
<p>“People are obsessed with ‘The Office,’” noted West Palm Beach resident Kate Eagleton, 23, who works as a social media manager with Venue Marketing Group.</p>
<p>“Tiger King” and “Ozark” are her recent binges, a habit she is paradoxically disciplined about.</p>
<p>“I feel like to me binge watching isn’t necessarily watching a ton of episodes in a row but more like getting really invested in a show,” said Ms. Eagleton. “Like the only show I’ve watched for the past month, maybe month and a half, has been ‘Ozark.’ Only one episode a day or maybe two because that’s all I have time for.”</p>
<p>She and her co-workers have also been discussing “Tiger King” on a regular basis. She described the show as “such a hot mess you can’t put it down. It’s got everything: love, action, drama, murder, mystery. And obviously an amazing big cast of tigers and lions.”</p>
<p>It’s a relief for her also, watching these shows that don’t whisper a word about the coronavirus when the rest of the world is saturated with news about it.</p>
<p>“It’s weird, too, like watching a show where they’re not social distancing, they’re not wearing masks, they’re giving each other hugs — obviously because it’s not reality,” she said. “It’s crazy to think we’re going to look back at this and be like ‘remember when it was like this?’”</p>
<p>Her current favorite show, “Ozark,” happens to be the number one most-watched show for the first time during quarantine, among a survey of Reelgood users. The show offers viewers both escapism and a metaphor for our times, a satisfying combo and one possible explanation for its popularity.</p>
<p>“For the longest time I thought ‘Ozark’ was about a serial killer in the woods but that’s not what it’s about at all,” Ms. Eagleton said. “It’s really interesting. This family from Chicago they got involved with the Mexican cartel and they have to run away to the Ozarks and hide. And how this family reacts to the new normal and all the craziness of it; honestly, it’s pretty similar to some of the craziness that’s going on right now with us. There’s a lot of chaos in their world in ‘Ozark.’”</p>
<p>Her close involvement with this lengthy narrative might for some recall a literary experience. And isn’t the ideal way to experience a great novel to do so in a binge, becoming fully immersed in its dream world in ways you never could if you only picked it up once or twice a week?</p>
<p>In giving a work your full and undivided attention in this way, you’ve given its creator the best chance at winning you over with the tale.</p>
<p>“I always aim for a reading in one sitting,” said the author Joan Didion in the Paris Review in 2006 when asked about how she envisions readers experiencing her nonfiction masterpiece “The Year of Magical Thinking.”</p>
<p>“Binge watching reminds me of when the last Harry Potter book was released,” Ms. Huber a.k.a. Solo Travel Girl said. “I was 30-something years old, at a bookstore at midnight, standing in line with a friend for books. We both stayed up all night reading it.”</p>
<p>Once in Nantucket at a local library there was a binge reading, so to speak, of “Moby-Dick,” recalls Mark P. Famiglio, the 65-year-old president and chairman of the Sarasota Film Festival and a noted industrialist.</p>
<p>The book was passed from reader to reader until its very end, the purpose being that one could experience it whole.</p>
<p>Could binge watching ultimately be the ideal way to consume the great shows of the television era, when epic story-lines like those in “The Sopranos” developed the superior aesthetics of shows like “True Detective,” offering a combination that previously only feature films could offer? Is bingeing good for art?</p>
<p>“It almost is more interactive when you binge,” Mr. Famiglio said, “because your mind kind of flattens out the curve, puts things into perspective more quickly (and) gets immersed in the fantasy.”</p>
<p>But in comparison to movies and TV, a literary experience is more active. You must decipher the words so that the story streams in your mind. Movies are more passive. Just sit back and mainline those images and sounds.</p>
<p>After getting hooked on a great show, it’s easy to ride that train all night. I did that with “House of Cards” and again late last year with “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.” It did not feel like the time I lost myself inside the novel “Moby-Dick,” one of the most immersive experiences of my life. It felt more like a drug experience, a night of doing cocaine.</p>
<p>After watching all night I still needed more, some satisfactory conclusion or revelation, but there were no episodes left and the next season wasn’t yet available. The sun was coming up behind the blinds and a full work day loomed. I never returned to it.</p>
<p>“I would stay awake all through the night binge watching,” Mr. Famiglio told me, about the drama “24.” He’s also a big fan of the show “Billions” and his guilty pleasure is “Gossip Girl.” In the future, he sees virtual reality becoming a popular way to stream shows.</p>
<p>“It seems like (binge watching) has taken on a whole new meaning with this lockdown,” he said. “It’s funny because it’s like forced binge watching instead of guilty-pleasure binge watching.”</p>
<p>More and more these days, his bingeing has centered around on television news, which for many of us has become its own kind of entertainment, a gripping saga based on a true story, one that’s playing out in real time before our eyes. It’s such a hot mess we can’t put it down. It’s a three-ring circus. And it’s got everything: love, resilience, drama, mystery, death and so much more.</p>
<p>“For me I think I’ve crossed the entertainment boundaries,” Mr. Famiglio said, “with the different genres of new shows out there and political meanings of various networks. I binge between, going back and forth between, the news networks.”</p>
<p>That sounded stressful to me.</p>
<p>“It is stressful but it’s interesting,” Mr. Famiglio said. “As you get into it you start to understand it more as a circus on both sides, on all three or four sides — there’s probably even more than that.”</p>
<p>Said Eric Raddatz, director of the Fort Myers Film Festival and Florida Weekly presentation editor: “Where our consumption of books had always been on our time frame, television and movies for many years has controlled when and where we plant in front of a screen on someone else’s terms. With streaming and video on demand, that has all changed. Now we watch much like we once read books — whenever the hell we want and for however the hell long we want. Some stay more disciplined than others as to the duration and frequency, I’m sure, but it is liberating when it comes to getting other, more important things done in our lives.”</p>
<p>Sleep</p>
<p>Based on a poll taken late last year, 88% of Americans admitted they’d lost sleep due to binge watching, said the chief of the sleep police, Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, otherwise known as the medical director of Sleep Medicine for Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers and a board member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p>
<p>Binge watching has become a major concern for sleep specialists because sleep is a pillar of health along with exercise and nutrition, she said.</p>
<p>“Sleep is so very important,” she said. “If you don’t sleep well it affects so many aspects of your life. Your mood, fatigue. Your brain doesn’t function well, you have trouble learning and remembering, you gain weight. I just find that you really have to prioritize your sleep.”</p>
<p>Typically she and her husband limit themselves to two episodes at a time of any given show.</p>
<p>“I need something light and entertaining in this day of Covid-19,” she said. “There’s just too much out there that’s heavy and so finding shows that are distracting and light are helpful. It’s interesting — a lot of my patients are telling me they are re-watching shows that once gave them joy. So there’s a certain generation that’s watching ‘Seinfeld’ and ‘Friends.’ Other generations are watching westerns and John Wayne movies.” ¦</p>
<p>In the KNOW</p>
<p>Binge tips and sleeping</p>
<p>Dr. Fariha Abbasi-Feinberg, medical director of Sleep Medicine for Millennium Physician Group in Fort Myers and a board member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, offers recommendations about binge watching and sleep.</p>
<p>» It’s easy to lose track of time while mindlessly watching show after show. Instead, practice “mindful” viewing, such as watching only at certain times and only one or two episodes. “Schedule your binge watching appropriately and take some time in between episodes and going to bed and then do something calming and head to bed and really avoid using the iPad, phones, laptops very close to your eyes close to bedtime. I think those are really important issues.”</p>
<p>» There may be positive health effects of mindful watching, too. “If you choose things that help you cope or help you pass time or cheer you up in some way, maybe it’s not as bad as we think of, usually.”</p>
<p>» Turn off electronics an hour or 90 minutes before bed and don’t watch anything too stimulating or too depressing just before sleep.</p>
<p>» Save the bedroom for sleep, not binge watching. “I’m a big fan of telling people honestly they should not be binge watching or working in your bedroom.”</p>
<p>» Stay away especially from devices like iPads or computers before bed. “That direct light exposure you get straight into your eyes is a lot more harmful to your sleep and it often can delay your sleep pattern because of the blue light that’s emitted from a lot of these devices.”
