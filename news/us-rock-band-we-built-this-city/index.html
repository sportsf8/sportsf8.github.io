<p>Graduates are entering adulthood in profoundly difficult times. Do they know how lucky they are?</p>
<p>By The Herald Editorial Board</p>
<p>High school graduates of the Class of 2020,</p>
<p>You must be asking yourself about now: “What did we do to deserve this mess?” And “What’s the latest news on the murder hornets?”</p>
<p>The answers: Nothing. And; a dead one was found last week in Custer, which is along I-5, a few miles south of the U.S.-Canada border, which should dissuade the 19-year-olds amongst you from making the trip to British Columbia once the border and the Vancouver bars open.</p>
<p>This isn’t what anyone wished for you.</p>
<p>While previous graduates have heard the strains of Elgar’s “Pomp and Circumstance” while accepting their diplomas, handshakes from school board members and applause from fellow graduates and family, you’re getting various levels of pomp under unforeseen circumstances, that being the precautions taken during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Graduates of Edmonds School District were treated to a virtual graduation ceremony on Friday. Families for Marysville School District grads threw a city-wide parade of vehicles that passed by all four high schools in late May. Everett School District, because the county has now advanced to Phase 2 of the state’s Safe Start plan, has planned a drive-in commencement for this Saturday at the parking lot next to Memorial Stadium. Graduates and their families — one family per car — are invited to attend, and graduates will be allowed to get out of their cars — wearing a mask — as their names are called and walk the stage to pick up diplomas, before getting back in their car and then leaving. Immediately.</p>
<p>The cap toss has been replaced by the ceremonial removal of the face mask.</p>
<p>But one thing you won’t be denied is the unsolicited advice of adults, some of whom are responsible to varying degrees for the state of the world into which you now embark.</p>
<p>As we said: What did you do to deserve this?</p>
<p>Kidding aside — a least for a few paragraphs — your generation, including the recent classes before and after you, are being asked to enter adulthood during a difficult time. Other generations before you have faced formidable challenges and uncertain futures; others, while they share today’s circumstances with you, had an easier time establishing themselves in careers and community. (The worst the author’s generation had to face during the 1980s was the slide of a once-decent rock band, Jefferson Airplane to Jefferson Starship to Starship and “We Built This City.”)</p>
<p>You already know all the following, but we’ll recount it here to remind those older than 25 who might be wistfully thinking about how swell it would be to be a high school graduate again.</p>
<p>Along with the aforementioned pandemic, which threatens a resurgence even as a vaccine is still months away at best:</p>
<p>Those who are planning to attend college are likely to experience a learning environment that’s much like the one they’ve muddled through during the last few months of high school; with an emphasis on distance: distance learning, social distancing and commons and dining halls that are closed or at reduced capacity. For some time yet, college life won’t be anything like what your parents remembered; what they do remember of college life.</p>
<p>The first piece of advice: Choose your dorm mate well; you’ll be seeing a lot of that person.</p>
<p>Those who are entering the job market now or four or more years from now can’t count on an unemployment rate that was at historic lows just a few months ago. While the latest national figures showed improvement, the national jobless rate was around 16 percent for May. Snohomish County’s unemployment rate for April — at 20.2 percent — was the highest in the state.</p>
<p>Second piece of advice: Go to school; get a degree or a training certificate to give yourself the best shot at getting a job. Your high school diploma isn’t your ticket to the good life; it’s a transfer pass. If Snohomish County doesn’t have a lot of job openings right now, what it does have is quality community colleges with scads of programs in high-demand career fields.</p>
<p>Voters are facing perhaps the most consequential election in decades, as they choose not only who will occupy the White House for the next four years, but also control of Congress.</p>
<p>Third piece of advice: Register to vote; then vote. And not just in the presidential election on Nov. 3. Certainly, that’s where all the attention is right now, and that’s as it should be. Determining who’s in control of the White House and Congress as of January 2021 while determine the nation’s direction and success on numerous issues, at least some of which we’re certain you believe are important because many of you have been marching in the streets about them, including climate change, racial inequality, the rights of women, the role and practices of law enforcement in our communities, immigration and freedom of speech, among others.</p>
<p>But after this November, keep voting, particularly in local elections for city, county and legislative races. It’s the public offices at that level that most directly affect our daily lives. If it’s change you want to see in your community, it is those offices for state lawmakers, mayors, council members, school board members and others that can make those changes.</p>
<p>There’s so much more knowledge we could impart to you: Change your oil regularly; it’s a lot cheaper in the long run. No matter how tight your finances, stay away from pay-day loans; they’re a trap. When things open up again enjoy some live music. Subscribe to newspapers, even if it’s just a digital subscription; you’ll need that information. Learn how to roast a chicken; it’s pretty easy and it’ll impress your date. Call your parents, at least once a week (they told us to include that one).</p>
<p>One final bit of advice: Don’t envy those older than you because they might have had it easier than you will. Some did; some didn’t. But everyone has stuff they have to deal with. And the fewer the struggles in one’s life, the fewer the opportunities for growth and strength.</p>
<p>Oh, and keep an eye out for the murder hornets.

<h3 id="the-50-best-albums-of-2020-so-far">&ldquo;The 50 Best Albums Of 2020 So Far&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2020/05/best-albums-2020-so-far-1590508601-1347x1000.jpg" alt="img">
You’ve seen the memes. It’s only been five months and 2020 has already been a historical shitshow of a year. Thousands and thousands died while the rest of us slowly lost our minds in lockdown. And then, just as things finally seemed to be returning to some shattered semblance of normalcy, cities all over the world erupted in justified anger over the murder of black citizens at the hands of police. Remember early January when all we had to worry about was little stuff, like impeaching our president and nuclear war with Iran? Those were the days.</p>
<p>It might be corny, but it’s true: Times like these are when we need music more than ever, whether to escape our feelings or to feel them as much as possible. But the music industry hasn’t been spared the pandemic either. The future of live music is very much up in the air right now. Livestreams, drive-in concerts, fan pods, N95 festival vape suits — is that what we have to look forward to for the rest of the year? At this point, no one even knows.</p>
<p>What we do know is that this terrible year has given us plenty of great music. We’ve gotten soothing albums and seething albums. We’ve already gotten a few quarantine albums, transmissions from artists trying to make sense of the world from within their own little fortresses of solitude. We’re almost certainly going to get a whole lot more of these in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>As always, your humble Stereogum staff has listened and argued, proselytized and compromised, and come up with a list of our 50 favorite albums released between 1/1 and 6/30 of this year. These are the albums that moved us. Maybe they’ll move you too. And maybe, just maybe, when we do this again in six months, the world will look a little less dark. Let’s listen to these albums and work to make that happen. –Peter Helman</p>
<p>50 Frail Hands – parted/departed/apart (Twelve Gauge) Ten songs in 20 minutes, each one a minefield that explodes into violence at the slightest spark: This is how a screamo band throttles you thoroughly yet leaves you craving more. Nova Scotia’s Frail Hands have mastered the art of the cataclysmic shit fit. They know how to wield dynamics without actually pausing to be quiet that often. Their recent parted/departed/apart is all visceral force and unhinged rage — the sound of winding up so tightly that your tension becomes a weapon to be deployed like a flamethrower. –Chris DeVille HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>49 Kehlani – It Was Good Until It Wasn’t (Atlantic) Trap&amp;B sounds good on Kehlani. Pivoting from SweetSexySavage’s neon ’90s revivalism, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t leans into shadowy, low-slung grooves and minor-key chord progressions. It’s an album with a strong sonic identity and a narrative point of view to match, Oakland’s reigning R&amp;B MVP processing the fallout from a romance gone sour in fluttering, conversational flourishes. She sounds incredible whether coyly flirting atop Masego’s jazzy trumpet riffs, boldly encouraging life change alongside Jhené Aiko, or grieving love lost in tandem with James Blake. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>48 Yaeji – WHAT WE DREW 우리가 그려왔던 (XL) “We sit in a circle and look at each other and reminisce how we got to meet each other,” Kathy Lee chants on “Money Can’t Buy,” a hypnotic cut from her first full-length project as Yaeji. On WHAT WE DREW 우리가 그려왔던, Yaeji invites us to a party with all her friends — mostly a collection of fellow New York City oddballs — and we’re along for the ride. It’s both for us and not. Yaeji’s music is insular and slow; it takes a few listens to really lock in to what she’s doing. But once you get settled in her groove, her mumblings blossom into sturdy hooks, and her songs become comforting celebrations of friendship and creation. –James Rettig HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>47 Lil Uzi Vert – Eternal Atake (Atlantic) After a prolonged cold war with his own record label, Lil Uzi Vert swung back into the spotlight channeling the free-associative glee of peak Lil Wayne, over some cartoonishly twisted trap beats, on a spaced-out wavelength all his own. As its deluxe companion album demonstrates, Eternal Atake could have taken a lot of lesser forms, bogged down by the usual parade of guest stars. Instead, hip-hop’s devilish rockstar delivered a singular emotional and aesthetic expression, rapping his ass off for an hour and tacking a nasally Backstreet Boys tribute on the end for good measure. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>46 Chubby And The Gang – Speed Kills (Static Shock) Charlie Manning-Walker, lead barker of London face-stompers Chubby And The Gang, comes from the exploding world of UK hardcore, and he’s done time with moshpit revivalists like Violent Reaction and Arms Race. But now Manning-Walker has reinvented himself as Chubby Charles, and he’s put together a band that draws on a rich historical strain of British working-class rock: glam, pub-rock, street-punk. Chubby And The Gang, in other words, make a supremely British version of bar-rock, turning knucklehead soccer-hooligan chants into poetry. And even when they’re bashing out power-pop hooks, or playing rinky-dink organs, or offering a sincere acoustic tribute to the people who died in the Grenfell Tower fire, the Gang bring the urgency of the best hardcore. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>45 Amnesia Scanner – Tearless (PAN) The album artwork for Amnesia Scanner’s Tearless looks like something gone horribly wrong. That’s what the world feels like right now, too. The electronic duo formerly and anagrammatically known as Renaissance Man have called the LP “a breakup album with the planet,” but it’s less an elegy for the past than an expressionistic embrace of the chaos, channeling dance music and metal and noise into a potent new strain of mutant-pop. As they say in the closing track: “You will be fine, if we can help you lose your mind.” –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>44 Ashley McBryde – Never Will (Warner Music Nashville) Two years ago, Ashley McBryde was Nashville’s new avatar of authenticity. She’d been putting indie albums out since 2006, but McBryde made her big splash with 2018’s Girl Going Nowhere, a powerful piece of tough blue-collar country music. With her follow-up, though, McBryde shows us just how much she can do: blazing Southern-rock rippers, tenderly gospel-inflected ballads, a weirdly charming album closer about the history of styrofoam. She writes tremendous hooks and delivers them in a honeyed seen-it-all drawl. But she’s also a restless, fiery talent and a true explorer. She’s too real to be a simple symbol of realness. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>43 Moodymann – Taken Away (KDJ) Last year, Highland Park police dragged the Detroit deep-house legend Moodymann from his van, which was parked outside his apartment building, and arrested him at gunpoint; someone had apparently called the police to report someone acting suspicious. Moodymann’s album Taken Away, recorded in part as an attempt to process that trauma, is about as downbeat and introspective as Detroit house gets. Taken Away is full of syncopated thumps and bluesy murmurs and echoes of sirens. If you don’t know the story behind it, it’s still a warm and gorgeous party record. But released into the world four days before George Floyd’s murder, it takes on a whole new dimension. –Tom HEAR IT: Bandcamp</p>
<p>42 Destroyer – Have We Met (Merge) Have We Met caps off an arc begun almost a decade ago, when Dan Bejar released his landmark album Kaputt and entered the most accessible, acclaimed, yet no less eccentric chapter of his career. Informed by the claustrophobic atmosphere of our times, Have We Met is cerebral and absurd even by Bejar’s standards. Bizarre scenes and non-sequiturs abound. Bejar often sounds like a man slowly unraveling over greyscale, icy synth backdrops. But in the epic swell of “Crimson Tide,” the new wave pulse of “It Doesn’t Just Happen,” or the sneakily catchy refrains of “The Man In Black’s Blues,” Bejar crafted apocalypse music that’s every bit as transporting as it is discomfiting. –Ryan Leas HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>41 I Break Horses – Warnings (Bella Union) Six long years have passed since I Break Horses’ sophomore album Chiaroscuro. The world has changed, and so has Maria Lindén’s life. Across Warnings, Lindén grapples with crumbling relationships and nearly losing friends; she sifts through wreckages and specters. The dense dreamscapes of I Break Horses are a fitting backdrop. Whether in the shimmering “I’ll Be The Death Of You” and “Neon Lights” or the empathetic catharses of “Baby You Have Travelled For Miles Without Love In Your Eyes” and “Death Engine,” Lindén returned from a long, searching passage in life with the most realized, gorgeous, and ultimately reinvigorating work of her career. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>40 Code Orange – Underneath (Roadrunner) Pittsburgh’s Code Orange have been making frantic, math-damaged hardcore for more than a decade, since they were literal children operating under the name Code Orange Kids. With each album, they’ve been getting bigger and heavier, to the point where they’ve now been playing metal festivals in stadiums and collaborating with Slipknot’s Corey Taylor. On Underneath, they’ve embraced the challenge of making grand, cathartic big-tent rock music without losing their punishing harshness. They’ve succeeded. Underneath has soaring choruses, jittery IDM drill-beats, scuzzed-out nu-metal groove-attacks, and riffs hard enough to clothesline the skin right off of your skull. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>39 Peel Dream Magazine – Agitprop Alterna (Slumberland) From the first guttural guitar haze of “Pill,” you think you know what you’re getting. There have been lots of bands with that one perfect song capturing the bygone heyday of dream-pop and shoegaze. But across Peel Dream Magazine’s sophomore outing, the hits keep coming and the reference points keep collapsing in on each other. “Emotional Devotion Creator,” “Do It,” “Too Dumb” — each song finds Peel Dream exploring different iterations of psychedelic music and blurring the boundaries between them. The hooks, history, and philosophy all become detritus swirling together into a kaleidoscopic reinterpretation you can’t look away from. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>38 Jay Electronica – A Written Testimony (Roc Nation) Jay Electronica actually, finally released a full-length debut, and then that debut turned out to really be an unofficial album-length collab with Jay-Z. The whole thing still sounds implausible, like a hazily recalled dream you had 10 years ago. Fittingly, A Written Testimony is itself a fuzzy mirage of sorts, a series of gravel-voiced meditations over airy, impressionistic production. Nothing could really live up to the feverish hype that once surrounded Jay Electronica and A Written Testimony doesn’t even try. But it’s all the better for it — an idiosyncratic, psychedelic drift released right at the beginning of an era when we all spent a whole lot of time inside rifling through our own minds. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>37 Nation Of Language – Introduction, Prescence (Self-released) How’s this for some truth in advertising: Introduction, Presence is a hell of an introduction with presence to spare. Nation Of Language mine the sounds of ’80s synth-pop and new wave to work through decidedly current feelings of listlessness and discontent, frontman Ian Devaney’s deep, rich baritone splitting the difference between your favorite post-punkers and the National’s chief brooder Matt Berninger. Every interlocking keyboard squiggle, every drum machine rhythm, every bass groove — they all come together perfectly in a mercilessly efficient hook delivery system that sounds like an old classic and feels like a new one. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>36 Frances Quinlan – Likewise (Saddle Creek) Frances Quinlan is one of our finest songwriters, and Likewise, her first solo album after almost a decade in Hop Along, is a showcase for her many talents. Her songs are impressionistic fragments — they feel unmoored in time, like “Went To LA,” or they settle for indeterminate endings, like “Your Reply” and “Rare Thing.” Her arrangements on Likewise are light and weightless, but Quinlan brings a gravity and emotional acuity to everything that she does. It’s an album that ponders big questions but doesn’t get tripped up on the answers; it savors the unknowing. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>35 Envy – The Fallen Crimson (Temporary Residence) Imagine you’re climbing a mountain in a raging windstorm to fight a dragon. You look down and see the whole world — miles of earth stretching out before you, lives reduced to tiny ant-like specks. That’s the scale that Envy are working on, and that’s what listening to The Fallen Crimson feels like. The Japanese band are the OG kings of matching sweepingly grand post-rock peaks and valleys with heavy shoegaze beauty and hardcore’s howling intensity, combining it all into a tidal wave of pure emotion. Let it wash you away. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>34 Tame Impala – The Slow Rush (Interscope) How does a psychedelic loner turned lover reckon with time’s relentless forward march? By plunging backward into an analog dance party where everything glows like a disco ball reflecting off puffy-haired monsters of rock. Kevin Parker built his legend crafting vivid alternate histories of classic rock and big-tent dance music. If 2015’s Currents blurred together the sounds of the modern festival scene, The Slow Rush sounds darker, more interior, more retro — a hallucinogenic swirl bridging the gap between Studio 54 and the Midwest arenas of the same era. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>33 Sam Hunt – Southside (MCA Nashville) With his 2014 debut album Montevallo, Sam Hunt conquered the bro-country mountain. A heart-wreckingly handsome ex-college quarterback who broke the code on subtly integrating Drake-wave rap internalism into bright, gleaming mainstream country, Hunt seemed poised to dominate for the foreseeable future. Instead, he disappeared. He married the high-school ex he’d sung about so often on Montevallo, quit drinking, and spent years tinkering with his sound. Then he reemerged with Southside, a slippery and gorgeous piece of music. Southside transforms bluegrass samples into trap beats, casually flirts with clever abandon, and makes its personal epiphanies register as full-throated arena pop. Six-year break or no, Hunt might still fuck around and dominate. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>32 Grimes – Miss Anthropocene (4AD) Forget Elon Musk. Forget the baby name jokes. Honestly, you can even forget the convoluted narrative about climate change personified as a goddess or whatever. Let all of the extraneous bullshit fall away and just listen to the dang music. Yes, Grimes is a lot, but that’s part of what makes her songs special. On Miss Anthropocene, she takes the deeply uncool influence of edgy, nihilistic nu-metal, fuses it with pop and electronic dance music, and uses it to capture the paranoid, freaked-out headspace of live-tweeting your own panic attack at 4AM. Whatever you might think of Grimes’ public persona, the music speaks for itself. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>31 Boldy James – The Price Of Tea In China (ALC) The husky-voiced Detroit rapper Boldy James writes like a great crime novelist, laying out the stresses and dangers of living out life on the wrong side of the law. When he talks about bloodstained concrete and bricks chipped from bullet ricochets, you can practically see the scene he’s describing. On The Price Of Tea In China, he teams up with producer the Alchemist, an old comrade who instinctively knows how to surround James’ deadpan darkness with shivery, ominous boom-bap. Together, they’ve made a tense, coiled, artful meditation on hard realities. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>30 Car Seat Headrest – Making A Door Less Open (Matador) On Making A Door Less Open’s opening track, Will Toledo attests, “I believe that thoughts can change your body.” What follows is the result of much hard thinking about how to alter the substance of Car Seat Headrest. Often Toledo and his bandmates do so by building an electronic exoskeleton into the hearty alternative rock that made them indie-famous, lending a different sort of oomph to all the howling choruses and clever, sardonic observations. The sum total of their efforts is a thrilling left turn from a deeply consistent yet wildly unpredictable band. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>29 Empty Country – Empty Country (Get Better) With Cymbals Eat Guitars, Joseph D’Agostino trafficked in indie-minded iterations of classic rock, from epic Built To Spill freakouts to neon Springsteen worship. So it only follows that his new project would plow headfirst into the great wide open. D’Agostino’s debut album as Empty Country plays like a drive through the heartland, except instead of coast to coast it takes you to the 1980s and back. Along the way it connects the dots between “Pink Houses,” Red House Painters, and the houses on all those memorable emo album covers. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>28 Braids – Shadow Offering (Secret City) On Braids’ fourth album, Shadow Offering, the Montreal art-pop trio is at its cleanest and most refined. They teamed up with producer Chris Walla, who teases out the rockier side of their tunes, turning the group’s taut synth reveries into glistening and forceful songs that tackle topics like abuse and desire and self-hatred. Raphaelle Standell-Preston’s voice is dizzying; she presents her fears not as a persistent dull ache but as something that is going to rip her apart from the inside out. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>27 Andy Shauf – The Neon Skyline (Anti-) All singer-songwriters are storytellers of a sort, but neither term does justice to what Andy Shauf accomplishes on The Neon Skyline. Each of its 11 tracks are chapters from the same narrative, vignettes that cohere into something like a novel or an indie film. The arc is simple: guy runs into his ex at the bar, flashes back on falling in and out of love, awkwardly flirts for a while, and heads home. But Shauf ties those scenes together with emotional insight and an artful touch, soundtracked by luscious retro pop-rock arrangements that make the story feel timeless despite its meticulous sense of place. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>26 Freddie Gibbs &amp; The Alchemist – Alfredo (ESGN / ALC / EMPIRE) After two albums with Madlib, Freddie Gibbs — once a bone-hard street-rap prospect — has embraced his inner nerd, understanding that he’s at his best when rapping over misty, dissolving stoner-rap instrumentals. For Alfredo, Gibbs teams up with the Alchemist, who, just like Madlib, is a master of the form. The result is a solid 35 minutes of laid-back zone-out psychedelia and breathtakingly twisty and intricate tough-talk. Gibbs radiates charisma even when he’s flexing his absolute mastery, and guest stars like Rick Ross and Tyler, The Creator bring their A-game, happy just for the opportunity to rap with a master. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>25 Against All Logic – 2017-2019 (Other People) Nicolas Jaar has been good to us this year. He released a new solo album, Cenizas, and there’s a promise of more albums on the horizon. He kicked off the year with a new album from Against All Logic, his side project that approaches the dancefloor reverentially and with an ecstatic glee. The songs on 2017-2019 are constantly clanging and anxious and spilling forward. “If You Can’t Do It Good, Do It Hard,” Jaar’s latest collaboration with Lydia Lunch, has turned into an enduring mantra for 2020, a reminder to keep on moving even when it feels hopeless. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>24 Moses Sumney – græ (Jagjaguwar) Moses Sumney had so much to say that he had to split it in half. grae, his ambitious double album, was parceled out in two separate parts over a few months — taken as a whole, it’s simply overwhelming. It’s overflowing with ideas and dense arrangements, and Sumney is able to move between disparate sounds through the sheer will of his voice alone. “Virile,” the album’s stunning lead single and towering achievement, is a grandly operatic song about masculinity and vulnerability that uses both as a shield, armor that holds together opposing forces with iron-clad bonds and suggests that maybe they’re not so opposing after all. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>23 Westerman – Your Hero Is Not Dead (Partisan) It almost seems tongue-in-cheek: Whipping up a bit of internet fervor with the immaculate single “Confirmation,” refining the aesthetic over a handful more, then finally delivering an anticipated full-length debut called… Your Hero Is Not Dead. And then Westerman manages to balance ruminations over abstract moral and existential concerns with music that is strikingly beautiful throughout. Aided by Bullion’s crystalline electronic textures, Westerman uses his transfixing voice and serpentine guitar to perfect his singular sound, reaching for the horizon in “Waiting On Design” or conjuring yet another sublime, glimmering vision of a pop song in “Blue Comanche.” Your hero is indeed far from dead — he’s just now assuming the mantle. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>22 Bob Dylan – Rough And Rowdy Ways (Columbia) Just when it looked like Bob Dylan was settling into a semi-retirement of regular touring punctuated by strangely reverent standards collections, he comes careening back into the spotlight like SOY BOMB with his best album in a decade, if not two. Bracketed by deeply referential mirage-like epics “I Contain Multitudes” and “Murder Most Foul,” Rough And Rowdy Ways fills out its run time with a career-spanning assortment of sounds, from stately ballads to stomping roadhouse blues. He also proclaims, “Key West is the place to be if you’re looking for immortality” — and if anyone could speak authoritatively on that subject, it’s Bob. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>21 Arca – KicK i (XL) Arca spent three years not releasing anything, but she has been hard at work. KicK i is meant to be the start of a quartet of releases — this one is the “pop” version of what’s been clanging around her head these last few years, and it’s certainly the most accessible material she’s ever put out. It’s crisp and concise; her music remains beguilingly odd, but KicK i is compulsively relistenable. She recruited Björk, Rosalía, and SOPHIE for the effort, joining in a lineage of forward-thinking auteurs. These are pop songs from other dimensions, a plugged-in radio dial of gooey decay. KicK i feels like her breakout moment, a well-deserved coronation. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>20 Sada Baby – Skuba Sada 2 (Asylum) Detroit rap annihilator Sada Baby spent the first few months of 2020 on an absolute rampage. Every day, it seemed like there was a new Sada Baby video up on YouTube. There he was, again and again, in all his loud and ferocious glory, his gigantic beard immediately standing out in every mob scene. For a long time, those frantically funky songs were YouTube-only. Skuba Sada 2 — incredibly, Sada’s second full-length of the year — collected many of those songs, transforming them into a feverish rap marathon that never lets up. These tracks were only weeks old when it came out, but Skuba Sada 2 already played like a readymade greatest-hits collection for an internet cult hero. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>19 Laura Marling – Song For Our Daughter (Partisan / Chrysalis) When Laura Marling moved Song For Our Daughter up from August, it became a semi-surprise release meant to, hopefully, provide an anchor for people in confusing, traumatizing times. Not that this album is purely comforting, being a series of missives to an unborn child warning of how this warped world would challenge her. Despite coming from turmoil, Marling’s songs — the lilting sigh “Held Down,” the catchy “Alexandra” and “Strange Girl,” the raw and sparse “For You” — are able to harness beauty hidden within the ugliness surrounding us. In the end, it was the exact kind of salve we needed, just when we needed it. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>18 Higher Power – 27 Miles Underwater (Roadrunner) The Leeds band Higher Power come from the world of breakdown-heavy mosh-music hardcore. But they also have sticky, soaring choruses and big arena-rock riffs and a singer, Jimmy Wizard, who sounds like what might’ve happened if circa-1990 Perry Farrell got really into lifting weights. For their second album and big-label debut, Higher Power teamed up with Pixies/Foo Fighters producer Gil Norton to make their chunky hardcore sound like mid-’90s alt-rock radio-bait. This probably should be the cheesiest thing in the world, and maybe it is. But it also rules. If regular rock bands aren’t going to do anthemic reaching-for-infinity stompers anymore, maybe it makes sense for hardcore bands to start. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>17 Caribou – Suddenly (Merge) Call it EIDM: emotionally intelligent dance music. Over the course of his career, Caribou’s Dan Snaith has been steadily moving towards more personal singer-songwriter territory without losing his crate-digging experimentalist spirit. And on Suddenly, he fully sheds his academic persona to shoot straight for the heart, externalizing life’s sudden tragedies and joys into deeply felt, deeply melodic electronic music more suited to soul-searching than floor-filling. Anchored by his own nakedly human voice, he’s crafted an album of swerves and left turns for navigating a world full of them. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>16 Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever – Sideways To New Italy (Sub Pop) Following their 2018 debut Hope Downs, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever saw the world. But they also learned about dislocation, depletion — the endless blur of life on the road, and the way home can blur upon returning, too. Instead of writing about that feeling, they drew on different places, from southern Italy to the tropical reaches of their native Australia, to make an album that sounds like it has sunlight running through its veins. From the dazzling guitar interplay of “Cars In Space” to the sparkling dream of “The Only One” to the gigantic chorus of “Cameo,” RBCF corralled impressions from their new lives, and took their sound to even more vivid heights. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>15 Thundercat – It Is What It Is (Brainfeeder) What is It Is What It Is? Such an idiosyncratic vision is better experienced than blurbed, but how about: a funky jazz-fusion space odyssey informed by grief, romantic dejection, and existential dread, but also cartoons, video games, and old Kanye interview rants. Breezy despite its density, Thundercat’s fourth album is as fun as it is deep. There’s room in there for AM gold about durags, a Ty Dolla $ign/Lil B pairing, and a frenetic rhythmic onslaught bridging the gap between bop, thrash, and drum ‘n’ bass. Our man may be covered in cat hair, but he still smells good. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>14 Jeff Rosenstock – NO DREAM (Polyvinyl / Quote Unquote) “They were separating families carelessly under the guise of protecting you and me,” Jeff Rosenstock wails. The Long Island-bred Rosenstock is a master of strident uncertainty, and his version of pop-punk has a way of articulating what it’s like to try to live life in no-hope capitalist dystopia. Most of NO DREAM is about stumbling along, being in love, dealing with guilt. But all of Rosenstock’s electro-shock hooks and searching lyrics work against a backdrop of intolerable widespread injustice, and he never loses sight of that. When NO DREAM dropped without warning, it worked as a forceful reassurance. Even if none of us know how to process this shit, we are not alone. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>13 Porridge Radio – Every Bad (Secretly Canadian) By the end of the first song on Every Bad, singer Dana Margolin’s voice breaks into a ragged elemental wail as she repeats two lines over and over again: “Thank you for leaving me/ Thank you for making me happy.” That’s how Porridge Radio operate — setting the relentless mantras of a spiraling mind to simmering indie rock with a tendency to flare up into climactic squalls of cathartic noise at just the right moment. It’s an exorcism of big, bruised feelings purged into big, bruised songs. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>12 Dua Lipa – Future Nostalgia (Warner) Turns out future nostalgia sounds a whole lot like regular nostalgia. After the success of her breakout hit “New Rules” and its tropical house pulse, Dua Lipa began burrowing further and further back into pop music history, moving from ’90s diva-house to ’80s Giorgio Moroder-inspired disco. And on Future Nostalgia, she collects four decades of club music, of accumulated knowledge of ways to make people move, into an album of immaculate dancefloor bangers. Just wait till dancefloors are a thing again. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>11 Jason Isbell &amp; The 400 Unit – Reunions (Southeastern) “This used to be a ghost town/ But even the ghosts got out.” That’s Jason Isbell on the churning “Overseas,” a couple songs into Reunions, the new album he described as having a whole lot of ghosts in it. They come in many forms: an old friend who’s no longer here in “Only Children,” a now long-sober Isbell reflecting on his troubled past in “It Gets Easier.” The stories have a brutal economy to them, able to crush you instantly with glimpses of not just the ghost town and those who escaped, but those who didn’t. On Reunions, Isbell tries to reconcile all that past with who he is today, and in the process reminds us that who he is today is one of the most masterful songwriters of our time. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>10 Ka – Descendants Of Cain (Iron Works) “If he ain’t from the maelstrom, I never felt him,” says Ka. Ka is from the maelstrom — ’80s Brooklyn. For years, Ka has been making muttery and mystical rap music, working full-time as a Brooklyn fire chief and releasing albums when the spirit moves him. On those albums, Ka chants wise incantations over sparse, meditative music that he usually produces himself. With Descendents Of Cain, he digs deep into Biblical imagery to properly describe the trauma that comes with growing up in a violent place, in a violent time. The music flickers and throbs like a deep-space quasar, stripping New York boom-bap to ominous atmosphere, while Ka ponders the questions of the universe. You feel him. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music 9 Yves Tumor – Heaven To A Tortured Mind (Warp) The way Yves Tumor renders heaven sounds more like hell. Heaven For A Tortured Mind certainly feels tortured enough when the cocky rock bravado gives way to stark vulnerability. “Gospel For A New Century,” the opening track on the experimental pop artist’s latest album, is one heck of an introduction to this new era of Yves Tumor: all over the place in the best possible way, with blown-out guitars and guttural noises and a catchy, insistent beat. Yves Tumor runs through decades of glamorous macho energy on Heaven To A Tortured Mind to come up with a pantheon all his own. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>8 Charli XCX – how i’m feeling now (Atlantic) It was just a crazy enough idea to work. The hyper-productive Charli XCX forced herself to concentrate on one task during quarantine: Make an album. And make one she did. How I’m Feeling Now is spontaneous and effervescent, a time capsule that feels like it will endure. Its itchy, bombastic tracks are a way for Charli to bounce off the walls of her own mind and feel fulfilled while doing so. The album contains some of Charli’s most vulnerable songs ever, her chaotic take on pop music spilling over into something that can help bring us all together while we’re all apart. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>7 Sorry – 925 (Domino) Sorry are hard to figure out. The London group’s beguiling songs unfold with a curious dream-world logic, saxophone blurts and keyboard tinkles piercing through the all-encompassing haze of seductively moody indie rock. Even when they’re detailing the hedonistic excesses of the rockstar lifestyle, the core duo of Asha Lorenz and Louis O’Bryen sings with a winking ironic detachment, their drawling, disinterested voices circling playfully and finishing each other’s sentences. It’s hard to know just what to make of them, but it’s even harder not to fall under their spell. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>6 Soccer Mommy – color theory (Loma Vista) All of color theory’s shades are gloomy: blue for depression, yellow for illness, gray for loss. But the album is also the boldest and brightest that Soccer Mommy has ever sounded, refracting the homespun indie rock of Sophie Allison’s 2018 debut Clean through the nostalgic ’90s and ’00s pop anthems of her youth and emerging with a polished new sound. This music, just like Allison herself, lives in the darkness without ever fully succumbing to it. –Peter HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>5 The 1975 – Notes On A Conditional Form (Dirty Hit / Interscope) Notes On A Conditional Form is like getting five albums in one. That’s not a quip about its staggering runtime; it’s just the nature of the album, an unruly restlessness suggesting the more contained, logical roads-not-taken. If this indeed marks the conclusion of one era of the 1975, it’s a high note to end on, though not a very triumphant one. Truthfully, it’s not even exactly indulgent. The bleary scope is part of story: Wrangling with relationships, and technology, and self-reflexivity, and everything else, Notes is one more sprawling, scattered attempt — not just to showcase the 1975’s malleability, but to filter crowded backlogs of ideas and sounds and melodies into a portrait of the anxious millennial mind. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>4 Run The Jewels – RTJ4 (BMG) El-P and Killer Mike took their time with the fourth installment in the Run The Jewels saga — and, as usual, the album seemed to arrive exactly when it was supposed to. There’s all the same shit talk and underdog charm and humor that fueled RTJ’s early ascension, but their hearts (and crowns) are heavier now. Even in the space of one song, like opener and lead single “Yankee And The Brave,” a partially light-hearted action movie setup is tinged with the real-life horror movie scenery of the America RTJ4 arrived into — which, of course, was really the America these two have been grappling with for years. That’ll always define how we first heard RTJ4: released amidst a week of nationwide (and then worldwide) protests, songs like “Walking In The Snow” and “JU$T” sounding equal parts righteous, fiery, and reflective. –Ryan HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>3 Perfume Genius – Set My Heart On Fire Immediately (Matador) Mike Hadreas, like Angel Olsen, is one of the few singers and songwriters gifted and ambitious and history-minded enough to take ancient forms of rock ‘n’ roll melodrama and turn them into personal koans. On his latest, he starts by lamenting that half of his whole life is finished over an organ-sustain dirge that turns into a music-box prom waltz. From there, Hadreas soars over baroque psychedelia and euphoric drones. Producer Blake Mills and old session-musician geniuses like Pino Palladino and Jim Keltner create soft, luxuriant noise-lullabies, and Hadreas uses them as interdimensional portals to take us inside his soul. In dreams, he walks with us. In dreams, he talks with us. In dreams, we’re his all of the time. –Tom HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>
<p>2 Waxahatchee – Saint Cloud (Merge) Katie Crutchfield always sounded wise beyond her years, even when she was a teenager fronting P.S. Eliot. Now that she’s entering her thirties, sobered up and madly in love, her music as Waxahatchee brims with perspective and grace. Saint Cloud is the work of a songwriter confident enough to let the listener approach at their leisure, patient and unflashy but rich with rewards for those who lean in close and soak it all in. Listening through is refreshing, like taking a peaceful stroll by a riverside and having your brain unscrambled. –Chris HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music | Bandcamp</p>
<p>1 Fiona Apple – Fetch The Bolt Cutters (Epic) Listening to Fetch The Bolt Cutters is like meeting up with an old friend you haven’t seen in a while. They invite you over to their house, and maybe it’s a little awkward and cramped — there’s clothes folded up on the couch and you’re sinking into the cushions. Fiona Apple has been through a lot and she wants to tell you about it. You have to listen. Fetch The Bolt Cutters is an invitation to an interior world. It’s a homey album, which makes sense given that it was made entirely at home. Banging pots and pans, barking dogs, and the hum of casual existence are all instruments in Apple’s hands. She uses the textures of everyday life to construct sing-songy hymns that sound like macaroni art. The songs play in opposition to themselves: they’re cacophonous and quiet, familiar and disorienting, feral and soothing. Fetch The Bolt Cutters is meant to completely overtake you, and it does. It’s a monumental achievement that feels so simple and complicated at the same time — the mark of a true classic. –James HEAR IT: Spotify | Apple Music</p>

<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2020/05/80s.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
During the &rsquo;80s, much of the best rock music being made came from the U.S., and we&rsquo;re honoring the best of it with our look at the Top 20 &rsquo;80s American Classic Rock Bands.</p>
<p>The ‘80s proved to be a time of massive rock domination, with hair metal, glam rock and new wave opening doors for new artists, while also providing further inspiration for previously established acts. Technology also played a major role in shaping rock, as the experimentation with electronic keyboards that first bore fruit in the &rsquo;70s expanded when digital synthesizers, programmable drum machines and sequencers became commonplace, and guitar-based acts looked to incorporate them into their sound.</p>
<p>Whittling our list down to just 20 bands was difficult, especially given the abundance of worthy nominees. For the purposes of this exercise, groups were graded only on the work they delivered between 1980 and 1989. We look at how they worked through the unique artistic and commercial challenges that the &rsquo;80s presented to them.</p>
<p>Solo artists were excluded, meaning Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Nicks, Billy Joel and many other vaunted stars are absent from our list, as were bands with multi-national lineups, like Fleetwood Mac and Foreigner (although an exception was made to one group due to an American being the sole constant member). In the end, we came up with an impressive collection of bands from throughout the era. Naturally, many of the big names made the cut, including Guns n’ Roses, Van Halen, Bon Jovi and Motley Crue. Read on to see exactly where they landed in our list of the Top &rsquo;80s American Classic Rock Bands.

<p><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-196006/social" alt="img">
Released in January 1967 on the Youngbloods’ first album, “Get Together” became a flower-power anthem in San Francisco during the city’s Summer of Love. Nationally, the single sputtered, reaching only No. 62 on Billboard’s pop chart.</p>
<p>Two years later, when San Francisco’s hippie movement became mainstream, the single was re-issued and hit No. 5.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/S8wICsdRfzunLFrYL5nw/convert?cache=true&amp;crop=0%2C57%2C2923%2C1461&amp;crop_first=true&amp;h=300&amp;w=450" alt="img">
In 2005, three teenagers gave themselves the name 21 Demands and started playing music, eventually going on to top the Irish Singles Chart with their debut single, &lsquo;Give Me A Minute&rsquo;, making it the first independently-released track to do so. Five years later, in the midst of trading their aimless rock beginnings for a sound with more heart, they welcomed a bassist, Jason Boland, and effectively sealed their incarnation into Kodaline.</p>
<p>Vulnerability feels safe with this band, who has built a loyal fanbase on the blueprint of emotional authenticity. Earlier this year, they released &lsquo;Saving Grace&rsquo;, a powerful anthem of hope and solidarity that is especially fitting for a time when the world is currently battling the throes of the pandemic. The single comes ahead of a new album, One Day At A Time, which is set to be released on 12 June.</p>
<p>Below, vocalist Steve Garrigan shares about the band&rsquo;s upcoming album, and reflects on the band&rsquo;s journey so far, from falling back in love with old songs to his best memories of their Asia tour last year.</p>
<p>Hi Steve, how are you doing? What have you and the rest of the band been up to while in quarantine?</p>
<p>We haven’t seen each other in person in 2 months and that’s never happened before, I think ever. We’re working on music and doing a lot of livestreaming. I work from here, and we do it all online individually. That’s been a lot of fun, and our fans have liked it. We’re working on new music, keeping busy, trying to stay healthy and positive.</p>
<p>What have you been listening to? What films have you watched?</p>
<p>I watched so many movies. Mainly true story movies, like The Way Back. It’s about an athlete and his basketball coach. It’s quite heavy, it’s a tearjerker. Music, I’ve just been listening to anything and everything. Lots of new music on Spotify&rsquo;s New Music Friday. Old music too, like Bruce Springsteen. Mainly I’ve just been spending my time working on new music here. There’s an endless list of movies.</p>
<p>Have you been baking? Seems like everyone’s doing that lately.</p>
<p>A lot of my friends have baked bread for the first time. I haven’t tried it yet because I’m kinda scared that I might just destroy the kitchen! My baking skills aren’t great, but I suppose you’re right, it’s a good time to try and learn to bake. It’s a good skill to have.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has taken a huge toll on many people’s mental health. How do you cope with the uncertainty of the situation?</p>
<p>I try to keep to a routine as best as I can each day. I try to work out as well, stay healthy, and eat as well as I can. Meditation is great as well. I try to do that each day. I don’t do it every day but if I feel a bit overwhelmed or stressed out with the situation, I find that it really helps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a really weird time, but at the end of the day, everybody’s in the same boat. And everybody probably has good days and bad days because it’s such a strange situation. The world’s at a standstill right now. I also think that using Zoom to talk to friends and family is a really great thing to do, and that kinda helps me as well.</p>
<p>What advice would you give to someone who finds themselves struggling in such times?</p>
<p>If you can, reach out to somebody like family or friends. And if you can’t, there are a lot of things online to help. There are a lot of resources out there to help you calm down and make you see the bigger picture. It’s temporary and things will get better as well. So it’s important to know that. If you’re struggling to stay positive, just know that there are lots of resources out there to help you, but if you can, reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p>The band has been doing livestreams every Friday, with your fans joining in on some songs to form a virtual choir. What’s it like connecting with your fans this way as opposed to real-life interaction at concerts?</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t really know how it was gonna turn out. We missed playing live so much, and at our live shows we encourage people who come to watch us to sing along as much as they want. We missed that, so we were trying to figure out a way to kinda do it, but not really, because it’s not the same as a live show. We came up with the idea of asking our fans to sing along to our songs on livestream. You don’t have to be able to sing, but it worked out really well.</p>
<p>It ended up being a couple of hundred people singing together, and it sounded amazing. When you put everyone in a big group, there’s just this massive sound. It turned out to be a bit of an emotional performance as well. The people who were involved were so happy, so it was a great thing to do and we’re planning to do more of that. We do livestreams every Friday so we’re thinking of ideas to get people involved.</p>
<p>I had no idea it was gonna work out the way it did, it could have been terrible. But it worked out well, so we’re gonna do it again.</p>
<p>What are your plans for future livestreams?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got guest musicians. We did this one last week—there’s this group called Voices of Service. We found out about them because they were on America’s Got Talent where they sang a song of ours called ‘Brother’, and they’re ex-military. They started this singing group together to help ex-soldiers with PTSD and it’s quite incredible. Their story is amazing.</p>
<p>We never thought we would have the opportunity to meet them or play with them but we reached out to them and asked if they wanted to sing ‘Brother’. It was amazing, their singing was so good, and I was so intimidated that I just kinda decided to not sing.</p>
<p>So we have plans to get some of our musician friends and our fans again in our livestreams. It’s great that we can do that. It’s the power of streaming online, and it’s exciting stuff, we do have lots of ideas.</p>
<p>Speaking of concerts, what are some of the most memorable moments from your time in Asia last year?</p>
<p>It was our first full Asia tour ever. We never had the chance to tour Asia so we didn&rsquo;t know what to expect. But when we got there, there were fans waiting for us, singing all our songs back to us. It turned out to be the best tour we ever had, and we still talk about it to this day.</p>
<p>We were making plans for another Asia tour as well, but obviously because of the coronavirus that’s kind of postponed for now. We can’t wait to go back, I think every show on that tour was pretty much a highlight for us. It was our first time in Bangkok and it blew our minds. The crowd there was so big and they were singing along to every single song. When you go to a city for the first time, you never really know if there&rsquo;s gonna be a big crowd or not. The Bangkok tour was sold out in every place and it was amazing. Even just talking about it now, I genuinely can&rsquo;t wait to get back and play again. Hopefully sooner than later.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about your new music. Your music video for ‘Saving Grace’ is a compilation of footage from fans staying at home. How did it feel watching thousands of videos of people going through their day from all different parts of the world, knowing that they are all connected by your music?</p>
<p>It was an idea that we just came up with. I know a lot of musicians are doing it now as well. We had a different idea for a video and we couldn&rsquo;t do that, so we sent out the song to fans from all over the world and got them to send us a video of them doing something.</p>
<p>I think 500 fans ended up in the video, as far as I’m aware. It caught me off guard. I didn’t know how it was gonna turn out but the results actually just made me cry like a baby. I was sitting on the couch with my girlfriend and I got really excited. More or less, straight away, I just started crying, but it was good tears.</p>
<p>Looking at it it shows you that the whole situation we’re in now is global. Everyone&rsquo;s doing the same thing: staying inside, and keeping their distance. It’s a very powerful video, and I’m glad that we did it, and the song really suits the video as well. It’s about being strong and staying together and being there for each other. The fans have said that they really like it. I hope that more people see it, and more people like it, and that it makes them smile.</p>
<p>There are lots of moments captured in the video that really amplify the beauty of ordinary things. What are some ordinary things you are grateful for right now?</p>
<p>My dog, he’s right here. Good food, friends. family. Just hanging out. So many. Music. Pajamas!</p>
<p>I took a look through the tracklist of your upcoming album, One Day At A Time. The whole thing feels like a story from the song titles and the way the tracks have been arranged. Can you walk me through what this story might be?</p>
<p>Each song is its own story, if you tie it all together. Yeah, it’s a really good question. To be honest when we went into making this album we didn’t think of making an overall story, we kinda treated each song individually. But if there’s one thing to tie all our songs together, it’s the message of overcoming and staying strong and staying positive. I think that runs through a lot of our old songs as well.</p>
<p>There’s a song about a friend of ours who passed away years ago and we’re just remembering him. It’s called ‘Evening’. The last track in the end is about moving on, and forgiving yourself and others. There’s a song called ‘Spend It With You’ that I’m really excited about. It&rsquo;s a fictional story we made up, which we don&rsquo;t usually do because we try to take songs from our personal lives. But this is just a fake story: if the world was ending, what would you do? The answer is - I’d spend it with you. So it’s like a love story at the end of the world but it’s a classic song as well, with the melody and all. It feels like an old 1950s song for some reason.</p>
<p>Overall the album is just kind of about relationships but not just relationships with your partner, it’s about relationships with everybody, your family, your friends. There’s a song called ‘Care’ which is about having massive arguments with your best mate, but it’ll be fine and that you’ll work it out.</p>
<p>Each song tells its own story. All the songs are about the relationships you have, life, and staying strong.</p>
<p>What would you say was the hardest song to write?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Saving Grace’, probably. That was a chorus I had for ages, and for whatever reason I couldn’t finish it. I took it to the guys and we ended up writing 10 different verses, and there were different arrangements for it. We tried a lot of different things and it took a long time to finish. When we eventually finished it, we looked at each other like this is really powerful. This is great. There were a few times we thought it was done but i didn&rsquo;t think it was finished. Everybody was divided so that took a long time. It’s a weird journey for a song to be finished.</p>
<p>You recorded everything in Dublin this time. You mentioned in an interview that you used to not like Dublin, until you started touring and eventually circled around back to your hometown. Do you experience that with some of your songs too?</p>
<p>Yeah, I suppose when you play a song live in front of a crowd, it completely changes it, depending on the crowd and how they’re reacting - are they singing along? Are they bored?</p>
<p>We did a song with Kygo a couple years ago. I liked the sound and I don’t know if the guys liked it, but we did our own version of it and the more we played it live, the more we loved it, so we made a Kodaline version of it.</p>
<p>On these livestreams, we’re playing a lot of old songs - some of them we’ve never played live because we thought they&rsquo;d never go down well. It’s been a lot of fun, I&rsquo;m falling in love with a lot of the old songs we have. There are certain songs that we did on our EP - they were released, but as b-sides and a lot of people have never heard of them. But some big fans are asking for these songs, and even playing them myself, I&rsquo;m learning to love them and it&rsquo;s really cool. There&rsquo;s a song called ‘Take Control’ that we&rsquo;ve never played live. We did that on our livestream last week.</p>
<p>But then again if we’re playing the same songs every night, it can be like, I dont wanna play these songs. So you know, you can learn to love songs but you can also learn to - not hate - but not like songs because you&rsquo;ve played them so much. When we play live, we play all the time, and every single show is different. Sometimes a certain song is amazing, but sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t work. It depends on the show and the crowd. I&rsquo;m constantly falling in and out of love with a lot of our songs.</p>
<p>In that case, would you consider playing some of these old songs you mentioned the next time you perform live?</p>
<p>Absolutely. I&rsquo;d say this whole experience for us is going to build a new live show, where we incorporate different songs and even songs that we never would have thought of putting in.</p>
<p>We used to do this cover of Sam Cooke’s song - he’s this incredible soul singer, he&rsquo;s known as one of the greatest voices ever. We used to play live and do acapella. We did that last week and I forgot how much I loved playing that song. I can&rsquo;t remember when we stopped playing it. We’re doing songs we haven&rsquo;t done in a long time, and even songs we&rsquo;ve never played before. Hopefully sooner rather than later, we get to play a live show and play these songs we&rsquo;ve never played before. It&rsquo;s really exciting for all of us.</p>
<p>Aside from performing live, what are you looking forward to once lockdown measures are lifted?</p>
<p>Seeing my mum and dad, my family, my friends. Giving my friends a hug. Going outside more. That’s the main thing. Family, friends, going outside, and a pint at the local pool would be amazing. They&rsquo;re all closed. The cinema as well would be amazing. Hanging out with everyone properly.</p>
<p>Do you have a specific cause you&rsquo;d want to promote? Tell us why you believe in this organization and how we can help.</p>
<p>As a band, we have quite a few. Off the top of my head, I was an ambassador for an Irish charity called Walk in My Shoes. It promotes mental health, and they have lots of resources online for anxiety and depression. It&rsquo;s a great charity and website for anybody who&rsquo;s going through a tough time. It&rsquo;s close to my heart. We also tried to raise money for the frontline workers in Ireland, Vinny&rsquo;s very passionate about that.</p>
<p>For Walk in My Shoes, you can donate through their website. It&rsquo;s a great cause and I&rsquo;ve suffered from depression and anxiety in the past, so I understand the power of what they&rsquo;re offering people. I would appreciate it if you could check that out, and if you can donate anything, that&rsquo;d be great. If you can&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s fine too.</p>
<p>Kodaline&rsquo;s new album, One Day At A Time, will be out on 12 June 2020.

Sima Cunningham (in black) and Macie Stewart formed Ohmme as a duo in 2014, then added drummer Matt Carroll in 2016.</p>
<p>Ash Dye</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;ve spent months at a time on the road with your band for more than two years running, bouncing between opening slots, festival appearances, and headlining sets in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and Europe. You&rsquo;ve been enthralling audiences with the frenetic yet tightly controlled energy of your immersive live show, supporting a bold and proudly unconventional debut album.</p>
<p>Now imagine that mere months from the release of your second full-length, all but guaranteed to explosively broaden your audience, you&rsquo;re sidelined—not by the standard-issue music-industry evils (a soured major-label contract, a monopolistic booker) but by a force much more powerful and even more impersonal.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the reality faced by many buzzed-about acts as COVID-19 continues to spread—Chicago art-rock band Ohmme among them.</p>
<p>Ohmme founders Sima Cunningham and Macie Stewart and their drummer, Matt Carroll, were supposed to hit the road in April opening for Waxahatchee, ahead of the June 5 release of Fantasize Your Ghost (Joyful Noise). Then they would&rsquo;ve kicked off the west-coast leg of a headlining tour with their friend V.V. Lightbody.</p>
<p>Continued efforts to flatten the curve of the pandemic mean they&rsquo;re now self-isolating separately and confined to livestreaming their performances. And like so many of us, they&rsquo;ve been trying their hand at making focaccia and turning to astrology to try to make sense of the wrenching changes in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made my first successful focaccia the other night,&rdquo; Cunningham says. &ldquo;My first one did not rise. Now, I&rsquo;ve got it down pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Fantasize Your Ghost came out last week, its release coincided with the latest Bandcamp revenue-sharing day, when the platform waives its cut of sales to help artists and labels struggling during the pandemic. Rather than celebrate their album, the band chose to stand in solidarity with another struggle—the ongoing fight for Black lives that erupted again into the streets after the police killing of George Floyd. Ohmme donated their Bandcamp proceeds to Chicago nonprofit Assata&rsquo;s Daughters, a Black liberatory activist group formed by women, femmes, and gender-nonconforming people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are asking for you to transform your support for us into support for our Chicago community and the Black Lives Matter movement,&rdquo; Ohmme explained on Instagram. &ldquo;Our record is about confronting the inevitability of change and the chaos, discomfort, beauty and growth that can produce in a soul. Let&rsquo;s all keep learning, keep going, and keep listening to Black voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the months since COVID-19 shut down the live-music ecosystem, Ohmme have played several online sets, sometimes sharing a room and sometimes remotely, including as part of Goose Island&rsquo;s 312unes series and the Dr. Martens Presents: Stay In series (the latter included Carroll live from Denmark). When Carroll can&rsquo;t participate, Cunningham and Stewart use his drum tracks or do without, as they did on May 10, when they played acoustically via Mayor Lightfoot&rsquo;s Instagram to benefit the Arts for Illinois Relief Fund. They&rsquo;re also scheduled to headline the first night of the Do Division Street Fest&rsquo;s inaugural virtual edition on Friday, June 26.</p>
<p>Do Division Virtual Street Fest night one featuring Ohmme, Fran, We Were Promised Jetpacks (solo), and Wyatt Waddell</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s bill is booked by the Empty Bottle. Fri 6/26, 5:15 PM, West Town Chamber of Commerce, westtownchamber.org, $10 suggested donation, all ages</p>
<p>The ten muscular tracks on Fantasize Your Ghost showcase the band&rsquo;s intrepid spirit and clever control over their instruments, while their lyrics explore what it means and how it feels when you&rsquo;ve become a stranger to the life you once knew. Meaningful relationships run their course and empty out; places and things you&rsquo;ve built an identity around stop feeling significant. The album&rsquo;s 40 minutes succinctly evoke the anger, clarity, pain, and joy that can come if you accept what comes next.</p>
<p>Cunningham, 30, and Stewart, 27, are nimble multi-instrumentalists and arresting singers, and they&rsquo;ve collaborated widely throughout Chicago&rsquo;s sprawling music communities, playing with artists working in rock, hip-hop, classical, folk, country, jazz, noise, and more. Between them they&rsquo;ve worked with the likes of Chance the Rapper, Tortoise, Jeff Tweedy, and Twin Peaks.</p>
<p>Ohmme&rsquo;s sound reflects their varied backgrounds and their classical training. The band might adopt the cadences and syncopation of hip-hop, take deep breaths of folk-rock simplicity, or erupt with the all-in ferocity of a freely improvised electric-guitar freak-out—and they can balance it all gracefully. Stewart and Cunningham don&rsquo;t know exactly why their partnership works so much better than all their other musical relationships, but they&rsquo;re grateful for it.</p>
<p>The band had planned for their debut full-length, 2018&rsquo;s Parts, to &ldquo;waterfall into&rdquo; Fantasize Your Ghost, as Cunningham puts it—they&rsquo;d hoped to weave its material into their sets on that canceled April tour with Waxahatchee. They see the albums as two facets of the same journey, but where the former looks outward at social norms—particularly those navigated by women, which were placed under a microscope before and after the 2016 presidential election—the latter turns its focus inward.</p>
<p>Fantasize Your Ghost also seems prescient in light of how state-mandated shelter-in-place orders and new efforts to phase in pre-COVID activity have affected our relationships to daily existence. It can seem futile to try to control our lives and what&rsquo;s happening around us, or even to wrestle with our desire to do so—and it&rsquo;s especially difficult to put off uncomfortable questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of this record deals with contending with different versions of yourself,&rdquo; says Cunningham. &ldquo;The version you are right now was the version that, at some point in the past, you chose—and you kind of followed that for a while. You can start to feel a little hollow or feel you really need to bring yourself back to life in a different way to move forward. It&rsquo;s about making those decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change is the only constant, as cheesy as it sounds,&rdquo; Stewart adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how you approach and welcome it into your life—whether you&rsquo;re up for it or fighting against it. Either one is worthwhile, but it&rsquo;s about figuring out how you want to respond while you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The video for &ldquo;Ghost,&rdquo; directed by Austin Vesely</p>
<p>Ohmme first surprised audiences with an ambitious self-titled EP in 2015 (which was reissued two years later). Their aesthetic took shape early: haunting melodies, lyrics that read like riddles, and confident disruptions of pop-songwriting and instrumental techniques. They incorporate odd meters and unusual chord combinations so fluidly that their sophisticated musical intelligence erases its own fingerprints, but at the same time they embrace &ldquo;mistakes&rdquo; and work to unlearn technically correct ways of doing things. It&rsquo;s a way of finding the freedom to explore that they absorbed from the world of free improvisation.</p>
<p>Right from its first track, &ldquo;Flood Your Gut,&rdquo; Fantasize Your Ghost is daunting. Not because it&rsquo;s ugly or confrontational, but because the distortion of pop convention creates uncertainty and suspense. The song captures a brooding tone, with an anxious guitar riff and rumbling bass, and Stewart and Cunningham deliver its angry lyrics in a deceptively sweet style: &ldquo;Have you found your stomach or your spine? / When I leave, they&rsquo;ll eat you alive,&rdquo; they coo. &ldquo;One, two, three, you&rsquo;re not your mother&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; they repeat, their honeyed vocals dissipating into murky strings. &ldquo;Your whole vision&rsquo;s not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the album unfolds, its layers of overdubbed vocals and processed guitars evoke the turmoil that boils and bubbles inside a person as they outgrow their surroundings or who they thought they needed to be. Each track has its own urgent push and pull, and Stewart often punctuates the arrangements with intricate flurries of strings that can sound clean and sweeping or knotty and tortured.</p>
<p>Fantasize Your Ghost is as much of a call to action to reclaim one&rsquo;s life (&ldquo;3 2 4 3&rdquo;) as it is a taunt, a challenge to, and an admonishment of those who lose themselves to the expectations of others. It describes opportunities for redefining your behavioral and emotional patterns (&ldquo;The Limit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spell It Out&rdquo;) as well as for sabotaging yourself by kissing strangers or falling for flattery from flawed heroes (&ldquo;Twitch&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The video for &ldquo;The Limit,&rdquo; directed by Hannah Welever</p>
<p>While Ohmme&rsquo;s lyrics generally offer more questions than answers, the album&rsquo;s closing track, &ldquo;After All,&rdquo; comes closer than most to a resolution; it also has the most familiar, traditional melody, tinged with 60s vocal-group pop. Unambiguously about having compassion for yourself, it&rsquo;s a reminder for women to stand firm and create their own spaces in a society that demands they shrink themselves. &ldquo;Lonely girl, it&rsquo;s OK / Take a breath, get away / Seek your cocoon,&rdquo; they sing, with Stewart&rsquo;s sweet, high voice floating above Cunningham&rsquo;s warm, cozily worn-in one. &ldquo;Lonely girl, you&rsquo;re enough / Take a breath, loosen up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart thinks she and Cunningham were picking up on a low-grade crisis in their corner of Chicago&rsquo;s music scene. &ldquo;In our community, everyone was working like crazy,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;Maybe not taking the time for themselves that they needed to take in order to be fully present in any given moment. I think, whether or not we realized it, we were tuned into that. We&rsquo;re definitely tuned into that on a personal level, and it makes sense our songs would come out that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart and Cunningham founded Ohmme in 2014 with the intention of pushing the boundaries of guitar music, which soon evolved into their &ldquo;unlearning&rdquo; approach. &ldquo;Guitar music encompasses such a vast variety of music from so many different cultures that the idea of boundaries begin to dissipate, and you realize that it really can be anything,&rdquo; Stewart says. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the biggest takeaway for us. There&rsquo;s no one correct way to do anything, no end-all, be-all technique for achieving something. The most important thing is to have an idea and try to use the tools you have in front of you to execute it. At the moment, that happens to be the guitar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both play guitar, with Stewart sometimes switching to bass or violin. Both sing, usually together, and treat their voices as equally important instruments with their own distinct roles. Even without a drummer, they &ldquo;fill a lot of space,&rdquo; as Stewart puts it. &ldquo;Because we&rsquo;re both able to play multiple instruments and multitask, we can do the work of a much larger band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because Ohmme have never tried to tour with more than three musicians, they&rsquo;ve been able to do so more frequently. But Stewart&rsquo;s arrangements on Fantasize Your Ghost did raise the question of traveling with a string section.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not gonna tour with a string section,&rdquo; says Cunningham, deadpan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make different arrangements. But that being said, there&rsquo;s a lot of strings on the record. We had some fun, special shows planned in Chicago and a couple other cities, and Macie&rsquo;s such a great string arranger—she was going to reach out to different local string sections. That&rsquo;s something we&rsquo;ll bring back at some point, but just not in the near future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart and Cunningham work together as a unit so seamlessly it seems instinctual. They describe their relationship as equal parts intense artistic partnership, deep friendship, and sisterhood; they share their own verbal and nonverbal language, onstage, offstage, and in the studio.</p>
<p>Carroll, 30, joined Ohmme in 2016, and because he&rsquo;s the only other person who&rsquo;s ever been a member of the group, he&rsquo;s part of the family. Cunningham says he sometimes gives his bandmates shit for bickering in rehearsal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When me and Macie get up in our heads too much, he shakes us out of it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Matt is really just a source of joy. When we brought Matt into the band, musically, it created this kind of centrifuge for us. He&rsquo;s at the center, at the middle—able to bend out with us but also really hold it together back there. He&rsquo;s always egging us on from behind the drum set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two women were acquainted before starting Ohmme: Cunningham often guested in Marrow, an indie-rock band Stewart cofounded in 2013. By then they&rsquo;d known each other for years—Stewart was an original member of Kids These Days, a genre-bending hip-hop/funk/soul/pop group cofounded in 2009 by Vic Mensa and Cunningham&rsquo;s brother, Liam Kazar. After Kids These Days split up in 2013, Stewart and Kazar formed Marrow with Carroll, their former bandmate Lane Beckstrom, and Dorian Gehring, who&rsquo;d become Ohmme&rsquo;s longtime engineer.</p>
<p>Stewart, a keenly melodic improviser, joined the explorative, high-energy jazz quintet Marker, led by veteran reedist Kevin Vandermark and including three other young Chicago musicians, in 2016. Cunningham spent 12 years in the Chicago Children&rsquo;s Choir and released her debut solo album, Time Is Never Your Friend, in 2010. She&rsquo;s been involved in several bands, and for more than a decade she&rsquo;s done event production and promotion work around the city.</p>
<p>After debuting in July 2014 at the Postock Festival, an annual DIY music celebration in rural Wisconsin that Cunningham has presented since 2008, Ohmme played their first Chicago show that September at Constellation. (They were initially called Homme—French for &ldquo;man&rdquo;—but made the change to avoid confusion with a South Korean duo of the same name.) Cunningham had started booking the long-running singer-songwriter series I Hear Voices at Constellation shortly after drummer and arts presenter Mike Reed (perhaps most famous as founding director of the Pitchfork Music Festival) opened the venue in 2013, and she and Stewart were enamored with the shows there. After a Marc Ribot concert at Constellation in May 2013, they got to talking shop, planting seeds for what would become their current approach to progressive music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of the early part of this band was coming out of the improvised-jazz world. We were both going to Constellation a lot,&rdquo; Stewart says. &ldquo;It was just really inspiring to see instruments played and music played with such intention. Being able to just improvise and go—letting sounds be what they are and exploring textures rather than feeling you have to fit them into the constraints of whatever arbitrary rules there are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart and Cunningham&rsquo;s friend Vivian McConnell, aka singer-songwriter V.V. Lightbody, opened for them at their debut show. &ldquo;They really excite me,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When I see them doing stuff with the guitar that I haven&rsquo;t seen anybody do or wouldn&rsquo;t have thought of—I&rsquo;m just blown away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three of them met when McConnell&rsquo;s old band Grandkids shared a bill with Marrow at Schubas in March 2014. They&rsquo;ve been going to each other&rsquo;s gigs ever since, and McConnell calls Ohmme her &ldquo;band besties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never, ever forget—people were losing their shit when they played &lsquo;Woman,'&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;People were screaming. It was insane. It&rsquo;s crazy, because that energy—that happens to this day when they play that song at shows. Just them as musicians really struck me—it still does. And they&rsquo;re friends of the scene: they grew up in Chicago and have just been so supportive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A 2017 Noisey piece called Ohmme &ldquo;the band at the heart of Chicago&rsquo;s music community,&rdquo; and McConnell echoes that sentiment—not only as a fellow musician but also as another woman rejuvenating and recasting a male-dominated genre. Stewart played violin arrangements for three songs on the latest V.V. Lightbody album, Make a Shrine or Burn It, and Cunningham provided vocals on the single &ldquo;Horse on Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonically, we&rsquo;re very different,&rdquo; McConnell says, &ldquo;but I also think there are certain things we do that place us in our own little nook—they&rsquo;re still songs, but take on a different shape and complexity that&rsquo;s indicated by what we do with our instruments. They&rsquo;ve helped me realize my own inconsistencies, but always in a positive way. Women, especially women musicians—singing and working with them lifts me up. They&rsquo;re very encouraging. They&rsquo;ve inspired me to do more with my instrument and vice versa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McConnell describes the X factor that sets Ohmme apart: &ldquo;Trust—and having so much confidence and trust that whatever they do is going to be good,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>That dynamic is apparent even to people working with Ohmme for the first time. Indie-rock veteran Chris Cohen (formerly of Deerhoof, the Curtains, and Cryptacize) produced Fantasize Your Ghost over five days in August 2019, and he felt it right away: &ldquo;They&rsquo;re special people,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I always feel that way about the people I work with, but they have a really special touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cohen joined Ohmme and Gehring at a makeshift studio they&rsquo;d put together in a barn in Wisconsin, on the farm where Cunningham hosts Postock. &ldquo;I just really encouraged them to play as loud as they could,&rdquo; Cohen says. Playing loud wasn&rsquo;t a problem, but the vocals needed to match that power.</p>
<p>Ohmme drew inspiration from Bulgarian women&rsquo;s choruses and Abba, particularly for the keening close harmonies of the loss-of-innocence song &ldquo;Selling Candy.&rdquo; Their goal was to just open their mouths and &ldquo;push out sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spring 2019 the band had tracked a few early demos for Fantasize Your Ghost while on the road in upstate New York. Then they went in search of a producer. Stewart has been a fan of Cohen&rsquo;s old band Deerhoof for years, and more recently Cunningham heard some of his solo albums through Twin Peaks multi-instrumentalist Colin Croom. The pair also liked Cohen&rsquo;s production on Weyes Blood&rsquo;s 2016 album Front Row Seat to Earth.</p>
<p>Ohmme squeezed in those five days of tracking between their tours and Cohen&rsquo;s. Between August 2019 and the end of the year, they mixed the album in Chicago with Dave Vettraino at Public House Sound Recordings and mastered it with Shelly Steffens at Chicago Mastering Service. The relatively brief window the band had available to record pushed them to focus their explorations. Cohen encouraged them to venture into new approaches and techniques, modify their harmonies, and more. Nothing was off limits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very intense. We did a lot of work every day,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I felt like I got where they were coming from. They&rsquo;re into improvised music, and I liked that they were adventurous. And obviously, they could sing really well together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My role was to help them get sounds,&rdquo; Cohen continues, &ldquo;to be another opinion, make suggestions for overdubs. They had the material, and they had worked it out quite a bit on their own. I don&rsquo;t try to get in there and pull everything apart. My job is just kind of setting a tone in the room—making people feel comfortable to try things while keeping them on track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The barn was weathered, with gaps in the walls that left it open to the elements—Cohen remembers birds living inside, and of course lots more outside. Their singing, the buzzing of insects, and other environmental sounds almost act as a thread through Fantasize Your Ghost. The juxtaposition of this pastoral ambience with Ohmme&rsquo;s pissed-off songs adds a layer of tension to the album.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recording in the barn, there were definitely a lot of room mikes placed around to capture the breadth and feeling of the room,&rdquo; Cunningham recalls. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s actually a silo next to the barn, so we put a mike in there and re-amped the whole session through there so we could play around with that as this enormous reverb chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cohen remembers the band having fun with the setting they&rsquo;d chosen for their sessions. &ldquo;I think everyone was excited to treat it like it was a performance and just play into this big, open space,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I usually like to record where there are less unknown factors, but it wasn&rsquo;t a problem at all. It was really cool. It turned out to be a good choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cunningham feels the same way about choosing Cohen to produce. &ldquo;Chris Cohen was definitely the right energy to bring onto this record, at a time where we were both feeling very chaotic, feeling the turmoil and wanting to translate that into the art and also find calm in it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But you kind of need tension to make music great sometimes, but you also really want to find a way to—&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to take care of yourself,&rdquo; Stewart finishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of a marathon getting to the recording session, and it was going to be a marathon right after the recording session,&rdquo; Cunningham continues. &ldquo;We knew we had this huge fall coming up. We were just trying really hard to create this special bubble of time, and Chris was a big part of that—and a big part of why I think the record carries this kind of shimmering beauty to it, in its foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macie Stewart and Sima Cunningham</p>

<p>That August week in Wisconsin fell under the Sturgeon Moon—an old name for the full moon that happens in August, because Indigenous people associated that time of year with a surge in numbers of sturgeon in the Great Lakes. The word &ldquo;sturgeon&rdquo; means &ldquo;stirrer&rdquo; in several European languages, and it describes the way the fish searches for sustenance—as well as Ohmme&rsquo;s approach to songcraft. They stir up the material that&rsquo;s settled to the bottom, the foundation, hoping to find something hidden, forgotten, or new.</p>
<p>Ohmme named the lone instrumental track on the new album &ldquo;Sturgeon Moon,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s the first and so far only track of its kind they&rsquo;ve released—a nightmarish, free-form flood of beautiful noise. &ldquo;It felt totally right to put an improvised track on this record, as a nod to our beginnings,&rdquo; Stewart says. &ldquo;A lot of the early part of this band was coming out of the improvised-jazz world. It brings up so much raw joy and satisfaction that I think you can feel in the track too. It&rsquo;s kind of chaos, but it&rsquo;s directed chaos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ohmme have had much more time than they expected this spring to prepare for the release of Fantasize Your Ghost, and for the time being, they&rsquo;re considering the possibilities of what a show should feel and sound like when they play it. With Carroll now living in Denmark with his wife and newborn son (he comes back to tour), they&rsquo;ve had to work on live arrangements of the new album&rsquo;s songs without him, isolating his drums tracks and working around those. By the time the pandemic suspended touring, they&rsquo;d played only three of its singles onstage, opting to keep a lid on the new material for maximum freshness.</p>
<p>Stewart says they&rsquo;re hoping Ohmme&rsquo;s dates with Waxahatchee, now pushed from April into September and October, don&rsquo;t have to be rescheduled a second time. For now, they&rsquo;ve put off a headlining tour to support Fantasize Your Ghost till their shows with V.V. Lightbody in January 2021, hoping the wait won&rsquo;t be even longer.</p>
<p>Whenever it happens, Ohmme are ready. Creating the new album has reinforced the strength of the bond between Stewart and Cunningham as well as the purpose of their band: as Cunningham puts it, &ldquo;exploring doors of creativity that are only opened up through our partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart believes that partnership is still growing stronger. &ldquo;We both understand each other—especially after making this record and touring so much over the last year—fundamentally better than we ever have before,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I think whatever music we make going forward, or whatever the band is going forward, is coming from an even more trusting place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The both of us are very headstrong, very &lsquo;figure out a solution for it,&rsquo; and we can both get down on ourselves if we can&rsquo;t do those things necessarily or we feel like we failed at something. Us having more compassion for ourselves and for each other will make it fruitful going forward. There&rsquo;s still so much more out there left to discover, even just between the two of us and how we create. That&rsquo;s an exciting prospect.&rdquo; v</p>

<p>Daisy Jones &amp; The Six: A Novel</p>
<p>By Taylor Jenkins Reid</p>
<p>(Ballantine Books, 9781524798642, $17) On Sale Date: 2/4/2020</p>
<p>“One hundred percent worth the buzz. I was entranced from beginning to end. Reid’s use of an interview format is perfect and ingenious for exploring the rise and fall of an imaginary 1970s rock band. It allows for an in-depth and realistic look at complicated group dynamics and varying perceptions and memories of each other during key moments and interactions.”</p>
<p>—Cori Cusker, Bright Side Bookshop, Flagstaff, AZ</p>
<p>Dominicana: A Novel</p>
<p>By Angie Cruz</p>
<p>(Flatiron Books, 9781250205940, $16.99) On Sale Date: 6/2/2020</p>
<p>“Dominicana hinges on the promise of new beginnings built on generations of sacrifice and dreams. There is a path to a better life, but no manual. Alone with a husband she doesn’t know, Ana carves a space for herself in Washington Heights, learning almost everything from scratch. An ode to women everywhere whose birthright is not only survival but joy.”</p>
<p>—Amanda Ibarra, Flyleaf Books, Chapel Hill, NC</p>
<p>This Tender Land: A Novel</p>
<p>By William Kent Krueger</p>
<p>(Atria Books, 9781476749303, $17) On Sale Date: 5/19/2020</p>
<p>“This Tender Land is a modern classic that illuminates the desperate reality of a critical time in American history. I was immediately engaged in this epic story about four orphans who embark on a life-changing odyssey in search of freedom, safety, and family during the Great Depression. This Tender Land is a perfect novel for fans of Before We Were Yours and Where the Crawdads Sing. This novel is a must-read for all book clubs.”</p>
<p>—Eve Taben, Elm Street Books, New Canaan, CT</p>
<p>Trust Exercise: A Novel</p>
<p>By Susan Choi</p>
<p>(Holt Paperbacks, 9781250231260, $15.99) On Sale Date: 5/5/2020</p>
<p>“A psychological masterclass. I can think of no better place to dissect how micro actions toward each other suggest macro feelings than a famous arts high school where emotions, power dynamics, and naivete mascarading as bravado are at their peak and ever shifting. Many have said, and I will too, that you have to read this one knowing as little as possible about what to expect. All I’ll say is that it left me with a potent emotion spurred by a slowly revealed truth, not just about the characters but about our world, and Susan Choi is a genius.”</p>
<p>—Molly Moore, BookPeople, Austin, TX</p>
<p>Family Ties</p>
<p>The Guest Book: A Novel</p>
<p>By Sarah Blake</p>
<p>(Flatiron Books, 9781250110275, $17.99) On Sale Date: 5/5/2020</p>
<p>“A cozy-chair, cup-of-tea, wrapped-in-a-blanket kind of novel, The Guest Book takes the reader through three generations. As you delve into the lives and personalities of the Milton family’s seemingly perfectly ordered and charmed world, the cracks gradually begin to show. Through the denial of the news in Nazi Germany, the taboo of speaking of one’s illness or someone’s homosexuality, or the hiding of a friend that is of a different skin color or religion, we see through the eyes of this family that history does repeat itself and lessons are hard learned. If you enjoyed The Postmistress, you will enjoy this. Lots of discussion for reading groups.”</p>
<p>—Nona Camuel, CoffeeTree Books, Morehead, KY</p>
<p>In West Mills (Indies Introduce title)</p>
<p>By De’Shawn Charles Winslow</p>
<p>(Bloomsbury Publishing, 9781635575286, $16) On Sale Date: 6/16/2020</p>
<p>“Knot is a strong and independent woman in a rural town in North Carolina. She likes her liquor, and she will always speak her mind and regret none of it. She is one of many members of the community of West Mills that we get to know over the course of 40 years in De’Shawn Charles Winslow’s beautiful and feisty book about the love of family, friends, and neighbors. Though not always perfect and with a fair share of secrets, they always try to do what they believe is best for the ones they love.”</p>
<p>—Carl Kranz, Fountain Bookstore, Richmond, VA</p>
<p>The Lager Queen of Minnesota</p>
<p>By J. Ryan Stradal</p>
<p>(Penguin Books, 9780399563065, $17) On Sale Date: 6/23/2020</p>
<p>“This is a tale of two sisters, a batch of undefeatable Midwestern women, and the modern evolution of American beer trends in the Midwest. America’s heartland looks a bit different from the perspectives of Edith, Helen, and Diana, each of whom struggles to both survive and realize her dreams in a world less than willing to give women a chance, let alone a beer. Lovely, powerful, and an excellent read!”</p>
<p>—Linda Sherman-Nurick, Cellar Door Books, Riverside, CA</p>
<p>Mostly Dead Things</p>
<p>By Kristen Arnett</p>
<p>(Tin House Books, 9781947793835, $15.95) On Sale Date: 4/21/2020</p>
<p>“Kristen Arnett’s Mostly Dead Things is a unique and charismatic story that winds its way through family matters, personal strife, and most important of all: taxidermy. Great for fans of Karen Russell’s Swamplandia!”</p>
<p>—Delany Holcomb, Bookmarks, Winston-Salem, NC</p>
<p>Who Are You, Calvin Bledsoe?: A Novel</p>
<p>By Brock Clarke</p>
<p>(Algonquin Books, 9781643750781, $15.95) On Sale Date: 6/23/2020</p>
<p>“Inspired by Graham Greene’s Travels With My Aunt, Brock Clarke’s new novel is a delightful journey (physically and emotionally) that constantly keeps us guessing at the final destination. This can be said of the narrator, Calvin Bledsoe, as well as the reader. At his mother’s funeral, Calvin meets an aunt he never knew he had, and embarks on an odyssey of self-discovery he didn’t know he needed. A thoughtful coming-of-age story wrapped in a screwball mystery caper, Who Are You, Calvin Bledsoe? may inspire questions of your own. It may inspire you to learn about John Calvin, the pellet stove, or even small animal pornography. It will most certainly make you smile.”</p>
<p>—Tony Peltier, Quail Ridge Books, Raleigh, NC</p>
<p>Young Adult</p>
<p>The Devouring Gray (Indies Introduce title)</p>
<p>By Christine Lynn Herman</p>
<p>(Little, Brown Books for Young Readers, 9781368042314, $9.99) On Sale Date: 3/3/2020</p>
<p>“The Devouring Gray has everything that makes Stranger Things and The Raven Cycle so appealing to readers: a dark and enthralling atmosphere, a creeping sense of dread, and, above all, a cast of teen characters who feel truly alive. This is the height of what YA urban fantasy can be.”</p>
<p>—Kiersten Frost, Brookline Booksmith, Brookline, MA</p>
<p>The Poet X</p>
<p>By Elizabeth Acevedo</p>
<p>(Quill Tree Books, 9780062662811, $12.99) On Sale Date: 3/6/2018</p>
<p>“This book is a great coming-of-age story for any teenage girl. A collection of poems make it a quick and thoughtful read. Xiomara is a Dominican girl living in the city, getting used to her changing body and attention from her lab partner, and wrestling with ideas of right and wrong. Her ideas of right and wrong are completely different from her highly religious mother’s. Her poems are her freedom, but how can you be free when home makes you feel trapped?”</p>
<p>—Lulu Roush, Waucoma Bookstore, Hood River, OR</p>
<p>Sorcery of Thorns</p>
<p>By Margaret Rogerson</p>
<p>(Margaret K. McElderry Books, 9781481497626, $11.99) On Sale Date: 6/30/2020</p>
<p>“Prepare yourself for a world where books live and think as we do, and whose pages hold both fantastical wonders and menacing enchantments. Elisabeth is a librarian’s apprentice, sworn to protect the mystical tomes from the world — and the world from them. When a deadly mishap throws Elisabeth to the mercy of the royal courts, she must seek help from her sworn enemy, a sorcerer. You won’t be able to pull yourself away from the magic and wit this story holds!”</p>
<p>—Kiera Thompson, the river’s end bookstore, Oswego, NY</p>
<p>There’s Something About Sweetie</p>
<p>By Sandhya Menon</p>
<p>(Simon Pulse, 9781534416796, $12.99) On Sale Date: 5/26/2020</p>
<p>“Two teenagers with something to prove—to their parents, their classmates, and themselves—find themselves drawn together in this classic rom-com with a Bollywood flavor. The chemistry, the sass, the representation were all on point. I particularly loved seeing a fat woman of color as the romantic lead!”</p>
<p>—Mackenzie Van Engelenhoven, The King’s English Bookshop, Salt Lake City, UT
