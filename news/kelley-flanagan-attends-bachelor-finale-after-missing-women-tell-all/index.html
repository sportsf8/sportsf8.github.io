Kelley Flanagan is in the (Bachelor) house!

After missing the The Bachelor: Women Tell All episode in early March, Flanagan attended the live in-studio portion of the finale on Tuesday.

Before night two of Peter Weber‚Äòs Bachelor finale began, host Chris Harrison opened the show and noted that Flanagan was in attendance. The TV then cut to Flanagan, who gave a smile to cameras.

On March 4, Flanagan was notably absent at the Women Tell All.

Though she didn‚Äôt win Weber‚Äòs heart, the lawyer, 27, became a fan-favorite contestant this season for her no-nonsense, no-drama approach to their relationship. And while we still don‚Äôt know why she didn‚Äôt attend the reunion, she (sort of) addressed the news on Twitter, retweeting former Bachelor Nick Viall‚Äòs joke during the episode that she was ‚Äúcurrently winning the Women Tell All.‚Äù

‚ÄúWish they didn‚Äôt wait till the end of the Women Tell All to show Kelley,‚Äù the fan wrote.

And she retweeted another fan who posted screenshots from her Instagram Story, which documented that she was at a Monster Truck show while the episode was airing.

‚ÄúLOLOL Kelley is at a Monster Truck show instead of watching the Women Tell All,‚Äù the fan wrote. ‚ÄúNever change, @kelleyflanagan.‚Äù

When a fan tweeted at Flanagan saying they wished she had been there, she gave a sweet response ‚Äî but didn‚Äôt divulge her reason for missing it.

‚Äú@kelleyflanagan I wish we could‚Äôve listened to you share last night,‚Äù the fan wrote. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a witty woman and I love that, you had me laughing this season a lot. I hope you know that you‚Äôre loved today! God bless you sweet woman :)‚Äù

Thank you! üòò ‚Äî Kelley Flanagan (@kelleyflanagan) March 3, 2020

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Flanagan replied with a kissy emoji.
