<p>FRIDAY PUZZLE — Delicious! This grid is like butter, baby; the cultured, French kind that’s rich enough to make you feel rich, too. This grid is also smart enough to make you feel smart. Hopefully, this grid is fun enough to make your whole weekend fun.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>I suppose this was patchy for me. It took a few turns at each corner, and my last letter was the R in REEDY, at the grid’s heart. But when every clue is this well crafted, it feels like a smooth solve. I clung to “Boo Boo” as Yogi’s ursine sidekick and refused to give up “bear” at 50D (“misery” wouldn’t fit at 59A, but AGONY and HERON set everything straight). As in every puzzle by Ms. Weintraub, there are amazing little touches. There are quite a few jokes today that feel a little “quarantine-y,” like the references to airplane travel that make me glad to be earthbound and the twinned entries at 18A and 53A.</p>
<p>40A: While sylvan forest dwellers dart about, the trees in the wood grow slowly. Sap runs in the spring, and if you’re in an evergreen area you can see RESIN run, albeit at a snail’s pace.</p>
<p>47A: FREE WIFI? The AGONY of painful Eustachian tubes at 30,000 feet? I was certainly looking for something related to air here, not water. Where else can you find a “jet”? A HOT TUB.

23A. An interesting fact that I learned from this puzzle (unrelated to the clue “Revered emblem”): The use of the phrase “low man on the TOTEM pole” to mean someone of little importance is incorrect. Among some First Nations who create them, the images carved into the lower part of the pole are actually more important than those above it. Ken Jennings, writer of “The Debunker,” wrote about his discussion with an expert about the positions on a TOTEM pole:</p>
<p>According to Canadian naturalist Pat Kramer, an expert on First Nations culture, the lowest figures on the totem pole are often considered the most prestigious. The designs on the bottom six feet of a totem pole are the ones that will be seen at eye level, after all, so they’re the figures that the carver usually decides not to farm out to apprentices. “The helpers do the high up parts and the master finishes the low end of the pole,” explains Mr. Kramer. “Higher-up figures are more representational and, if anything, slightly less important.”</p>
<p>41A. I would like to formally welcome the comedian DEMETRI Martin to the New York Times Crossword.</p>
<p>44A. Tough one. I had the F and T in the last two positions, and the answer was four letters, so I knew the answer to “President who was formerly Theodore Roosevelt’s secretary of war” had to be TAFT.</p>
<p>61A/19D. BBS are the AMMO for air guns. BBS also stands for Bulletin Board Systems. These systems were predecessors to the World Wide Web and social networks.</p>
<p>4D. Clever. A “Hula hoop?” in this puzzle is a LEI, which can be worn while performing the hula.</p>
<p>9D. Another debut! BEAT BOXERS amaze me. The singer, BEATBOXER, rapper and producer, Kevin Olusola, is incredibly gifted. As you listen to Mr. Olusola perform with his group, Pentatonix, bear in mind that he is making all of the percussion sounds solely with his mouth.

Webster says that the term bragging rights is “a good reason to talk with pride about something you have done.”</p>
<p>As a young boy onward it seemed that life on the farm was based always on competing for that defined right. It didn’t matter if it was who was the strongest to who could skip a flat stone across a space of water and causing the most skips. If you did the most you then had the right to brag if so desired. I feel safe in saying this went on from daylight until dusk.</p>
<p>I feel it was due to a farmer’s life mostly. Most all a farmer does is manual labor of some sort and of a skill most always was needed to move the job along quicker. From weeding tobacco beds to tossing bales of hay. The jobs were greatly needed but let’s face it the jobs took up a lot of hours. Hours that became boring and mundane in nature. That was unless the task was turned into a competition in some way or form. For example look at setting tobacco. You set on the transplanter with a bunch of plants to go into the ground. All the person really had to do was take a plant put it in the finger that put it into the ground then grab another plant. Over and over until the day ended or the patch was completely set. Think about it. Boring! But if a person counted how many plants went through their hands in a minute, well the one who put the most plants in the ground was the fastest. Wouldn’t the two on the setter come out even? Not if you get in too big of a hurry and missed your turn. This could and did go on all day and the best got to boast.</p>
<p>This could be for a group such as a hay crew to see how many bales of hay they could move from the field into the hay mow. When talking to other guys from other crews the numbers were matched and a winner would be declared in most cases. Sometimes convincing the other person you were faster didn’t happen and it stayed a tie. From the start of the day on we would match each other as to how much, how long, or how fast.</p>
<p>This would also spill over to a farmer and his crops or produce from their gardens. How many bushel to the acre of corn, or pounds of tobacco per acre. I have seen huge tomatoes on the front porch at a farmer’s house or a very large potato so any visitor could see the monster you had grown in your garden. It also allowed anyone who thought they could out do it to bring it on. For at least until the next growing season the top producer had earned the right to tell of his ability to outgrow all others. Not all would brag but I have seen quite a few that if someone brought up how well you had done they would just smile real big and nod their heads to confirm it.</p>
<p>But of all the contests for the bragging rights around here it was who could cut tobacco the fastest. Cutting tobacco was a talent that not all could excel at. It seemed in each neighborhood there would be one or two that could and would put the stalks of tobacco on the sticks so quickly and accurately and show little or no effort that they earned a lot of praise from all the rest.</p>
<p>I feel I have cut with some of these men in the same patch. I didn’t say I was cutting beside them. I want to name some I have witnessed but am afraid I would miss someone.</p>
<p>The story I will relay is of a man before my time and can only tell what I was told. In I think the 40’s there was a young man named Mel Ott from around Felicity that they said was the fastest. One day a retired man said I don’t believe you to be the fastest and I am betting you 50 dollars that you can’t drop your own sticks and cut 1,000 sticks of tobacco in an eight hour day. Mel said I will take your bet but I’m being paid by the stick, so no matter what the outcome I still want to be paid what I earn by the stick. The man said it’s a bet. So the next day many folks other than the other cutters and the man who bet showed up and watched Mel. He didn’t cut 1,000 sticks but instead he cut over 1,250 sticks approximately as I’ve been told. Now a thousand sticks in a day is the measuring stick for a very good cutter and what Mel did was a land mark for a new standard. I believe this to be true as the bet was carried out on my dad’s farm and he is the one who told me this. Dad wasn’t a man to bet but he loved a great contest. He said besides, he got more tobacco cut that day than he had all fall. From that time forward Mel Ott held the bragging rights if he wanted to brag but I never heard him boast. However if ask he would smile and nod his head yes.</p>
<p>For a million bragging rights and to make a day move faster and with some added interest it served their purpose then and I assume they still do. I have tried many times to win at a challenge of the best and can say sometimes I did. Also it is safe to say many times I didn’t but almost every time I enjoyed the chance to take on the challenge. When it came to lifting I could win most times. I could even lift the front end of a Volkswagen and carry it in a half circle and never lost that challenge. But remember that strength doesn’t take the need for talent or skills. Just big muscles to lift. But it helped the day pass a little easier and made it more interesting.</p>

<h3 id="crossword-roundup-gazebo-and-other-joke-words">&ldquo;Crossword roundup: &lsquo;gazebo&rsquo; and other joke words&rdquo;</h3>

If you’re new to cryptic crosswords, this is the Guardian’s place for celebrating and explaining the best recent clues from across the broadsheets</p>
<p>New to cryptic crosswords?</p>
<p>Start here, and bear in mind that cryptic clues give you, in either order, a definition of the answer (marked in bold in the examples below) and a little recipe for its letters (in the examples, the links take you to our explainers of those recipes).</p>
<p>The news in clues</p>
<p>As discussed in the last roundup, we’re expecting a different flavour of timely clues for the foreseeable. Nowadays, a clue can do you the world of good just by evoking a trip outside. Here is a not-so-tough clue from a Telegraph Toughie puzzle by Elgar (known locally as Enigmatist, with whom we have done a little Q&amp;A:</p>
<p>After you’ve written it in, you can take a few moments imagining a pleasant dip in the River SOMME once this is over. What flora might we encounter during the swim? Pan has an idea …</p>
<p>… namely, a BULRUSH. And Nutmeg (Q&amp;A) dodges wordplay altogether, instead offering a lovely pair of definitions …</p>
<p>… of SPRAY.</p>
<p>Latter patter</p>
<p>If the Guardian’s array of setters are new to you, here is a useful thing to know about Qaos:</p>
<p>I do like putting ghost themes into my puzzles (a compulsive impulse, you might say). So you can solve them ‘plain’, but if you spot the hidden theme, you might get an extra sense of enjoyment.</p>
<p>This means that some of the clues and answers will refer to the theme while others, such as, I think, this one, are just charming standalone items:</p>
<p>And the word GAZEBO is a mysterious one. We often presume, given what it means and its unusual collection of letters, that it has an Asian origin. The problem is that no one has been able to find it. The Oxford English Dictionary suggests that the word might in fact be a joke.</p>
<p>It’s not a very funny joke, but it goes like this. There are words like “lavabo” (a ritual washing of hands) which are Latin phrases for something you’re going to do (“I will wash”). And so “gazebo” would then be a jocular way of saying “I will have a good look at some things”. I did warn you that it wasn’t very funny – but it is always a treat to find a word that is, or may have been, artificially created, so to speak.</p>
<p>The next instalment of our cluing competition concerns just such a word, from the 19th century. It takes the “-tious” ending from words like “fractious” and tacks it on to a word for something annoying: reader, how would you clue BUMPTIOUS?</p>
<p>Cluing competition</p>
<p>Many thanks for your clues for PLONK. Dunnart gave us the elegant “Drop of wine” then gallantly alerted us that the same clue has in fact been published by Philistine. The audacity award goes to Combinatorialist for the ornate “It’s carelessly set down: π – 1 + 50 + ⅔ × 1000”.</p>
<p>I enjoyed all the plonkers, such as Dogrando’s “Rodney, perhaps forgoing a half of beer, gets some dodgy wine” and Encota’s “Put down tool without hesitation”.</p>
<p>The runners-up are GuyNorman, with an intriguing anagram indicator in “OK plan, but not a substitute for booze”, and DeetotheGee’s acrostic (explanation here of that device): “For starters, Poles like only North Korean wine”; the winner is the sly cryptic definition of Mahashivaratri’s “Cheap plasterer!”</p>
<p>Kludos to Mahashivaratri. Please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition, and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics, below.</p>
<p>Clue of the fortnight</p>
<p>Here’s Knut (Q&amp;A) with a clue that looks as if you need to think about classic Italian cinema. But you don’t.</p>
<p>We’d all settle for a spot of NORMAL LIFE.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Want to see something frustrating? I will understand if the answer is a resolute “No thank you, things are weird enough for me right now,” but I’m going to ask you to bear with me.</p>
<p>This is not frustrating because of anything the constructor Caitlin Reid or the puzzle editors did; it’s just an example of what can happen when a word gets stuck in the folds of one’s brain and cannot get out.</p>
<p>Take a gander at this. (Spoiler alert: This link reveals not only the answer key, but an insight into my current mental state.)</p>
<p>That is my solved puzzle. As you can see, I got the theme, except for one entry. As far as I can tell, I could not come up with that entry because, first, I could not think of what else might belong in that category, primarily because the main thought occupying my brain right now is “Do we really have enough toilet paper?” and second, I could not recall the words for the crossing entries. I might also have missed the fact that one of the clues was asking for a verb and not a noun.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — We’re all going through phases of coping right now, and it’s fascinating to be able to instantly see people’s emotional pulses because of modern technology. (Although, sampling — we’re mostly seeing the pulses of those who choose to broadcast them, which is a noisy minority.) I’m in the phase where all the clues relate to quarantine (um, “Who’s in?”) and all my puns go there too. EGRETS? I have a few — I have been obsessing over the muffin that I left on my desk “overnight” at work a month ago.</p>
<p>Today’s grid is by one of those stalwarts you really need in the ship when sailing uncharted waters, Robyn Weintraub, and bless her every which way for giving us one that’s neither infernally hard nor disappointingly easy. We have wit, we have class, we have interesting crosses, neat little bookend entries on the acrosses, and not a single false note. May everyone enjoy good health and eschew the bear!</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>I noticed some really wonderful interplay in the clues, and I’m sure I missed some examples. JEWEL at 1A looped back brilliantly to the last clue, “Finish on a diamond?,” and its deadpan entry, NINTH. (The “last” batter in a lineup. That’s a baseball reference. A reference to sports.) I also liked two stuttery duplications — OFFAL/OFFBALANCE and AS I/I SAID, which reminded me of Foghorn Leghorn.</p>
<p>18A: This is an entry that was relevant upon its 1998 debut, and will be dated for every use thereafter, assuming that satellites survive as long as society does. I remember thoroughly trashing a ROAD ATLAS on a cross-country trip back then, and how enjoyable it was to get a bit lost and find someplace like Meteor Crater, Ariz. Interesting that an industry study shows that paper atlas sales in the 21st century have actually increased.

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" alt="img">
VARIETY PUZZLE — This is a fun diversion that looks like an absolute bear to make, the “Going Too Far” crossword. First of all, there are no closed squares to provide breathing space and flexibility for a constructor, in this case the ingenious Alex Eaton-Salners. On top of that stricture, there is a series of symmetrically arranged gray squares that are filled with a prescribed set of letters that need to figure in one entry, either across or down. The requirements are dizzying to me, but the end result is worth it, a gratifying solve that’s a combination of a straight crossword and a bit of an acrostic.</p>
<p>To solve this thing, allow for the notion that some unspecified number of entries are going to “overflow” into the gray boxes that you see in the grid. This overflow can be at the beginning, which means that the entry will begin in a gray box before the numbered start box, or at the end, which means that the entry will jut into a gray box for its last letter. In one case that I noticed, an entry does both, beginning and ending in gray boxes. Each gray box will be used by one entry only, so once you have overflowed into a box, you know where the surrounding entries can begin and end; otherwise, this puzzle would be even a degree more difficult.</p>
<p>When you’ve finished, and every square in the grid is filled in, you will see a quotation, reading from left to right and top to bottom, in the gray boxes. The source of the quotation, as we are told in the puzzle instructions, is also in the puzzle, at 41-Down.</p>
<p>As far as solving, I actually hit some snags in the regular entries that slowed things down for me, and I think that Mr. Eaton-Salners amped up the difficulty from his last “Going Too Far.” I got mixed up on the whole east side with “bet maker” instead of BAD LOSER and “canines” instead of COPTERS, and no clue about ADO ANNIE. I also struggled with HAS A GO and GARISH (the entry that spilled out of its bounds in both directions). And CHIRRS instead of “chirps” was brutal!
