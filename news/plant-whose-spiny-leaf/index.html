<h3 id="gardening-this-botanical-garden-is-a-hidden-gem-with-free-admission">&ldquo;Gardening: This botanical garden is a hidden gem with free admission&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/OCR-L-HG-SISKIN-COL-0523-04-1.jpeg?w=1024&amp;h=768" alt="img">
Can you imagine going to Westwood and finding an amazing botanical garden where admission is free? I am talking about the Mildred Mathias Botanical Garden on the campus of UCLA, the hidden gem of local horticultural delights.</p>
<p>The only thing more amazing about your trip to Westwood will be the availability of free parking (2-hour limit on Hilgard south of Le Conte) since the university is shut down due to Covid-19 and the students and staff who would normally have taken the street curb parking spots have all gone home.</p>
<p>A Westminster Police officer looks for evidence after a male was shot during a large gathering of around 700 people in the parking lot across from Fountain Valley Skate Center after a college night event ended around 1:00 a.m. Wednesday morning near Magnolia Street and Warner Avenue in Fountain Valley.</p>

<p>Sound The gallery will resume in seconds</p>
<p>This Aug. 3, 2006, photo shows street vendors in the Echo Park section of Los Angeles. Two members of the Los Angeles City Council want to legalize sidewalk vendors, arguing it will help people who fear deportation in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to ship out millions who are in the country illegally. Joe Buscaino and Curren Price sent a letter Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016, to their fellow council members outlining a policy to decriminalize and regulate street vending. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)</p>
<p>The Botanical Garden is open to the public from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The entrance is on the corner of Hilgard and Le Conte Avenues. It’s a great outlet for the whole family with many exotic plants to ogle, especially in the cactus and succulent section. There are benches next to a large pond where you can sit and have lunch a few feet away from what is probably the biggest ongoing convention of turtles — who sun themselves unabashedly on the pond’s edge – for miles around. You can even bring a group and gather with appropriate social distancing in a small amphitheater that is secluded within the garden.</p>
<p>One of the outstanding features of the garden is a large slope near the pond that is planted entirely with bromeliads. Last week I wrote about a bromeliad I that I had never seen before (Puya chilensis) and I am about to do that again. The plant in question is Quesnelia testudo, or turtle-head bromeliad. Its genus name honors the plant explorer Martin Quisnel and its species name testudo means turtle in Latin, a moniker given on account of the way the bromeliad’s bulbous flower head extrudes from the foliage. How ironic that it should be situated just a few feet away from the turtle convention mentioned above. It can grow in either sun or shade but its leaves are spiny so wear gloves when handling it.</p>
<p>In truth, what we call a bromeliad flower is really a collection of bracts, the same appendages which are actually modified leaves and give color to a variety of plants from poinsettias to bougainvilleas to Anthuriums, those long-lasting indoor plants whose heart-shaped plastic-textured horizontal red bracts enclose vertical yellow flower spikes known as spadixes.</p>
<p>Planting bromeliads on a slope makes sense for two reasons and both have to do with drainage. You do not want standing water around bromeliad roots which are typically only for structural support since these plants take in water through the cups formed by their rosetted leaves. Water on a slope is always moving downwards so rot induced from standing water on such terrain is not an issue. The other reason for bromeliad slope planting is the sensitivity many of them have to cold. Cold air, like water, drains off a slope so bromeliads will be less likely to freeze in such a location. In any event, Quesnelia is one of the more cold-tolerant bromeliads, withstanding temperatures down to 25 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>I have learned that this outstanding plant and other Quesnelias are available through vendors on eBay. Another way to procure uncommon bromeliads would be to make contact with members of the San Fernando Valley Bromeliad Society (sfvbromeliad.homestead.com) which meets once a month in Encino or with the La Ballona Valley Bromeliad Society (bsi.org) that holds monthly meetings in West Los Angeles although such public meetings will probably be on hold for now.</p>
<p>The Mildred Mathias Botanical Garden is famous for its dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides), thought to be the tallest representative of its species in North America. It was only in 1944, in a remote part of south-central China, that the first living dawn redwoods were discovered, a species known beforehand exclusively from fossils. That mountainous region of China is the sole habitat of this tree, which is also the only deciduous redwood species. A seedling was planted in this garden in 1948, will grow to one hundred feet tall, and may live for more than a thousand years.</p>
<p>Another arboreal beauty with a long lifespan is the dragon tree (Dracaena draco), two examples of which are growing on the eastern edge of the Mildred Mathias garden in a section devoted to arid zone plants. In their native Canary Island habitat, dragon trees are known to live for several thousand years.</p>
<p>Two of the plants in this section are especially noteworthy because of their blooms. One is a sun-loving Bolivian bromeliad (Puya spathacea) with startling orange-red candelabra branched flower clusters. The other is the Australian silky net-bush (Calothamnus villosus); each of its flowers is a shaggy scarlet mustache.</p>
<p>Tip of the Week: In the Mildred Mathias Garden, a group of tropical vireya rhododendrons from Malaysia are congregated in a special planter whose soil appears to consist solely of peat moss and perlite. Vireya flowers are vibrant yellow, orange, pink or red, long-lasting and often fragrant. Overhead, the high branches of mature trees serve to protect these vireyas from the ravages of sun and wind. In our dry climate, rhododendrons and azaleas – which are members of rhododendrons’ nuclear family — should be grown in high shade, under the cover of tall trees, where the scorch of sun and wind cannot be felt, yet where the ambient light is good and the humidity is somewhat higher than in the open. Placement under trees will also trap a measure of heat that may help Vireyas survive a frost since they are cold sensitive.

<h3 id="deer-resistant-plants-for-your-garden">&ldquo;Deer Resistant Plants for Your Garden&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/052220+story+image(1).jpg" alt="img">
Deer will eat anything if they are hungry. The best approach is to use plant material that isn’t appealing to consume. Typically plants with spiny or fuzzy foliage, a strong scent, and those known to have toxic properties aren’t appealing.</p>
<p>Here are three top performers:</p>
<p>Bell Flower (Campanula Carpatica) is a low-growing perennial . In early summer, blue upturned, bell shaped flowers grow on short stalks. They are produced in such quantities they nearly cover the entire plant. Many species of campanula are fragrant, which may be one reason deer tend to avoid them. Two species of campanula in particular, C. carpatica and C. medium, are among the least preferred perennials of deer.</p>
<p>Coreopsis (Coreopsis) Lance-leaf coreopsis plants are seldom browsed by deer, but you can plant threadleaf coreopsis with even greater confidence, as it rarely receives even a nibble by passing deer. Coreopsis is easy to grow as it&rsquo;s drought-tolerant and needs no fertilizing. Deadheading blooms can encourage more flowers throughout the summer.</p>
<p>Lavender (Lavendula) What delights the olfactory senses of people is abhorrent to a deer. Both the foliage and the flowers of lavender emit the sweet perfume so beloved by potpourri makers.</p>

<h3 id="blooming-on-the-judean-desert-hills">&ldquo;Blooming on the Judean Desert hills&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/457784" alt="img">
Ma’aleh Adumim, about 7 km. west of Jerusalem and home to some 40,000 residents, is a huge botanical garden, representative of the flora that blooms in the spring on the hills of the Judean Desert.A stroll on the security road that faces Jerusalem reveals a treasure trove of wild flowers that dazzle with their amazing colors and scientific facts. There you will find toxic plants, trees mentioned in the Bible and rare flowers.Among the toxic plants and trees are the Golden henbane, with yellow and purple flowers, which contains alkaloids; and the 1.8-meter tobacco tree, which grows in undisturbed habitats, whose beauty is deceiving. According to experts, all its parts are poisonous, if consumed. It has yellow tubular flowers, about 5 cm. long, and its leaves are thick.Abundant on the hills of Ma’aleh Adumim is Tournefort’s gundelia, a tumbleweed measuring 30 cm. to 50 cm. tall, with spiny leaves and a brownish flowering head. The plant is not much to look at, but it has an unusual place in Judaism. Scholars believe it’s mentioned in the books of Psalms and Isaiah.Common also on the hills is the crown anemone, mentioned in the New Testament, whose red flowers open in the morning and close at night, which stands out in the greenery of the Judean Desert in the spring.Measuring about 50 cm. tall, the cotton thistle, not the most attractive plant in the world, but certainly one of the most unusual ones, turns from a spiky green ball into purple “hairs” that resemble a man’s close haircut.Another plant that doesn’t get its proper due is the wild cucumber, known also as the exploding cucumber, important enough to be mentioned in several ancient Jewish and non-Jewish texts. Its flower is a visual delight not too common in the desert.When it comes to beauty and exoticism, few can beat the splendid bindweed, with its pink flowers, and the salvia dominica, with its toothlike flowers.A note about wildflowers couldn’t be complete without mentioning the ubiquitous crown daisy, a yellow flower that grows even in cement cracks, and the slender oat, a fragile plant that paints the fields with its golden hues.Three sites will guide you through the flora of Israel. The first, flowersinisrael.com, lists thousands of flowers and bushes in alphabetical order by their Latin, English, Hebrew and Arabic names, and allows you to find them by color, families and blooming month. For some species it includes the botanical origin of the name and the classic texts where they are mentioned.Equally impressive is wildflowers.co.il , published in Hebrew and English by the Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund. It lists thousands of flowers in alphabetical order by their Latin name, and classifies them as toxic, biblical, medicinal or allergenic. Each plant is accompanied by a photo and described in detail, and where it grows in Israel.A shared initiative of the late Hebrew University professor Avinoam Danin and his son Barak Danin is <a href="http://www.flora.org.il">www.flora.org.il</a> , published in both English and Hebrew, and run in cooperation with the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens. It has a database of thousands of flowers, and, like the other two sites, it includes the Latin and English names of the plants and their distribution in Israel.

<h3 id="5-ways-to-decorate-your-home-with-indoor-plants">&ldquo;5 ways to decorate your home with indoor plants&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/12299532-16x9-large.png?v=4" alt="img">
As a toddler in Coffs Harbour, Ryan Klewer used to earn lollies by picking snails off plants for an elderly neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good way to learn which plants attracted bugs,&rdquo; he reflects.</p>
<p>In fact, for as long as he can remember, Ryan has felt connected to plants — not surprising as his mother ran a plant nursery where he worked most holidays.</p>
<p>Yet Ryan never saw a future in plants until about a year ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I studied design in Melbourne but after working a year in a design studio I started hosting plant parties in pubs,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been growing my own collection and I had this idea of people having a few beers and grabbing some plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months ago, he started his own business, doing interior design with plants.</p>
<p>Ryan is now responsible for the care of several hundred indoor plants, scattered around cafes, homes and offices.</p>
<p>When it comes to arranging plants in a space he says: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a difference between styling with plants and dumping a whole load of plants in one place. It&rsquo;s not all about clustering a whole load of plants together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still not sure where to begin? Ryan shares five things to consider.</p>
<p>Loading&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with pots and learn how to group them</li>
</ol>
<p>Pots &lsquo;maketh&rsquo; a plant but nice ones are expensive. Ryan suggests buying a few &lsquo;hero&rsquo; pots that you&rsquo;ve proud of then mixing them up with cheaper terracotta ones.</p>
<p>If you have a bit of a collection, think about grouping pots that complement each other — for example, matte-finish pots in one grouping and glossy ones in another.</p>
<p>Ryan also recommends picking a colour tone and staying in that spectrum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paint your own pots to mix it up,&rdquo; he suggests.</p>
<p>Finally, pick a pot to suit the plant; tall, skinny plants looks better in tall, skinny pots.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Find ways to mix colours and textures</li>
</ol>
<p>Look for contrast when placing plants together. ( ABC Life: Matt Garrow )</p>
<p>When arranging a variety of indoor plants try combining plants with a slightly different leaf colour, texture or shape. But avoid mixing something sharp and spiny against something soft.</p>
<p>When grouping plants in the same pot, you could also experiment with putting smaller plants in front (using a wide pot), and taller ones at the back.</p>
<p>Garden designers like to group plants in odd numbers, but Ryan believes there&rsquo;s no specific rule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something you can keep in mind and play with,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Make a DIY display stand</li>
</ol>
<p>If you&rsquo;re up for some DIY, concrete bricks can be used for plinths and plant stands. ( ABC Life: Matt Garrow )</p>
<p>Ryan uses lightweight polystyrene/concrete bricks that you can find at hardware stores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sand them back, paint them, then stack to create a bench, shelves or put them upright as a plant stand,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re soft enough to carve into, too, so can create whatever shape you want.&rdquo;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use a &lsquo;stunt double&rsquo; to display plants in dark spaces</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t read a book in a space without turning a light on, it&rsquo;s too dark for plants.</p>
<p>However, Ryan gets around this by having two identical plants that can be swapped around in difficult spots.</p>
<p>After a week in the gloom, you can pop one plant in a brighter spot and get the &lsquo;stunt double&rsquo; to cover. Then repeat.</p>
<p>Low-light-tolerant plants include the ZZ plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia), peace lilies (Spathiphyllum sp.) and sansevieria (Dracaena trifasciata).</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Plant multiple heights in one big pot</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have space for one large pot, create a lush oasis by underplanting a tall plant with smaller, cascading ones.</p>
<p>Either plant these out together or use a large &lsquo;cache pot&rsquo; and arrange the separate plants in individual plastic pots within your main one.</p>
<p>Upright plants include:</p>
<p>A fiddle-leaf fig (Ficus lyrata)</p>
<p>A fiddle-leaf fig (Ficus lyrata) Rubber plant (Ficus elastica)</p>
<p>Rubber plant (Ficus elastica) Bird-of-paradise (Strelitzia sp.)</p>
<p>Underplants could include:</p>
<p>Devil&rsquo;s ivy (Epipremnum aureum)</p>
<p>Devil&rsquo;s ivy (Epipremnum aureum) Heartleaf philodendron (P. cordatum), creeping fig (Ficus pumila)</p>
<p>Heartleaf philodendron (P. cordatum), creeping fig (Ficus pumila) Peace lily</p>
<p>Tips for potting and planting indoor varieties</p>
<p>The easiest way to display indoor plants is planting them (or leaving them) in a plastic pot with drainage holes and standing this in a display pot without holes.</p>
<p>However, if you prefer the look of planting directly into pots, Ryan has a few tricks to avoid drowning your plant in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Create a drainage level at the base of the pot, either by putting a layer of gravel or rocks under the soil, or put an upside-down saucer in the bottom of the pot, so water drains under it but the plant isn&rsquo;t sitting in the water.&rdquo;
