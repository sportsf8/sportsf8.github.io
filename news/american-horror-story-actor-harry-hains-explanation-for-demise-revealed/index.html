<p>Two years after winning Alice Cooper&rsquo;s Proof is in the Pudding, Amelia Joyce is competing again. But this time, it&rsquo;s on a much larger stage.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of another Arizonan, Joyce has made it to the top 40 contestants on season 18 of &ldquo;American Idol.&rdquo; She&rsquo;ll be on the episode that airs at 7 p.m. Sunday, April 5, on ABC.</p>
<p>Longtime viewers of the reality singing competition show might recall that Jordin Sparks of Glendale won season 6 of &ldquo;Idol&rdquo; not long after winning Proof is in the Pudding, an annual Phoenix talent contest Cooper hosts to spotlight up-and-coming artists in the Valley.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a path Sparks forged. But it&rsquo;s not one where Joyce feels entirely at home.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old clearly has what it takes to compete on a national stage. It was evident during the 2017 finals for Proof at the Van Buren. And it was clear during her &ldquo;Idol&rdquo; audition, where she delivered a soulful reading of the Beatles classic, &ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still, it&rsquo;s not what she would ever call her natural environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m definitely not, you know, a competition kid,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I never saw myself doing &lsquo;American Idol.&rsquo; Or any competition. I just never did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That Proof is in the Pudding contest was, in fact, the first time Joyce had ever done a music competition, and she&rsquo;s still not sure how comfortable she is subjecting what she does to that entire process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art is a subjective thing,&rdquo; Joyce says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so deeply personal to each person. It&rsquo;s woven into the fabric of who we are. My music is inseparable from my sense of self. And you put all these artists together in a room and then say, &ldquo;OK, sing for your life and act natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughs, then says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you have two minutes to show them who you are, then the next artist goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AT HOME: Catching up with Alice Cooper, who&rsquo;s home with family in Arizona after postponing his tour</p>
<p>How Wade Cota&rsquo;s &lsquo;American Idol&rsquo; journey inspired her</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t until another Phoenix act, Wade Cota, made it to the top four contestants on 2019&rsquo;s &ldquo;American Idol&rdquo; that Joyce started thinking she could set whatever reservations she was feeling to the side and go for it.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend and producer Austin Moore was Cota&rsquo;s roommate at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lived with Austin for a couple years,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And I kind of saw his experience from the flip side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once she decided to try out for &ldquo;Idol,&rdquo; she reached out to Cota and other local artists with &ldquo;Idol&rdquo; experience, including Callie Young, a 2019 contestant who&rsquo;s also appeared on &ldquo;The Voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;And so, I tried to glean as much experience as I could from other local people who&rsquo;ve tried out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing prepares you for Hollywood Week</p>
<p>Although she says nothing prepares you for Hollywood Week, it definitely helped that she had taken part in Proof is in the Pudding.</p>
<p>Winners are invited to perform at Cooper&rsquo;s Christmas Pudding, a star-studded annual variety show that raises funds for his Solid Rock Teen Center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same sort of mindset,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;A bunch of artists together in a room for a competition with art, which is subjective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce has a clear affinity for haunting ballads, with the voice that draws you into what she&rsquo;s singing, from the understated, acoustic guitar-driven charms of last year&rsquo;s aptly named &ldquo;Songs From My Bedroom&rdquo; EP to the widescreen drama of the recently released &ldquo;What No One Says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arizona-based music producer Bob Hoag was a judge the night she won the Proof is in the Pudding contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She’s a great musician, which is nice and all, but there are a lot of great musicians out there,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And she’s a great songwriter, but again, there are lots of great songwriters out there. What impressed me was her sincerity and how genuine she was — it didn’t seem like she was merely skilled — she has an abundance of what few performers today have: heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite her reservations, Joyce says she&rsquo;s enjoying the experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been quite the journey,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It was a cool experience just to be able to meet kids from all over the country. I&rsquo;ve never been in that diverse of an environment with so many different kinds of artists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her favorite part so far, she says, has been performing for the judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything before that is like, &lsquo;OK, this is out of my comfort zone,'&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;just trying to act natural. It&rsquo;s so hard to feel like you can be yourself when everyone around you is so different and there&rsquo;s cameras everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>THEY DO: Meet Jordan Jones, the Scottsdale singer who got engaged at his &lsquo;American Idol&rsquo; audition</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lionel Richie has heard an original song of mine&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s when she stepped on stage and could just focus on performing for Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie that she finally felt comfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the most inspiring part,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;to know that I could put my arrangements into their ears, I could put my original lyrics into their ears. That just blew me away. Lionel Richie has heard an original song of mine. That still blows my mind to this day, to think back to Hollywood Week when I sang an original song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing she really hoped to showcase for the judges was her versatility.</p>
<p>Amelia (Photo: Provided by the artist)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I play guitar, I play piano, I write my own songs and I can sing other people&rsquo;s stuff as well,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I really wanted to showcase my ability as a songwriter to Lionel, because I just have so much respect for him. He&rsquo;s been in the industry for such a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After auditioning with &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo; on the piano, she busted out the acoustic for the next round, which didn&rsquo;t air, covering &ldquo;Numb&rdquo; by Linkin Park in what she describes as a really pretty folk arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luke told me after after that, like in the comments of that round, &lsquo;You always keep me on my toes. I never know what to expect from you because here you are playing guitar now.&rsquo; So I really tried to make that my thing with them. And I mean, obviously, I got to the top 40 so I think it paid off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FOR SUBSCRIBERS: School&rsquo;s out for Alice Cooper&rsquo;s Solid Rock Teen Center, a home away from home for Arizona kids</p>
<p>The importance of not losing who you are to win</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also been a more eye-opening experience than Joyce expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really an insecure artist, but going into that environment, there&rsquo;s just so many talented kids from all over the country,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an environment that really breeds insecurity. And I know a lot of friends I made along the way felt the same thing, but I didn&rsquo;t expect it to shake my foundation as much as it did. But in a really good way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s made her stronger in a lot of ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a really good mental game to practice staying in your lane,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The music industry is the industry of nos. And it is super challenging to make your own way, especially as an independent artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It can be tempting to try and duplicate what works for other artists with the judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if anything, it really tested my mental resilience of just stop comparing yourself, stay in your lane, do your thing. Be yourself, be yourself, be yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was also harder work than she expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially during the Hollywood week,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t broadcast the fact that we&rsquo;re all staying up all night to work on our arrangements and you have a short amount of time to do all these different things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But whatever happens afternext, she&rsquo;s glad she did it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK that a lot of it doesn&rsquo;t come naturally to me,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a great career builder. Even if it just helps me get better-paying gigs, because nonmusical people who are hiring you will be like, &lsquo;Oh, she made top 40. She must be able to sing.&rsquo; And I would still be the same artist with or without &lsquo;American Idol,&rsquo; but career-wise, it&rsquo;s just an amazing opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="american-idol-contenders-run-at-top-20-started-in-alabama">‘American Idol’ contender’s run at Top 20 started in Alabama</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.al.com/resizer/R3LOBfMQu1D9FLfdG-N_xM3hIZk=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IBT5A2QHLRBKHFA77KM2N6NZXI.JPG" alt="img">
Back in August, hundreds of people lined up in Mobile for a shot at becoming the next American Idol. On Sunday, viewers see whether one of them makes it into the season’s Top 20.</p>
<p>So far this season, Alabama viewers have had the opportunity to root for one of their own, Douglas Kiker of Grand Bay, who made it to Hollywood but no further. By comparison Aliana Jester isn’t an Alabama native, but her journey to possible stardom did begin in the state.</p>
<p>On Aug. 20, 2019, Jester was among hundreds of people who lined up in the Arthur R. Outlaw Mobile Convention Center before being led to the GulfQuest Maritime Museum for auditions.</p>
<p>While the mood among the contenders was excited and upbeat, it was a challenging environment. In a single third-floor room, a row of producers each summoned forth a group of three or four hopefuls, giving each person a few minutes to sing. With one producer’s table separated from the next only by curtains, this wasn’t much in the way of a spotlight moment: It was more like hearing the cast of a musical warming up backstage before a show.</p>

<p>Jester, a Tampa native who’d driven over from her home in Fort Walton, Fla., stood out anyway. She sang parts of Beyonce’s “Listen” and Smokey Robinson’s “Who’s Loving You,” a song covered by many groups including a definitive version by The Jackson 5. Then she cut through the noise with “I Will Always Love You.” The crowd around her gave her an ovation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m super excited,&rdquo; she said on the way to the room designated as the “winner’s circle.” She said she’d previously auditioned for &ldquo;The Voice&rdquo; and &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Got Talent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hope is to learn and grow through the experience,” she said.</p>
<p>Interviewed by phone on Friday, she said she’s gotten her wish. She’s learned from her fellow competitors every step of the way. “I’ve learned about myself that I’m definitely tough,” she said.</p>
<p>Jester’s next appearance came on March 15, the last episode to feature general auditions. She showed up in front of celebrity judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie with her French bulldog Nova Lady along for support and made an impression. It’s never a bad thing when Lionel Richie compares you to a “young Whitney.”</p>
<p>She moved on to the Hollywood Round, where things again went well. A duet on the Meghan Trainor/John Legend duet “Like I’m Gonna Lose You” with fellow contestant YZthaSinger helped both of them move forward, though YZthaSinger ultimately didn’t make the Top 40.</p>
<p>Maybe Hollywood Week looked easy on TV, but Jester said that between the production schedule and the emotional ups and downs, it was grueling. She’s never been one to need a lot of sleep, she said, but the week pushed her to her limit.</p>
<p>“I got home and I slept for 16 hours,” she said. “To the point where my stepmom had to wake me up and say, ‘Are you still alive?’”</p>
<p>It also was a humbling experience, she said. Jester has sung all her life, but as the “Idol” field has been whittled down she’s found herself among people who’ve had more formal training and more time on stage.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m probably the one with the least experience out of all of this,” she said. Where others can talk about career breaks they’ve already had, she said, “I’m like, ‘I do karaoke.’”</p>
<p>Sunday’s episode completes the Hawaii round that pares the field down from 40 to the Top 20. That process began in the episode that aired Sunday, March 29. It would have been completed on Monday, March 30, but the coronavirus shutdown has slowed the show’s transition from pre-recorded to live material. So Monday’s episode was postponed until Sunday.</p>
<p>Jester said she wanted everyone to understand that she and the other contestants have been back at home for a while now. Their trip to Hawaii was recorded before COVID-19 put things on hold.</p>
<p>Like anyone else, she got to watch the first half of the Hawaii round when it aired on March 29. “It definitely brought back memories,” she said.</p>
<p>In contrast to Hollywood, she remembers Hawaii as more of a fun time. “I was toward the end so I was able to watch everybody perform,” she said. Watching the episode was “like I was back in Hawaii with all of them,” she said.</p>

<p>There was a downside to being one of the last to take the stage. Everyone who did well put that much more pressure on her. “I was like, ‘There goes one spot’ … ‘There goes another spot …,’” she said.</p>
<p>“American Idol” airs at 7 p.m. Central time on ABC. Current plans call for “Idol” not to air on Monday, April 6. On April 12 and 19 it’ll air specials of prerecorded material featuring the Top 20. A schedule for subsequent live shows hasn’t yet been announced.

<h3 id="american-idols-top-40-contestants-of-2020-were-just-leaked">&lsquo;American Idol'&lsquo;s Top 40 Contestants of 2020 Were Just Leaked</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/american-idol-2020-spoilers-top-40-contestants-1584980252.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
This is your final warning to look away now if don&rsquo;t want any (potential) spoilers for American Idol this year.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still with us, prepare to see the alleged top 40 contestant list from this season. Just like last year, the Idol-obsessed blog The Idol Pad is claiming to know which contestants make it through Hollywood Week and earn the show&rsquo;s coveted top spots. How, you ask? Well apparently, Idol Pad had some eyes and ears on the ground while the ABC singing show was filming its post-audition elimination rounds in late January and early February. After supposedly gaining intel from Idol staff, contestant family members, fans, and more, Idol Pad says it now has the full scoop on the top 40 of 2020.</p>
<p>But is the list legit? While we can&rsquo;t say for sure until more episodes air, the site did predict the top 20 contestants last year using similar tactics, so there&rsquo;s a good chance the below list is, in fact, correct.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re ready for spoilers, keep scrolling for the supposed top 40 contestant list of season 3 (18th overall). The site notes that there&rsquo;s one female contestant not confirmed, which explains why there are only 39 confirmed names below:</p>
<p>Aliana Jester</p>
<p>Amber Fiedler</p>
<p>Amelia Joyce</p>
<p>Bilaal Avaz</p>
<p>Cameron Havens</p>
<p>Cyniah Elise</p>
<p>Demi Rae Moreno</p>
<p>Dewayne Crocker</p>
<p>Devon Alexander</p>
<p>Dibesh Rokharel ( Arthur Gunn )</p>
<p>( ) Dillon James</p>
<p>Elyjuh Rene</p>
<p>Faith Becnel</p>
<p>Francisco Martin</p>
<p>Franklin Boone</p>
<p>Geena Fontanella</p>
<p>Genavieve Linkowski</p>
<p>Grace Leer</p>
<p>Grace Lundy</p>
<p>Jeb Vonderbruegge</p>
<p>Jonny West</p>
<p>Jordan Jones</p>
<p>Jovin Webb</p>
<p>Julia Gargano</p>
<p>Kimmy Gabriela</p>
<p>Lauren Mascitti</p>
<p>Lauren Spencer Smith</p>
<p>Louie Knight</p>
<p>Makayla Phillips</p>
<p>Makayla Brownlee</p>
<p>Natalie Jane</p>
<p>Nick Merico</p>
<p>Olivia Ximines</p>
<p>Perrin York</p>
<p>Robert Taylor</p>
<p>Samantha Diaz</p>
<p>Sophia Wackerman</p>
<p>Shannon Gibbons</p>
<p>Travis Finlay</p>
<p>If this list ends up being correct, fans will likely be pretty excited, as it appears many of the internet&rsquo;s favorites — Dibesh Rokharel (Arthur Gunn), Makayla Phillips, Cyniah Elise, Dewayne Crocker, and Francisco Martin — have all made the cut. That said, quite a few standout contestants — Madison Paige, Peyton Aldridge, Sheniel Maisonet, and Yzthasinger – are not on the roster, meaning there&rsquo;s a chance they&rsquo;ll get eliminated in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Again, we can&rsquo;t say with 100% certainty that this is what will happen over the next few weeks on Idol. Keeping that in mind, it&rsquo;s probably best that fans watch every week just in case Idol Pad ends up being wrong.
