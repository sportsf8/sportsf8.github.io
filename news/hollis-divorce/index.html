<p>Bob Dylan: where to start in his back catalogue</p>
<p>By Richard Williams / The Guardian</p>
<p>The Times They Are A-Changin’ (1964)</p>
<p>The cover told the story. After the portrait of the unformed boy, fresh in from Minnesota, on his self-titled debut album , followed by the young lovers huddling for warmth in a wintry Greenwich Village on Freewheelin’, Barry Feinstein’s grainy and dramatically cropped black and white portrait on the cover of Bob Dylan’s third album projected the image of an altogether more serious and substantial figure, still wearing the clothes he’d borrowed from James Dean but bent on tackling the big issues of the day. The Times They Are A-Changin’ transformed Dylan from a folk-club act and cult hero into the voice of a generation — an epithet he claimed to detest but never quite succeeded in erasing.</p>
<p>As a cultural wave began to break, a 22-year-old was directly confronting mothers, fathers, senators, congressmen, writers and critics with evidence of their failures. And when informed by those mothers and fathers that Dylan “couldn’t sing,” his followers loved him all the more. The image was set, and no matter how many wonderful bands he would go on to recruit — the Hawks, the Rolling Thunder troupe, the Never Ending Tour ensemble — he will live longest and most powerfully in the memory as a lone figure in the spotlight with an acoustic guitar, a harmonica and a defiant nasal drawl scraped clean of all varnish, delivering songs like these.</p>

<p>There are bleak tales of injustice visited on the invisible poor (The Ballad of Hollis Brown and North Country Blues), the angry civil-rights broadsides (Only a Pawn in Their Game and The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll) and an evisceration of cold war hypocrisy (With God on Their Side), each of them explicit in its accusatory detail and suffused with an empathy and a seemingly world-weary wisdom so striking in one of his age.</p>
<p>But in this first entirely self-composed album there were also songs of self-discovery coming from more oblique angles, like When the Ship Comes In and Restless Farewell, and a moment of luminous tenderness: Boots of Spanish Leather, transformed from the traditional Scarborough Fair into one of the songs with which he gave a generation access to their newest and deepest feelings.</p>
<p>Highway 61 Revisited (1965)</p>

<p>zIf the rackety boogie of Subterranean Homesick Blues lit the fuse, this was the explosion. He had found the formula he was looking for: a gnarlier, snarlier version of the British Invasion bands, an endless high-voltage, high-heeled surge of guitars, keyboards and drums, a first-take sound with the big-city blues in its veins and a poet at the controls, singing about tortured thieves and junkyard angels and remaking the Old Testament as a road movie. Like a Rolling Stone, released as a six-minute single, was the harbinger and also a career pinnacle. What did it mean, this howl of triumphant disdain? It seemed to mean whatever you were thinking yourself, making the world feel a bigger place. And, to finish off, Desolation Row, a universe created from scratch in 11 stripped-back minutes of carnival hallucinations.</p>
<p>Blood on the Tracks (1974)</p>
<p>Any expectation of linear development having been blown apart by the excursions into country and other forms of vernacular music that followed Dylan’s motorbike accident, Blood on the Tracks was received with a sigh of collective gratitude. Souls were soothed by the return to earlier songwriting strategies in the graceful melodies, the finely wrought lyrics and the unadorned arrangements of Simple Twist of Fate, Shelter from the Storm and If You See Her, Say Hello, while Tangled Up in Blue showed him using all his powers to hold a narrative up to the light and examine its many facets. There was the entrancing mystery of Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts, a tale of violence and lust in the old west, and a lost-love song of kindness, regret and eternal resonance set to a skipping rhythm in You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go.</p>

<p>The album followed his divorce from Sara Lownds, but its stories were universal: “Life is sad, life is a bust / All you can do is do what you must / You do what you must do, and you do it well / I do it for you, honey baby can’t you tell?”</p>
<p>Time Out of Mind (1997)</p>
<p>In 1989 the Canadian producer and guitarist Daniel Lanois took Dylan down to New Orleans to help him refocus his music with the widely praised Oh Mercy. Eight years later the partnership was resumed in Miami. Dylan’s voice was wearier and rougher now, its changed texture emphasized by Lanois’s production techniques. Everything on Time Out of Mind sounded older; it was as if the Muddy Waters band of 1956 had just vacated the studio but left behind their amps and instruments, with which Dylan and Lanois created their spectral webs of sound. The mood was at its most intense in Not Dark Yet, a slow-march meditation on mortality, and the 16-minute Highlands, an ambling 12-bar blues in which Dylan collapsed the space between Robert Burns’ hymn to a lost rural home and an encounter with a waitress in a Boston diner. And, half-buried, there’s Make You Feel My Love, destined to become probably his most covered song since Blowin’ in the Wind.

Rosayra Pablo Cruz and Julie Schwietert Collazo. HarperOne, $26.99 (246p) ISBN 978-0-06-294192-3</p>
<p>This disturbing and unforgettable memoir follows the path of Guatemalan mother Pablo Cruz, who fled to the U.S. in 2018 with her two sons after her husband is murdered, she herself is shot, and her oldest son is threatened by criminals. Writing with Schwietert Collazo, who initiated the Immigrant Families Together grassroots organization to aid mothers detained at the U.S. border, Pablo Cruz narrates her agonizing eight-day journey to the border crammed in a truck with other refugees and her 81 days in a cell after being separated by ICE agents from her boys (ages five and 15). In the months without her boys, who are placed in foster care in the Bronx while she remains in Arizona, Pablo Cruz paints a heartbreaking picture of the many incarcerated mothers who spend hours weeping and praying together. A devout evangelical Christian, Pablo Cruz draws upon her faith to see her through the desolation and despair, and eventually her prayers are answered by a group of angry, “bad-ass ladies” from Immigrant Families Together who raise a $12,000 bond for her release. This wrenching story brings to vivid life the plight of the many families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. (June)

Au contraire. That is a distinctly more modern phenomenon. Orenstein cites a recent survey in which young men report “more social pressure to be ever-ready for sex and to get with as many women as possible.” She also reports that a contemporary “culture of adolescence,” complete with a worship of “sexual conquest,” has replaced perspectives of men as protectors and caregivers from earlier in the 20th century.</p>
<p>If you think the culture of sexual conquest is driven by the boys, you are seriously out of date. As a woman (and a mother), I was horrified by what the boys told Orenstein about the young women in their social lives. As young teens, these girls are “hooking up” with multiple boys and then comparing, mocking and humiliating them to friends and classmates, and on social media. I was frankly shocked by Orenstein’s obliviousness to this. She decries what she views as the boys’ misogyny. But not a word about the self-destructive promiscuity and deliberate cruelty of the girls.

There’s the 2005 comedy The Squid and the Whale, brief and agonising as a stubbed toe, which cemented this writer-director’s standing and favoured clipped, scathing scenes of comic humiliation. Or there’s his latest film, Marriage Story, nearly an hour longer and no less painful, but with that pain administered in suffusing waves rather than short, sharp shocks. If the earlier picture showed how divorce can turn reasonable people into combatants and cannon fodder, the new one insists that the effort to avoid that carnage may not in all cases be doomed.</p>
<p>It’s an odd sort of divorce movie that has “marriage” in the title (though not the first: Bergman’s Scenes from a Marriage is namechecked on screen) and which begins with each partner presenting an adoring montage of the other’s finest qualities. Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is an actor who turned her back on a Hollywood career in favour of theatre work in New York under the direction of her dazzling, perfectionist husband, Charlie (Adam Driver), the sort of man who can’t resist giving notes even at the drinks party on closing night.</p>
<p>Their plan was to move eventually to Los Angeles, where Nicole grew up. But now it’s many years later, they have an eight-year-old son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), and Nicole is tired of her wishes being ignored. The pair decide to separate and she heads to California with Henry to star in a TV pilot. While she’s there, she visits a laser-focused divorce lawyer, Nora (Laura Dern), whose bright, minimalist office is as far from the ramshackle clutter of Nicole’s life with Charlie as it would be possible to imagine.</p>
<p>More than once in the film we hear the West Coast praised for its expansiveness (“The space!”), and there is something in the combination of that physical freedom and Nora’s sympathetic attention that allows Nicole’s disappointments to come cascading out in one unravelling monologue. Baumbach’s use of the long take gives Johansson room to breathe, too, and to suggest a woman surprised by the intensity of her own feelings in the very act of articulating them.</p>
<p>Charlie lacks an equivalent speech, a lightning-bolt moment, but then he has a larger share of the action: after the first 45 minutes or so, the picture shows the divorce largely as he experiences it in the form of a series of injustices. As Nicole’s life expands, his contracts. He is advised that if he wants to prove to the courts his commitment to Henry, he must take an apartment in LA. And he can’t consult any divorce lawyers to whom his wife has spoken, which is how he ends up torn between a $950-per-hour pink-faced tough-guy (Ray Liotta) and a cheaper, gentler old-timer (Alan Alda) who turns nouns into verbs (“Can we sidebar?”) and makes unhelpful observations (“You remind me of myself on my second marriage”).</p>
<p>Each day brings fresh evidence for Charlie of his new lowly status, such as the miserable Halloween where custody arrangements leave father and son no option but to go trick-or-treating late at night when the neighbourhood’s supply of candy has been exhausted. A TV horror movie seems to comment on Charlie’s life (“There will never be another dawn”) while his choice of costume (the Invisible Man) expresses his fears about the role he will now play in Henry’s future.</p>
<p>If Charlie and Nicole could step outside the movie, they might marvel at the drama’s seam of heartbreaking ironies, the way innocuous words and actions can be weaponised; they’re theatre people, after all. An ordinary domestic interaction is transformed by the presence of a manilla envelope overlooked by one of the characters, the whole scene choreographed like farce but with divorce papers rather than sex as the electrifying component.</p>
<p>And they would both surely appreciate the symmetry in the way their relationship is bookended by performances. Nicole first met Charlie when she saw him in a play in someone’s apartment; by the end of the film he is again performing in an intimate setting, only now the stage is his sparsely decorated LA digs, his co-star is Henry and the only audience member is a family court representative (the brilliant, unsettling Mary Hollis Inboden) who has come to evaluate them in their home environment.</p>
<p>As the bloodthirsty Nora, Dern has the showiest role, and one sublimely disorienting moment when she pauses hostilities at lunch to recommend to Charlie and his lawyer some “really yummy salads and sandwiches”, turning in an instant from shark to mother hen. It is Johansson and Driver, though, who give the picture its weight, clarifying movingly the couple’s love for one another even as they’re falling apart. Physical disparity is part of their charm. With her short hair, drowsy eyes and plump lips, Johansson is as self-contained as a teardrop; Driver’s face, truculently handsome, looks as long and lugubrious as a violin, one which knows it is doomed to play Adagio for Strings, and nothing but, for the rest of its days.</p>

Across the United States (and Canada and Europe), cases are being brought in which parental rights are sought out to be terminated because the parents do not “affirm” their minor child’s assertion that he or she is a different gender than his or her biological sex. Refusal to do so is argued to be abuse. These arguments are making their way into divorce and child custody cases as well — the case of James Younger in Texas is an infamous example — with transgender activists claiming that the parent who opposes “social transitioning,” the administration of “puberty blockers” or surgical mutilation should be denied custody, all in the name of the child’s “rights.”
