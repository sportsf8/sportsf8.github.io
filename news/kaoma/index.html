<p>Il testo che segue è tratto dal libro &ldquo;Mezzo secolo di ritornelli&rdquo; di Stefano Cilio.</p>
<p>La canzone fu pubblicata nell’estate del 1989 dal gruppo francese Kaoma, in collaborazione con la cantante brasiliana Loalwa Braz, e oltre a essere il tormentone di quell’anno è anche diventato un classico dei balli latino-americani di coppia e una delle canzoni in lingua portoghese più diffuse nel mondo.</p>
<p>“Lambada” è una versione non autorizzata della canzone del 1981 “Llorando se fue”, brano acustico in spagnolo inciso dal gruppo boliviano Los Kjarkas, specializzato in musica andina. I membri del gruppo intentarono una causa per plagio, che vinsero grazie al fatto che le due melodie fossero identiche e che la loro versione fosse stata depositata alla Siae tedesca (Gema), ottenendo un risarcimento il cui valore non è mai stato reso pubblico.</p>
<p>La versione dei Kaoma è stata adattata al ritmo di quello che poi diventerà il ballo Lambada e tradotta in portoghese per avere appeal nel mercato brasiliano. Il ballo Lambada è un tipo di danza di coppia ad alto tasso erotico, in cui i partner sono estremamente vicini l’una all’altro e ancheggiano sinuosamente strusciandosi in modo allusivo e sensuale.</p>
<p>Il video è ambientato in una spiaggia brasiliana e i due protagonisti principali sono i giovanissimi ballerini Chico e Roberta. A seguito dell’immenso successo di “Lambada” i Kaoma hanno reinciso la canzone sia in inglese che in spagnolo; notevole anche il riscontro ottenuto al Festivalbar, grazie al quale il gruppo si affacciò per la prima volta in Italia. Il successo mondiale della canzone è testimoniato dall’aver raggiunto la posizione numero uno in undici paesi (Austria, Belgio, Finlandia, Francia, Germania, Italia, Olanda, Norvegia, Spagna, Svezia e Svizzera), con oltre 5 milioni di copie vendute solo nel 1989.</p>
<p>Nel 2009 è uscita una nuova versione, “Lambada 3000”, in cui il famoso disc-jockey e produttore Gregor Salto ha reinterpretato la canzone in chiave house; per l’occasione Loalwa Braz ha reinciso le parti vocali ma il successo di questo remix si è limitato al Belgio e all’Olanda.</p>
<p>In tempi recenti la cantante portoricana Jennifer Lopez ha utilizzato una melodia del ritornello di “Lambada” nel suo grande successo “On the Floor”, prodotto nel 2011 da RedOne e cantato assieme a Pitbull, arri- vando al numero uno di oltre venti classifiche nazionali. Il successo della canzone fu tale da far rientrare “Lambada” nelle classifiche di vendita, facendola esordire a distanza di decenni nel mercato digitale.</p>

<p>Questa scheda è tratta da “Mezzo secolo di ritornelli – Le canzoni più presenti nelle classifiche di vendita italiane”, di Stefano Cilio, Arcana Edizioni, per gentile concessione dell’editore.(C) Lit edizioni di Pietro D&rsquo;Amore s.a.s.</p>
<p>Nota: l’autore del libro ha deciso di inserire in un sistema tutte le classifiche settimanali di vendita dei dischi in Italia uscite in sessant’anni, scegliendo solo le prime dieci posizioni per un criterio di omogeneità.</p>
<p>Una volta raccolti tutti i dati, per ciascuna delle 3.131 classifiche settimanali è stato assegnato dalla prima alla decima posizione un punteggio decrescente (ponderato sulla base della media delle vendite nel nostro paese). Ciascuna canzone entrata anche solo per una settimana al numero dieci ha così ottenuto un punteggio relativo alla propria presenza, e una volta stabilita la graduatoria complessiva dei 4.134 brani considerati, di cui 757 sono arrivati al numero uno, le canzoni con il punteggio totale più alto sono andate a formare una sorta di classifica delle classifiche.

<h3 id="kamba-clarifies-leaked-audio">&ldquo;KAMBA Clarifies Leaked Audio&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://zambiareports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kamba-Kennedy.jpg" alt="img">
Patriotic Front PF Lusaka Province Secretary Kennedy Kamba has clarified that the conversation between him and Chomba Kaoma was intended to help youths with established businesses and not to steal donated Covid-19 materials from the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Kamba also said it is disappointing that a private conversation he had with Kaoma could be leaked and circulated on WhatsApp blogs thereby embarrassing the party and implicating it of involvement in illegalities.</p>
<p>Kamba clarified that his conversation with Kaoma was well intended as he was merely asking him to identify viable youths in business such as tailors to get tenders to make reusable face masks which government would buy and distribute in schools across the country to prevent Covid-19 infections.</p>
<p>Kamba explained that this did not imply in any way that the donated Covid-19 materials are being given to PF youths as they are all in the custody of the government and can therefore not be stolen or misappropriated.</p>
<p>He said what his office wants is to help those in the party structures and those not in the structures by linking them to business opportunities and therefore, the leaked conversation was misconstrued to mean that Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya was dishing out donated Covid-19 materials to PF members.</p>
<p>And Chomba Kaoma has unreservedly apologized to Lusaka Province PF Secretary Kennedy Kamba over a voice recording of their private conversation yesterday that has leaked and gone viral on social media.</p>
<p>In the audio, it was insinuated that Mr. Kamba directed Chomba Kaoma to identify and mobilize PF youths who will be beneficiaries of a consignment of PPE’s received from Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya donated towards Covid-19 in order for the youths to sell.</p>

<h3 id="africas-covid-19-recovery-should-harness-the-benefits-of-nature-and-conservation">&ldquo;Africa’s COVID-19 Recovery Should Harness the Benefits of Nature and Conservation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Small_WW220094.jpg" alt="img">
Africa’s COVID-19 Recovery Should Harness the Benefits of Nature and Conservation</p>
<p>by Brighton Kaoma, Alice Ruhweza, and Jeff Worden | May 22, 2020</p>
<p>Today, as we celebrate International Day of Biodiversity, the global community is called to re-examine our relationship to the natural world. We celebrate this day in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic that is severely impacting people and organizations around the world, and highlighting the fragility of so much of what we hold dear. We stand in solidarity with all those who are suffering at the hands of this global crisis.</p>
<p>Today’s theme, “Our solutions are in nature,” emphasizes “hope, solidarity and the importance of working together at all levels to build a future of life in harmony with nature.” This message resonates with particular strength today, as the scope and scale of the devastation of COVID-19 to human health and wellbeing becomes increasingly clear. While most African governments have acted expeditiously to contain the spread of this virus across the continent, the economic impacts of the pandemic are both acute and far-reaching. These impacts threaten the very foundation of Africa’s sustainable development agenda.</p>
<p>One sector where the impacts of COVID are particularly clear is tourism. Estimates by the African Union suggest that the economic impact of COVID-19 on Africa’s tourism and travel sector alone may be as much as $50 billion USD — nearly 7 times greater than the 2008 economic crisis — with widespread job losses and the looming threat of food insecurity.</p>
<p>These economic impacts reach far beyond the sector itself, however. With the rise of ecotourism over the past three decades, the fate of the industry has become increasingly linked with the wellbeing of rural communities in high biodiversity areas. In many parts of Africa, human health and wellbeing is inextricably linked to sustainable management of their natural resources. The sudden and comprehensive collapse of global tourism has brought to the fore a largely hidden but parallel crisis brewing for Africa’s conservation landscapes and the people that protect and depend on this rich natural heritage.</p>
<p>In addition to providing alternative livelihoods to vulnerable rural communities, tourism has transformed the very nature of conservation in Africa. It has engendered a revolution in community-based natural resource management through revenue sharing, enabled the expansion of conservation outside of protected areas, and provided a mechanism to fundamentally change the conservation narrative from “exclusion” to “inclusion” – from government ownership to community rights. Tourism has also demonstrated the potential for channeling resources from wealthy economies to developing countries and communities in support of conservation. Critically, income from tourism has supported conservation both inside and outside of protected areas and provided an incentive for many communities to protect biodiversity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, tourism has created vast multiplier effects across economic sectors. For example, it is estimated that every night that a tourist stays at a high-end wildlife lodge in a remote part of Africa, up to 14 people in the surrounding community benefit indirectly from the income generated. On a macro level, there are numerous examples of countries whose revenue from the tourism sector significantly contributes to the national treasury, with much of this revenue being channeled to other essential sectors such as health and education.</p>
<p>In countries like Uganda and Rwanda, tourism revenue pays for the construction of schools and health care facilities for communities neighboring protected areas. In Kenya, tourism is the third largest source of foreign exchange; it supports 1.5 million jobs (especially in rural areas), and dominates the service sector. In 2018, the World Travel and Tourism Council reported that South Africa’s tourism sector directly contributed to 2.9 percent of the GDP, and the economic contribution from tourism could be multiplied by a factor of four to include its revenue-generating ability across other sectors, ranging from agriculture to manufacturing.</p>
<p>Tourism also fueled the transition of nations like Cabo Verde, the Maldives and Samoa from what the U.N. defines as ‘least developed countries’ to ‘middle income countries.’</p>
<p>On this International Day of Biodiversity, however, it is equally important that we remember the existential value of nature. Even without tourism, we are completely dependent on nature for our water, food, medicines, clothes, fuel, shelter and energy. The collapse of tourism reminds us to appreciate the other essential services that nature provides, such as reducing vulnerability to climate change; providing food and water security; reducing pollution; ensuring access to important genetic material and traditional medicine; timber production, and carbon storage. All of which are essential to Africa’s future economic development. A recent report on Global Futures by WWF suggests that a “business-as-usual” development strategy that fails to protect nature and its essential services could result in an economic loss of nearly $10 trillion USD by 2050. It is therefore imperative that nature is part and parcel of our local and national development plans.</p>
<p>We know that tourism has its challenges, and even as we emerge from this crisis, we will need to critically examine issues such as the negative impacts of carbon emissions from international travel, and the environmental degradation resulting from too many tourists, among other things. We also recognize that it is time to explore new models of sustainable finance for nature that go beyond the current tourism model. But we know fundamentally that the ability of this sector (and our economies more generally) to recover will be based on the health of the product it is selling — in this case nature and biodiversity.</p>
<p>Africa’s tourism industry will be an important launching pad for economic recovery. We call on African leaders and policy makers to consider tourism as one of the key components of stimulus packages and economic recovery plans. Aside from being deeply entrenched in the African continent’s development DNA, tourism fosters unparalleled positive ripple effects to other sectors of the economy during this recovery phase. But let’s not stop there. Even as we build on the social and environmental benefits that tourism can support, let’s ensure that biodiversity, and nature more generally, are recognized as key building blocks for a post COVID -19 recovery.</p>
<p>In the spirit of today’s theme, “our solutions are in nature,” let us seize this opportunity to reflect on the central role of nature in our health, wellbeing, and sustainable development. Happy International Day of Biodiversity!

<p><img src="https://zambiareports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Calabash.jpg" alt="img">
A person has died while six other members of the same family are admitted to Mangango Mission Hospital in Kaoma District after consuming suspected poisonous local drink popularly known as Munkoyo. Both Police and Kaoma District Commissioner Kennedy Mubanga have confirmed the incident involving a family of Mangowa village in Chief Mutondo’s area in Kaoma.</p>
<p>The seven family members took the suspected poisonous Munkoyo on Sunday morning for their breakfast and later developed stomach pains, vomiting and diarrhoea, resulting in the death of one family member. Mr. Mubanga identified the deceased as Imanga Mutoleka, aged 17.</p>
<p>He said the suspected poisonous Munkoyo was brewed by the mother to the deceased who is also a victim. Mr. Mubanga said Councillor Mathias Mwenzala reported the matter to Police who rescued the victims and rushed them to Mangango Mission Hospital.</p>
<p>And Kaoma District Hospital Director Idi Mwine described the condition of the victims as stable. Dr. Mwine said the samples of the Munkoyo drink have been taken to Lusaka for thorough laboratory tests. Police have since launched an investigation into the matter.</p>

<p>The area member of parliament is Tourism minister Ronald Kaoma Chitotela.</p>
<p>He has been seen and heard bragging of taking development to Pambashe constituency but after over 50 years of independence schools in his constituency still have no desks and innocent pupils sit on the floor while learning.</p>
<p>What sort of leaders do we have in zambia, meanwhile the minister recently purchased a 2019 brand new Range Rover when his voters children don’t have desks in class.

THE Lusaka High Court has upheld the 18-year jail sentence imposed by the Lusaka Magistrates’ Court on Henry Kapoko and two others.</p>
<p>Kapoko, a former Ministry of health human resource officer, was jailed for corruption in 2018 along with Vincent Luhana and Justine Phiri.</p>
<p>The High Court has, however, quashed the mode of conviction for the trio, saying their sentence will not run consecutively but concurrently.</p>
<p>This means that their sentence has been reduced to nine years from the date of conviction.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Luhana and Phiri who were Convicted alongside Kapoko for being negligent in the execution of their duties have been acquitted of charges of theft by public servant and money laundering.</p>
<p>The court said the findings of the lower cannot be faulted as it was a discretion and upheld the directive by the Magistrates’ Court to pay back the stolen K6.8 million.</p>
<p>This is in a matter where Kapoko, Zukas Kaoma, Evaristo Musaba, Vincent Luhana and Justin Phiri challenged their 18-year jail term for theft by public servant on grounds that the state failed to prove the offence of theft by public servant, and money laundering beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>In 2018 Choma-based magistrate Exnorbit Zulu, jailed Kapoko and four others to 18 years imprisonment after he found them guilty in 61 counts of theft by public servant and money laundering involving over K6.8 million.</p>
<p>Magistrate Zulu ordered Kapoko, Zukas Kaoma, Evaristo Musaba, Luhana and Phiri to pay back the K6.8 million and that all the properties they acquired using such money be forfeited to the State.</p>
<p>High Court judge Catherine Phiri, on behalf of others, said the trial magistrate could not be faulted for finding that the elements of theft had been proved.</p>
<p>After the judgement, Luhana and Phiri wore smiles as they left the court premises while a crestfallen Kapoko walked down the corridors of the Supreme Court with his hands strapped at his back.

<p><img src="https://www.namibian.com.na/public/uploads/images/5ebdab8861e5d/Lorry7.jpg" alt="img">
A NAMIBIAN lorry driver died in a road accident in Zambia this afternoon.</p>
<p>The 26-year old driver died after his lorry collided with the rear end of another lorry, which had come to a halt.</p>
<p>The Namibian understands that the driver, who worked for Mr T Transport, was driving on a gravel road between Kaoma and Kasempa in the western part of Zambia when the accident occurred.</p>
<p>Mr T Transport owner Pecks Katukula confirmed the accident to The Namibian this evening.</p>
<p>“He was really young. The accident happened this afternoon in Zambia. It was on a gravel road and he hit another truck from behind. His family has been informed,” he said.</p>
<p>Also speaking to The Namibian from Zambia, Namibia&rsquo;s high commissioner in Lusaka, Sivave Haindongo, said he had heard about the accident, but was still waiting for information from the Zambian authorities.</p>
