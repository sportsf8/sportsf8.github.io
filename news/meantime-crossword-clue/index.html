<h3 id="solution-to-evan-birnholzs-march-15-post-magazine-crossword-name-dropping">&ldquo;Solution to Evan Birnholz’s March 15 Post Magazine crossword, “Name Dropping”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SCOC6R55FJHUZGIUJBD5PUORAE.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Today’s puzzle has a “redefining phrases to mean something else” theme, but with an extra twist that’s not easy to spot. I’ll get to that twist a bit later, but first … the theme answers are all celebrities with common words as their first and last names. They’ve been redefined as though they’re not names at all:</p>
<p>23A: [Tanker mess that occurs during a blessing?] is GRACE SLICK .</p>
<p>25A: [Young kangaroo who’s head of the diocese?] is JOEY BISHOP .</p>
<p>36A: [Nobleman known for eating burgers?] is PATTY DUKE .</p>
<p>59A: [Natural rise of a religious movement?] is FAITH HILL .</p>
<p>61A: [Nautical locations where radio operators say “copy that”?] is ROGER WATERS .</p>
<p>67A: [River crossings where some meet their boyfriends?] is BEAU BRIDGES .</p>
<p>72A: [One worshiped by male goats?] is BILLY IDOL .</p>
<p>92A: [Seafaring voyage for male turkeys?] is TOM CRUISE .</p>
<p>109A: [Forest full of big cats?] is TIGER WOODS .</p>
<p>111A: [Folk tale about a bathroom?] is JOHN LEGEND.</p>
<p>That’s a simple enough idea, but I wanted to take it further. The puzzle doesn’t just drop names out of the theme answers. There are no names or any proper nouns anywhere in the puzzle. There aren’t any names or proper nouns in the clues, either. I can’t tell you how many times I was pulling my hair out trying to avoid common crossword names like ERIE and ONO and OREO in every single part of the grid.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Obviously it wasn’t necessary to take that extra step throughout the puzzle; in fact, I can understand if the total lack of names gave the puzzle a dry flavor while you were solving. But it felt like an artistic and ambitious goal, so I did my best to achieve it while still keeping the grid as smooth as possible. Thankfully, I won’t be making a nameless puzzle again any time soon.</p>
<p>(There was a brief period where I had considered making the byline “Anonymous” to complete the nameless motif, but I didn’t.)</p>
<p>Some other answers and clues:</p>
<p>18A and 114A are MAXIM and ADAGE , respectively, both clued as [“Birds of a feather flock together,” e.g.]. Seemed appropriate for a phrase about similarity.</p>
<p>66A: [Zombie’s utterance of “braaaains,” essentially] is MOAN . When you’re sticking to an aesthetic of avoiding names everywhere, you have to get a little bit silly sometimes to make things interesting.</p>
<p>79A: [Streaming site?] is CREEK . One of my favorite clues today.</p>
<p>OTTER . It’s a 41D: [Animal that can be trained to lure fish into fishing nets] is. It’s a fishing tradition in Bangladesh</p>
<p>50D: [Cause for alarm in a restaurant?] is CHILI. As in, two-alarm chili, three-alarm chili, etc. That’s my favorite clue today.</p>
<p>Next week’s puzzle will be a special puzzle of sorts; it’s unfortunate I won’t be able to hand it out at the crossword tournament like I had planned to, but I hope you’ll enjoy it all the same.

<h3 id="our-favorite-crossword-clues-of-2019">&ldquo;Our Favorite Crossword Clues of 2019&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5abd243731a8d50df08d57dd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Crossword-Puzzle-Eustace.jpg" alt="img">
The New Yorker’s crossword puzzle family grew this year: in April, we introduced a second weekly puzzle, the Weekend Crossword, and added two new constructors—Erik Agard and Aimee Lucido—to our roster, alongside Patrick Berry, Kameron Austin Collins, Elizabeth C. Gorski, Natan Last, and Anna Shechtman. Last month, we revived an old favorite—you can now play a cryptic crossword every Sunday on newyorker.com—and this month, we’re continuing a recent tradition, counting down to the new year with seven days of holiday crosswords. Each morning, you’ll find a year-in-review puzzle with a different theme: literature (Tuesday), language (Wednesday), movies (Thursday), music (Friday), TV (Saturday), science and tech (Sunday), and news and politics (Monday).</p>
<p>In the video above, Anna and Erik look back on some of the words and phrases that defined 2019. Erik has a hunch that crosswords are going to take over the nation in 2020; we hope he’s right. In the meantime, we’re taking a look backward, rounding up some of the most memorable New Yorker crossword clues of the year. And, if you haven’t picked out a New Year’s resolution yet, we have a humble suggestion: do more crosswords. Happy holidays, and happy solving.</p>
<p>“Career advice that may be purely academic?”</p>
<p>A.: PUBLISHORPERISH</p>
<p>Liz was responsible for some of our favorite puns this year. Others that tickled us: “Hammer home?” for TOOLBOX, “Give a damn?” for CUSS, and “It’s no place for free spirits” for CASHBAR.</p>
<p>“Cosmetic trend involving serums and essences”</p>
<p>A.: KBEAUTY</p>
<p>A phenomenon that was overdue for its crossword début. Props to Kameron for working this tricky combination of letters into a grid—and for crossing it with SKIN and EYEMASK to give its corner a subtle cosmetics theme.</p>
<p>“Where you might meet your match”</p>
<p>A.: TINDERDATE</p>
<p>Anna’s grids are often sprinkled with neologisms (TWITTERRANT, MOMAGER, SNEAKERHEAD) clued in unexpected ways. (We had trouble choosing between this and her clue for DIGITALNATIVE: “One socialized with social media, say.”)</p>
<p>“Liverpool street whose signs are prone to tourist theft”</p>
<p>A.: PENNYLANE</p>
<p>There’s a whole story of pop culture and local politics wrapped up in this pithy clue.</p>
<p>Photograph by Peter Byrne / PA Images / Getty</p>
<p>“Eartha Kitt song often misattributed to Marilyn Monroe”</p>
<p>A.: SANTABABY</p>
<p>One of many instances of a white performer getting credit for a black musician’s song—and an example of how crosswords can help set the record straight.</p>
<p>“ ‘A Voice from the South’ author, 1892”</p>
<p>A.: ANNAJULIACOOPER</p>
<p>Speaking of welcome correctives, Erik’s puzzles often center—literally—women and people of color whose stories have been pushed to the margins (see also: MADAMCJWALKER). Revisionist history via the fifteen-by-fifteen grid.</p>
<p>“Cause of certain nocturnal emissions”</p>
<p>A.: SLEEPAPNEA</p>
<p>This one almost didn’t make it past the censors.</p>
<p>“Common malapropism used to mean ‘Nonetheless!’ ”</p>
<p>A.: IRREGARDLESS</p>
<p>A word doesn’t have to be dictionary-sanctioned to be “cross-worthy,” as Aimee has demonstrated more than once this year.</p>
<p>“Lil Nas X No. 1 hit with the lyric ‘I’m gonna ride ’til I can’t no more’ ”</p>
<p>A.: OLDTOWNROAD</p>
<p>When something becomes a full-blown cultural phenomenon overnight, there’s an informal race to get it into a puzzle—and Natan frequently wins.</p>
<p>“Chicago district named for the intersection of three streets”</p>
<p>A.: SIXCORNERS</p>
<p>A Patrick trademark: clues that at first look like trivia, but then reveal themselves to be tests of lateral thinking—and, in the process, go from hopelessly obscure to deeply satisfying.</p>
<p>“Animal named for the color of its fur and for its natural habitat”</p>
<p>A.: SANDCAT</p>
<p>Many people do crosswords to relax; what’s more soothing than a sand cat?</p>
<p>Photograph by Darren Green / Alamy</p>
<p>“Butler did it”</p>
<p>A.: QUEERTHEORY</p>
<p>Perfection. Bonus fact: there’s actually a character named Judith Butler in an Agatha Christie novel. (She’s not the murderer; for once—spoiler alert—the landscaper did it.)</p>
<p>“ ‘Sorry if you were offended,’ for one”</p>
<p>A.: NONAPOLOGY</p>
<p>Non-apologies have been around since the “Apology of Socrates,” at least, but they feel omnipresent in the Twitter age. Sometimes crosswords remind you that it’s useful to have names for things.

<h3 id="solution-to-evan-birnholzs-feb-9-post-magazine-crossword-twist-endings">&ldquo;Solution to Evan Birnholz’s Feb. 9 Post Magazine crossword, “Twist Endings”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PU7Q645VQFG4TNBRD65ASAKXTA.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
I’m guessing the most out-there answer for the bulk of solvers is PORT OF HUALIEN. Why would I pick a geographic location that specific and perhaps unknown to many American solvers? It may take a bit of film knowledge to get the first aha moment, but do you see a movie title hiding in there? It’s right at the end of each theme answer, and you can confirm it by the parenthetical year that the movie was released:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>SHREDDED WHEAT &ndash;&gt; HEAT, a 1995 film starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Val Kilmer.</p>
<p>BOX OFFICE SMASH &ndash;&gt; MASH, from 1970.</p>
<p>FOR THE NONCE &ndash;&gt; ONCE, from 2007. This is the original movie that the award-winning Broadway musical is based on.</p>
<p>DODGE DURANGO &ndash;&gt; RANGO, from 2011.</p>
<p>BATTLE SCARS &ndash;&gt; CARS, from 2006.</p>
<p>ETHICAL DILEMMA &ndash;&gt; EMMA, from 1996. If this puzzle had come out two weeks later, I could have made the parenthetical year 2020</p>
<p>PORT OF HUALIEN &ndash;&gt; ALIEN, from 1979.</p>
<p>So, now we’ve got the movies that appear at the ends of the theme entries, but we’re not done yet. Two of the films (HEAT and EMMA) are from the 1990s, so it wouldn’t make sense if one of them was the answer and the other one wasn’t. Now you have to think about the other word in the title, “Twist.” That’s a common signal in puzzles (especially cryptic crosswords) for anagrams. The second aha is to find that each title has been anagrammed to another word in the grid:</p>
<p>HEAT &ndash;&gt; T HEA at 91D: [“Queer as Folk” actress Gill]</p>
<p>MASH &ndash;&gt; H AMS at 30A: [Melodramatic sorts]</p>
<p>ONCE &ndash;&gt; E CON at 25D: [Specialty in demand, briefly?].</p>
<p>RANGO &ndash;&gt; G ROAN at 70A: [Pained utterance].</p>
<p>CARS &ndash;&gt; A RCS at 119A: [Plot trajectories].</p>
<p>EMMA &ndash;&gt; M AME at 77A: [Musical auntie].</p>
<p>ALIEN &ndash;&gt; E LIÁN at 116A: [González in 2000 headlines].</p>
<p>The final step is to take the first letters of those anagrammed words, match them up in thematic order, and you spell out THE GAME , a 1997 film starring Michael Douglas.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why I picked THE GAME as the meta answer, it’s for a few reasons:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a memorable twist ending of its own, so it’s appropriate on that level. You can read about its twist here if you don’t plan on watching the movie (scroll down to No. 19), but I’d recommend a viewing; I saw it many years ago and remember thinking it was clever.</li>
</ol>
<p>AD</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Though there are other movies out there with more well-known twist endings (like PSYCHO or THE SIXTH SENSE), THE GAME felt like the title with the most natural connection to puzzles, and the film itself is a puzzle-solving mystery of sorts, though you don’t have to have seen it to solve the meta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letters of THE GAME worked out nicely for the way I wanted to execute the meta, at least for the most part. I needed one-word movie titles that could fit at the end of unrelated phrases and could also anagram to other words beginning with specific letters. It was surprisingly difficult to find ones that worked for the letters T and E. That’s why I ran with PORT OF HUALIEN to hide ALIEN and THEA to anagram HEAT.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>AD</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I still liked the idea enough to make the meta before someone else did. You never know what other meta constructors like Matt Gaffney, Peter Gordon or Mike Shenk are thinking!</li>
</ol>
<p>AD

<h3 id="can-a-crossword-be-racist">&ldquo;Can a crossword be racist?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-74854287.jpg" alt="img">
When Hannah Yang complained about a racist clue in the daily paper, she was reminded of the prevalence of casual racism in New Zealand.</p>
<p>I’d never seen a racist clue before.</p>
<p>It appeared one morning when I sat down in our break room to look at the day’s cryptic crossword (yes, this is a thing we do at our workplace, don’t judge us). There it was, right up the top. Seven across: a racist clue.</p>
<p>For context, cryptic clues (as the name might suggest) aren’t to be read literally. They’re cryptic in the sense that they contain hidden instructions (such as “solve this anagram”) which lead you to the correct answer. Nevertheless, “Chink, i.e. Chinese leader concerned with evildoing” is a plainly racist clue, regardless of what other meanings it is also capable of supporting.</p>
<p>So, finding the offending clue, well, offensive, I sent a message to the Dominion Post and suggested that an apology in the next issue might be appropriate. The response was sadly predictable. While the paper didn’t “think racism – in any form – is acceptable”, it also thought this clue was just “ a very unfortunate combination of words rather than an outbreak of racism”. “Chink” was a synonym for the clue’s answer, “crevice”, was the explanation given by the puzzle company, which provides crossword puzzles to all the Stuff papers. It wasn’t meant to be racist. The Dominion Post wouldn’t be publishing an apology.</p>
<p>But racism doesn’t disappear for lack of intent. A clue like “chink” is racist even if the newspaper didn’t intend to be racist because the word “chink” within close proximity of the word “Chinese” carries a distinct, offensive meaning regardless of cryptic context. So, it’s not an unfortunate combination of words rather than racism; it’s an unfortunate combination of words and racism.</p>
<p>The belief that accidental racism can’t happen is part of why casual racism is so insidious: people don’t think it’s a problem, so it persists precisely because of this. In the meantime, statements like “we don’t think racism is acceptable” are stripped of their meaning. Asserting zero tolerance for racism doesn’t count for much if your very definition of “racism – in any form” excludes self-evident forms of racism.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility for a racist clue appearing in your paper doesn’t mean you admit the paper is racist. It’s a matter of being grown-up, acknowledging harm was caused, and rectifying that harm by making it clear where your organisation stands on the issue. And reasonable people will give you credit for that.</p>
<p>But the Dominion Post was not moved. It told me that while the Post has a “proud record of correcting and/or apologising”, there wouldn’t be one on this occasion. My complaint was the only one they’d received, it said, and it would be “counter-productive” to apologise as it would “only get more people looking for it”.</p>
<p>As the Human Rights Commission’s Give Nothing to Racism campaign underlines, however, most people who experience racism don’t complain. The fact that this clue might otherwise have been left undiscussed doesn’t diminish the problem – it’s part of the problem.</p>
<p>As for being counter-productive, a friend of mine made the excellent point that drawing attention to the issue is the point of an apology. “Casual racism needs to be corrected publicly so people learn. [Otherwise] casual racism slips past and, like you said, is more insidious,” they said.</p>
<p>So when it comes to racism, we have a collective duty as a society.</p>
<p>If we’ve had experiences, we should share them, and share them civilly. Well-meaning people won’t realise why it’s problematic to tell a person of Asian appearance “Your English is very good!” unless we talk about it. Honest and kind-hearted people won’t know that they unintentionally but routinely ignore the one non-white person in the group, unless we talk about it. Ordinary and empathetic people, through no fault of their own, simply won’t begin to understand how paralysing it can be when you can’t tell anymore whether that person who didn’t look at you in the meeting was racist or if you’re just over-thinking it – unless we talk about it.</p>
<p>And all this we have to talk about civilly, because no one will listen to what we say if they sense even a whiff of anger.</p>
<p>Conversely, if we ever find ourselves listening, then we should bravely and humbly acknowledge that experience and seek to learn from it. I say “bravely” because I realise that doing so is difficult. No one wants to be told that something they did was racist. Certainly nobody wants to be told that they are racist. And so, in our selfish desire to be right and to convince ourselves that we were right all along, we confuse the calling out of racism with a personal attack on our character.</p>
<p>Finally, if we ever find ourselves bystanders, then we should always call out racism for what it is, because every unintentionally prejudiced statement that goes uncorrected, every misguided and ignorant comment swept under the rug, is another contributor to the collective, subconscious mindset that tells us “Chink, i.e. Chinese leader concerned with evildoing” is not racist.</p>
<p>And I still have no idea what the hell “concerned with evildoing” has to do with “crevice”.</p>
<p>Update (17/10/19): I am happy to say that since the publication of this article, the Dominion Post has apologised to me, assured me that an apology will be printed in the next day’s paper, and promised to learn from this. This is a very heartening response, and I hope it demonstrates the power of frank and open dialogue around difficult issues such as racism.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — I started this column intending to write just a brief one, as we are most likely all thinking about other things, but it turned into a much longer piece. I will try to make this as coherent as possible.</p>
<p>It has been difficult for me to concentrate on work because of worries about friends and family as we see more people affected by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>How are you all doing? It’s important to check in with each other during a time of stress and social distancing, and please don’t forget to touch base with those who might not have online social networks of support and comfort. Call a neighbor who might be alone and make sure they have what they need. Listen quietly to those who need to talk about their fears, without negating them. Be kind to yourself and to each other.</p>
<p>“Self-care” is a term that gets bandied around a lot, but this is a good time to turn to the activities that provide comfort and keep you in a healthy mind-set. I find myself knitting and crocheting a lot more these days, because I find it to be meditative and relaxing. I’m also reading books, instead of obsessively refreshing the news apps on my phone (trust that any information you need will get to you no matter what. It’s hard to avoid).
