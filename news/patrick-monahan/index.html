<p>In June last year, I went to compete in the Duluth Marathon in Minnesota in the US. The route runs along Lake Superior and into the city of Duluth. It’s known as a fast course, so I was going there to beat my personal best (the Irish record, 1:29:03). I didn’t care about where I placed. I could have come last, but I wanted to beat that PB. To achieve that, I needed conditions to be good. I arrived there two days before the race and the weather forecast for race day was crap. Just terrible.</p>
<p>Because its located on the lake the weather can change quite quickly, and by the time we got to the start line, conditions were perfect.</p>
<p>In wheelchair racing, the first 5km is mental. You want to drop as many racers as possible, get out of the traffic, stay in the leading pack.</p>
<p>We got away quick. Myself and one of the top Americans, Aaron Pike led the race early on. We went through 10km in something like 17 minutes. I thought there was something wrong with my Garmin. I knew we were going fast, but I’d never gone that fast. We went through the half marathon in under 40 minutes. The second half of the race got tougher.</p>
<p>Aaron pulled away a bit at 20 miles, but I knew I was on for a massive PB. The last few miles got a bit sketchy. There is a race that starts before us and because we were so quick, we started to run into traffic with other runners and walkers on a narrow stretch. I had to ease off, it wasn’t worth the risk of crashing for the sake of 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be one for negative thinking in a race but as I pushed through those last couple of miles I thought, “It would be just my luck now to pop a tyre.” The wheels are worth about €1000 each.

<p>The song titled “Sing Together” features members of the USAF Heritage of America Band singing along, some with musical instruments, some carrying notes with the song’s lyrics as Train’s Patrick Monahan leads.</p>

<p>“In many places our civilian and military medical professionals are working side by side. Both bands are happy to show their support and share this song with everyone.”</p>
<p>The video ended with members from USAF Heritage of America Band, 633d Medical Group and Sentara Healthcare holding signs with the words “Thank You” on them.</p>

Chris, Joanne, Arianna, Christopher and Nick Rubano pose in celebration of Arianna&rsquo;s quarantine Sweet 16.</p>
<p>STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. &ndash; A novel coronavirus pandemic did not stop family and friends from surprising Arianna Rubano with a joyous drive-by on her Sweet 16 on Sunday, May 3.</p>
<p>The St. Joseph Hill Academy sophomore was delighted with the caravan of loved ones riding down her Westerleigh street, waving birthday posters and offering gifts and balloons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The weeks before my birthday, I was anxious that I wouldn’t be able to celebrate with my family and friends, but I was surprised with a great birthday drive-by from my mom, dad and my brothers Christopher, and Nick,&rdquo; said Arianna. &ldquo;I will never forget the great time I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arianna&rsquo;s mom, Joanne Rubano, was concerned she and her husband, Chris Rubano, would not be able to celebrate their only daughter&rsquo;s Sweet 16, as the date grew closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it became apparent that we couldn&rsquo;t be with family and friends in the way we&rsquo;d always envisioned for Arianna, we reached out to everyone and the response was overwhelming,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are confident that given the unique circumstances that Arianna was given, she still made memories to last a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
