<p>Stephan Lewandowsky studies the way people think, and in particular, why they engage in conspiracy theories. So when the cognitive scientist from England’s University of Bristol observes wild speculation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, he sees how it fits into the historical pattern of misinformation and fake news.</p>
<p>I recently wrote about the viral video “Plandemic” as an investigative reporter assessing the range of unsubstantiated COVID-19 allegations put forth by a controversial researcher. Lewandowsky comes at the video and others like it from a science-based perspective. He is one of the authors of “The Conspiracy Theory Handbook,” which explains the traits of conspiratorial thinking.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be proliferating, and some may even be taking root. So I asked Lewandowsky to share how he identifies and understands them, and what we can do to sort through the confusion. The interview has been condensed for clarity and length.</p>
<p>What’s the difference between a real conspiracy and a conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>A real conspiracy actually exists, and it is usually uncovered by journalists, whistleblowers, document dumps from a corporation or government, or it’s discovered by a government agency. The Volkswagen emissions scandal, for example, was discovered by conventional ways when some engineers discovered an anomaly in a report. It was all mundane — normal people having normal observations based on data. They said, “Hang on, something’s funny here,” and then it unraveled. The same is true for the Iran-contra scandal. That broke via a newspaper in Lebanon. True conspiracies are often uncovered through the media. In Watergate, it was journalists not taking “no” for an answer.</p>
<p>A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is discussed at length on the internet by people who are not bona fide journalists or government officials or whistleblowers in an organization or investigative committees of regulators. They’re completely independent sources, individuals who self-nominate and put themselves forward as being in possession of the truth. In principle, that could be true. But then if you look at the way these people think and talk and communicate, you discover their cognition is different from what I would call conventional cognition.</p>
<p>What are some differences between conventional and conspiratorial thinking?</p>
<p>You can start with healthy skepticism vs. overriding suspicion. As a scientist, I’m obviously skeptical. I’m questioning anything people say. I look at my own data and other people’s data with a skeptical eye. But after skeptics have been skeptical, they are quite capable of accepting evidence. Once something has withstood scrutiny, you accept it. Otherwise you’re in a state of complete nihilism and you can’t believe anything.</p>
<p>That crucial second step of acceptance is absent in conspiracy theorists. That is where conspiracy theorists are different. Their skepticism is a bottomless, never-ending pit of skepticism about anything related to the official account. And that skepticism is accompanied by extreme gullibility to anything related to the conspiracy. It’s an imbalance between skepticism for anything an official may say and complete gullibility for something some random dude on the internet will tweet out. It’s that imbalance that differentiates conspiracy thinking from standard cognition.</p>
<p>Conspiracy thinking is immune to evidence. In the “Plandemic” video, the absence of evidence is twisted to be seen to be as evidence for the theory. They say the cover-up is so perfect that you will never find out about it. That’s the opposite of rational thinking. Usually when you think of a hypothesis, you think of the evidence. And if there’s zero evidence, you give it up or say there is no evidence for it.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists may also simultaneously believe things that are contradictory. In the “Plandemic” video, for example, they say COVID-19 both came from a Wuhan lab and that we’re all infected with the disease from vaccinations. They’re making both claims, and they don’t hang together.</p>
<p>More generally, conspiracy theorists show this contradictory thinking by presenting themselves as both victims and heroes. They see themselves as these heroes in possession of the truth. But they also see themselves as victims. They feel they are being persecuted by this evil establishment or the deep state or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Why do you think some conspiracy theories are so popular?</p>
<p>Some people find comfort in resorting to a conspiracy theory whenever they have a sense of a loss of control or they’re confronted with a major adverse event that no one has control over. So every time there’s a mass shooting in the U.S., I can guarantee you ahead of time that there will be a conspiracy theory about it.</p>
<p>So you would expect conspiracy theories related to the pandemic. That doesn’t make them any less harmful. Here in the United Kingdom, people are burning 5G cell towers because of this extreme idea that 5G has something to do with causing COVID-19. More than 70 cell towers have gone up in flames because of this conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Is conspiracy thinking at an all time high?</p>
<p>Historical records show that there were rampant conspiracy theories going on in the Middle Ages when the plague hit Europe. It was anti-Semitism at the time. That tends to be part and parcel of pandemics. People engage in conspiracies that involve some sort of “othering” of people. During previous pandemics, people chased doctors down the street because they thought they were responsible for the pandemic. In Europe, now a lot of antagonism is directed at Asians, because the pandemic started in China. The internet is helping the spread of conspiracy theories. It’s much easier now than it was 30 years ago. But it’s difficult to say we have more now.</p>
<p>Are conservatives or liberals any more likely to engage in conspiracy thinking?</p>
<p>There is a lot of research on this and political conspiracy theories tend to be most associated with extreme political views, on the right or the left. But if you quantify it, you frequently find more on the right than the left.</p>
<p>How do we talk to the conspiracy theorists in our lives?</p>
<p>It’s extremely difficult. In terms of strategy, the best people to talk to are people who are not conspiracy theorists. The vast majority of people are grateful for the debunking and responsive to it. That should be your target of communication if you have a choice. The hardcore conspiracy theorists are unlikely to change their minds. They will take what you say and display considerable ingenuity in twisting it and using it against you. On Twitter, I block them immediately because I’m concerned about my ability to have a rational conversation and I don’t want others to violate that right.</p>
<p>How do we prevent the spread of conspiracy theories?</p>
<p>By trying to inoculate the public against them. Telling the public ahead of time: Look, there are people who believe these conspiracy theories. They invent this stuff. When they invent it they exhibit these characteristics of misguided cognition. You can go through the traits we mention in our handbook, like incoherence, immunity to evidence, overriding suspicion and connecting random dots into a pattern. The best thing to do is tell the public how they can spot conspiracy theories and how they can protect themselves.</p>
<p>Are you aware of any cases where the conspiracy theorists turned out to be right?</p>
<p>There are tens of thousands of conspiracy theories out there, so I haven’t checked them all. But if you look at actual conspiracies, Volkswagen, Iran-contra, Watergate — the real conspiracies — they were uncovered by conventional cognition. There weren’t people there who took the absence of evidence to be evidence for the theory, or who reinterpreted contrary evidence to somehow support their theory. I’m not aware of any conspiracy theorists discovering something where they turn out to be correct.</p>

<p><img src="https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_17334589263505-1522503304.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800" alt="img">
Just as was true when the Mueller investigation closed without a single American being charged with criminally conspiring with Russia over the 2016 election, Wednesday’s issuance of the long-waited report from the Department of Justice’s Inspector General reveals that years of major claims and narratives from the U.S. media were utter frauds. Before evaluating the media component of this scandal, the FBI’s gross abuse of its power – its serial deceit – is so grave and manifest that it requires little effort to demonstrate it. In sum, the IG Report documents multiple instances in which the FBI – in order to convince a FISA court to allow it spy on former Trump campaign operative Carter Page during the 2016 election – manipulated documents, concealed crucial exonerating evidence, and touted what it knew were unreliable if not outright false claims. If you don’t consider FBI lying, concealment of evidence, and manipulation of documents in order to spy on a U.S. citizen in the middle of a presidential campaign to be a major scandal, what is? But none of this is aberrational: the FBI still has its headquarters in a building named after J. Edgar Hoover – who constantly blackmailed elected officials with dossiers and tried to blackmail Martin Luther King into killing himself – because that’s what these security state agencies are. They are out-of-control, virtually unlimited police state factions that lie, abuse their spying and law enforcement powers, and subvert democracy and civic and political freedoms as a matter of course. In this case, no rational person should allow standard partisan bickering to distort or hide this severe FBI corruption. The IG Report leaves no doubt about it. It’s brimming with proof of FBI subterfuge and deceit, all in service of persuading a FISA court of something that was not true: that U.S. citizen and former Trump campaign official Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and therefore needed to have his communications surveilled.</p>
<p>Just a few excerpts from the report should suffice to end any debate for rational persons about how damning it is. The focus of the first part of the IG Report was on the warrants obtained by the DOJ, at the behest of the FBI, to spy on Carter Page on the grounds that there was probable cause to believe he was an agent of the Russian government. That Page was a Kremlin agent was a widely disseminated media claim – typically asserted as fact even though it had no evidence. As a result of this media narrative, the Mueller investigation examined these widespread accusations yet concluded that “the investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.” The IG Report went much further, documenting a multitude of lies and misrepresentations by the FBI to deceive the FISA court into believing that probable cause existed to believe Page was a Kremlin agent. The first FISA warrant to spy on Page was obtained during the 2016 election, after Page had left the Trump campaign but weeks before the election was to be held. About the warrant application submitted regarding Page, the IG Report, in its own words, “found that FBI personnel fell far short of the requirement in FBI policy that they ensure that all factual statements in a FISA application are ‘scrupulously accurate.'” Specifically, “we identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed.” It’s vital to reiterate this because of its gravity: we identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed.</p>
<p>The specifics cited by the IG Report are even more damning. Specifically, “based upon the information known to the FBI in October 2016, the first application contained [] seven significant inaccuracies and omissions.” Among those “significant inaccuracies and omissions”: the FBI concealed that Page had been working with the CIA in connection with his dealings with Russia and had notified CIA case managers of at least some of those contacts after he was “approved as an ‘operational contact&rsquo;” with Russia; the FBI lied about both the timing and substance of Page’s relationship with the CIA; vastly overstated the value and corroboration of Steele’s prior work for the U.S. Government to make him appear more credible than he was; and concealed from the court serious reasons to doubt the reliability of Steele’s key source. Moreover, the FBI’s heavy reliance on the Steele Dossier to obtain the FISA warrant – a fact that many leading national security reporters spent two years denying occurred – was particularly concerning because, as the IG Report put it, “we found that the FBI did not have information corroborating the specific allegations against Carter Page in Steele’s reporting when it relied upon his reports in the first FISA application or subsequent renewal applications.” To spy on a U.S. citizen in the middle of an election, one who had just been working with one of the two major presidential campaigns, the FBI touted a gossipy, unverified, unreliable rag that it had no reason to believe and every reason to distrust, but it hid all of that from the FISA court, which it knew needed to believe that the Steele Dossier was something it was not if it were to give the FBI the spying authorization it wanted. In 2017, the FBI decided to seek reauthorization of the FISA warrant to continue to spy on Page, and sought and obtained it three times: in January, April and June, 2017. Not only, according to the IG Report, did the FBI repeat all of those “seven significant inaccuracies and omission,” but added ten additional major inaccuracies. As the Report put it: “In addition to repeating the seven significant errors contained in the first FISA application and outlined above, we identified 10 additional significant errors in the three renewal applications, based upon information known to the FBI after the first application and before one or more of the renewals.” Among the most significant new acts of deceit was that the FBI “omitted the fact that Steele’s Primary Subsource, who the FBI found credible, had made statements in January 2017 raising significant questions about the reliability of allegations included in the FISA applications, including, for example, that he/she did not recall any discussion with Person 1 concerning Wikileaks and there was ‘nothing bad’ about the communications between the Kremlin and the Trump team, and that he/she did not report to Steele in July 2016 that Page had met with Sechin.” In other words, Steele’s own key source told the FBI that Steele was lying about what the source said: an obviously critical fact that the FBI simply concealed from the FISA court because it knew how devastating that would be to being able to continue to spy on Page. As the Report put it, “among the most serious of the 10 additional errors we found in the renewal applications was the FBI’s failure to advise [DOJ] or the court of the inconsistences, described in detail in Chapter Six, between Steele and his Primary Sub-source on the reporting relied upon in the FISA applications.” The IG Report also found that the FBI hid key information from the court about Steele’s motives: for instance, it “omitted information obtained from [Bruce] Ohr about Steele and his election reporting, including that (1) Steele’s reporting was going to Clinton’s presidential campaign and others, (2) [Fusion GPS’s Glenn] Simpson was paying Steele to discuss his reporting with the media, and (3) Steele was “desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the U.S. President.” If it does not bother you to learn that the FBI repeatedly and deliberately deceived the FISA court into granting it permission to spy on a U.S. citizen in the middle of a presidential campaign, then it is virtually certain that you are either someone with no principles, someone who cares only about partisan advantage and nothing about basic civil liberties and the rule of law, or both. There is simply no way for anyone of good faith to read this IG Report and reach any conclusion other than that this is yet another instance of the FBI abusing its power in severe ways to subvert and undermine U.S. democracy. If you don’t care about that, what do you care about? * * * * * But the revelations of the IG Report are not merely a massive FBI scandal. They are also a massive media scandal, because they reveal that so much of what the U.S. media has authoritatively claimed about all of these matters for more than two years is completely false. Ever since Trump’s inauguration, a handful of commentators and journalists – I’m included among them – have been sounding the alarm about the highly dangerous trend of news outlets not merely repeating the mistake of the Iraq War by blindly relying on the claims of security state agents but, far worse, now employing them in their newsrooms to shape the news. As Politico’s media writer Jack Shafer wrote in 2018, in an article entitled “The Spies Who Came Into the TV Studio”: In the old days, America’s top spies would complete their tenures at the CIA or one of the other Washington puzzle palaces and segue to more ordinary pursuits. Some wrote their memoirs. One ran for president. Another died a few months after surrendering his post. But today’s national-security establishment retiree has a different game plan. After so many years of brawling in the shadows, he yearns for a second, lucrative career in the public eye. He takes a crash course in speaking in soundbites, refreshes his wardrobe and signs a TV news contract. Then, several times a week, waits for a network limousine to shuttle him to the broadcast news studios where, after a light dusting of foundation and a spritz of hairspray, he takes a supporting role in the anchors’ nighttime shows. . . . [T]he downside of outsourcing national security coverage to the TV spies is obvious. They aren’t in the business of breaking news or uncovering secrets. Their first loyalty—and this is no slam—is to the agency from which they hail. Imagine a TV network covering the auto industry through the eyes of dozens of paid former auto executives and you begin to appreciate the current peculiarities. In a perfect television world, the networks would retire the retired spooks from their payrolls and reallocate those sums to the hiring of independent reporters to cover the national security beat. Let the TV spies become unpaid anonymous sources because when you get down to it, TV spies don’t want to make news—they just want to talk about it. It’s long been the case that CIA, FBI and NSA operatives tried to infiltrate and shape domestic news, but they at least had the decency to do it clandestinely. In 2008, the New York Times’ David Barstow won the Pulitzer Prize for exposing a secret Pentagon program in which retired Generals and other security state agents would get hired as commentators and analysts and then – unbeknownst to their networks – coordinate their messaging to ensure that domestic news was being shaped by the propaganda of the military and intelligence communities. But now it’s all out in the open. It’s virtually impossible to turn on MSNBC or CNN without being bombarded with former Generals, CIA operatives, FBI agents and NSA officials who now work for those networks as commentators and, increasingly, as reporters.</p>

<p>The past three years of “Russiagate” reporting – for which U.S. journalists have lavished themselves with Pulitzers and other prizes despite a multitude of embarrassing and dangerous errors about the Grave Russian Threat – has relied almost exclusively on anonymous, uncorroborated claims from Deep State operatives (and yes, that’s a term that fully applies to the U.S.). The few exceptions are when these networks feature former high-level security state operatives on camera to spread their false propaganda, as in this enduringly humiliating instance:</p>

<p>All of this has meant that U.S. discourse on these national security questions is shaped almost entirely by the very agencies that are trained to lie: the CIA, the NSA, the Pentagon, the FBI. And their lying has been highly effective. For years, we were told by the nation’s leading national security reporters something that was blatantly false: that the FBI’s warrants to spy on Carter Page were not based on the Steele Dossier. GOP Congressman Devin Nunes was widely vilified and mocked by the super-smart DC national security reporters for issuing a report claiming that this was the case. The Nunes memo in essence claimed what the IG Report has corroborated: that embedded within the FBI’s efforts to obtain FISA court authorization to spy on Carter Page was a series of misrepresentations, falsehoods and concealment of key evidence:</p>
<p>As the Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi – one of the few left/liberal journalists with the courage and integrity to dissent from the DNC/MSNBC script on these issues – put it in a detailed article: “Democrats are not going to want to hear this, since conventional wisdom says former House Intelligence chief Devin Nunes is a conspiratorial evildoer, but the Horowitz report ratifies the major claims of the infamous ‘Nunes memo.’” That the Page warrant was based on the Steele Dossier was something that the media servants of the FBI and CIA rushed to deny. Did they have any evidence for those denials? That would be hard to believe, given that the FISA warrant applications are highly classified. It seems far more likely that – as usual – they were just repeating what the FBI and CIA (and the pathologically dishonest Rep. Adam Schiff) told them to say, like the good and loyal puppets that they are. But either way, what they kept telling the public – in highly definitive tones – was completely false, as we now know from the IG Report:</p>
<p>Yes. I am telling you the dossier was not used as the basis for a FISA warrant on Carter Page. — Shane Harris (@shaneharris) January 12, 2018</p>
<p>New: Two Democratic members of House Intel tell me McCabe did not say dossier was basis of FISA warrant, disputing central claim of #NunesMemo — Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) February 2, 2018</p>
<p>Over and over, the IG Report makes clear that, contrary to these denials, the Steele Dossier was indeed crucial to the Page eavesdropping warrant. “We determined that the Crossfire Hurricane team’s receipt of Steele’s election reporting on September 19, 2016 played a central and essential role in the FBI’s and Department’s decision to seek the FISA order,” the IG Report explained. A central and essential role. It added: “in support of the fourth element in the FISA application-Carter Page’s alleged coordination with the Russian government on 2016 U.S. presidential election activities, the application relied entirely on the following information from Steele Reports 80, 94, 95, and 102.” Just compare the pompous denials from so many U.S. national security reporters at the nation’s leading news outlets – that the Page warrant was not based on the Steele Dossier – to the actual truth that we now know: “in support of the fourth element in the FISA application-Carter Page’s alleged coordination with the Russian government on 2016 U.S. presidential election activities, the application relied entirely on the following information from Steele Reports 80, 94, 95, and 102″ (emphasis added). Indeed, it was the Steele Dossier that led FBI leadership, including Director James Comey and Deputy Diretor Andrew McCabe, to approve the warrant application in the first place despite concerns raised by other agents that the information was unreliable. Explains the IG Report: FBI leadership supported relying on Steele’s reporting to seek a FISA order on Page after being advised of, and giving consideration to, concerns expressed by Stuart Evans, then NSD’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General with oversight responsibility over QI, that Steele may have been hired by someone associated with presidential candidate Clinton or the DNC, and that the foreign intelligence to be collected through the FISA order would probably not be worth the ‘risk’ of being criticized later for collecting communications of someone (Carter Page) who was “politically sensitive.” The narrative manufactured by the security state agencies and laundered by their reliable media servants about these critical matters was a sham, a fraud, a lie. Yet again, U.S. discourse was subsumed by propaganda because the U.S. media and key parts of the security state have decided that subverting the Trump presidency is of such a high priority – that their political judgment outweighs the results of the election – that everything, including outright lying even to courts let alone the public, is justified because the ends are so noble. As Taibbi put it: “No matter what people think the political meaning of the Horowitz report might be, reporters who read it will know: Anybody who touched this nonsense in print should be embarrassed.” No matter how dangerous you believe the Trump presidency to be, this is a grave threat to the pillars of U.S. democracy, a free press, an informed citizenry and the rule of law. * * * * * Underlying all of this is another major lie spun over the last three years by the newly-minted media stars and liberal icons from the security state agencies. Ever since the Snowden reporting – indeed, prior to that, when the New York Times’ Eric Lichtblau and Jim Risen (now with the Intercept) revealed in 2005 that the Bush-era NSA was illegally spying on U.S. citizens without the warrants required by law – it was widely understood that the FISA process was a rubber-stamping joke, an illusory safeguard that, in reality, offered no real limits on the ability of the U.S. Government to spy on its own citizens. Back in 2013 at the Guardian, I wrote a long article, based on Snowden documents, revealing what an empty sham this process was.

One day last November, Mitch Japczyk, an administrator at an Illinois staffing agency, was called upon to help solve an office mystery. A handful of his co-workers were huddled around the office printer, where a one-page document had just printed itself out, unprompted. Nobody in the office knew what it meant.</p>
<p>“ATTENTION!” the document began. “PewDiePie is in trouble and he needs your help to defeat T-Series!” It went on to explain that PewDiePie, a 29-year-old Swedish YouTube personality, was in danger of being overtaken as the platform’s most popular channel by T-Series, an Indian music label and Bollywood production studio. In order to prevent this from happening, the author recommended five steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unsubscribe from T-Series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subscribe to PewDiePie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share awareness to this issue. #SavePewDiePie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell everyone you know. Seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BROFIST!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Japczyk, now 33, spends more time on YouTube than many of his colleagues and was able to explain the broad strokes: PewDiePie (rhymes with “cutie pie”; real name: Felix Kjellberg) was a YouTube megacelebrity with a group of hard-core fans, known as the Bro Army, who often went to extreme lengths to show their support. But it was only when Japczyk got back to his computer that he realized the scale of the operation. A hacker was claiming responsibility for finding a set of 50,000 printers all over the world with unsecured network connections, taking them over and using them to print these fliers.</p>
<p>The printer hack wasn’t an isolated incident. For months, tributes to PewDiePie had been popping up all over the world. Billboards and fliers appeared in India, Bangladesh and Times Square. Early this year, hundreds of Estonian fans held a parade in the nation’s capital city, chanting his name and holding signs that said “Sub 2 Pewds.” Someone chalked “Subscribe to PewDiePie” on a World War II memorial in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Like Japczyk’s colleagues at the staffing agency, many people who witnessed these events most likely wrote them off as dumb stunts or random emanations from some Gen Z media universe they weren’t plugged into — which, of course, they were. But as the “Subscribe to PewDiePie” movement grew, its meaning got blurrier. Some people were cheering for PewDiePie because they liked his videos. Other people saw him as the flag-bearer of an older, weirder internet culture that was being steamrollered by bland corporate interests and needed to be defended. And a few had much darker motives.</p>
<p>On March 15, a white nationalist in Christchurch, New Zealand, said, “Remember, lads, subscribe to PewDiePie” on his Facebook live stream, just before going on a shooting rampage, killing dozens of worshipers inside two mosques. A few weeks later, another violent white nationalist cited PewDiePie, this time in writing. In his manifesto, the suspect — accused of killing one woman and injuring three others at a synagogue in Poway, Calif. — even claimed that the YouTuber aided in the plot. “I had the help of a man named Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg,” wrote the shooting suspect, who, like the Christchurch suspect, has pleaded not guilty. “He was kind enough to plan and fund this whole operation — the sly bastard.”</p>
<p>Just to be abundantly clear: As far as we know, these were both sick jokes. Kjellberg has no connection to either man, and there is zero evidence that their deeds were actually inspired by him. But he was not a randomly chosen target either. For years, Kjellberg has been trying, fairly unsuccessfully, to shed a reputation as a far-right sympathizer. Partly, that’s because a few years ago, he made some Holocaust jokes on his channel, which led to a nuclear-grade backlash. And partly, it’s because Kjellberg responded to being called out for those jokes, and other offensive statements, the way a reactionary might: by mocking his critics, casting himself as the victim of a media smear campaign and refusing to back down.</p>
<p>Modern right-wing extremism is wrapped in so much irony that it’s hard to know what motivates any particular adherent. The suspects in the shootings in Christchurch and Poway might have been casually trolling PewDiePie by mentioning him in the context of mass murder — knowing that it would set off a media frenzy and stall his campaign to rehabilitate his image. They might have been trying to bait reporters into wrongly blaming PewDiePie for the killings. (Which would make those reporters look gullible and out of touch, thereby proving that PewDiePie was right about the media.) They might have just been chaos-loving nihilists. A lot of internet culture exists in this frustrating quantum state — things are either total jokes or total nonjokes, depending on their context and your vantage point.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the Poway shooting, Kjellberg’s publicist called me. Kjellberg hadn’t given an interview in years — a guy with millions of YouTube subscribers has little need for reporters — but in the wake of the shootings, I had asked, and he agreed to talk. People were accusing him of supporting white nationalism again, and he wanted to explain why they were mistaken. I flew to Brighton, the seaside town in Britain where Kjellberg has lived since 2013, and we met at an Airbnb near his house. He showed up a few minutes late, popping out his earbuds to greet me.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” he said.</p>
<p>“Here we are,” I agreed.</p>
<p>In his YouTube videos, Kjellberg is a spring-loaded ball of manic energy — he screams, he curses, he cracks himself up. But in person, he was withdrawn and polite, with the stiff body language of a job applicant. He seemed eager to make a good impression, or at least to appear nonthreatening.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to have this opportunity,” he said unconvincingly.</p>
<p>One crucial thing to understand about YouTube is that there are really two of them. The first YouTube is the YouTube that everyone knows — the vast reference library filled with sports highlights, music videos and old Comedy Central roasts. But there’s a second YouTube inside that one. It is a self-contained universe with its own values and customs, its own incentive structures and market dynamics and its own fully developed celebrity culture that includes gamers, beauty vloggers, musicians, D.I.Y.ers, political commentators, artists and pranksters. The biggest of these personalities have millions of subscribers and Oprah-level influence over their fandoms. Many Inner YouTubers never watch TV and develop elaborate parasocial bonds with their favorite creators. For people who frequent Inner YouTube — generally people under 25, along with some older people with abundant free time — the site is not just a video platform but a prism through which all culture and information is refracted.</p>
<p>I started hanging out on Inner YouTube in earnest a few years ago, and its scale and insularity was jarring at first. Imagine a genetic mutation that gave everyone born after 1995 the ability to see ultraviolet light. Imagine that these people developed an identity around UV light, started calling themselves “UVers” and became suspicious of any media product made exclusively on the visible spectrum. As an old person with normal eyes, you would experience this change as a kind of slow cognitive decline. Every day, as more and more of the world played out in UV, you would struggle to catch glimpses of it. All of a sudden, people would be talking about Area 51 or eating Tide Pods, and you’d have no idea why. This deep chasm of understanding between Inner YouTube and the rest of the world has proved to be the defining problem of Kjellberg’s career.</p>
<p>When Kjellberg started his channel in 2010, YouTube culture hardly existed. He was a 21-year-old college student in Gothenburg, Sweden, who liked playing video games in his apartment. Eventually he took his game footage, superimposed some running commentary in the corner and started uploading it to YouTube — early examples of a genre that became known as “let’s play.” Thanks to some combination of goofy charisma and algorithmic luck, Kjellberg’s channel blew up, in a way no YouTube channel ever had. In 2012, he hit a million subscribers. The following year, PewDiePie became the biggest channel on the site, and Kjellberg started making serious money — a reported $4 million from ads on his channel — and was involved in various lucrative offshoot projects, including a deal with the Disney-owned Maker Studios. In 2014, a survey found that PewDiePie was more popular with American teenagers than Katy Perry, Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that PewDiePie’s audience had grown larger than that of any late-night talk show, many mainstream outlets still treated him like an exotic animal. Journalists wrote breathless stories about his earnings (sample 2014 headline: “This Guy Makes Millions Playing Video Games on YouTube. What?!”), and late-night hosts puzzled over his mass appeal (“Why do you think people like it so much, watching you play games?” Stephen Colbert asked him on “The Late Show”). He appeared on several episodes of “South Park,” where the running gag was that nobody could understand what he did for a living.</p>
<p>Inside YouTube, PewDiePie was a prized talent. The company put up PewDiePie posters in its headquarters and gave him a starring role in YouTube Rewind, the company’s year-in-review video. (Rewind has become a kind of annual report card for Inner YouTube’s top creators, who analyze it frame by frame, looking for hints about their place in the platform’s pecking order.) During these years, PewDiePie was not just the YouTuber with the biggest channel. To many Inner YouTubers, he represented the values of the platform — lo-fi, authentic, defiantly weird. In 2016, when his channel became the first in history to hit 50 million subscribers, YouTube commissioned an enormous ruby-colored statue of the “brofist” — he signs off most videos by raising a clenched hand to the webcam — and mailed it to him.</p>
<p>Kjellberg unboxed it in his kitchen with his camera rolling and seemed genuinely moved.</p>
<p>“YouTube really has given me everything,” he said.</p>
<p>Years ago, YouTube embarked on a radical experiment in self-governance. In 2012, the company vastly expanded the number of creators it allowed to make money from ads on their channels, provided they stayed within some loose boundaries of taste. This made YouTube unique among social platforms, in that it was possible for popular creators to earn a full-time living directly from the platform. YouTube built an algorithm that recommended those creators’ videos based on how engaging they were. Then it stepped back, let the machines run and let a thousand media moguls bloom.</p>
<p>So Kjellberg’s relationship with YouTube has always been a two-way street. His videos brought the company lucrative advertising revenue and a steady stream of loyal users at a time when it was fending off competition from Facebook, Netflix and other video platforms. In exchange, the company promoted his channel and turned a blind eye to some of his more erratic behavior — as in 2012, when he was criticized for his habit of referring to beating his video-game opponents as “raping” them, or in 2016, when he was temporarily banned by Twitter after joking that he was joining ISIS. Kjellberg called these mistakes his “oopsies,” and he knew they were easily fixed with an apology. At the time, YouTube took pride in being a creator’s utopia, and PewDiePie was hardly the only one pushing the limits. Gamers with David Duke vocabularies were everywhere, and a nascent group of right-wing reactionaries was beginning to learn that skewering political correctness was a ticket to YouTube virality. But so was a more garden-variety brand of shock humor, carefully calibrated to the sensibilities of teenage boys.</p>
<p>Edgelords — people who post offensive things online for attention — had always existed on message boards like 4chan. But YouTube brought them out of the shadows and turned provocation into a viable career path. On YouTube, there were few rules and no lawyers looking over creators’ shoulders — which is precisely why millions of young people went there, to find the kind of stuff they couldn’t get on TV. The platform’s algorithms promoted engaging videos, with little regard for what made them engaging, and showered ad revenue on the most successful channels. And as all kinds of boundary-pushers raced to fill this void, it became harder to tell who had an actual ideology and who was just feeding the machines what they wanted.</p>
<p>Kjellberg knew plenty of edgelords — he was a gamer, after all — but he never considered himself one of them. Sure, he cursed and shouted while playing video games, but that was normal behavior. Of the hundreds of videos he posted every year, most were solidly PG-13. Around 2015, though, he began to take more risks. He continued playing video games, but he started experimenting. He did viral challenges, made fun of other YouTubers and reviewed meme submissions from his fans. His video titles from that period sound like a jumbled set of X-rated refrigerator-poetry magnets:</p>
<p>“SEX WITH YOUR CAR SIMULATOR”</p>
<p>“FIST ME DADDY”</p>
<p>“FINGERING SHREK”</p>
<p>“TOILET EXPLOSION DEATH???”</p>
<p>Today Kjellberg attributes this period to a combination of immaturity, boredom and YouTube’s platform incentives — which encouraged creators to increase their watch time by doing outrageous things. He says that he grew sick of playing video games and that his channel’s growth had plateaued, which gave him the urge to let loose. “Looking back, it was a bubble waiting to burst — this bubble of, how far can we push this?” Kjellberg told me. “I think YouTube at that time was at a place where no one really knew where the limit was.”</p>
<p>PewDiePie’s YouTube channel surpassed 100 million subscribers this year. Screen grab from YouTube</p>
<p>But Kjellberg did know where the limit was, because he had already started breaching it. In early 2015, he nearly blew up his Maker Studios deal over a video in which he read erotic fan fiction starring characters from the hit Disney movie “Frozen.” According to a person with knowledge of the incident, Bob Iger, Disney’s chief executive, was very upset when he found out that a YouTuber employed by one of his subsidiaries was cackling over pornographic depictions of Elsa and Olaf the Snowman. Iger calmed down after a Maker Studios staff member explained that erotic fan fiction was a popular internet genre. (A spokeswoman for Disney said that Iger found the video to be “in poor taste.”) Another former colleague of Kjellberg’s told me about an incident that happened in November 2016. Kjellberg arrived at a taping of “Scare PewDiePie” — a show he was making for YouTube’s premium video service — in a T-shirt with a swastika drawn on it. Kjellberg explained that the shirt was part of a running joke on his vlog, in which he and his friends, at least one of whom was Jewish, pranked one another by drawing things on one another’s shirts. The colleague intervened, telling Kjellberg that it would be irresponsible to wear a Nazi symbol on a show that millions of young people would see. (Videos posted by Kjellberg during this period show him and a friend wearing shirts with swastikas drawn on them, but Kjellberg denied wearing one on the show’s set.)</p>
<p>I talked to roughly a dozen people who knew or collaborated with Kjellberg during this period, and none thought he was a genuine anti-Semite. Some theorized that Nazi jokes were just the most offensive type of humor he and his friends could imagine, and therefore the funniest. They said he didn’t understand the power he had as YouTube’s most popular creator, or what millions of impressionable kids might make of a blond, blue-eyed European joking about Hitler. Even today, Kjellberg — whose 100 million subscribers would collectively form the 14th-most-populous nation on earth — has a hard time making sense of his influence. In his mind, he’s just a normal guy who happened to get famous.</p>
<p>“My job is just: I go to my office; I record a video in front of a camera,” he told me. He then glanced down at the microphones sitting on the table. “It’s weird for me to be in this position, because I don’t really want to be in this position.”</p>
<p>In February 2017, Kjellberg learned that The Wall Street Journal was preparing to run an article about nine videos, posted on his channel over the course of six months, that contained anti-Semitic jokes or Nazi imagery. Kjellberg knew that the videos were controversial, and he did some quick damage control. In a post on his Tumblr, he explained, “I think of the content that I create as entertainment, and not a place for any serious political commentary.” His jokes, he said, were “in no way supporting any kind of hateful attitudes.”</p>
<p>Some of the videos The Journal featured were clearly less offensive in context, like the one in which he told his fans to stop building swastikas in a video game. But other jokes — like a video in which he tested the limits of what people on the gig website Fiverr would do for money, including paying two Indian men to hold up a sign that read “Death to All Jews” — were harder to explain. A few of these videos captured the attention of established anti-Semitic groups, who speculated that Kjellberg wasn’t totally kidding and might be converting to their cause. The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi hate site, was so hopeful that it changed its tagline to “the world’s #1 PewDiePie fan site.” Today, Kjellberg blames himself for stepping over the line, but he also characterizes what happened as a kind of category error — a group of outsiders, blind to UV light, who mistook his trolling for genuine hate. Of course, even people who understood that he was trolling found it irresponsible. As a writer on the video-game website Polygon put it, “Intent only gets you so far when it comes to toying with hate speech in front of an audience of tens of millions, many of whom are younger children.”</p>
<p>The fallout from The Journal’s article was swift and brutal. Maker Studios ended its partnership with Kjellberg, and YouTube canceled his “Scare PewDiePie” series and dropped him from a V.I.P. advertising program. By the end of the day, Kjellberg — who was on a Valentine’s Day getaway with his longtime girlfriend, Marzia Bisognin, when the article went online — was in danger of losing his whole empire. “I spent the day being in this little cottage with no internet,” he said. “And then I go on Twitter, and there’s J.K. Rowling calling me a fascist, and I’m like: ‘How is this happening? This is crazy.’ ”</p>
<p>A few days later, Kjellberg posted an angry, defensive video in which he vacillated between self-deprecation and grandiosity, accusing The Journal of punching down at a “rookie comedian” seconds before saying things like, “Old-school media does not like internet personalities because they’re scared of us.” He recast The Journal’s article as a conspiracy, implying that the jealous, dishonest mainstream media had ginned up a fake controversy in order to take him (and by extension, all of YouTube) down a peg. By turning attention to the news media, Kjellberg found a fight he could win. Mainstream outlets had, in fact, botched some of their early coverage of YouTube culture, and YouTubers were inherently suspicious that the media establishment saw them as competition.</p>
<p>PewDiePie felt besieged, even though his audience dwarfed that of any mainstream media outlet — and the Bro Army agreed. For weeks, they barraged The Journal’s reporters with harassment and threats, and even dug up off-color jokes one reporter made years earlier on Twitter. Kjellberg promptly featured the tweets in a video; afterward, the reporter received so many death threats that The Journal offered to briefly move him out of his house. The Bro Army also took aim at YouTube, which fans believed was siding with the media and punishing PewDiePie in response to outside pressure. When the 2017 version of YouTube Rewind came out, he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>After the Journal article, Kjellberg seemed to lose whatever was left of his inhibitions. He started his own parody news series, “Pew News,” in which he mocked the media and dissected negative articles about him. He took on the kinds of culture-war topics he once avoided, like microaggressions and the wage gap. Kjellberg never identified himself as a conservative, but his new, more politicized views attracted the attention of right-wing personalities like Carl Benjamin, a British YouTuber known as Sargon of Akkad, and Alex Jones, who offered Kjellberg a guest slot on Infowars. (Kjellberg politely declined.)</p>
<p>Kjellberg started his own parody news series, “Pew News,” in 2018. Screen grab from YouTube</p>
<p>Kjellberg also kept making oopsies — bad ones, the kind that would instantly end careers anywhere outside YouTube. In a September 2017 video, he yelled “nigger” on a gaming live stream. (He apologized, saying in a video, “I know I can’t keep messing up like this.”) In 2018, he recommended an anime review channel that, upon closer inspection, turned out to be rife with anti-Semitic and hateful content. These scandals made Kjellberg toxic outside YouTube. But they only strengthened his fan base’s perception of him as a martyr, a symbol of YouTube’s freewheeling culture sacrificed at the altar of corporate profits. And they endeared him to the alt-right, which saw in him a potentially valuable ally. “In an age of ruthless cultural conformity, someone like PewDiePie isn’t supposed to exist,” Paul Joseph Watson, a far-right YouTube commentator, said in a 2019 video defending Kjellberg from his critics. “Which is why they’ve tried to tear him down, over and over again.”</p>
<p>Kjellberg and I sat in the Airbnb together for an entire afternoon, and I spent at least an hour trying to pin down his actual political beliefs or get him to talk about how this period of intense criticism shaped his views. He spoke freely about his feud with the news media — he now regrets going after the Journal reporters, he said, especially given what happened to them afterward — but when the conversation approached partisan politics, he clammed up. He told me that he was “more apolitical than anything,” and when I asked him whether he was more right-wing or left-wing, he said he was “somewhere in between.” We had a lot of long, futile exchanges like this:</p>
<p>“Are there any politicians who excite you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Like, anywhere in the world?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t name one, no.”</p>
<p>“What did you think about UKIP endorsing you?” I asked. On Twitter, the far-right British party had recently told its followers to subscribe to his channel to stop T-Series from overtaking him.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of funny how a political party would post about a meme,” he said. “But it’s also kind of like, Ehh, don’t drag me into your politics.”</p>
<p>To Kjellberg, the past few years have proved that there is no reward for engaging in politics, even if it would be good fodder for his channel. He is especially annoyed that he continues to be linked to the far right, despite his insistence that he doesn’t support its causes. When Kjellberg is accused of being far right, he doesn’t respond by protesting that he’s actually a “classical liberal” or a “heterodox Stoic” or whatever YouTube reactionaries are calling themselves these days. Instead, he insists that he’s not interested in politics at all. It’s a clever strategic position for a guy whose audience straddles the partisan divide.</p>
<p>But it’s also plausible, if you watch more than a few of the roughly 4,000 videos on his channel. PewDiePie doesn’t endorse candidates, debate podcast hosts or make fun of transgender-bathroom bills. He plays video games, reads memes off Reddit and sometimes jokes about stuff in the news. His political preferences, to the extent they exist, seem almost entirely predicated on entertainment value. President Trump, he told me, “became a meme for a while,” until it stopped being funny. And while recent history has taught us that extremists often use stupid memes to smuggle their views into the mainstream, in Kjellberg’s case, the memes themselves seem to be the point.</p>
<p>Kjellberg described the New Zealand shooting as a major turning point in his life. The morning after, he was in bed, struggling to get back to sleep, when his phone began buzzing. He saw, on Twitter and in a flurry of texts, that the shooting suspect had said, “Subscribe to PewDiePie” just before he began his slaughter. After Kjellberg absorbed the shock, a sequence began unspooling in his mind. First, the news media — which wouldn’t understand that all that “Subscribe to PewDiePie” stuff was as much a joke as an actual endorsement — would accuse him of inspiring a mass murderer. All the Nazi stuff would come back up. He would have to issue a statement, and doing so would make it seem as though he were drawing attention to himself and away from the victims.</p>
<p>It had been about a month since the shooting when I asked Kjellberg about it, and he looked genuinely pained. He repeated his concern for the victims and their families, and he reiterated what he said about himself a hundred times before: He wasn’t a white nationalist, and he didn’t condone violence. He told me that he was planning to release a video calling for an end to the “Subscribe to PewDiePie” campaign and was hoping to return to his roots as a goofy, uncontroversial gaming vlogger.</p>
<p>We parted ways. And then, for whatever it’s worth, everything he said would happen did. A few days after our interview, he persuaded his fans to end “Subscribe to PewDiePie.” He stopped grinding axes with the news media and started playing Minecraft again. He and Bisognin married and went on their honeymoon. He got new advertising deals, and he returned to YouTube’s good graces. YouTube sent him a “red diamond” play button on the occasion of his 100 millionth subscriber, along with a congratulatory letter from Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive — a sign that, in the company’s eyes, he has turned back from the edge.</p>
<p>The charitable way to interpret PewDiePie’s new attitude is that he has actually grown up, developed a thicker skin and taken stock of his own power and responsibility. The more pragmatic way is to point out that Kjellberg is a professional YouTuber and that — for now, at least — his career prospects are partly dependent on his ability to stay out of trouble. Either way, if Kjellberg ever achieves something like redemption, it will always be complicated by the world-historic nature of his YouTube stardom and the daily high-wire act it requires of him. Stand too close to the edge, and he risks jeopardizing his standing with the people who sign his checks, host his videos and write about him on gaming websites. Stand too far from the edge, and he risks looking like a sellout in front of 100 million fans, many of whom follow him expressly for the unfiltered straight talk — or worse — and could turn on him if they sense that he is taking directions from above.</p>
<p>In September, after reaching 100 million subscribers, PewDiePie uploaded a new video. In it, he pledged to give $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League, one organization that criticized him for joking about the Holocaust. It was a symbolic gesture of closure, a signal that he had matured and was ready to apologize and move on. “I’ve finally come to terms,” he said, “with the responsibility I have as a creator.”</p>
<p>Some of his fans, though, weren’t ready to bury the hatchet. They barraged the video’s comment section with anti-Semitic slurs and conspiracy theories and accused the Anti-Defamation League of blackmailing him into making a donation. Some of them were actual anti-Semites, but others were just suspicious. Why would PewDiePie donate to an organization that criticized him? Was he being bullied? They had been conditioned to think that any time a YouTuber apologized for stepping over the line, it was because someone from the outside — a media organization, an advertiser, YouTube corporate — was forcing his or her hand. “As his second family,” one commenter on a PewDiePie-themed subreddit wrote, “I feel like we’re obligated to voice our concerns when there’s something clearly not right here.”</p>
<p>The next day, Kjellberg posted another video and announced that he wasn’t giving the $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League after all. He said that it “doesn’t feel genuine for me to proceed with a donation at this point” and that he “didn’t know a lot of things” about the group’s activities when he made the pledge. He would find another charity, he said, one that better represented his values. Some people interpreted Kjellberg’s about-face as a sign that he wasn’t actually sorry for the Nazi jokes. Others surmised, probably more accurately, that he feared offending his most vocal fans more than he feared the criticism he would face for retracting a donation to a Jewish anti-hate group. No one was particularly happy, least of all Kjellberg, who took to his YouTube channel to confess that he just wanted to make the drama go away.</p>
<p>Watching all this play out, I thought about something he told me back in Brighton. We had been talking about the likelihood that T-Series would soon dethrone him after six years as YouTube’s top creator. Kjellberg surprised me by saying that it didn’t really bother him — that, in fact, he had been getting nostalgic for the days when he had fewer subscribers. He confessed that he periodically thought about giving up on YouTube altogether. His wife had given up her popular YouTube channel last year. I suggested that he could do the same thing — shutter his channel and spend his days lounging on a hammock somewhere with her.</p>
<p>“Don’t tempt me,” he said with a smile. “I kind of question if the positive outweighs the negative,” he went on. “It’s a lot more than I think I signed up for.” He seemed to catch himself mid-daydream and clarified: Deleting his channel is not something he would really go through with. Like many other extreme ideas, it’s just something he plays with from time to time.

<p><img src="https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/03/h_15105838-1553966188-e1553966272673.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800" alt="img">
Among the Trump-Russia investigation’s many loose ends, one stands out: the Trump Tower Moscow project and the conflicting statements from President Donald Trump and his former advisers about their attempts to complete a lucrative business deal in Russia in the midst of the 2016 election. The man closest to the project, longtime Trump business associate Felix Sater, was set to appear before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees this past week. But with many details of the 400-page special counsel investigation still shrouded in mystery, Sater’s testimony has been postponed indefinitely, or at least until members of Congress better understand the contents of the so-called Mueller report. Sater’s story is a familiar plotline in the Trump-Russia narrative: An opportunistic ex-con ingratiates himself into the Trump Organization, landing a rent-free office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, then brokers connections between the future president, Trump’s family and company, and Russian elites, eventually including the Kremlin. When the unbecoming details of Sater’s past — his secret prosecution, his ties to organized crime — come to light, the president disavows their relationship. The less familiar story is how Sater got here, and how his path to the center of the current political scandal was enabled and, arguably, abetted by some of the same people who went on to work in the special counsel’s office. The government has acknowledged Sater’s long-running cooperation and he has spoken publicly about his purported role in obtaining Osama bin Laden’s phone numbers before 9/11, identifying a North Korean official seeking to buy nuclear weapons technology from the Russians, and helping to disrupt an assassination plot on former Secretary of State Colin Powell in Afghanistan. But the details and terms of Sater’s agreement with the government remain largely secret, contained in sealed court filings submitted in his 20-year-old criminal case. (Last month, The Intercept sought the unsealing of some of these materials, including his cooperation agreement. Judge Leo Glasser ordered both the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Sater’s counsel to respond by April 8.) Sater may have remained in the shadows, but long before special counsel Robert Mueller’s report found that the Trump campaign had not colluded with the Russian government, his name emerged in what seemed — on its face — to be direct evidence of such an effort. “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” Sater famously wrote in a November 2015 email to Michael Cohen, then Trump’s personal attorney, that was first published in the New York Times. “Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it…I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.” That wasn’t collusion, Sater told The Intercept in an interview last week. “It’s called marketing. It’s giving both sides what they want.”</p>

<p>Eventually, Sater was called in to explain that to the prosecutors in Mueller’s office. While he declined to discuss the details of that interview, he did describe an exchange with Andrew Weissmann, one of Mueller’s senior prosecutors, during the meeting. “What the hell is it with these emails?” Weissmann asked, according to Sater. “You really know how to be on the front page, don’t you, Felix?” If Weissmann’s tone sounds casual and even jocular, it might be because the two men have known each other for 20 years. Weissmann supervised the 1998 stock fraud case that originally brought Sater into the government’s orbit as a cooperator. He is not the only member of Mueller’s team who goes way back with Sater. FBI Special Agent William McCausland who worked on former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn’s prosecution, handled Sater as early as 2003, after he became an informant. (“One of the hardest-working and best FBI agents I’ve ever worked with,” Sater said of McCausland.) Other former Eastern District prosecutors who were detailed to the special counsel include Zainab Ahmad and Greg Andres, who served as chief of the office’s criminal division at the time Sater was sentenced. Peter Carr, the spokesperson for the special counsel’s office, declined to comment. Sater’s history as an informant who worked with members of the special counsel’s team, coupled with his position at the center of the Trump-Russia story, raises the question of whether the Russia investigation was, ultimately, a circular exercise. Could Mueller’s investigation have been avoided — or dramatically narrowed in scope — had federal prosecutors not cut Sater a secret deal in 1998 but, instead, prosecuted him? This sort of hypothetical-in-hindsight may not sit well with members of Sater’s prosecution team, all but one of whom declined to speak to The Intercept for this story. The only exception, former Eastern District prosecutor and now New York state Sen. Todd Kaminsky, said it’s unfair to suggest that law enforcement officials should have anticipated Sater’s involvement in a political scandal implicating the president. “I think it would be very difficult to tell an FBI agent or a prosecutor in, let’s say, 2002, knowing what you know about Sater — that he’s a savvy businessman, that’s he’s a stock defrauder, that he stabbed someone in the face with a martini glass — and have them say, ‘You know what, I don’t think we should get this information on Al Qaeda, because one day this guy is going to be in the middle of an international conspiracy that goes to the highest level [of government],’” Kaminsky said. For his part, Sater told The Intercept he didn’t play any role in investigations into Trump, before, during, or after the election. “The FBI has never asked me to provide information about the Trump Organization or Donald Trump at any time,” he said. “There was never any connection with me from my case and the Trump investigation other than during interviews with Mueller.” Sater also said he never used his role as a senior advisor to Trump to carry out law enforcement work. Though, he would not say whether he signed an “otherwise illegal activity” — an authorization from the Department of Justice to violate the law in the context of an investigation — which, in some instances, requires review by the director of the FBI. (Mueller was FBI director from 2001 until 2013, when Sater was cooperating with the bureau.) Sater also took exception to questions about whether he’d ever been approached by a foreign intelligence agency while acting as a government informant. “Where do you think I got half this shit from? From a dentist?” he said. “Was I ever the subject of them trying to turn me? Who knows.” The Trump Moscow project, he said, was a straight-ahead real estate deal. “I’m telling you, believe it or not, investigate it or not, there was no intelligence component to me trying to do a Trump Tower,” Sater said. “I’m a businessman. I’m a developer. I saw an opportunity. I went for it. It’s not right. It’s not wrong. It’s just what it is.” Yet nothing is ever quite as it seems with Felix Sater. He’s been called a spy, a stock cheat, a real estate developer, a gangster, a Russian, an American patriot. Twenty years ago, federal prosecutors saw him in more practical terms: as someone they could work with.</p>

<p>The Art of the Deal Sater’s cooperation did not occur in a vacuum. In the early winter of 1998, a group of federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York faced a perennial question: Do we prosecute this guy? Or do we cut him a deal? Sater was a 31-year-old ex-con, a Russian Jewish emigre who’d served a year in state prison for an assault stemming from a fight in a bar. That made for an unremarkable pedigree in their jurisdiction. He appeared to have graduated from his state-court felony to a sprawling federal white-collar conspiracy in which he was accused of defrauding retirees, including at least two Holocaust survivors, out of millions, according to court filings. The allegations against Sater alone made him a good target for prosecutors. Financial crime was a growing racket for the Italian Mafia and Sater was at the center of it. He said he could help penetrate a criminal underworld otherwise closed off to the FBI: the mob’s growing presence on Wall Street. (“When you grow up in Brooklyn and Staten Island, everybody knows a guy,” he told The Intercept.) Sater was savvy, capable, and connected — an ideal cooperator. Two decades later, those same qualities would put him at the center of the Trump-Russia story. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Eastern District of New York had made its name flipping criminals, most notably Salvatore “Sammy the Bull” Gravano, the Gambino family deputy who testified against John Gotti in 1992. After three acquittals, Brooklyn prosecutors finally secured a conviction against Gotti — and a life term in prison. Gravano had a hand in 19 murders, but he received time served for his testimony. His deal is a case study in the stark moral logic underlying cooperation agreements: a lesser evil for a greater good. The Eastern District would go on to apply that logic to devastating effect against New York’s five Mafia families throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Former FBI Special Agent Leo Taddeo, the first agent to work with Sater, described the office’s culture of cooperation as “healthy.” “The Eastern District does the government’s business and it does it really well,” Taddeo said. “And part of that business is entering into cooperation agreements every day.” As the office branched out into national security cases after the September 11 attacks, criminal cooperation agreements took on an even more complex moral dimension. Prosecutors continued to successfully recruit cooperating witnesses in terrorism cases, even though the cooperators had in some cases been enemies of the state. One such witness, Bryant Neal Vinas, a Long Island man who joined Al Qaeda, provided key intelligence and testimony on the terror group’s operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In a 2015 case against three al-Shabaab members, prosecutors relied on the testimony of a man who helped plan and execute the 2010 World Cup bombings in Kampala, Uganda, which killed 70 people, including Nate Henn, a 25-year-old NGO worker from North Carolina, and injured six Americans and scores of others. The key witness, Mugisha Mohamoud, had served five years in prison in Kenya after confessing to his role in the attack and was living there when he testified. The U.S. has not publicly charged Mohamoud or extradited him. The three al-Shabaab defendants pleaded guilty and were sentenced in 2016.</p>

<p>“No Task Was Too Big” Within this context, Felix Sater presented a relatively straightforward profile as a cooperator. He hadn’t committed any death penalty-eligible offenses and, by his own account, he was contrite and eager to do the right thing. The Justice Department’s official position on Sater is that his value as a cooperator far outweighed any liabilities. It also implicitly outweighed concerns over his potential for recidivism. At Sater’s sentencing in 2009 — 11 years after he first surrendered — then-prosecutor Kaminsky told the judge: “Felix Slater was one of the best cooperators we worked with. There was nothing he wouldn’t do. No task was too big. He was really helpful and was the key to open a hundred different doors that they couldn’t open prior to that time.” Sater had hired two former Eastern District prosecutors to represent him at that hearing, Leslie Caldwell and Kelly Moore. Both had worked at the U.S. Attorney’s Office at the time he became a cooperator. Caldwell, who went on to become an assistant attorney general in the Obama administration, had represented the government in an early appearance in one of the stock fraud cases for which Sater provided information. “I’m hesitant to use the word redemption, but I think it fits Mr. Sater,” Caldwell told the judge at the sentencing. “I think he has redeemed himself.” She explained that Sater had developed such a close relationship with the FBI that he had been traveling freely to Russia as part of his real estate business for 10 years without being required to report those trips to his handlers, as is generally required for informants. Caldwell closed her remarks on Sater’s character with a prediction. She told the judge that Sater is “not going to appear before this court or any other court again in the context of a criminal case.” Neither Caldwell nor Moore responded to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The prosecutors involved in Sater’s original case have since risen to some of the top positions in federal law enforcement. Loretta Lynch, who served as U.S. attorney in Brooklyn during his cooperation, became attorney general under President Barack Obama. Caldwell and Weissmann went on to lead the Enron task force before rising to even more senior positions, with Caldwell serving as assistant attorney general for the criminal division and Weissmann running the department’s fraud section. Weissmann also served under Mueller at the FBI. When his former boss was appointed special counsel, Weissmann joined what became known as the Mueller investigation. Their career success may have little to do with Sater’s cooperation, yet the two cannot be entirely disentangled. During her 2015 confirmation, when asked about Sater, Lynch said that he provided “information crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.” At Sater’s 2009 sentencing, Glasser chose not to give him prison time, even though the RICO statute exposed him to a potential 25-year sentence. Glasser instead imposed a $25,000 fine and told Sater, “The extent of your cooperation over all of those years clearly manifests that you have a very sincere and deep respect for the law.” Fifteen years earlier, it was Glasser who had sentenced Gravano to time-served. Glasser, who is 94, still hears cases in the Eastern District; he declined to comment. A Lesser Evil Cooperation agreements are, by their very nature, transactional, and in the lesser-evil-for-the-greater-good formulation, Sater appeared to more than live up to his end of the bargain. Last year, in preparation for closed testimony before the House Subcommittee on Intelligence, he provided Congress a bulleted list of 23 examples of his intelligence and investigative work, according to a statement obtained by BuzzFeed. By his own account, Sater was an operative of superhero proportions — someone who could cobble together a team of former Spetsnaz mercenaries to hunt bin Laden while unraveling terrorist financing schemes and also building his own intelligence network of spooks around the world, all without receiving compensation from the government. The breadth of his self-described activities suggests an uncanny understanding of the various markets for information in the U.S. government’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Most of Sater’s claims have so far proven impossible to independently verify. One former intelligence official who worked with the FBI’s New York office, but didn’t have direct knowledge of Sater’s cooperation, voiced skepticism. “Somebody who claims to have done all that he has screams bullshit,” the official said. “It sounds like he took the FBI for a ride.” So what did Sater get for his cooperation? His freedom, for one. In addition to the $25,000 fine, Sater forfeited a home in the Hamptons, but he did not spend a single night in jail. More important, Sater retained his identity. Judges and federal prosecutors agreed to conceal his charges and eventual conviction. His plea agreement required him to plead guilty to a single count in a racketeering indictment but, in a legal but entirely opaque practice favored by prosecutors the Eastern District, he did so in secret and under a false name. Even the courtroom was sealed, with reporters, the public, and — had they shown up — the victims of Sater’s fraud barred from entering the hearing. Unlike a cooperator who testifies in a public trial, Sater was never subjected to the adversarial system of justice. He was, in effect, represented by the government in both the prosecution and the defense. And with the press shut out of the closed proceedings, there was no one with an incentive to impeach his credibility or question the government’s version of events. In the eyes of the justice system, Sater was a two-time felon with links to both the Italian and Russian mobs who had been convicted of sophisticated financial crimes. While there was public information on his assault conviction, there was no public record on his conviction in the Eastern District. When Sater met Manhattan celebrity real estate developer Donald Trump in 2002, he appeared to be little more than a 38-year-old former Wall Street prodigy from Shearson Lehman trying to reinvent himself in New York real estate.</p>

<p>The Redemption To work effectively with the Trump Organization, Sater leveraged the two assets he’d secured from the Eastern District: his freedom and his identity. After September 11, he joined Bayrock, a real estate venture operating out of Trump Tower. There, Sater developed a working relationship with Trump, appearing at groundbreaking ceremonies and hosting Donald Jr. and Ivanka on a 2006 trip to Moscow — where he boasted in an email to Michael Cohen that he “arranged for Ivanka to sit in Putins [sic] private chair.” As a political refugee who fled anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, Sater saw his relationship with Russia as all business. “I’ve never been Russian in my life. I’m an American Jew who happened to have had the misfortune of being born in Moscow,” he said. “I went there to make money. I speak Russian. I can take advantage of an extra edge.” Sater’s signature project with the Trump Organization, Trump Soho, also broke ground in 2006. The next year, Trump discussed a potential Trump Moscow project during a deposition in a libel case. Throughout this period, Sater remained under a secret indictment in the Eastern District, awaiting sentencing. But as Sater struggled to get Trump Moscow off the ground, he discovered a problem with the Trump brand, he told The Intercept. “It had no value,” he said. “They didn’t want to pay Trump the licensing fee because they’re like, ‘Who the hell is Trump in Russia? Who knows him?’” The solution materialized nearly a decade later when Trump’s 2016 campaign began to get traction, Sater said.

<h3 id="44-years-41-allegations-how-the-past-caught-up-to-a-former-olympian">&ldquo;44 years. 41 Allegations. How the past caught up to a former Olympian.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0730/r577090_1296x729_16-9.jpg" alt="img">
An Outside the Lines Investigation 44 years. 41 allegations. Now the past is catching up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quiet, early morning at UCLA&rsquo;s Drake Stadium, the sun still low. The world&rsquo;s greatest track athletes have run here through the years, in front of thousands of cheering fans. But on this Tuesday in June 2016, only a dozen or so anonymous men and women stretch and tick off laps.</p>
<p>Among them is Benjamin, a wiry, 20-year-old UCLA sophomore. He is not on the Bruins&rsquo; track team, but he is training toward his dream of making his home country&rsquo;s national squad. As he stretches, Benjamin (who asked that his real name not be used) sees a figure walking stiffly and deliberately toward him across the infield. The man comes into focus: early 30s, flowing blond hair, piercing blue eyes. He looks like an athlete, firm and thin, but he&rsquo;s wearing street clothes.</p>
<p>The stranger approaches Benjamin; he nods in the direction of an older man in a track jacket and white Adidas cap, perched on a folding chair about 10 feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you train with this guy?&rdquo; the stranger asks.</p>
<p>Benjamin hesitates, partly because his coach, a former Olympian and trainer of elite athletes, always has demanded secrecy: Our training is our business.</p>
<p>The stranger continues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurs to Benjamin that he actually doesn&rsquo;t know his coach&rsquo;s full name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach Avondale,&rdquo; Benjamin says. &ldquo;Look, you can go talk to him if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he can f&mdash; himself,&rdquo; comes the reply. &ldquo;His name is Conrad Montgomery Avondale Mainwaring. He&rsquo;s a serial child molester, and he molested me when I was at UCLA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trusted this guy, I thought it was OK, but what he did to me f&mdash;ed me up for the next 10 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger keeps talking, but the words are mostly a blur to Benjamin. Finally, the man turns and approaches the coach, raising his cellphone to record the encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to f&mdash;ing jail!&rdquo; the man says.</p>
<p>The man lays into the coach for what seems like forever. Benjamin tries to focus on his workout, but it&rsquo;s no use. He gathers his stuff and walks off the track, trying to process the stranger&rsquo;s words: He molested me at UCLA.</p>
<p>What the stranger didn&rsquo;t know was that Benjamin himself had been molested by Mainwaring &ndash; only nine hours earlier. Nor did the stranger realize that he had just pulled a thread that would begin unraveling the mystery and misdeeds of Conrad Mainwaring, a former Olympian who coached Olympic-level athletes, including a two-time gold medalist.</p>
<p>In June 2018, Outside the Lines began investigating a tip that Mainwaring allegedly had molested a 12-year-old boy in the 1970s and might have continued such activity to the present day. The tip led to a 13-month reporting effort that uncovered scores of allegations spanning five decades and two continents &ndash; and sparked a police investigation that resulted in Mainwaring&rsquo;s recent arrest.</p>
<p>Those who have accused Mainwaring, now mostly middle-aged men, were interviewed multiple times each and over hundreds of hours in total. Efforts were made to corroborate their stories, including speaking with family members, friends and spouses they had confided in over the years, as well as reviewing letters, journals, photos, official documents and news articles.</p>
<p>As startling as the sheer number of accusations was the fact that for years Mainwaring &ndash; who rejected repeated interview requests &ndash; remained a cipher, a man with almost no public footprint who was able to stay one step ahead of the allegations and the law.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>A Family Secret Andrew Zenoff says his older brother, Victor, spun into a life of drugs and risky behavior after his alleged abuse by Conrad Mainwaring. “Conrad’s molesting was a huge contributor to his unhappiness … and ultimately his death.” 00:00 / 00:00 Rachel Bujalski for ESPN</p>
<p>IN MAY 2018, a phone rings at the Marin County, California, office of Andrew Zenoff, an entrepreneur who initially struck it big two decades ago by selling a pillow for nursing mothers. &ldquo;My Brest Friend,&rdquo; he called his invention. Zenoff grabs his cellphone. It&rsquo;s a friend &ndash; a reporter &ndash; following up on an earlier conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That guy you told me about &ndash; the one you said molested your brother back in the &rsquo;70s &hellip; what&rsquo;s his name again?&rdquo; the reporter asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conrad Mainwaring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zenoff, now 54, recounts the tragically short life of his older brother, Victor: They grew up on the East Coast in the 1970s. Victor was easygoing and affable. Everybody seemed to like him, and he excelled in most sports &ndash; basketball, baseball, tennis, soccer.</p>
<p>Each summer, starting when Victor was 12, the Zenoff brothers went to Camp Greylock for Boys, a sleepaway sports camp in New England. There, Victor developed a close relationship with a certain counselor, a man whose distinctive qualities drew campers to him. He carried an aura of authority and spoke in a proper British accent. Most impressively, he was an Olympian. His name was Conrad Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was sort of like a hero figure to my brother,&rdquo; Zenoff says.</p>
<p>But Victor changed over three summers at camp. By 15, he was consumed by drugs and risky behavior, and the family had moved to the West Coast. One time, he rolled his car and nearly killed himself. After that, his parents bought him a used highway patrol car, thinking it would be &ldquo;a safe tank,&rdquo; but he was pulled over driving faster than 100 mph.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1980, Victor was approaching his 18th birthday &ndash; barely out of high school &ndash; when he told his mother he had been sexually abused by Mainwaring repeatedly over several summers. The next day, Victor left on a camping trip to California&rsquo;s Yosemite National Park with a friend he had met at a Grateful Dead show. A few days later, officers knocked on Nisha Zenoff&rsquo;s front door. Victor was dead, found at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. Police deemed it a hiking accident.</p>
<p>Andrew says he never had Mainwaring as a counselor and was never approached by him, and he didn&rsquo;t learn of the alleged abuse until after Victor&rsquo;s death. At that point, he says, the Zenoffs were too devastated to tell anyone else what Victor had confided to his mother.</p>
<p>Besides, maybe Victor was Mainwaring&rsquo;s only victim.</p>
<p>‘Seduced By His Interest’ Vernon Sharples says Mainwaring molested him in the 1970s.</p>
<p>IN THE SUMMER of 1975, the textile hub of Leicester, England, a gloomy, downtrodden city 100 miles north of London, had little to offer 15-year-old Vernon Sharples. When he wasn&rsquo;t working as an assistant at a sporting goods store, he was smoking cigarettes and pilfering alcohol from his parents, who he says weren&rsquo;t very attentive.</p>
<p>And then one day, Conrad Mainwaring walked into the store where Sharples worked, MC Sports. &ldquo;I was aware that he was going to the Olympics because he used to come into the shop and try and get a bit of stuff for free,&rdquo; says Sharples, now a slender, balding 59-year-old.</p>
<p>Though not good enough to make England&rsquo;s national team, the 23-year-old Mainwaring was to compete as a hurdler for his native Antigua at the upcoming 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.</p>
<p>Mainwaring&rsquo;s athletic accomplishments interested Sharples, but he was most taken by the attention the track star heaped on him at the store. So when Mainwaring invited Sharples to train with what he called his &ldquo;squad&rdquo; of athletes at Saffron Lane Athletics Stadium in Leicester, the boy leaped at the chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just seduced by his interest,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>The coach preached sobriety and celibacy, citing booze and girls as obstacles to athletic success. He had a word for messing around with members of the opposite sex: wenching. Mainwaring was an avid reader and classical music aficionado who seemed, at least to a kid from Leicester, to know everything. Some evenings after practice, the two would ride a bus downtown, where the coach &ndash; he went simply by &ldquo;Conrad&rdquo; &ndash; took Sharples to a Chinese restaurant and treated him to chicken and chips. Often, the coach would talk about a group of other select youngsters he trained &ndash; his &ldquo;international squad&rdquo; &ndash; at a summer camp in America.</p>
<p>During one of their conversations, Mainwaring explained that he was doing research in psychology and wanted Sharples to be one of his subjects. The fieldwork, Mainwaring told the teenager, involved masturbation habits. It lasted several weeks, during which time Sharples says the coach asked about frequency, timing, duration and other aspects of self-gratification. At one point, Sharples says, Mainwaring told him to see how long he could go without indulging.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He just kept on saying that I&rsquo;m this amazing guy &hellip; kind of showering me with compliments,&rdquo; Sharples says. &ldquo;And so I just went along with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After workouts, Mainwaring gave Sharples and other squad members massages; he called it &ldquo;physiotherapy.&rdquo; Calling it &ldquo;massage [would] really wind him up,&rdquo; Sharples says. One day, Sharples was the last squad member to receive treatment, lying face up on a table when Mainwaring instructed him to &ldquo;think up an erection&rdquo; and then &ldquo;think it down.&rdquo; All part of the research, he was told. Sharples says this happened a few times before the sessions went to a new level: &ldquo;He would rub my penis over my shorts &hellip; until I ejaculated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than 40 years later, Sharples can&rsquo;t recall how long the alleged abuse lasted. At the time, he didn&rsquo;t think of it as abuse; Mainwaring used clinical language, never sexualizing the &ldquo;physiotherapy.&rdquo; Sharples doesn&rsquo;t remember why Mainwaring stopped, but he says, &ldquo;When it did stop, I remember feeling almost rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharples continued to seek his coach&rsquo;s approval throughout the remainder of high school. Although communication diminished, the conversations were meaningful, he says. Often, talk turned to Mainwaring&rsquo;s international squad in America.</p>
<p>When Sharples turned 18, Mainwaring invited him to cross the Atlantic and work as a counselor at Camp Greylock for Boys in Massachusetts. Sharples didn&rsquo;t need much persuading; he felt honored.</p>
<p>By then, the summer of 1978, Mainwaring was well on his way to establishing a dramatic legacy at Greylock. And soon, he would be in America to stay.</p>
<p>Pitch-Black Woods David Allinson (not pictured) says Mainwaring promised him greatness if he followed his direction. Mainwaring worked with hundreds of boys at Camp Greylock, as shown in this photo from a camp yearbook. “He started down this path of, ‘How bad do you want the Olympics?’ I said, ‘More than anything in my life.’” 00:00 / 00:00</p>
<p>ON THE WESTERN edge of Massachusetts, in the heart of the Berkshire Mountains, is a summer camp where boys have gone to play for more than a century.</p>
<p>Camp Greylock spreads across 300 acres near the town of Becket, a bucolic setting of top-flight sports facilities &ndash; 15 tennis courts, five baseball fields, three soccer fields, two 100-yard flag football fields, an in-line hockey rink, a nine-hole golf course, a climbing wall, a zip line, a lake and a weight room &ndash; and cabins nestled amid abundant forest.</p>
<p>The camp was founded in 1916 by three brothers, who sold it to a group of former campers in the late 1940s. Those men would operate Camp Greylock for Boys for the next 50 years, until it was sold again in 1994 to a new generation of former Greylock employees. Through the years, the camp has catered to the children of wealth &ndash; the sons of entertainers and sports executives, politicians and architects. This year&rsquo;s tuition is $12,800 for seven weeks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how or exactly when Mainwaring arrived at Greylock, but he was a stalwart for at least five summers. He was a captivating figure to many of the young men and junior counselors, famous for his participation in the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Even if the campers knew he had finished last in his preliminary heats in the 400- and 110-meter hurdles, it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter.</p>
<p>Camp Greylock Map The athletic fields at Camp Greylock were surrounded by woods, as seen in this map from a camp yearbook. One man told Outside the Lines he was 14 when Mainwaring took him from a night activity (A) to an athletic field (B), where he was molested.</p>
<p>That was true for David Allinson, a track star with Olympic ambitions in 1979. He was 17 and heading into his senior year of high school in New Rochelle, New York, when Mainwaring got him a job as a junior counselor at Greylock. Allinson had been introduced to the coach the previous summer and had trained with him thereafter. Allinson admired the way Mainwaring carried himself and how he tried to be a father figure, something Allinson says he lacked at home.</p>
<p>But Allinson says the relationship took a dramatic turn that summer at Greylock. He remembers it this way: Soon after Allinson arrived in Becket, Mainwaring summoned him to the soccer field to work on a special athletic feat the coach liked to show off. He would leap next to a soccer goal and touch his foot to the crossbar. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to get to college and be a decathlete or get to the Olympics, you need flexibility, so we need to do this drill tonight,&rdquo; the coach said. Oh, and one more thing, Mainwaring added: Before you come to the field, brush your teeth.</p>
<p>That night, after brushing his teeth, Allinson walked from his cabin to the field. It was pitch-black, surrounded by trees. He was nervous and called out for Mainwaring. &ldquo;Shhh, keep your voice down,&rdquo; the coach said, waving a flashlight. They walked and talked a bit, did a few exercises. Gradually, Mainwaring led Allinson into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad do you want the Olympics?&rdquo; Mainwaring asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than anything,&rdquo; the boy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you willing to do for it, how much mental energy are you prepared to give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach said the boy needed to give him a hug. He told Allinson to relax: &ldquo;You need to be able to focus, and you need to learn how to slow your heartbeat down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then suggested Allinson think up an erection. &ldquo;That is the ultimate mental test, because I&rsquo;m not gay, and you&rsquo;re not gay, and this isn&rsquo;t about sex,&rdquo; Mainwaring said. &ldquo;This is about showing me you have the mental ability to control your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach then masturbated the boy to climax.</p>
<p>Afterward, the coach presented another &ldquo;mental challenge.&rdquo; He wanted the boy to kiss him, and Allinson obliged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, this has been a big test for you, and I&rsquo;m happy to say you passed it and you are on your way to the Olympics,&rdquo; Mainwaring said.</p>
<p>Allinson, now a corporate executive living with his wife and children in Northern California, says after that night, &ldquo;I knew my life had completely changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who I was or what I was,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allinson says the abuse continued and eventually &ldquo;started happening in the bunks, while the campers were out playing &hellip; maybe a dozen times. I remember getting emotional and saying, &lsquo;When is this going to stop?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remembers Mainwaring saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to stop when you realize what&rsquo;s necessary in your training, and your training isn&rsquo;t there. If you stop, I won&rsquo;t coach you.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, as an adult, Allinson says he contemplated suicide. He says he hid the abuse out of shame, fear and confusion &ndash; all of which he blames for a lifelong struggle with alcohol.</p>
<p>In all, seven men told Outside the Lines they were sexually abused by Mainwaring when they were campers or junior counselors at Camp Greylock in the mid-to-late 1970s.</p>
<p>The men who ran the camp when Mainwaring worked there are dead. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach the camp&rsquo;s current owners, Outside the Lines received an email from an attorney who said the latest iteration of the camp has never had any &ldquo;affiliation whatsoever with Mainwaring.&rdquo; The lawyer did not respond to repeated emails seeking additional comment. Several staff members from that time period and one former camper who is now a staffer told Outside the Lines they couldn&rsquo;t recall anyone matching Mainwaring&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>A Culture of Secrecy Robert Bender, who met Mainwaring on his first day at Syracuse, says the coach had a &ldquo;powerful way of &hellip; pulling you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BY 1980, MAINWARING was 28, had landed at Syracuse University in upstate New York and was pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in counseling and guidance. He worked for the school in student housing.</p>
<p>His latest squad was a mix of students attending the university and younger athletes he had met at local track meets while working as a counselor at a nearby high school. Mainwaring insisted the squad train in secret.</p>
<p>Robert Bender, a lanky freshman, met Mainwaring on his first day at Syracuse. His mom parked outside his dorm and the two were unloading boxes to take up to his room when Mainwaring approached, offering to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you an athlete?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Before long, Bender was part of Mainwaring&rsquo;s squad, lured more by his presence and attitude than by any of the physical training. The freshman was struck by how Mainwaring would &ldquo;alternate between being really smiley, laughy and exuberant,&rdquo; then turn on this &ldquo;dead-on kind of expression [that looked] like he&rsquo;s kind of burrowing in to you psychologically, he&rsquo;s penetrating you psychologically. He had a very powerful way of pulling you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach pushed his mental training, and he was adamant there should be no girlfriends and no sex. These were things, Mainwaring said, that would dampen Bender&rsquo;s development as an athlete. Eventually, Bender says, the training turned physical, with the coach conducting &ldquo;physiotherapy&rdquo; that led to inappropriate touching. Bender says he pulled away after just a few experiences but couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to talk about it at the time, bowed by shame and the force of Mainwaring&rsquo;s message &ndash; secrecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said I couldn&rsquo;t talk to anyone about it. Nobody,&rdquo; says Bender, now 57. &ldquo;I think he goes after heterosexual men, having a homosexual act with a heterosexual man, and you feel ashamed about it. You don&rsquo;t want anybody to know, and he relies on that horror that his victim will be equally invested in keeping it a secret as he wants it to be a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mainwaring, an avid letter writer, emphasized the need for secrecy in correspondence with Vernon Sharples in the early 1980s. &ldquo;Naturally I expect you to keep my address to yourself [Ed.&lsquo;s note: Emphasis is in the original.] as I requested in my last letter,&rdquo; he wrote, adding, &ldquo;I do not wish anyone at all to know this.&rdquo; In another letter to Sharples, he wrote, &ldquo;I trust that you will not tell anyone where I am or what I am doing, as for the first time I can be away from the newspaper and wagging tongues and people I cannot tolerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharples says he can&rsquo;t recall why Mainwaring wanted to keep a low profile. Other than a couple of 1976 clippings from the local Leicester newspaper that touted Mainwaring&rsquo;s spot in the Olympics, searches of old papers unearthed nothing unusual. Outside the Lines found no evidence of Mainwaring having trouble with the law in the United Kingdom, though criminal records there are not available to the public.</p>
<p>Bender and six other former Syracuse students say Mainwaring used his veil of secrecy to molest them in the dorms, using virtually identical tactics.</p>
<p>During his time in Syracuse, Mainwaring also kept office hours as a counselor at nearby Nottingham High School, according to two men who say they were minors when he abused them there. School district officials told Outside the Lines they found no records that Mainwaring was ever a staff member or a sanctioned volunteer.</p>
<p>Five other local high school students say they were molested by Mainwaring during the same time period. In total, 14 men told Outside the Lines they were abused by Mainwaring in the Syracuse area.</p>
<p>Among the Nottingham students was Robert Druger, who later attended Syracuse University and ran on the track team. Now an eye surgeon and aikido instructor in Syracuse, Druger, 56, says he visited Mainwaring for &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; in dorms where Mainwaring worked. He says the abuse went on for several years. Until recently, Druger says, he compartmentalized the darker parts of the relationship while crediting Mainwaring with helping to improve his life in some ways.</p>
<p>Sitting on the back deck of his home outside Syracuse last fall, Druger says the full gravity of the abuse didn&rsquo;t hit him until the past few years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like finding out the Wizard of Oz is only this guy behind the curtain, and instead of getting courage, a heart or a brain, you found out he was a child predator and abused you 40 years ago,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>A Syracuse University spokesperson told Outside the Lines that Mainwaring completed a master&rsquo;s degree in guidance and counseling and began working toward a doctorate, which he didn&rsquo;t complete. The spokesperson says the school wasn&rsquo;t made aware of any allegations against Mainwaring until this past February, at which point law enforcement authorities were notified and the school began a review of Mainwaring&rsquo;s time on campus.</p>
<p>Mainwaring left Syracuse in the summer of 1985 for Colgate University, about 40 miles down the road in Hamilton, New York, where he worked in the admissions department. Several Syracuse squad members would visit him at Colgate, and new members joined. Among them was Brian, who spoke on the condition Outside the Lines withhold his last name. Brian was 18 when he arrived at Colgate in the fall of 1987, a jazz guitarist and successful high school athlete who had struggled with motivation. He had partied heavily in high school and was in emotional upheaval when he got to college. A sympathetic friend said he just had to meet Conrad Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got different degrees. He&rsquo;s into music. He&rsquo;s into sports. He&rsquo;s totally different,&rdquo; the friend said. &ldquo;He knows the score, basically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was that Brian found himself in Mainwaring&rsquo;s office one day, challenged to attain greatness through a mental strength and therapy session. All while being touched inappropriately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very clever, very diabolically clever because he was couching it as nonsexual,&rdquo; Brian says now.</p>
<p>But within weeks of Brian arriving at Colgate, Mainwaring was leaving for his next job. A school spokesperson confirmed that Mainwaring worked for two years in the admissions department but provided no details about why he left. Mainwaring told Brian he was headed to California for a new job, gave the young man his new number and said he could call collect anytime. In a letter to another squad member during that time, Mainwaring wrote that he was leaving for &ldquo;California Institute of Technology for my new position as Counseling Psychologist and Professor of Psychology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was only partly true.</p>
<p>‘Dragging It Out of Him’ Robert Oliver, who oversaw student housing at Caltech, said in an oral history that Mainwaring was secretive about his counseling sessions with students. “He was much too secretive about the operations.” 00:00 / 00:00 California Institute of Technology Archives</p>
<p>CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY is a school for geniuses, a science and engineering powerhouse in Pasadena, just a few miles down the road from the Rose Bowl. The university manages NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and it is perennially viewed as one of the nation&rsquo;s top tech schools &ndash; the MIT of the West.</p>
<p>By the end of September 1987, Mainwaring had, indeed, landed at Caltech. But he was neither a professor nor, formally, a counselor. He was hired as the associate master of student housing, essentially the No. 2 spot in the department that oversees student living at Caltech.</p>
<p>His arrival was covered in the student paper, which described him as &ldquo;a man whom most students find easy to talk to because of his unassuming demeanor and his smooth English accent.&rdquo; Mainwaring, the article boasted, has &ldquo;degrees in music, theology, psychology; graduate degrees in education, developmental psychology, and counseling; as well as a diploma in physiotherapy.&rdquo; The article said that Mainwaring&rsquo;s job would make him &ldquo;available for more one-to-one interactions with the students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The position came with a house near campus. Squad members visited from the East Coast, and they were impressed by his two-story digs, which had access to a swimming pool. Brian came out from Colgate, and after a workout, Mainwaring gave him a massage and masturbated him, again couched as part of mental training.</p>
<p>Mainwaring began incorporating a new facet into his teachings with Brian: God. By this point, religion had become a central part of the young man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at him like a Christian disciple because he would intersperse his weird, whacked-out teaching with Bible aphorisms here and there,&rdquo; says Brian, who has a master&rsquo;s degree from Yale Divinity School. &ldquo;Like cults use the Bible, he used it in a way that he knew had pull with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But things soon unraveled for Mainwaring at Caltech. His boss, Robert Oliver, would note that Mainwaring was &ldquo;very charming, but he didn&rsquo;t volunteer very much information, so I had to get most of what I needed to know by kind of dragging it out of him.&rdquo; Oliver is now dead, but in an audio oral history recorded in 1988, he clearly was describing Mainwaring when he talked about hiring an associate master of student housing who was &ldquo;doing a dissertation at Syracuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one hand, Oliver said, it was a smart staffing decision to hire Mainwaring, whose name he didn&rsquo;t use on the recording. With a new deputy, there was someone else to handle middle-of-the-night calls to the dorms. But deputizing this person was &ldquo;a bad thing at the same time, because I wasn&rsquo;t totally aware of all the things that were going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was much too secretive about the operations,&rdquo; Oliver says. &ldquo;Indeed, I am told that he asked the people he was counseling not to divulge information about what was going on in their counseling sessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One former Caltech student, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, told Outside the Lines that Mainwaring quickly earned a reputation for providing informal couples counseling to students and, inevitably, urging the couples to break up. The former student says that during a session with his then-girlfriend in the spring of 1988, Mainwaring said the couple&rsquo;s relationship was stalled because the man&rsquo;s sex drive wasn&rsquo;t strong enough. Mainwaring said he had a fix, though, and invited the freshman to his house. Upon arrival, the man says, Mainwaring directed him to lie down on the couch. Soon, the coach&rsquo;s lotion-filled hands were under the man&rsquo;s pants and grabbing his penis. The former student says he left immediately. He didn&rsquo;t complain at the time, but Outside the Lines has learned that another student filed a complaint about Mainwaring.</p>
<p>Caltech fired Mainwaring on July 5, 1988, less than a year after he arrived, &ldquo;following an internal investigation related to a student complaint,&rdquo; a school spokesperson wrote in an email. The spokesperson declined to provide details about the nature of the complaint and added, &ldquo;The student was not a minor, and did not want to report the alleged incident to law enforcement.&rdquo; Asked if Caltech took any actions to warn other potential employers about Mainwaring, the spokesperson said the school had no further information.</p>
<p>In total, three men told Outside the Lines they were sexually abused by Mainwaring while he was at Caltech. If other students there were molested by him on or near campus, they hadn&rsquo;t sought justice; the Pasadena Police Department said it has no records of any complaints against Mainwaring.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1990, 18 months after he was fired from Caltech, Mainwaring was hired by the University of Southern California to work in its Disability Services and Programs office. He lasted just over a year. Citing employee privacy policies, a spokesperson for USC declined to say whether the school had known about Mainwaring&rsquo;s dismissal from Caltech or comment on why he left.</p>
<p>In the decade after his departure from USC, Mainwaring kept an even lower profile than he had in the past &ndash; back when he was telling Vernon Sharples to keep his whereabouts a secret. He worked a series of random jobs and continued to coach athletes, sometimes in an official capacity. One female athlete said he coached women for a time at Santa Monica College, and a school spokesperson confirmed that Mainwaring was employed part time as a track coach during the spring of 1996.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many new squad members Mainwaring began training in the 1990s. Some old members continued to visit him and stay in contact, but Outside the Lines spoke with only one accuser who says he met the coach during that time.</p>
<p>Power of the Track Yuri Nosenko (not pictured) met Mainwaring at UCLA in 2001. Mainwaring is shown at a Los Angeles-area track earlier this year. “There was definitely this sense of … ‘Don’t even interact with women.’” 00:00 / 00:00 RACHEL BUJALSKI FOR ESPN</p>
<p>DRAKE STADIUM&rsquo;S NINE dark azure lanes make up one of the most recognizable surfaces in track. Some of the fastest humans have run there, from Jackie Joyner-Kersee to Maurice Greene.</p>
<p>The power of the track was not lost on Yuri Nosenko, newly 18 and a freshman when he was training at Drake on a fall afternoon in 2001. He was on his own &ndash; not on the UCLA track team but hoping to get there. Nosenko came from athletic cloth. His dad was once one of the Soviet Union&rsquo;s top 400-meter runners, and his mom was among that country&rsquo;s best women&rsquo;s tennis players.</p>
<p>After Nosenko had finished his workout one day, Conrad Mainwaring walked up and introduced himself as &ldquo;Coach Av.&rdquo; Mainwaring said he noticed that Nosenko seemed serious about training, and he invited the young man to join his current squad. Some of the members were UCLA students, some were not and some were Olympic-level athletes who had finished college. It was an open invitation. Mainwaring wouldn&rsquo;t charge Nosenko for his services, but there were three requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; Mainwaring said, &ldquo;No drinking or drugs. Second, no messing around with girls. And then third, you&rsquo;ve got to come to church with me once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first and third didn&rsquo;t seem like huge deals to Nosenko, and he didn&rsquo;t have a girlfriend at that point, so he agreed. Above all else, he just wanted to make the UCLA team.</p>
<p>Initially, Nosenko loved what he found. He enjoyed the training regimen, and Mainwaring was clearly legit: To Nosenko&rsquo;s surprise, the squad&rsquo;s standout member was Felix Sanchez, the Dominican American hurdler and then-Olympic hopeful. Nosenko ultimately would be one of Sanchez&rsquo;s training partners in the lead-up to the 2004 Olympics in Athens.</p>
<p>Before long, Mainwaring taught Nosenko about mental strength and began discussing testosterone levels, the purported connection between erections and athletic performance, and the importance of abstaining from masturbation. Again, secrecy was mandatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had code words for all these things,&rdquo; Nosenko says. &ldquo;&lsquo;Coffee&rsquo; was masturbation, and &lsquo;tea&rsquo; was a wet dream. There was a way to call him to schedule a therapy session. Ring once, hang up. Wait, call again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nosenko says he never discussed this part of the training with Sanchez or other members of the squad. Sanchez says he was never touched inappropriately by Mainwaring and wasn&rsquo;t aware of any allegations against his former coach until three years ago. &ldquo;I have heard a few comments since 2016, [but] to tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t believe them,&rdquo; he says, adding that he was &ldquo;fully surprised by the accusations.&rdquo; Outside the Lines spoke with several other men who say they trained with Mainwaring and had only positive experiences.</p>
<p>But Nosenko says that Mainwaring&rsquo;s apartment near UCLA &ndash; the same one he has lived in since 1990, according to public records &ndash; was a regular destination for many of the athletes who trained with Coach Avondale. Sometimes, squad members were at the apartment at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were several times when I watched him give my peers hand jobs,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;&hellip; He framed it so well as training &hellip; like, this is training, it&rsquo;s not sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the Lines spoke with 14 men who trained under Mainwaring at Drake Stadium or in the Los Angeles area from the mid-1990s to 2016 and say they were abused near campus, usually at Mainwaring&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>One man, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, competed for the UCLA track team from 2010 to 2013 and says he was coerced so artfully that a session occurred inside Mainwaring&rsquo;s apartment as the two men watched TV coverage of the Jerry Sandusky child abuse scandal.</p>
<p>Says the man, who also earned a law degree from UCLA: &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t even cross my mind that this was the same thing, that he was doing this for his own pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beginning of the End Tym De Santo&rsquo;s random blog post about a vacation improbably became a hub for Mainwaring&rsquo;s alleged victims. “Anyone that Googled him, evidently, was getting my blog.” 00:00 / 00:00 RACHEL BUJALSKI FOR ESPN</p>
<p>WHILE MAINWARING WAS busy coaching at the UCLA track, his past was beginning to catch up.</p>
<p>Two thousand miles away, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a man named Tym De Santo was just back from vacation in March 2010. He planned to write about the trip on his blog, where he called himself the Renaissance Guy. De Santo was a niche celebrity. He and his mop of blond hair appeared on the inaugural season of HGTV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Design Star,&rdquo; where he got his nickname because of his varied talents: designer, singer-songwriter, sculptor, photographer, mountain biker, former professional ski racer.</p>
<p>He wrote on the blog that he and his mother traveled to England, where the De Santo family had lived for a year when Tym was young. &ldquo;My time in UK was so pleasant and inspiring!&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>De Santo described a &ldquo;truly magical evening&rdquo; visit to Cambridge, where he &ldquo;sat in front of a long row of colleges, sipping on a cappuccino&rdquo; under the &ldquo;deepest indigo blue&rdquo; sky he had ever seen. He concluded, &ldquo;Hundreds of years of history, people, stories and events. Thank you Mom and thank you England!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a single mention of Conrad Mainwaring, whom De Santo met when he lived in England. Mainwaring later got him a job as a junior counselor at Camp Greylock in the late 1970s. There, De Santo says, Mainwaring molested him.</p>
<p>But by the time he posted about the England trip &ndash; more than three decades later &ndash; De Santo thought he had buried that past.</p>
<p>The blog item, probably read largely by close friends and family, sat dormant for a year. Then the strangest thing happened: A childhood friend of De Santo&rsquo;s named Glenn Stephens chimed in under the comments section, using an alias.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the UK,&rdquo; Stephens wrote, &ldquo;I have some Conrad Mainwaring gossip for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Santo&rsquo;s talk of England, it turns out, had triggered Stephens to remember he had seen Mainwaring several years earlier working with a group of young men at UCLA&rsquo;s Drake Stadium. Stephens had briefly trained with Mainwaring decades earlier after being introduced by De Santo. He says Mainwaring once &ldquo;tried a bad touch on me&rdquo; during a post-workout massage, at which point Stephens cut the cord.</p>
<p>At the time that Stephens made his 2011 remark on De Santo&rsquo;s blog, Mainwaring was mostly invisible on the internet, despite having been an Olympian who coached Sanchez to a gold medal in 2004. Anyone who Googled him found little. But Stephens&rsquo; blog comment would prove to be a beacon for anyone typing in Mainwaring&rsquo;s name. The first to speak up, in 2013, was Brian, the man who says he was molested by Mainwaring when he was an 18-year-old freshman at Colgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed a reference here to Conrad Mainwaring, who also goes by the alias Avondale Mainwaring,&rdquo; Brian wrote. &ldquo;He has abused many boys and young men, some of whom are my friends. While eternal justice awaits him, justice now, in history, for the victims, would be a good thing &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other comments trickled in over the next few years, until the fall of 2017, when the #MeToo movement was changing the national dialogue on sexual abuse and more people found De Santo&rsquo;s blog and shared their experiences. The details were vague, but they began to lay bare the path of destruction &ndash; from England to Greylock to Syracuse to Colgate to Southern California.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crafty SOB.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serial predator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got me and my good friend at Camp Greylock in 1977.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used his Olympic status to control me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was abused for several years by this despicable predator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grievous and utterly evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the longest and most detailed comments came from Vernon Sharples, in the U.K. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a long time to process everything,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;There is light at the end of the tunnel! We were all used and abused by Conrad. He not only stole our bodies but he stole our minds, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The network of men accusing Mainwaring jelled. Many of them had lived in pained silence. Some had spiraled into alcohol, drug or sexual addiction; others had considered suicide. Many had endured pervasive shame.</p>
<p>Now, they had found a support system. The more they connected privately through emails and phone calls, the more they discovered the similarity of their experiences &ndash; and the more emboldened they became to take action.</p>
<p>Andrew Zenoff sought out his reporter friend.</p>
<p>Others considered more direct routes to get at Mainwaring.</p>
<p>A Call to Repent Michael Waxman, shown near his home in Maine, says he was only 13 when Mainwaring molested him at Camp Greylock. “Did you then, or do you now, ever think of all the harm you’ve caused?” 00:00 / 00:00 RACHEL BUJALSKI FOR ESPN</p>
<p>BRIAN WAS AT his office in southern Connecticut early one morning in April 2013. It was about 8:30 on the East Coast &ndash; but he had designs on waking up Conrad Mainwaring three time zones to the west, using a number he found online. Here&rsquo;s how he remembers it:</p>
<p>After a few rings, Mainwaring, now 61, picks up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conrad, do you know who this is? &hellip; It&rsquo;s Brian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember me? I&rsquo;m calling you to see if you repented for molesting young men and boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve struggled with this my whole life,&rdquo; Mainwaring says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in therapy since 2002.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you stopped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped in 2002.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brian knows this isn&rsquo;t true because of what he&rsquo;s learned through the network. He details the impact Mainwaring has had on his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you to forgive me,&rdquo; Mainwaring says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what? What did you do?&rdquo; Brian wants clarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ruining your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The call lasts about 15 minutes. Mainwaring stumbles through, at once self-critical &ndash; &ldquo;There is total hypocrisy in my life because I&rsquo;m still teaching young people.&rdquo; &ndash; and at other times seething over the memory of a woman who supposedly betrayed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a false teacher,&rdquo; Brian says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re deluded. You weren&rsquo;t following Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells Mainwaring that if he is to truly repent, he needs to make a &ldquo;wholesale confession&rdquo; to all the men he wronged. Brian has a suggestion for whom to call first, and he offers a phone number.</p>
<p>A few days later, a man who asked to be referred to as Max is about to take a walk when his phone rings. Max says Mainwaring molested him starting when he was in high school in Syracuse in the early 1980s. He and Brian had connected through the survivor network and spent hours sharing their stories and feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Conrad,&rdquo; Mainwaring begins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling to ask for your forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max asks whether the sexual part of the &ldquo;training&rdquo; served any legitimate purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no logic to any of it. It was stupid, it was wrong,&rdquo; Mainwaring tells Max. He says his actions were &ldquo;Hitler-like. Everything I was doing was about control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they go back and forth, Max lays out the devastation he suffered, including thoughts of killing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been darkness that has been part of my life,&rdquo; Max says. &ldquo;I went to prostitutes and massage parlors and reenacted my experience with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mainwaring says that he has been in therapy for years, that he left education, that he wasn&rsquo;t sexually abusive anymore. He says he and a counselor he&rsquo;s been seeing &ldquo;are pretty sure I experienced an event while I was young. That something happened with my cousins. I have flashes of it.&rdquo; He says his parents left him alone in Antigua until he was 9 and that &ldquo;some sort of molestation took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be painful. I&rsquo;m sorry for what was perpetrated on you,&rdquo; Max says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more sorry that you turned around and perpetrated it on others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to answer that question. I don&rsquo;t know what to do about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. I hope you know that I&rsquo;m genuinely sorry. Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you,&rdquo; Max answers, without thinking.</p>
<p>The call lasts 44 minutes, and Max immediately records everything he can remember in his journal, which he provided to Outside the Lines. Max writes that he felt pity for Mainwaring because he was &ldquo;infected with a sickness and then infected others.&rdquo; Then Max feels angry and worried that he failed to convey &ldquo;how much sorrow, shame and demoralization I felt over 30 years.&rdquo; And by finishing the call by saying, &ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo; What was that?</p>
<p>Max writes down what he wished he had said: &ldquo;Good luck as you proceed down a path for good rather than one of destruction. Good luck processing and understanding how much you&rsquo;ve hurt young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an effort both to learn about Mainwaring&rsquo;s family history and to address his claims of abuse as a boy in Antigua, Outside the Lines reached out to his brother in England and sister in New Zealand. Neither replied. But at least two things Mainwaring told Max were lies. First, Mainwaring hadn&rsquo;t voluntarily left education &ndash; at least not at Caltech &ndash; as he had suggested. Most notably, he allegedly hadn&rsquo;t stopped abusing young athletes.</p>
<p>Nor, apparently, would he stop.</p>
<p>‘Something Weird Just Happened’ David O&rsquo;Boyle describes his feelings as he prepared to confront Mainwaring in 2016.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S EARLY EVENING, June 27, 2016, and Mainwaring is giving Benjamin a ride to his student apartment after a workout at Drake Stadium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find parking,&rdquo; Mainwaring tells Benjamin. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come up and give you the full treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past several months of training with Mainwaring, Benjamin has become a believer. His efforts to walk on to the UCLA track team haven&rsquo;t worked out, but under Mainwaring, his running times have improved, buoying his goal of making his country&rsquo;s national team. Sure, the talks about life and theories on training, the comments about testosterone and the connection between erections and athletic performance are weird, but they seem to fit into some grander plan.</p>
<p>Inside the apartment, Mainwaring has Benjamin lie on his back. Soon, he begins to work the groin area and tells Benjamin to conjure an erection. Ability to do so is an indication of high testosterone, Mainwaring says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal is to get from zero to 100,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Benjamin feels uneasy, but he is oddly pleased when Mainwaring says, &ldquo;Good, good, you&rsquo;re getting percentage quite quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eastern European athletes and coaches do this all the time,&rdquo; Mainwaring tells him. &ldquo;And the Greeks used to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mainwaring works his hands under Benjamin&rsquo;s underwear: &ldquo;To get the deep muscles, I need direct contact with the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually, Mainwaring masturbates Benjamin to completion. Benjamin lies there stunned, but almost hypnotized. He keeps thinking about the goal: higher testosterone levels, better performance.</p>
<p>After Mainwaring leaves, Benjamin replays the session over and over. He goes to his computer and searches for any information on performance and masturbation and testosterone levels. He comes up empty and texts a friend: &ldquo;Something weird just happened. I need to talk with you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Benjamin goes to bed. He has an early workout the next day at Drake. With Mainwaring.</p>
<p>Around the same time, about 30 miles away, in the L.A. suburb of Agoura Hills, 31-year-old UCLA alum David O&rsquo;Boyle is steeling himself for the next morning. He is planning to confront Mainwaring for abusing him 11 years ago. He had kept the pain mostly to himself all these years, but then he found De Santo&rsquo;s blog and learned that one man who accused Mainwaring of abuse might have been just 12 years old at the time.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Boyle can&rsquo;t stay quiet any longer. He has to do something.</p>
<p>‘It’s Over For You’ David O&rsquo;Boyle says he confronted Mainwaring partly to warn other athletes who were still training with the coach.</p>
<p>EARLY THE NEXT morning, June 28, 2016, Mainwaring picks up Benjamin outside his apartment en route to Drake, as if nothing unusual happened the night before. And O&rsquo;Boyle makes the 45-minute drive to UCLA.</p>
<p>As O&rsquo;Boyle parks and walks toward the track, he hasn&rsquo;t decided whether he&rsquo;ll record the confrontation. Marching across the infield, he can see young men stretching, and he spots Mainwaring. Adrenaline floods his brain. He decides to warn the athletes before doing anything else; he wants to do for them what nobody did for him, so he approaches the group. Benjamin looks up, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you train with this man?&rdquo; O&rsquo;Boyle asks.</p>
<p>Benjamin feels paralyzed as O&rsquo;Boyle turns to Mainwaring and stays on him, relentlessly, for 12 minutes, video rolling.</p>
<p>How are you getting away with it, you m&mdash;&ndash;f&mdash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>How do you do it? How do you get these boys to believe in you so much? How do you get them to trust you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a total master manipulator.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing this anymore. It&rsquo;s over for you.</p>
<p>Mainwaring, in a purple shirt under a black jacket, avoids eye contact. He fumbles with a stopwatch. He takes out a note pad and starts writing. He points off camera toward what appear to be some of his squad members and suggests he is going to time them.</p>
<p>Look in that camera. I want a good picture to show the cops.</p>
<p>How many boys have you molested in your life? I know at least 5, maybe 6.</p>
<p>Mainwaring tries to walk away a couple of times, with the aid of a walker he has used since having hip surgery the year before. He is carrying a large umbrella, which he uses to take occasional swipes at O&rsquo;Boyle, connecting at least once.</p>
<p>Hittin&rsquo; me with an umbrella! What are you, 7 years old? Is that when it happened to you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing this anymore. It&rsquo;s over for you. There&rsquo;s not gonna be any more boys. There&rsquo;s not gonna be any more molesting.</p>
<p>Eventually, O&rsquo;Boyle is done. He goes directly to UCLA police, where he tells an officer everything, from the alleged abuse a decade ago to the confrontation that day and Mainwaring hitting him with the umbrella. He just wants something &ndash; anything &ndash; done. He writes a letter to UCLA&rsquo;s athletic department, demanding an investigation and insisting Mainwaring be banned from the track. Several others write letters of support.</p>
<p>Benjamin, in a state of fatigue and despair, goes back to his apartment. Mainwaring calls him later that day, he says, and insists O&rsquo;Boyle is a disgruntled former athlete. Benjamin doesn&rsquo;t know what to believe, but he writes a detailed account of what happened in his apartment.</p>
<p>About two weeks later, Benjamin works up the nerve to tell his parents, who encourage him to file a report with authorities. So, UCLA police hear another account about Mainwaring. But according to Benjamin, officers suggest they can&rsquo;t bring charges because he is an adult. Any sexual contact, they say, would be seen as consensual. This contradicts California law, which states, in part, that if &ldquo;the perpetrator fraudulently represented that the touching served a professional purpose, [he] is guilty of sexual battery,&rdquo; regardless of the age of the victim.</p>
<p>Complaint to UCLA Police UCLA police took this report from Benjamin about two weeks after the runner witnessed David O&rsquo;Boyle&rsquo;s confrontation with Mainwaring.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Aug. 15, 2016, UCLA notifies Mainwaring he has been banned from campus and from working with UCLA athletes. If he doesn&rsquo;t comply, the letter says, he&rsquo;ll be subject to arrest. It reads, in part: &ldquo;We recently received several complaints that you utilized as an alleged training strategy inappropriate massaging of the genital region of male athletes,&rdquo; which complainants consider &ldquo;an assault.&rdquo; The letter also notes that UCLA police spoke with Mainwaring and that he &ldquo;acknowledged the nature of this physical contact on more than one occasion&rdquo; but &ldquo;indicated it may have been inadvertent.&rdquo; Outside the Lines was unable to review the investigative files, which are protected under state law.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Boyle later said UCLA police informed him that the umbrella strikes didn&rsquo;t merit criminal charges and that the statute of limitations had expired on his claims of sexual abuse. The department declined comment to Outside the Lines, citing confidentiality.</p>
<p>Although O&rsquo;Boyle&rsquo;s confrontation led to a small victory for those who have accused Mainwaring, none of them believed he would give up coaching. As one said, &ldquo;He was like a virus, a contagion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t through fighting him.</p>
<p>Detectives Catch a Break LAPD Detective Sharlene Johnson says it was difficult to find any cases against Mainwaring that fell within the statute of limitations until Benjamin stepped forward.</p>
<p>ROBERT DRUGER, THE Syracuse eye surgeon recruited to Mainwaring&rsquo;s squad while in high school, was at a bar mitzvah in late 2018 when he met a federal prosecutor who had handled sexual abuse cases.</p>
<p>Druger had buried his abuse for decades; he hadn&rsquo;t told anyone about it &ndash; not even his family &ndash; until he found De Santo&rsquo;s blog, linked up with others who have accused Mainwaring and contacted Outside the Lines to give his account. But once Druger opened up, there was no stopping him. His bar mitzvah conversation led to a call with a federal agent in New York, which led to a call with the FBI in Los Angeles. Druger wanted Mainwaring brought to justice, but it wasn&rsquo;t looking good.</p>
<p>New York&rsquo;s criminal statute of limitations on Druger&rsquo;s allegations was long expired, and there was no evidence that Mainwaring committed a federal crime, so the FBI forwarded the case to the Los Angeles Police Department. If Mainwaring was still involved with boys or young men, it would be a matter for the LAPD.</p>
<p>Druger spoke to LAPD Detective Danetta Menifee, relaying his experience and putting her and her partner, Detective Sharlene Johnson, in touch with others who said Mainwaring abused them. Still, there wasn&rsquo;t much the detectives could do. All of the cases were too old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a little disheartening, listening to the victims, how they were affected back then, how they&rsquo;re still affected, and knowing that [we] couldn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Johnson told Outside the Lines.</p>
<p>But then the detectives caught a break. In December, a former training partner of Benjamin&rsquo;s had encouraged him to reach out to Outside the Lines. After talking with reporters, Benjamin learned about the LAPD investigation and contacted officers, sharing his own experience.</p>
<p>The report arrived just six months before expiration of California&rsquo;s three-year statute of limitations on sexual battery by fraud &ndash; touching the genitals under false pretenses. With Benjamin, the detectives had a shot at bringing a case to the district attorney. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy. Because the allegation did not include a claim of penetration, the sexual battery was what is referred to as a &ldquo;wobbler,&rdquo; meaning it might not be charged by prosecutors as a felony.</p>
<p>In an effort to increase their chances of getting a felony filed, the detectives sought to show prosecutors that the alleged offense was part of a pattern &ndash; in this case dating back to the 1970s. So Johnson and Menifee continued chasing down men whose accounts bolstered their case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of these men didn&rsquo;t even know they were victims of crimes until more recent things started coming out in the news about women, the #MeToo movement and what was happening to them,&rdquo; Johnson says. &ldquo;&hellip; I think a lot of that has to do with &hellip; society being more open to what is and is not a crime when it comes to all spectrums of sexual assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the LAPD was building its case against Mainwaring, Outside the Lines spotted him at a local track meet and learned he was still coaching young athletes at Rancho Cienega Sports Complex, a public facility in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of March 21 of this year, reporters found Mainwaring sitting at the track alone, waiting for his athletes to show up. It was overcast, and the rush of Exposition Boulevard traffic was audible from a hundred yards off. A reporter approached, with a TV crew in tow.</p>
<p>Mainwaring sprang up, grabbed his walker and bolted, moving surprisingly fast for a 67-year-old man with hip problems. With cameras rolling and the reporter asking about the many men who accused him of sexual abuse, Mainwaring beelined across the parking lot. He refused comment, other than to accuse the reporter of harassment. Later, Outside the Lines attempted to contact Mainwaring by email, phone and a letter left at his apartment. He never replied.</p>
<p>Early on June 19, Los Angeles police arrested Mainwaring on one felony count of sexual battery by fraud, punishable by up to four years in prison. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail a few days later.</p>
<p>It is unclear who bailed him out.</p>
<p>Outside the Lines broke the story of the arrest &ndash; prompting several additional men to contact reporters and describe how Mainwaring had sexually abused them.</p>
<p>Living With the Legacy Michael Waxman, Robert Bender and Vernon Sharples describe the lasting damage they say they suffered because of Mainwaring.</p>
<p>DECADES AFTER HER eldest son confided that he had been molested by Conrad Mainwaring and then died a few days later in a hiking accident, 78-year-old Nisha Zenoff sits on a couch in her Northern California home.</p>
<p>Her condo overlooks Richardson Bay in affluent Tiburon. It&rsquo;s tranquil and picturesque &ndash; a stark contrast to the dark hole in her life all these years later.</p>
<p>Nisha is a psychotherapist, with a specialty in grief and marriage counseling. She wrote a 2017 book titled, &ldquo;The Unspeakable Loss: How do you live after a child dies?&rdquo; Today, she is showing a reporter some old photos of Victor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is a good one. &hellip; I think that one was in Mexico. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sifts through the shots and smiles. &ldquo;Everybody loved Victor. &hellip; We would always say Victor had a certain sense of loving and being kind to people. &hellip; He smiled a lot. He was happy. He had that dimple. He was easygoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then: &ldquo;That summer camp experience with Conrad absolutely changed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Victor died, Nisha says, she vowed to her then-husband and others that she would go after &ldquo;this son of a bitch, wherever he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as Nisha&rsquo;s anger became consumed by grief, she says, her sense of urgency for justice was pushed to the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think our hearts were so broken that the most we could do was grieve his death,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But for me, it was always an unfinished piece of business. Always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, she is beginning to get some answers. Her son Andrew had helped set the wheels in motion by speaking with his reporter friend, and now Nisha was hearing about what Outside the Lines had unearthed about Conrad Mainwaring:</p>
<p>There are at least 41 men who have accused Mainwaring of abusing them. Victor was the youngest, just 12. The men now range in age from 22 to 59. According to their accounts &ndash; 15 on the record &ndash; Mainwaring carried out his abuse across two continents and four states, often while employed at prestigious institutions. A handful of the men say they tried to bring Mainwaring to justice in England and the United States, only to be met with shrugs or hindered by statutes of limitations.</p>
<p>The men told virtually identical stories &ndash; of being charmed, groomed, coached and sexually molested by Mainwaring for weeks, months or years under the auspices of sports training, mental training, spiritual guidance or some combination of the three. They say their coach used his Olympic credentials, coaching achievements, relationships with accomplished athletes and expertise in psychology and physiology to persuade them to train with him, often at no charge. Many said they had little or no previous sexual experience when they met him.</p>
<p>Collectively, they rendered a detailed and consistent picture of a con man so skilled that he often conducted the abuse without his victims even realizing they were used as tools of his perversion.</p>
<p>Many described a Faustian bargain driven by their desire for athletic success, combined with a sense that Mainwaring was truly their friend, their mentor, their guide on a journey toward a better life. In fact, to this day, some of the men report feeling wildly conflicted &ndash; angry and tortured by the abuse yet convinced that some of their achievements would not have been possible without him. One man still credits Mainwaring for his becoming a doctor. Another gave Mainwaring tens of thousands of dollars over the years; that man recently found himself crying alone in his car in the wake of the coach&rsquo;s arrest. Many invited Mainwaring into their homes to meet their parents, who were equally enamored of him. In recent years, several men banded together to raise $13,000 to help pay for Mainwaring&rsquo;s hip replacement.</p>
<p>As Nisha absorbs the breadth of the accusations and Mainwaring&rsquo;s lasting impact, she distills his influence to a &ldquo;manipulation of the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a rape of the brain in that sense because it wasn&rsquo;t just an abuse of the body,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s abuse of the brain and the heart and the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For that moment, Nisha&rsquo;s analysis sounds detached, more professional than parental. But then, quickly, she is inside Victor&rsquo;s head and overwhelmed. She&rsquo;s fighting back tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pain of thinking what he must have gone through internally, holding a secret like that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I really think of [Mainwaring] as a killer. I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty strong because I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s killed anybody. But somehow, I feel like he killed Victor&rsquo;s spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.amomama.com/0275e67e726c7e16b8c041482c47f0fc2274851579830635.jpg?width=650&amp;height=340" alt="img">
Although &ldquo;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&rdquo; only aired for two seasons, it made a lasting impact on television as one of the first futuristic shows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&rdquo; aired on NBC and features Anthony &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; Rogers, who led the launch of spacecraft Ranger 3.</p>
<p>With a surprising turn of events, Rogers is found frozen 504 years into the future where he has to adapt to the year 2491. Here&rsquo;s a look at the cast since the series ended.</p>
<p>GIL GERARD</p>
<p>Astronaut Buck may have had a difficult life in the future, but the actor who played him definitely did not. Gil Gerard went on to star in several other television shows and made a name for himself.</p>

<p>Initially, Gerard worked as an industrial chemist and ever reached the vice-presidential level of his company. However, acting was at his heart since his high school days.</p>
<p>The actor first landed a role as an extra in the film &ldquo;Love Story&rdquo; before getting into commercials of over 400. Gerard&rsquo;s first lead role was in &ldquo;The Doctors&rdquo; and later founded his own production company.</p>

<p>He later landed significant roles on &ldquo;Sidekicks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nightingales,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Code 3,&rdquo; which he hosted. The actor also appeared in the movies &ldquo;Nuclear Hurricane&rdquo; and &ldquo;Action Hero Makeover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recently, Gerard became the executive producer of the series &ldquo;2491,&rdquo; which refers to the year Rogers had to adapt to.</p>

<p>ERIN GRAY</p>
<p>Star Fighter pilot Col. Wilma Deering was played by Erin Gray, who continued to have a long list of credited on-screen appearances after the show.</p>
<p>Initially, the actress was scared to play the part because of how fiction the story was. She revealed to Closer Weekly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was scared to death on the one hand. You know, &lsquo;Oh, this is science fiction, which means that everything I&rsquo;m dealing with isn&rsquo;t real.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actress said she got by with the help of her cast members, adding that Gerard was the jokester of the crew, influencing Gray to show her comedic side instead of her serious one.</p>
<p>Gray appeared in over 40 productions, including &ldquo;Silver Spoons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Police Story,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gibbsville.&rdquo; However, her career began as a model in one of the most elite companies of her time.</p>
<p>She has since founded the booking agency Heroes for Hire and said: &ldquo;I throw myself into things that are scary and hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>TOM O&rsquo;CONNOR</p>
<p>Before Tom O&rsquo;Connor starred in the show, he appeared on the long-running series &ldquo;Peyton Place&rdquo; in 1964.</p>
<p>He was already, at that time, a familiar face on television with shows including &ldquo;The United States Steel Hour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Family Classics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After playing Dr. Elias Huer on &ldquo;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,&rdquo; he starred as Jack Boland in &ldquo;General Hospital&rdquo; and Peter Falk in &ldquo;Columbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His other appearances include &ldquo;Wheels,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Man with the Power,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tail Gunner Joe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Murder in Peyton Place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps, at long last, a serial rapist and pedophile may be brought to justice, more than a dozen years after he was first charged with crimes that have brutalized countless girls and women. But what won’t change is this: the cesspool of elites, many of them in New York, who allowed Jeffrey Epstein to flourish with impunity. For decades, important, influential, “serious” people attended Epstein’s dinner parties, rode his private jet, and furthered the fiction that he was some kind of genius hedge-fund billionaire. How do we explain why they looked the other way, or flattered Epstein, even as they must have noticed he was often in the company of a young harem? Easy: They got something in exchange from him, whether it was a free ride on that airborne “Lolita Express,” some other form of monetary largesse, entrée into the extravagant celebrity soirées he hosted at his townhouse, or, possibly and harrowingly, a pound or two of female flesh.</p>
<p>If you watch Fox News, you will believe Bill Clinton was Epstein’s No. 1 pal and enabler. If you watch MSNBC, this scandal is usually all about Donald Trump. In fact, both presidents are guilty (at the very least) of giving Epstein cover and credibility. There are so many unanswered questions about Epstein, but one that looms over all of them is whether the bipartisan crowd who cleared a path for him will cover its tracks before we can get answers — not just Clinton and Trump and all those who drank at Epstein’s trough but also (among others) institutions like Harvard, Dalton, and the Council on Foreign Relations, or lawyers like the New York prosecutor Cy Vance Jr., whose office tried to downgrade Epstein’s sex-offender status; Kenneth Starr, who tried to pressure Republican Justice Department officials to keep the Epstein case from ever being prosecuted; and Alan Dershowitz, who tried to pressure the Pulitzer Prizes to shut out the Miami Herald for its epic investigative reporting that cracked open the case anew.</p>
<p>In 2015, Gawker published Epstein’s “little black book,” which had surfaced in court proceedings after a former employee took it from Epstein’s home around 2005 and later tried to sell it. He said that the book had been created by people who worked for Epstein and that it contained the names and phone numbers of more than 100 victims, plus hundreds of social contacts. Along with the logs of Epstein’s private plane, released in 2015, the book paints a picture of a man deeply enmeshed in the highest social circles.</p>
<p>Collectively, these documents constitute just a glance at the way society opened itself to Epstein in New York, Hollywood, and Palm Beach. In the weeks since his arrest, we have learned even more about the cliques he traveled in and the way they protected him. Though some observers have likened Epstein’s enigmatic rise as a glamorous social magnet to that of Jay Gatsby, a more appropriate archetype may be the fixer, sexual hedonist, and (ultimately disbarred) lawyer Roy Cohn. In the 1970s and early ’80s, Cohn was a favor broker for boldface chums as various as the top Democratic-machine politicians, the mobster Carmine “Lilo” Galante, Nancy Reagan, the proprietors of Studio 54, the Catholic Archdiocese of New York, Andy Warhol, the publishers Rupert Murdoch and Si Newhouse, Dershowitz, and the ambitious young real-estate developer Donald Trump.</p>
<p>This project is meant to catalogue how Epstein’s secure footing in elite spheres helped hide his crimes. It includes influential names listed in his black book, people he flew, funded, and schmoozed, along with others whose connections to him have drawn renewed attention. Certainly, not everyone cited here knew of everything he was up to; Malcolm Gladwell told New York, “I don’t remember much except being baffled as to who this Epstein guy was and why we were all on his plane.” Some said they never met Epstein at all, or knew of him only through his ex-girlfriend and alleged accomplice, the socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. Others backed away from him after the scandal. But all of the influential people listed here were attached in some way to Epstein’s world. The sum of their names constitutes a more concrete accounting of Epstein’s power than could any accounting of his disputed wealth. Consider this a pointillist portrait of enablement that all too chillingly overlaps with a significant slice of the Establishment.</p>

<p>Epstein kept a photo of his friend Allen, the sexual pariah, on his wall and was photographed walking with him on the Upper East Side. They had more than a neighborhood in common. For years before his relationship with Mia Farrow, Allen had carried on with a 16-year-old girl he’d met at Elaine’s named Babi Christina Engelhardt. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she wondered if she was the inspiration for Manhattan, Allen’s 1979 movie about a man in his 40s who dates a high-school student, which was nominated for two Academy Awards. Engelhardt had sex with Allen more than 100 times, she says, sometimes with Farrow. “The whole thing was a game that was being operated solely by Woody so we never quite knew where we stood,” she said. Engelhardt went on to become Epstein’s assistant.</p>

<p>Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and her husband, billionaire hedge-funder Glenn Dubin, had Epstein over for Thanksgiving dinner in 2009, telling his probation officer they were “100 percent comfortable” with his being around their teenage daughter, Insider reported. She also created a foundation so Epstein could donate to her breast-cancer charity without attaching his name. “The Dubins are horrified by the new allegations against Jeffrey Epstein,” they said in a statement. “Had they been aware of the vile and unspeakable conduct described in these new allegations, they would have cut off all ties and certainly never have allowed their children to be in his presence.”</p>
<p>Prince Andrew, The Duke of York: Looking for a friend.</p>

<p>Epstein and the second son of Queen Elizabeth II have been friends for years and were introduced, it is generally thought, by Brit Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend and longtime aide-de-camp. Epstein has entertained the prince at his townhouse, where he would toss aside regal formalities and refer to him simply, and to English ears heretically, as “Andy.” Prince Andrew has had Epstein and Maxwell to shooting parties at Sandringham House, the queen’s country retreat in Norfolk. Theirs is an unusual alliance, given their stations — the born royal and the Brooklyn boy who made it big — but its disparities may be part of the point. “Jeffrey had Andrew put on a pair of sweatpants for the first time in his life,” a source told Vanity Fair about the two. “It was Jeffrey who taught Andrew how to relax.”</p>
<p>But their relationship, and their relaxing, took on darker shades as time went on. Andrew stood by Epstein after his release from a 13-month prison sentence and was the star attraction at the party he threw to reenter society. (Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos also came.) The British press wrung its hands with equal parts pain and glee when it was discovered that Sarah, the perennially indebted Duchess of York — Fergie to her Weight Watchers fans — had accepted £15,000 from Epstein to pay off one of her creditors, a deal brokered by her ex-husband, and that a former employee at Epstein’s Palm Beach manse had alleged in a sworn deposition that the duke was a longtime guest, enjoying massages and naked pool parties. (Prince Andrew denied ever attending, or any awareness of, naked pool parties.) The ongoing affiliation with Epstein likely contributed to the end of Andrew’s duties as a U.K. trade envoy. In 2015, Virginia Roberts Giuffre alleged in a court filing that Andrew was one of the powerful friends to whom Epstein lent her out for sex. Buckingham Palace issued a statement emphatically denying the allegation. She hasn’t pressed her case further in court. But a photograph of the duke with his arm around a 17-year-old Roberts Giuffre, with Maxwell grinning beside them, didn’t help. —Matthew Schneier</p>

<p>Band, Doug: Influence peddler.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book and on Epstein’s private jet log.</p>
<p>A onetime White House intern who climbed his way to being Bill Clinton’s bag carrier, body man, fixer, and all-purpose gatekeeper, Band arranged for the former president to travel to Africa on Epstein’s 727 in 2002. Band would go on to help his boss found the Clinton Global Initiative in 2005, a choice platform from which he launched his own lucrative favor-trading corporate-advisory firm, Teneo. Throughout that time, he took a number of trips on Epstein’s plane and attended parties at his townhouse. Band resigned from his position at CGI in 2012; leaked emails later showed Band and Chelsea Clinton trading accusations of conflicts of interest in a war of influence over her parents. More recently, Band’s been teaching a “Public Service” class at NYU.</p>

<p>Denies knowing Epstein, though he appears in the black book. Recently, Baldwin invited Julie K. Brown, the Miami Herald reporter who resurfaced the Epstein story, to do a podcast.</p>
<p>Bannon, Steve: Former White House chief strategist.</p>
<p>In August 2018, the New York Post reported that Bannon had been seen entering Epstein’s townhouse. Neither Bannon nor Epstein has commented on the substance of their meeting, but when Ivanka Trump condemned Roy Moore’s campaign in Alabama, saying, “There’s a special place in hell for people who prey on children,” Bannon, who backed Moore, responded, “What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?” It was a clear reference to the woman who had accused Donald Trump and Epstein of raping her when she was 13.</p>
<p>Barr, Donald: The headmaster who offered entrée.</p>
<p>In the 1975 Dalton School yearbook. Photo: The Dalton School</p>
<p>Barr was ousted shortly before Epstein, 21 and without a college degree, showed up for his first day of work teaching math and physics at the Manhattan’s elite Dalton School in the early 1970s. Barr announced his resignation soon after, in February 1974: “He was disliked by the faculty, he was highly controversial, he hadn’t raised much money, he was very conservative,” said the board’s chairman. Barr’s leadership style was described as “authoritarian” and “undemocratic” at the time. Memorably, several former students told the New York Times that Epstein was overly familiar with teenage girls at the school. Donald’s son William would intersect with Epstein’s orbit while serving as a counsel at Kirkland and Ellis in 2009. The law firm secured Epstein his obscenely lenient 2007 non-prosecution deal, which the Justice Department is now reviewing. In July, Barr the son refused to recuse himself from the ongoing Epstein investigation.</p>
<p>Barrack, Tom: Trump adviser and private-equity manager.</p>

<p>A wealthy executive whose family established the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard, Berkman was sued in 2014 by his administrative assistant, who said she was forced to read emails Berkman had sent to a colleague containing “pictures of random and unsuspecting women on the street” — that is, creepshots. (The suit was settled.)</p>

<p>Black, Conrad: Media mogul.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>He’s perhaps best known for being sentenced to 42 months in prison for fraud, then writing a book about Trump and receiving a pardon. Vicky Ward, who profiled Epstein for Vanity Fair in 2003, said Epstein heavily leaned on Black, who is her ex-husband’s uncle (and was her ex-husband’s then-boss), to try to exert his influence on Ward.</p>
<p>Black, Leon: Private-equity tycoon.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>The billionaire co-founder of Apollo Global Management and chairman of MoMA, Black made Epstein the director of his family foundation in 2001. The foundation continued to list Epstein as director on its tax forms until 2012, four years after he had pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. The foundation now says that Epstein resigned in 2007 and that his name continued to appear on its rolls owing to a “recording error.” In 2011, he was listed as an investor in Environmental Solutions Worldwide, a Pennsylvania company, alongside several people close to Black, including his four children. Black himself was seen with Epstein at a movie screening just a few months after Epstein finished probation in 2010, and Epstein was spotted at a party at Black’s home in the Hamptons as recently as 2015.</p>
<p>Black, Roy: An Epstein lawyer.</p>
<p>The trial attorney and legal analyst’s client roster has included Justin Bieber, Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis, and Rush Limbaugh. Black is perhaps best known for representing William Kennedy Smith against rape charges in Palm Beach in 1991. (The Kennedy nephew was acquitted.) In 2005, Black played the “managing partner” on NBC’s The Law Firm, a knockoff of The Apprentice for up-and-coming lawyers.</p>
<p>Blaine, David: Magician.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>Blaine put on a private show for Epstein’s dinner guests in 2003, doing card tricks for the likes of Sergey Brin, Mort Zuckerman, and Bill Clinton aide Doug Band. The dinner was organized by Ghislaine Maxwell and included a group of young women who were introduced as Victoria’s Secret models.</p>

<p>Bolkiah, Hassanal: Sultan of Brunei.</p>
<p>Epstein had at least one meeting with the sultan when he traveled to Brunei in 2002 with Bill Clinton. Bolkiah and his brother are famous for their lavish spending, including a collection of 2,500 cars and a $1.5 billion palace. Bolkiah was once sued by Miss USA 1997, who claimed she had been held as a sex slave. The suit was dismissed on the grounds that Bolkiah had sovereign immunity.</p>

<p>What seems new, in flipping through the reams of society photos of perhaps the world’s most prolific sexual predator that have been circulating over the past few weeks, is not the powerful and the beautiful who surrounded Epstein, but the intellectuals — the Richard Dawkinses, the Daniel Dennetts, the Steven Pinkers. All men, of course. But the group selfies probably shouldn’t have been a surprise — documents of an age in which every millionaire doesn’t just fancy himself a philosopher-king but expects to be treated as such, and every public intellectual wants to be seen as a kind of celebrity.</p>
<p>Cultural shifts like these require visionaries, networkers, salespeople. Brockman is one. A Warhol Factory kid turned freelance philosopher of science turned literary agent to Dawkins and Dennett and Pinker (and many others), in the 1980s he formed a casual salon of like-minded scientists and futurists that came to be known as the Reality Club, a knock against the poststructuralism then dominant in the academy. In the 1990s, he rebranded it as the Edge Foundation, an organization whose central event was an annual online symposium devoted to a single, broad question. In 2000, it was “What is today’s most important underreported story?” In 2006, “What is your dangerous idea?”</p>
<p>Epstein was a regular contributor, and his plane — to judge from the photographs, at least — was an especially appealing way for other contributors to get to ted. They could also catch Epstein at Harvard, where so many of them taught and where he became so prolific a donor that one whole academic program seemed to be run like his private Renaissance ateliers. Epstein had long described himself as a “scientific philanthropist,” and in a press release put out by the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation announcing its “substantial backing” of Edge, he called it “the world’s smartest think tank.”</p>
<p>Many in Brockman’s Edge community are, or were, inarguably significant figures in the American intellectual Establishment: Freeman Dyson, Jared Diamond, Craig Venter, John Horgan, Paul Bloom (to name a random but representative sample). They are also among the gods and heroes of the Trump-era internet community of “freethinkers,” whom Eric Weinstein, the venture capitalist and regular Edge contributor, memorably called “the intellectual dark web.” The name suggests a self-glamorizing style of dangerous discourse, and as soon as the community was identified, it was criticized as revanchist, an effort to reopen areas of intellectual inquiry — about innate differences between the races, say, or the genders — now considered problematic, at a minimum. But to listen to the IDW warriors themselves — talking about the “war on free speech” as though their universities had sent assassins their way rather than tenured chairs — their crusade seems motivated just as much by a thin-skinned sense of their own world-historical significance. They were special people, deserving of special acclaim and, of course, special privileges.</p>
<p>Many contributions to Edge were plausibly the products of genuinely special minds. Epstein’s were not. In 2008, the year he went to jail for prostitution, the prompt was “What have you changed your mind about?” Epstein replied, “The question presupposes a well defined ‘you’ and an implied ability that is under ‘your’ control to change your ‘mind.’ The ‘you’ I now believe is distributed amongst others (family friends, in hierarchal structures), i.e. suicide bombers, believe their sacrifice is for the other parts of their ‘you.’ The question carries with it an intention that I believe is out of one’s control. My mind changed as a result of its interaction with its environment. Why? Because it is a part of it.”</p>
<p>“Jeffrey has the mind of a physicist,” the Harvard professor Martin Nowak has said, incredibly. But what he really did have was the life of a very rich person — unable to see any world he felt unqualified to enter and surrounded by too many people enamored with his money to ever hear the word no. —David Wallace-Wells</p>
<p>Bronfman Jr., Edgar: Executive.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>The former Warner Music Group CEO, son of the late Seagram’s CEO Edgar Bronfman Sr., is related to the NXIVM-sex-cult Bronfmans. His son has a child with pop star M.I.A.</p>
<p>Brunel, Jean-Luc: Model scout.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book and on Epstein’s private jet log.</p>
<p>Brunel was accused in court testimony of having used his agency to supply Epstein with girls. (He was not charged.) He also has a long history of allegations that he had abused his fashion-world position. In 1988, he was the subject of a 60 Minutes investigation alleging that he and a fellow agent sexually assaulted nearly two dozen models. He denied the claims but later told Model author Michael Gross, “You get laid tonight with a model, is that a crime?” In 2005, Brunel co-founded the Mc2 modeling agency; Epstein invested $1 million, according to a 2010 deposition.</p>
<p>Buck, Joan Juliet: Fashion editor.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>In 2003, Buck met Maxwell at a fashion party at a New York City boutique. Buck had recently moved on from her seven-year tenure as the editor of Paris Vogue and was writing for its American counterpart and living in New Mexico. She was a lifelong resident of a rarefied social world. Maxwell, a regular on that particular circuit, quickly made a connection. “Oh, Jeffrey’s got a ranch in Santa Fe, blah blah blah,” Buck recently remembered their conversation going. She gave Maxwell her Santa Fe number and later asked a friend about Epstein and New Mexico. “His ranch?” the friend replied. “As we say in Texas, all hat, no cattle.”</p>

<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book and on Epstein’s private jet log.</p>
<p>Burkle took what were described as humanitarian trips to Africa with Bill Clinton on Epstein’s private Boeing 727. According to a 2008 Vanity Fair feature about the former president, “Burkle’s usual means of transport is the custom-converted Boeing 757 that Clinton calls ‘Ron Air’ and that Burkle’s own circle of young aides privately refer to as ‘Air Fuck One.’ ”</p>

<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>An investor in Uber, Calacanis was a fixture in the early-aughts New York tech scene as the founder and editor of Silicon Alley Reporter. (“I can’t tell you how many propositions I get, it’s absolutely insane,” he told the Observer in 2000.) In 2014, Vice awarded him Most Offensive Tweet of the Year for describing as racist the idea of white privilege.</p>

<p>According to journalist Vicky Ward, he killed portions of a 2003 story that accused Epstein of pedophilia after an office visit from Epstein. (Carter says there wasn’t enough on-the-record sourcing.) “I didn’t invent the system. I just lived by the system,” he said when The New York Times Magazine questioned him about the story last week.</p>

<p>Clinton, Bill: President and problem.</p>
<p>Name found on Epstein’s private jet log.</p>
<p>As soon as the Epstein news broke two weeks ago, the taunting and tallying began, suffocating in its familiarity. First were the jeering reminders, as if we didn’t know it in our every molecule: It wasn’t just Donald Trump who’d be ensnared in this stygian nightmare of underage sexual assault and trafficking of girls, it was Bill Clinton, who’d been a friend and repeat flier on Epstein’s plane. Then came the numbers, the attempts to quantify the nature of the Clinton-Epstein relationship. Clinton issued a statement toting up four plane trips, one Epstein meeting in Clinton’s Harlem office, one visit to Epstein’s home, and zero trips to his island. Meanwhile, reporters recalled that Gawker’s published flight logs had tallied 12 separate plane legs and that Epstein had more than 20 numbers and email addresses for Clinton and one signed photo of him in his home, along with one of Woody Allen and one of Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>All of this was presented as if these numbers could clarify some exact science of guilt or complicity. The reality is: Yes, Clinton was grimy and had grimy friends, and, more broadly, this is how powerful men have behaved toward women and one another. Yes, we know it’s dirty and mean and exhausting and true.</p>
<p>We know, of course, because the shadow of Clinton’s sexual history and his associations with other men who have terrible legacies of sexually inappropriate-to-criminal behavior have for decades hung like a greasy and unscrubbable film over the Democratic Party he once led. Clinton palled around not just with Epstein but with Charlie Rose and Harvey Weinstein and Trump himself.</p>
<p>They hung out together and flew together and went to each other’s offices and visited each other’s homes and appeared on each other’s TV shows and had each other’s phone numbers and attended each other’s weddings and created a circle of money and protection. The prosecutorial and defensive math — the haggling over flights and phone numbers — is just used to complicate this basic reality.</p>
<p>Those on the left have been going over how we’re supposed to feel about him for decades, but in the arguing about it, we have been asked to focus again and again on Clinton and his dick and what he did or didn’t do with it. The questions we’ve asked ourselves and one another have become defining.</p>
<p>Are we morally compromised in our defense of him or sexually uptight in our condemnation? Are we shills for having not believed he should have resigned, or doing the bidding of a vindictive right wing if we say that, in retrospect, he probably should have?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, how much energy and time have been spent circling round this man and how we’ve felt about him, when in fact his behaviors were symptomatic of far broader and more damaging assumptions about men, power, and access to — as Trump has so memorably voiced it — pussies?</p>
<p>After all, Clinton was elected president during a period that may turn out to be an aberration, just as the kinds of dominating, sexually aggressive behaviors that had been norms for his West Wing predecessors had become officially unacceptable, and 24 years before those behaviors would again become a presidential norm. So yes, Clinton got in trouble, yet still managed to sail out of office beloved by many, his reputation as the Big Dog mostly only enhanced by revelations of his exploits.</p>
<p>But the election of Trump over Clinton’s wife, and the broad conversation around sexual assault and harassment that has erupted in its wake, has recast his behavior more profoundly. The buffoonery, the smallness and tantrums of Trump, has helped make clear what always should have been: that the out-of-control behavior toward women by powerful men, the lack of self-control or amount of self-regard that undergirded their reckless treatment of women, spoke not of virility or authority but of their immaturity. And the people who have paid the biggest price for these men’s fixation on sex as a measure of manhood have, of course, not been the men themselves.</p>
<p>In Clinton’s case, it has been Monica Lewinsky, whose life and name became defined by her relationship to him. It has been his wife, Hillary, who, in addition to having been celebrated and pilloried for her defense of her husband, also had to conduct one of her three historic presidential debates with women who’d accused him of sexual misconduct sitting in the audience, invited there by her opponent as props to unsettle and disempower her. It has been decades of left feminist women who have had Clinton’s misdeeds thrown in our faces as proof of our own hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I try sometimes to imagine a contemporary Democratic Party without Bill Clinton in its recent past — yes, of course, from a policy perspective, but also simply from a personal one. What if so much energy had not been eaten up by his colleagues, by his wife, by feminists, by his supporters and friends and critics, all of whom had to dance around him, explain their associations with him, or carefully lay out their objections to him without coming off as frigid reactionaries?</p>
<p>What else might we have done with our politics had we not been worrying about Clinton and his grubby buddies? What further power have they taken from us? —Rebecca Traister</p>

<p>For around a decade, Dershowitz kept casual company with Epstein, who introduced him to his friends, like Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>(Dershowitz says he and the prince ended up not getting along because they disagreed about Israel.) Dershowitz visited Epstein’s mansions in New York and Palm Beach and occasionally accompanied him on his private plane. He says these trips were family oriented. Once, Epstein lent him the Palm Beach home so he could attend a granddaughter’s soccer tournament. Another time, he and his nephew flew down to watch a space launch with another Epstein connection, a top NASA official. He and his wife, Carolyn Cohen, once stayed with Epstein on his island in the Caribbean, where they were joined by another Harvard professor and his family.</p>
<p>When Epstein first started to attract media attention in the early aughts, mainly because of his friendship with former president Bill Clinton, Dershowitz served as a character witness for the reclusive financier.</p>
<p>He told Vanity Fair that he shared manuscripts of his books with Epstein before they were published and swore that his money was irrelevant. “I would be as interested in him as a friend if we had hamburgers on the boardwalk in Coney Island and talked about his ideas,” he told the magazine.</p>
<p>But Dershowitz says their interactions changed in 2005, when Epstein faced a local police investigation into his relations with underage girls in Palm Beach and he hired Dershowitz as a lawyer. With his assistance, Epstein was able to whittle down the state’s indictment against him to a single count of soliciting prostitution. But in the years to come, as Epstein’s legal problems compounded, they would eventually ensnare Dershowitz himself. He is also accused of having sex with two of Epstein’s alleged victims. “The stories are so phantasmological,” Dershowitz says. He recognizes that the #MeToo movement has surfaced countless accounts of preposterous-sounding sexual misbehavior by powerful men and almost all of them have turned out to be true. But Dershowitz swears he is different. “Mine is the only case, singular, the only one, where I never met the people,” he says. “There’s no evidence we’ve ever met, no evidence we were ever in the same place at the same time, ever.”</p>
<p>Today, Dershowitz claims he and Epstein were never really even friends, despite their proximity. “He was an acquaintance,” he says. “In retrospect, I wish I hadn’t taken the case, but I didn’t see a problem with taking the case. We didn’t have a close personal relationship.” —Andrew Rice</p>

<p>Greenberg, Ace: Bear Stearns chairman, Epstein’s first patron.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein didn’t have any formal training when he started working at Bear Stearns in 1976, but that wouldn’t have mattered to then-CEO Alan “Ace” Greenberg, who famously hired “PSD degrees,” short for “poor, smart, with a deep desire to be rich.” As it happened, Epstein was all three. He came from a modest Coney Island background, had no college degree, and worked a job — as a math teacher at Dalton and a tutor to Greenberg’s son — that was unlikely to support his tastes, which were apparently of the private islands–and–gilded desk–purportedly–belonging–to–J. P. Morgan variety. At Bear Stearns, Epstein made a name for himself in the “special-products division,” essentially figuring out how to help the rich pay less taxes. “He would recommend certain tax-advantageous transactions,” Greenberg’s protégé, James “Jimmy” Cayne, told New York in 2002. Cayne, who succeeded Greenberg in 1993, seems to have become the closer party to Epstein, whose mysterious departure from the firm he publicly defended decades after Epstein’s departure. “Jeffrey said specifically, ‘I don’t want to work for anybody else. I want to work for myself,’ ” Cayne insisted, despite transcripts from an SEC deposition that suggest other concerns around them both. It’s easier to imagine Cayne, a cigar-chomping, archetypal fat cat who was infamously off playing bridge when Bear Stearns collapsed in 2008, as a member of Epstein’s inner circle than his mentor, a folksy, bow-tie-wearing soul who referred to his successor as “crude,” “full of himself,” and “warped” in a memoir published shortly before his death. At the very least, it seems Cayne and Epstein were both capable of, ah, massaging the truth. —Jessica Pressler</p>

<p>Hoffenberg, Steven: A mentor and a con man.</p>
<p>Before Bernie Madoff, there was Hoffenberg, who in 1985 pleaded guilty to cheating investors out of $460 million — at the time, the largest Ponzi scheme ever. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison and, after his release in 2013, began sounding the alarm on Epstein, who had worked at Hoffenberg’s Towers Financial Corporation after leaving Bear Stearns. He claimed that Epstein had been his co-conspirator in the scheme and that Epstein’s fortune was built on Towers Financial’s fraud. “He was great at moving money illegally,” Hoffenberg says. “He was the deeper architect to getting things accomplished.”</p>
<p>Hoffenberg claims he was introduced to Epstein by Douglas Leese, a mysterious British arms dealer, and that he paid Epstein $25,000 a month as Towers Financial began making risky plays to take over companies like Pan American World Airways and Emery Air Freight. Advisers on the Pan Am deal included Richard Nixon’s attorney general John Mitchell, Nixon’s brother Edward, and John Lehman, a former secretary of the Navy. The move fell apart after the Lockerbie bombing, and when Towers Financial later went belly-up, Hoffenberg says, the two of them engineered a Ponzi scheme to fill the hole.</p>
<p>“He has a magnificent personality,” Hoffenberg says. “He’s very easy to interact with, very social, very easy to bond with, an unusually nice person. And he’s pretty dynamic on financial savvy. He could move money in different areas to get the stock prices to go up and down.”</p>
<p>Hoffenberg still owes his victims some $1 billion in restitution, and in 2016 he sued Epstein to recover some of the money. (He eventually dropped the suit.) Last year, two victims brought a suit against Epstein making the same claims as Hoffenberg but voluntarily dismissed the suit two months later.</p>
<p>“You’re about to see an entire story about this supposed billionaire and the story about his financial empire, which is as big as the tragedy with the girls,” Hoffenberg says. “It’s billions of dollars, and it’s a fiasco.” —James D. Walsh</p>

<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book and on Epstein’s private jet log.</p>
<p>In a world where most women still work for men, and where their jobs are overwhelmingly in the “service” or “caring” professions, it should surprise no one that Epstein’s procurers, schedulers, fixers, and enablers were female.</p>
<p>Four women — Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, Adriana Ross, and Lesley Groff — were identified in the 2007 Florida case against Epstein as possible co-conspirators, though none was charged.</p>
<p>Among public figures named in the black book are over 100 listings for “massages”: female names divided by location and descriptors like “big-boned,” “red head,” or “speaks NO English.”</p>
<p>History is full of the self-serving enabling of men by women, ending with the Trump court but not starting there. Was it money? Probably. The word is that Epstein paid his “executive assistants” $200,000 a year and let them order takeout from Le Cirque. When Groff had a baby, Epstein gave her a Mercedes and paid for a full-time nanny. “There is no way I could lose Lesley to motherhood,” he told the New York Times in 2005 (for a front-page story on the indispensability of good help for Wall Street tycoons).</p>
<p>Marcinkova, referred to in court documents as Epstein’s “sex slave,” hails from the former Yugoslavia; Ross, a model, is from Poland. Kellen (who has since married a NASCAR driver) was a scheduler, making sure that Epstein always had a slate full of girls, and it was she who sometimes walked the girls up the stairs in the Florida mansion and laid the oils out on the massage table. Marcinkova would have sex with the girls for Epstein’s viewing pleasure and sometimes all together. Groff booked travel, and Ross also helped with the calendar. After the Miami Herald published its investigation in 2018, Epstein wired the “possible co-conspirators” $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, prosecutors say, to buy their silence. Since then, none of them have been reached for comment. —Lisa Miller</p>

<p>Khashoggi, Adnan: Saudi Arabian man of mystery.</p>
<p>To bolster their argument that private-jet owner Epstein is a massive flight risk, SDNY prosecutors produced an expired Austrian passport under an alias that listed Saudi Arabia as Epstein’s primary country of residence. His lawyers claim the fake ID was for the “personal protection” of “an affluent member of the Jewish faith” traveling in the Middle East, but it could also point to one of his more secretive income sources.</p>
<p>According to his former friend the journalist Jesse Kornbluth, in the mid-1980s Epstein said he “worked for governments to recover money looted by African dictators” and occasionally subcontracted to those same autocrats to “help them hide their stolen money.” A source who spoke with journalist Vicky Ward said one of Epstein’s clients was the late Saudi arms dealer Khashoggi, a middleman in the Iran-Contra scandal who helped smuggle cash for the Marcos family out of the Philippines. In 1988, Khashoggi was arrested in Switzerland for concealing assets and later faced fraud and racketeering charges in the U.S. (He was later acquitted.) That year, he sold his 282-foot yacht to the Sultan of Brunei, who soon flipped it to Donald Trump. —Matt Stieb</p>

<p>Krauss, Lawrence: Cosmologist.</p>
<p>Epstein was a major donor to his program at Arizona State University, and Krauss teamed with the financier to host a conference of Nobel laureates in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2012. “Jeffrey has surrounded himself with beautiful women and young women, but they’re not as young as the ones that were claimed,” he told the Daily Beast in 2011. “I always judge things on empirical evidence, and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him but I’ve never seen anything else. So as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other people. I don’t feel tarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey. I feel raised by it.” This spring, Krauss retired amid allegations of his own sexual harassment.</p>

<p>She was there at the socialites’ dos: Cornelia Guest’s holiday bash, Georgette Mosbacher’s party for the writer Michael Gross. At real-estate mogul Aby Rosen’s birthday, at Harvey Weinstein’s cocktail party. At film screenings and store openings and fashion shows, at Tina Brown’s home and Arianna Huffington’s and the Time 100 Gala. For years, though not lately, Maxwell was a constant on the New York social scene in its most Upper East iteration. She was a friend of everyone, if an intimate of few.</p>
<p>Maxwell seemed to know many rich and powerful men — articles mention her dining with Bill Clinton, photos show her partying with Elon Musk and deep in conversation with Stephen Schwarzman — but her most durable connection has been with Epstein. She was, as he once put it, his “best friend.” Maxwell, 57, has been accused in civil suits of serving as his procuress, luring women and girls into Epstein’s web.</p>
<p>In court documents, Epstein’s accusers allege that Maxwell — who denies all and has never been criminally charged — acted as a recruiter, an instructor, and in some cases a participant in the abuse he practiced. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims Maxwell recruited her on behalf of Epstein when Giuffre was a 16-year-old spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, where Epstein has a home, said much of her grooming came from Maxwell. “The training started immediately,” Giuffre said in a video interview with the Miami Herald. “It was everything down to how to give a blow job, how to be quiet, be subservient, give Jeffrey what he wants.”</p>
<p>“Every pretty girl in New York, in those days, Ghislaine would invite to Jeffrey’s,” said Euan Rellie, an investment banker and social fixture who has known Maxwell for years and who, along with his wife, the author and socialite Lucy Sykes, was a fellow guest at a dinner for Prince Andrew at Epstein’s townhouse in the early aughts. Maxwell and Epstein had been attached, but she was “now an employee of his, as I understood it,” Rellie said. “Her job was to jazz up his social life by getting fashionable young women to show up.” He presumed the young women to be in their 20s.</p>
<p>Tabloid reports on Maxwell claim she managed Epstein’s properties from his office on Madison Avenue, which appeared in public records for many years as one of Maxwell’s addresses. Epstein, for his part, said she wasn’t on the payroll, yet she did errands for him: hunted for a yoga teacher in California and acted as intermediary when he wanted to give his friend the billionaire Les Wexner a family portrait painted by Nelson Shanks.</p>
<p>She was said to be wickedly funny and unusually knowledgeable, glamorous, and, on top of that, British. (“I think New Yorkers are charmed by that high-end English accent,” photographer Patrick McMullan said.)</p>
<p>What’s more, she was exotic. She had explored the seas and could pilot a helicopter, or maybe a submarine, one acquaintance thought — a MacGyver of the gala circuit.</p>
<p>Maxwell arrived in New York in the early ’90s, on the cusp of her 30th birthday. English-born and poshly educated, she was the favorite daughter of Robert Maxwell, the English media mogul, whose holdings included newspapers, notably the tabloid Daily Mirror in London, and the Macmillan publishing house in the U.S. Ghislaine had founded a social club for women in London and worked for another of her father’s papers, and, according to the New York Post, she came as his emissary to American society when he bought the New York Daily News in 1991.</p>
<p>But that same year, Robert was found dead — by suicide, murder, or accident (the official inquest’s ruling, though opinions vary) — in the Atlantic, off the Canary Islands. (He was last seen on the deck of his yacht, the Lady Ghislaine.) Soon after, he was discovered to have plundered the pension funds of the Mirror to shore up his floundering empire. Ghislaine was reported to have an income for life from a family trust, but at £80,000 a year, it would hardly be enough to sustain a high-flying lifestyle.</p>
<p>The meet-cute of Epstein and Maxwell in New York is unclear, and neither has historically gone into any great detail. By 1992, they were already linked, showing up at a Mar-a-Lago party with each other in Palm Beach, where Trump and Epstein ogled women together in front of NBC cameras. Suffice it to say they were romantically linked and then platonically linked. (Epstein told people his former paramours move “up, not down,” to friend status.)</p>
<p>For a woman seen everywhere about town, she is curiously silent in the press, except where ocean conservation is concerned. In 2008, she hosted a cocktail party for the board of the nonprofit Oceana at her townhouse on East 65th Street. And by 2012, she had launched the TerraMar Project, a conservation nonprofit of her own, of which, according to tax filings, she was president but from which she drew no salary. She gave a ted Talk about its work and talked it up at the U.N. and in the press, which credited TerraMar as her “brainchild.”</p>
<p>From the New York social world, she has vanished. “I have not seen her in a zillion years,” one acquaintance said. The party photos dried up in 2016. Her 65th Street townhouse was sold for just over $15 million that year. Where is she now? One social-watcher guessed the islands; others think Europe. She incorporated a company — Ellmax, a play on her name — in the U.K., and TerraMar’s last two years of tax filings listed the address of an accounting firm near Boston. (An executive there declined to provide any forwarding information.)</p>
<p>“She seemed like a woman who didn’t have any real job, didn’t have any real boyfriend, had lost her dad,” Rellie said of his impressions of her when they’d met. “A woman adrift who was clinging on to whatever she could find.” —Matthew Schneier</p>

<p>Pinker is one of the famous intellectuals most often linked to Epstein, but he says he flew on Epstein’s private plane only once in 2002 and that he was involuntarily placed next to him for a picture at Lawrence Krauss’s Origins Project’s annual conference in 2014: “If I had more wherewithal, I would not have indulged my friend in sitting with him. Despite what various friends and colleagues all said about what a genius he was, I found him tedious and distasteful. Even before I knew about the criminality, I found it irritating to talk to him, all the more so because the reason he was in the conversation was because he had given money to these various projects. He likes schmoozing with smart and intellectual people, but he couldn’t really or had very little interest in exploring an issue. He’d wisecrack, change subjects, or get bored after a few seconds. He’s a kibitzer more than a serious intellectual.” Nevertheless, Pinker supplied some linguistic expertise that his friend Alan Dershowitz used to defend Epstein during the 2008 trial. —Matt Stieb</p>
<p>Pinto, Alberto: Interior designer for the gold-leaf life.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book and on Epstein’s private jet log.</p>
<p>Forget for a moment the mural featuring Epstein in the middle of a prison yard complete with guards and barbed wire. Let’s also forget the life-size doll hanging from a chandelier, and the chess set with figures of his staff as pieces to play with. Let’s instead focus on the very lush Euro-Orientalist décor of Epstein’s 21,000-square-foot seven-story Beaux-Arts mansion, decorated by none other than the late great Alberto Pinto, one of the world’s top prestige interior designers. His clientele included princes, moguls, and wannabe princes, as captains of industry so frequently are, and Epstein clearly aspired to that provenance and history. He flew Pinto on his private plane, as he did other architects and designers (Jean-Michel Gathy, Ricardo Legorreta, and Peter Marino are also listed in Epstein’s flight logs), and lived like a modern pasha in rooms lavished with money that bought custom-tooled gold leather walls (at least they were made to look like tooled-leather walls) and leopard-print upholstered armchairs in the dining room that appear to be covered in silk velvet. It was exactly the sort of project Pinto relished, flexing all the artisanal muscle that a designer of his stature can exercise when cushioning his client’s home. —Wendy Goodman</p>

<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>You learn things answering phones, and in the spring of 2005, answering Charlie Rose’s phone at his PBS show, you would learn that his friend Jeffrey Epstein had some recommendations to make for whom Rose ought to hire as his next assistant. Written call logs from 2005 and 2006 show Epstein and his own assistant calling dozens of times, making plans for lunch and tea in Manhattan or to try to meet up in Paris. Epstein also called with a total of five women’s names and phone numbers. One woman was described as “world’s most perfect assistant she used to work for Harvey Weinstein he’s lucky if he can get her.” Another entry reads, “Jeffrey Epstein wants to talk to you before you call these two girls.” A fourth woman shows up on the manifests of Epstein’s jet, including on Bill Clinton’s trip across Africa, and wound up working at the Clinton Foundation. Two former staffers remember another Epstein referral, a young woman not mentioned in the logs, who interned at the show. In all, Rose hired three (“Jeffrey Epstein from time to time recommended various candidates for open positions at the Charlie Rose Show,” Rose’s representative said in a statement, but said the ex-host only learned about Epstein’s alleged abuse years later, when he pleaded guilty in Florida). When I called one of these women recently, she was stunned to learn she was one of many women Epstein recommended for the job. “I was being offered up for abuse,” said the woman, who was 22 at the time she worked for Rose. It helped her understand not only how her boss Rose — whom in 2017 she would accuse, along with 34 other adult women, of sexual harassment — had treated her, but also how the rest of the staff had seen her. And it helped her understand a grim version of networking among powerful men. —Irin Carmon</p>

Epstein also gave to a handful of politicians in New Mexico, where he’d purchase the Zorro Ranch from former governor Bruce King and where he was not required to register as a sex offender. In recent weeks, politicians including Schumer decided to donate an equal amount to charity.</p>

<p>Siegal, Peggy: Elite New York’s glue.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>A brazen and relentless publicist of the old school, Siegal understands one thing well: “Bringing people together. Everyone needs to feel that they belong.” At least a certain kind of accomplished person, no matter, frankly, how they went about getting there (who was she to judge?). Known for her movie premieres and other guest-list-driven social events, she bragged that she “ruined the Hamptons” to Vanity Fair in a profile back in 1996.</p>
<p>Publicity-party invites are an amoral game, driven by status and FOMO. Like everyone, she worked with Harvey Weinstein when he was an Oscar machine, the toast of the town. So you can’t blame Siegal for including someone who already knew all the boldface power people. In 2008, in the teeth of the accusations against Epstein, he was spotted by a New York party reporter, “unshaven, smiling that feline-monkey grin,” at the Siegal-engineered screening of the HBO film Bernard and Doris at the Time Warner Center. But after prison, apparently Epstein needed her more than ever: In a Times story on how Manhattan’s A-list refused to shun him, Siegal in particular was willing to help him (for free, apparently), “using her gate-keeping powers to usher Mr. Epstein, a friend, into screenings and events.” In 2010, she threw a dinner party at his Upper East Side townhouse for Prince Andrew, Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, Charlie Rose, and Woody Allen. She and Epstein might have had other reasons to get along: Siegal, who has just turned 72, is a self-invention as well, without a particularly pedigreed background. Also notable is the fact that, as she told Vanity Fair in 2012, “my favorite way to travel” to Cannes is “on a friend’s G5 from Teterboro to Nice.” —Carl Swanson</p>

<p>Starr, Kenneth: Former United States solicitor general.</p>
<p>Obviously, lawyers do not share guilt for their clients’ crimes. But it’s striking that Kenneth Starr chose to join Jeffrey Epstein’s defense team in 2007, after his moral fulminations against Bill Clinton’s sexual perfidy. His obsessive pursuit of President Clinton made him a folk hero on the right, representing the defense of traditional sexual virtue and the notion that it was under assault by Bill Clinton and the liberal elite. His special-prosecutor exploits propelled him to the presidency of the conservative Baptist Baylor University. During his tenure, the football program engaged in a horrific pattern of sexual abuse that led to the dismissal of the football coach and the removal of Starr after an investigation found “actions by University administrators that directly discouraged some complainants from reporting or participating in student conduct processes.”</p>
<p>It is perhaps coincidental, but Starr has tracked the broader conversion of the religious right from sexual shaming to sexual shamelessness. In an era when Donald Trump has exposed the hollowness of so many values conservatives allegedly hold dear, it is fitting that this Zelig of right-wing sexual hypocrisy has made yet another cameo. —Jonathan Chait</p>

<p>By the time the accusations of Epstein trafficking in girls surfaced, Larry Summers was out as Harvard’s president, having alienated much of the faculty, including two black professors who jumped ship, and spitballing about women’s biological inferiority in the sciences. But his tenure — 2001 to ’06, bookended by serving as Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary and Barack Obama’s director of the National Economic Council — overlapped with a high-water mark of Harvard’s love affair with Epstein. Epstein, reads a story published in the Harvard Crimson in 2003, “has found Harvard the perfect staging ground for his intellectual pursuits.” Then-president Summers didn’t comment, but Alan Dershowitz confided that Epstein “speaks well of Larry, and I think he admires Larry’s economic thinking.” Lucky Larry, to be recognized by such an eminence.</p>
<p>Epstein, of course, was not an alumnus of Harvard (or anywhere), or a faculty member, but he was a donor. Asked by the Crimson in 2006 whether Epstein’s $6.5 million donation should be returned, interim president Derek Bok referred to an earlier statement that Harvard has no “obligation to investigate each donor and impose detailed moral standards.” Summers imposed his own moral standards, hitching a ride on Epstein’s plane. (A representative had no comment.) Even after Epstein registered as a sex offender, the Boston Globe reported, Summers’s wife, Harvard English professor Elisa New, accepted Epstein’s $110,000 donation to her PBS poetry show. —Irin Carmon</p>

<p>Trump, Donald: President and partygoer.</p>
<p>Name found in Epstein’s black book.</p>
<p>At a party at Mar-a-Lago on November 1992. Photo: via NBC</p>
<p>There it was, yet another tape. This time, the now-president was filmed, in footage dredged up by NBC, in 1992 at Mar-a-Lago, hosting a party attended by a bevy of Buffalo Bills cheerleaders — and Epstein, from whom Trump has tried to distance himself since the arrest. He knew him only like anyone else in Palm Beach knew him, he said recently, although there were several entries for Trump in the black book, including a “direct emergency contact,” and 17 years ago Trump had boasted to this magazine that he’d known him forever and that he was a “terrific guy.”</p>
<p>It’s not just the denial in the face of evidence that, yes, he really did hang out with the guy that makes this set of film so classically Trumpian. The tape distills Trump to a certain essence: In this frame, he dances, snapping his fingers and spinning, surrounded by women — but profoundly alone, backing off and avoiding eye contact the second a woman moves in to dance with him. In another frame, he smiles with self-satisfaction as a crowd of women chants his name. Surrounded by a group of cheerleaders about to pose for a picture, he reaches around the waist of one and pulls her sharply in to him, then briskly cups her behind in a businesslike, joyless fashion while she reaches for her hair to maintain smiling composure. It’s as if he thinks it’s his vaguely grim duty, as an American man playing the campiest possible version of swinging billionaire bachelor, to grab the closest available body part.</p>
<p>And most telling is his sideline locker-room talk with Epstein, whom the camera catches entering the party, greeted warmly by Trump. Like teenagers, they stand at the edges of the dance floor, pointing out the women they like, laughing at private jokes about them, rating them as hot. Here, there is joy. You see in this moment two outer-borough boys who have successfully crashed the Manhattan Establishment, who have boorishly, clumsily used money to get everything they want — but whose desires have never moved beyond an adolescent vision of the world, of women, of men, of the good life, of who merits consideration and who can be used.</p>
<p>In middle age, Trump had enough self-control to understand that his worst instincts were best received by men who were an awful lot like him. Now, as an old man — the oldest teenager ever — Trump has lost even that filter. He’s turned the whole country into his bunga-bunga party, made a Mar-a-Lago of the world stage, and divided us into Epsteins and cheerleaders — either co-conspirators who love the license his immaturity grants or else disposable collateral damage. —Noreen Malone</p>

<p>Who built the temple? Tuttle, a designer of luxury resorts by trade, renovated the main compound on Epstein’s 70-acre private island in 2003. Sometime between 2009 and 2013, a “temple” appeared on the island: a large, boxy, blue-and-white-striped structure with a golden dome, surrounded by palm trees. In the days after Epstein’s arrest, the temple became the object of fervent speculation online. It was the kind of irresistible conspiracy-bait that exemplifies the Epstein story: On the one hand, shouldn’t it be enough that a mysteriously wealthy banker with connections to the globe’s most powerful people was apparently operating a child sex-trafficking ring without dabbling in theories about occult island temples? On the other hand, though, once you’ve accepted that, why would occult island temples be so out of the question? On the edges, the Epstein saga could seem less like a news story than like a brutal, unreadable fairy tales. Or maybe it was a desire to take a story about financial power and social privilege colluding to protect a criminal predator and transform it into something more terrible and monumental. After weeks of speculation, the first eyewitness account revealed that what the “temple” contained wasn’t a necromantic shrine but a gym, decorated with a framed photograph of a topless woman. —Max Read</p>
<p>Vance, Cyrus Jr.: Prosecutor in the crosshairs.</p>
<p>There are currently 475 level-three sex offenders registered in New York County, but in 2011, when an attorney from the office of Cy Vance, Manhattan DA, argued that Epstein’s risk level should be reduced, Justice Ruth Pickholz responded, “I have to tell you I am a little overwhelmed because I have never seen a prosecutor’s office do anything like this.” Pickholz denied the request — Epstein’s risk assessment put him 20 points above the required threshold for the highest level of offender — and the DA’s office later reversed its request. Though there’s no indication Vance and Epstein were friendly, his office has been criticized previously for declining to pursue sex-crimes charges against Harvey Weinstein that coincided with a donation from his attorneys (though Weinstein has since been charged by Vance’s office) and fraud charges against Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. —Irin Carmon</p>

<p>Retailing billionaire Leslie Wexner was Epstein’s only known client, the man who transferred the rights to that famous townhouse to him for free in 2011, years after they were supposed to no longer be in contact. The relationship stretches back to the late 1980s, a time when Wexner’s star was on the rise. A 1985 cover story for New York visited him in Columbus, Ohio, where his retail empire was built. Journalist Julie Baumgold described how he, not unlike Epstein, was a self-made man, addicted to self-improvement, how he didn’t know how to pronounce La Grenouille correctly and wanted to have his picture taken at the Whitney, and noted that “Wexner is what used to be known as a ‘confirmed bachelor.’ ” (He later married and has four children.) Not long after that piece, he was introduced to Epstein, who had left Bear Stearns under a cloud and was broke. He and Wexner hit it off, and Epstein soon began managing Wexner’s finances. Wexner’s credibility lent plausibility to the notion that Epstein managed billions from his Caribbean-island redoubt. Associates of Wexner, who is now worth $6.6 billion, didn’t understand the attraction. Soon after the men began working together, Epstein moved into Wexner’s Upper East Side mansion. Wexner bought the seven-story townhouse in 1989 for $13.2 million but apparently lived there only for a few months. The title was transferred in 2011 to a Virgin Islands entity controlled by Epstein. It is now worth $56 million. —Michelle Celarier and Carl Swanson</p>
