Selena Gomez announced that she is bipolar during an emotional online conversation with Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old singer said she &ldquo;realised&rdquo; she had the disorder during a recent visit to a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>During an appearance on Cyrus&rsquo;s Bright Minded live-stream on Instagram, Gomez said: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t scare me once I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The star, who has been open about her battle with autoimmune disease lupus, also said she had undergone treatment for anxiety and depression as well as &ldquo;other stuff that I&rsquo;ve been dealing with&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder, which used to be known as manic depression, affects a sufferer&rsquo;s mood, which can swing from one extreme to another.</p>
<p>Miley Cyrus</p>
<p>Addressing how she has been self-isolating during the coronavirus pandemic, Gomez said she has been able to &ldquo;use the tools that I&rsquo;ve used in therapy&rdquo; to cope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where we test each other. How are we gonna treat each other?&rdquo; Gomez said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This can be a time to be gentle with ourselves. Taking breaks from the noise and even social media. Just being outside and breathing in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gomez, a former Disney child star turned chart-topping pop singer, told childhood friend Cyrus that speaking about her emotions helps her deal with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think talking through what you&rsquo;re feeling is extremely helpful,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I have to feel it, sometimes I&rsquo;ve got to cry it out and release it, and just take a deep breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big empath, so I feel so much of what the world is feeling. Being there for other people actually helps me, too.&rdquo;

<h3 id="cannabis-patients-with-bipolar-should-avoid-use">Cannabis: Patients With Bipolar Should Avoid Use</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/sites/default/files/MedicalMarijuanaPrescription_92329367_0.png" alt="img">
We frequently encounter patients who use cannabis. More than 50 indications for medical marijuana are approved by various state governments, although no indications are FDA-approved. Marijuana is legal in 36 states—and 10 states allow recreational use—but regulation of the quality or purity of these products is minimal. Some patients are convinced that marijuana calms them, uplifts them, blunts their anxiety, enables them to sleep, and has other benefits like helping with pain. Many report that it is the only thing that is reliably helpful for neuropsychiatric symptoms, compared with prescribed medications. Notably, scores of nicotine users say the same thing: it is their coping strategy of choice for just about every stress or even their “only pleasure in life.” Others say the same things about benzodiazepines. Rhetorical question: What do these substances have in common?</p>
<p>Regardless of whatever short-term benefit patients perceive from cannabis, the evidence points clearly to an association between usage and worsening course of bipolar disorder over time. In a study of 4915 participants, Henquet et al.1 found a strong increased risk of manic symptoms associated with cannabis over a three year follow-up (after controlling for possible covariates). They also saw an earlier age of onset of bipolar disorder, greater overall illness severity, more rapid cycling, poorer life functioning, and poorer adherence with prescribed treatments.</p>
<p>Zorrilla and colleagues2 evaluated the subsequent course of patients with bipolar disorder who stopped cannabis use after an illness episode and compared their outcome with patients with bipolar disorder who had never used cannabis and a group that continued to use. The total sample included 1922 patients. In a two year period, the continued users had significantly lower rates of recovery, greater work impairment, and fewer were living with a partner. The data were based on patient reports; given that fact, there was likely under-reporting and probably an underestimate of the association between cannabis use and lives worsened. A systematic review of the effects of cannabis on mood and anxiety disorders confirmed a negative association between cannabis use and long-term outcomes.3</p>
<p>Some patients exhibit psychotic symptoms after cannabis use. A recent study found that schizophrenia or bipolar disorder developed in many of these patients.4 This happened in 47% of patients who became psychotic on cannabis over the next four years. This was the highest incidence of conversion after initial psychosis following use of various substances: the second highest was with amphetamine, at 32%. More patients converted to schizophrenia than to bipolar. As for any possible benefits, a recent review concluded that the evidence supporting use of cannabis for psychotic (or other psychiatric) disorders is “very low” and “inadequate.”5</p>
<p>The non-psychiatric medical benefits of cannabis are also very thinly evidenced despite outsized claims to the contrary.6 It is said to be “irresponsible” to encourage patients addicted to opiates to switch to cannabis for their problems with pain.7</p>
<p>Thus, it seems that patients with bipolar disorder should stay away from cannabis in all its forms. Quitting cannabis should be on the short list of interventions if patients are not doing well. This is a tough sell in today’s political environment regarding cannabis legalization. Many newspaper editorials and politicians support its beneficial effects and use. Clinicians should not back down and accept patients’ insistence on using this product; rather, they should continue efforts to educate and to consider the problem to be a serious one that potentially interferes with otherwise appropriate and effective bipolar treatments that may be offered.

<h3 id="selena-gomez-discloses-diagnosis-with-bipolar-disorder">Selena Gomez Discloses Diagnosis with Bipolar Disorder</h3>
<p><img src="https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Selena-Gomez.jpg?quality=80" alt="img">
Selena Gomez</p>
<p>Selena Gomez has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old pop singer disclosed her history with mental illness during an appearance on Miley Cyrus’ “Bright Minded” Instagram series.</p>
<p>“Recently, I went to one of the best mental hospitals in. America, McClean Hospital [in Belmont, Massachusetts], and I discussed that after years of going through a lot of different things, I realized that I was bipolar,” Gomez told Cyrus.</p>
<p>Asked by Cyrus what advice she has for people who are afraid to discuss mental health, Gomez stressed the importance of doing their own research. “And so when I got to know more information, it actually helps me. It doesn’t scare me once I know it,” Gomez remarked.</p>
<p>“When I was younger, I was scared of thunderstorms and my mom bought me all these different books on thunderstorms, so she’s like, ‘The more that you educate yourself on this, the more that you’re not gonna be afraid’ and it completely worked and that’s kind of something that helps me big time,” Gomez added.</p>
<p>Gomez also discussed how her upbringing in Texas previously impacted her understanding of mental health and how she spoke about it. “I’m from Texas. It’s just not known to talk about mental health. You got to seem cool. And then I see anger built up in children and teenagers or whatever young adults because they are wanting that so badly. I just feel like when I finally said what I was going to say, I wanted to know everything about it. And it took the fear away.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Gomez spoke frankly about her past relationship with Justin Bieber and described his treatment of her as “emotionally abusive.”
