<p>Roman Kemp is currently the heartthrob of I&rsquo;m a Celeb , with thousands of female viewers lusting after him in the jungle, including Love Island star Amber Gill who has sent flirty messages on twitter.</p>
<p>But Roman Kemp only has eyes for one woman - girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury - and he clocked up over 100,000 air miles in the last year to keep their relationship alive.</p>
<p>The pair, who haven’t spoken now for three weeks, are used to being apart as Roman flew a 12,000 mile round trip to Hong Kong every few weeks to keep the relationship on track when Anne-Sophie went to work there for six months.</p>
<p>Roman said: “She is 25 and beautiful. To be honest I don’t know how I landed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met when she posted a pair of shoes on Instagram . I liked them and then a week later I was on Tinder and it was the same girl.</p>
<p>(Image: ITV/REX/Shutterstock)</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was like: I’ve got to message her! So I messaged her on Instagram and within a week we met. It was fate.</p>
<p>“I think we live in a world now where everyone meets digitally I think.</p>
<p>Anne-Sophie describes herself as and experienced product manager with a demonstrated history in scientific research and psychology.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty)</p>
<p>Roman added: “My missus is Swiss and is from Bern in Switzerland. She’s got brains and beauty - really intimdating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’ve been dating two years. Is she The One? Who knows. You never know! But it’s love, 100 % and I am committed to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am hanging onto her. She moved to Hong Kong last year for a job for six months. So I went back and forth from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got the Airmails up. It was okay doing long distance. I got time off so I could visit her.”</p>
<p>Roman also pays a lot of attention to his famous parents Martin Kemp and Shirlie Holliman and what they think.</p>
<p>Luckily for Anne-Sophie, they are also fans and think he has made the right decision working hard at their relationship.</p>
<p>Roman added: “My parents’ marriage has made me know when a relationship is worth working on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They love Anne-Sophie. Yeah, yeah. It’s very important for me for my family to like my partner.</p>
<p>(Image: Instagram)</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Dad is happy with anyone but my Mum is hard to please and she loves Anne-Sophie as well.”</p>
<p>Speaking shortly before he went into camp, Roman also revealed he has a tattoo in tribute to George Michael – and says he “wants to keep his memory alive”.</p>
<p>He said: “I do have one for George (Michael). Yeah. What is it? I’ll keep that to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an amazing man. Completely. I want to keep his memory alive, for sure.”</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images Europe)</p>
<p>Whilst he has been in the jungle, Anne-Sophie has been speaking to Capital Radio where Roman is normally the breakfast show host.</p>
<p>She was asked to read out some of the many tweets from female fans that Roman has been getting, including Love Island’s Amber Gill who admitted she was disappointed to find out he had a girlfriend.</p>
<p>But mature Anne-Sophie is not phased by the admiration he has got and takes it as a compliment.</p>
<p>She said: “He’s not single, I think everybody knows this by now. I’m happy, I’m confident, and 0% worried. Keep fangirling and keep voting for our baby RoRo.”

<p>Roman Kemp, 26, has been one of the favourites to win I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! since he first entered the jungle, and now the contestant is one step closer to being crowned King of the Jungle tonight. When he leaves the show, the Capital Radio DJ will be welcomed by his girlfriend of two years, Anne-Sophie Flury.</p>
<p>Anne-Sophie appeared on Lorraine earlier in the week, said being without Roman has been a “lot harder” than she anticipatrd.

ROMAN KEMP has entered this year&rsquo;s I&rsquo;m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! and will take part in tonight&rsquo;s challenge - Just Desserts.</p>
<p>The Capital FM breakfast host is also one of the campmates currently in a relationship - here is what we know about his special lady.</p>
<p>2 Roman Kemp takes a snap with his girlfriend Anne-Sophie in the Capital FM studio</p>
<p>Who is Roman Kemp&rsquo;s girlfriend?</p>
<p>Fans have labelled Kemp the jungle heartthrob after going crazy for him on social media.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old is in a relationship with the Swiss-born Anne-Sophie Flury.</p>
<p>She has most certainly got the brains, as she is a neuroscientist and promising entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Earlier this year she launched a product called Shu Gum, an item designed to keep the your shoes fresh and clean.</p>
<p>Shu gum, made from natural ingredients, is made with the endeavour to reduce the wear and tear of your shoes and leave no residue as a result.</p>
<p>Fans can find out more about Anne-Sophie by visiting her Instagram page @coochiebygucci</p>
<p>2 Roman and Anne-Sophie have been dating since 2018</p>
<p>How long have they been dating?</p>
<p>The pair have been together since 2018 and had to spend eight moths apart while Anne-Sophie lived in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>When Roman flew to Australia to participate in I&rsquo;m A Celeb, the Swiss businesswoman posted on her Instagram page how much she would miss Roman while he is in the jungle.</p>
<p>Speaking to OK! Online, Kemp spoke about how supportive his girlfriend is and how they&rsquo;ll cope being away from each other.</p>
<p>The radio star said: &ldquo;She’ll probably love a break away from me. But she’s so supportive. She lived in Hong Kong for eight months during our relationship so we’re used to long distance.”</p>

<p>Is Roman taking on a trial in I&rsquo;m A Celeb?</p>
<p>Along with BBC radio presenter Adele Roberts, Roman will be taking on the latest trial in I&rsquo;m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
<p>Fans were given the opportunity to vote for which celebrity they wanted to see endure the iconic eating challenge, this year known as Just Desserts.</p>
<p>Last night we saw the first sign of tension in the series which saw Adele blast Roman as &lsquo;prejudice&rsquo; for labelling her picture of Jane McDonald in the jungle &lsquo;random&rsquo; and laughed when she didn&rsquo;t know any of her songs.</p>
<p>As a result, it does not seem to be a coincidence that fans voted for the two radio presenters to do the trial.</p>
<p>Catch I&rsquo;m A Celebrity TONIGHT at 9pm on ITV1. This is followed by I&rsquo;m A Celebrity: Extra Camp at 10pm on ITV2.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/12/11/15/22107612-0-image-a-35_1576079664548.jpg" alt="img">
Fans were left fuming when they believed no one greeted him after he finished in third place on I&rsquo;m A Celebrity.</p>
<p>But Roman Kemp&rsquo;s girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury has insisted that she did greet her boyfriend in the jungle, after a fan demanded to know where she was on Instagram.</p>
<p>The radio host, 26, came behind runner-up Andy Whyment and winner Jacqueline Jossa in the competition, and while the neuroscientist wasn&rsquo;t seen on the show she explained on Wednesday that the scene &lsquo;was cut&rsquo; for time.</p>
<p>Supportive: Roman Kemp&rsquo;s girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury insisted on Wednesday that she did greet him during his jungle exit but the scene was CUT</p>
<p>Responding to a curious fan, Anne-Sophie wrote: &lsquo;I was there – scene was cut. Kind of glad cause I had far too many frozen margaritas last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The happy couple, who have been dating since early 2018, happily reunited on Sunday following the show&rsquo;s live final, and Anne-Sophie shared a slew of loved-up snaps the following day.</p>
<p>Roman and Anne-Sophie were spotted arriving back in London on Wednesday, and the latter wrapped her arms around her boyfriend as they walked out together.</p>
<p>She also took pictures alongside Roman and his fellow campmate Myles Stephenson as they enjoyed the luxuries of business class.</p>
<p>Clarification: Responding to a curious fan, Anne-Sophie wrote: &lsquo;I was there – scene was cut. Kind of glad cause I had far too many frozen margaritas last night&rsquo;</p>
<p>Smitten: Roman and Anne-Sophie were spotted arriving back in London on Wednesday, and the latter wrapped her arms around her boyfriend as they walked out together</p>
<p>Cheese! Anne-Sophie also took pictures alongside Roman and his fellow campmate Myles Stephenson as they enjoyed the luxuries of business class</p>
<p>They made it: Roman and Myles put on an animated display on their flight</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Lorraine had interviewed the son of Martin and Shirlie Kemp and said: &lsquo;Tell me, as soon as you got back to that hotel and you gave Anne-Sophie a hug, what else did you do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before quickly adding: &lsquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to tell me as much - I meant food and things like that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roman joked: &lsquo;Lorraine, come on!&rsquo; before going on to reveal what he has been indulging in following his exit.</p>
<p>Casual chic: Anne-Sophie kept her look simple as she wore a blue top with frayed white shorts</p>
<p>Enjoying herself: Anne-Sophie flashed two peace signs when they were seen at the airport</p>
<p>Comfy: During the plane journey, Anne-Sophie wore baggy jogging trousers</p>
<p>Awks! Earlier this week, Roman was left lost for words during Monday&rsquo;s Lorraine, after the host quizzed him on what he&rsquo;s been up to with his girlfriend since he left the jungle</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;It was pizza ordered, it was fries ordered, it was just pure greed and elation at the same time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I kept touching the floor, it&rsquo;s carpet, actual carpet. I turned on the shower and it&rsquo;s actual hot water. It&rsquo;s so strange, you become so engrossed in this beautiful world, when you come out you forgot this all existed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roman has become somewhat of a heartthrob for fans during his time on the show and admitted that although he was &lsquo;flattered&rsquo;, he just couldn&rsquo;t wait to be reunited with his other-half Anne-Sophie.</p>
<p>Prying: The Capital FM breakfast host and the daytime TV presenter were both left slightly red-faced after she appeared to probe slightly too much into Roman&rsquo;s activities since getting out</p>
<p>While his girlfriend was there to meet him on the bridge, Roman also spoke of his reunion with his famous father Martin and mum Shirlie over FaceTime.</p>
<p>Discussing their tearful chat, he said: &lsquo;I spoke to both my parents on FaceTime the second I came out. I&rsquo;m one of those guys, I show my emotions a lot&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just seeing their faces, I just couldn&rsquo;t stop crying. I said, &lsquo;Did I do you proud?&rsquo; They said I did everything and more, so I did my job.&rsquo;</p>
