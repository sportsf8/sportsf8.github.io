<p>New Delhi: Almost 400 feminists from across the country have issued a statement appealing to the President of India to stop the execution of all four persons convicted in the 2012 Delhi gangrape and murder case.</p>
<p>The signatories include entire organisations working on women and children’s rights, along with prominent individuals like historian Uma Chakravarti, food rights activist Veena Shatrughna, lawyer Indira Jaising, scholar Nivedita Menon, activist Lalita Ramdas, women studies scholar Mary E. John, transgender activist Rachana Mudraboyina, writer Gogu Shyamala, women’s rights activist and artist Sheba Chhachhi, The Wire‘s public editor Pamela Phillipose, and filmmakers Anand Patwardhan and Nishtha Jain, reiterated their position against the death penalty.</p>
<p>Pointing to numerous instances where capital punishments failed to reduce the number of rapes, murder, sexual assaults and killings, the statement held that the death penalty was not a deterrent against crimes and that countries where the death penalty was not abolished continued to witness high homicide rates.</p>
<p>Also read: Teach the Justice System to Be More Aware of Women</p>
<p>The signatories also held that there was “no short cut to justice and safety” and that the only way to stop crimes against women was to make improve the criminal justice system. Referring to violence against Adivasi and Dalit women, the statement said that there was a “need to understand the pervasiveness of this kind of violence on women and evolve punishments that act as true deterrents to the very large numbers of men who commit, and get away with, such crimes”.</p>
<p>The full statement is reproduced below.</p>
<p>§</p>
<p>As individuals and groups who have been engaged in the struggles for women’s rights, safety and justice, it is often presumed that we would support the demand for death penalty for sexual assault. But for decades, even as we have consistently fought to make the world safer for women through changes in policy and law, and social awareness by breaking the silence on these heinous crimes, we have consistently argued against the death penalty for sexual assault, as well as, all other crimes.</p>
<p>In the light of the death warrant being issued on 7 January 2020 against Akshay Kumar, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta, and Mukesh Singh convicted of the brutal assault, gangrape and murder of a 23-year old medical intern in Delhi in December 2012, we reiterate our position against the death penalty.</p>
<p>We understand the inexorable pain of the parents and other loved ones of women and children who are raped and, in many cases, killed. However, efforts by politicians and parties, courts and other vested interests to capitalise on their pain and make the case a matter of the nation’s honour, give false hope that the harshest punishment of death will prevent all such cases in the future. The bare truth is that even after the Indian state executed Auto (Gowri) Shankar in 1995, Ranga and Billa (Kuljeet Singh and Jasbir Singh) in 1982, and Dhananjay Chatterjee in 2004 for rape/s and murder, sexual assaults and killings continue unabated.</p>
<p>We are against the death penalty because:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The death penalty is NOT a deterrent against crimes, as evidence from across the world shows. In America, where the use of the death penalty varies between states, homicide rates of states with the death penalty are 48-100% higher compared to states without it. Studies in Canada have illustrated that homicide rates remained significantly lower after abolition of the death penalty. And a 2018 multi-country study across 11 nations which have abolished capital punishment also affirms the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no short cut to justice and safety. The death penalty often becomes a short cut when, in fact, there is a need to focus on long term social change, and the State’s failure to ensure the security of women. The only way to stop such crimes is the certainty that the criminal justice system will work with honesty, integrity, competence and fairness against every accused, irrespective of their social standing, power position, class, or caste. Instead, what the State is trying to do is to distract us by creating an ‘illusion of justice’, by selectively hanging people even as it protects others responsible for similar crimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tragically, brutal sexual assaults occurs with frightening regularity and impunity in our country, especially against adivasi and Dalit women, workers in the unorganised sector, women with disabilities, hijras, kothis, trans and gender queer physiques, and sex workers. Additionally, during incidents of sectarian violence, women of certain castes and communities become targets of sexual assault, torture and murder. There have been, and continue to be, a large number of women similarly targeted in conflict areas such as Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Manipur, and Chhattisgarh. There is a need to understand the pervasiveness of this kind of violence on women and evolve punishments that act as true deterrents to the very large numbers of men who commit, and get away with, such crimes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the December 2012 case, violence was meted against the victim by strangers, which has rightly triggered a wide discourse on women’s safety in public spaces. However, the majority of sexual crimes are committed by members of their family, neighbours, friends, teachers, guardians and other acquaintances. Not surprisingly, therefore, reporting of such crimes remains abysmally low. In all these instances, the process of seeking justice is severely stacked against victim/survivors, and the conviction rate for reported sexual crimes remains as low as 26%! Consequently, most perpetrators of sexual violence enjoy a high degree of impunity, including being freed of all charges which we believe is the greatest cause for the continued prevalence of such violence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are not anti-punishment. Rather, we are pro-justice. Let us remember that the Justice Verma Committee, which was set up immediately after the December 2012 incident, stood against death penalty for sexual assault, and as did the Law Commission of India in its 262nd Report on The Death Penalty in 2015.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter how heinous the crime, we believe that every human being has an inalienable right to life and holds the potential for reform, if only the State and society will commit themselves to it, instead of baying for blood. In this case, the blood of those convicted in the December 2012 case.</p>
<p>There is no quick answer to stopping sexual crimes. We need to walk together on the long and complicated path to dismantling patriarchal and caste/community-based privilege, impunity and power, and the pervasive misogyny based in customs, tradition, law, the courts, government and society.</p>
<p>We hope the President of India will commute the death sentence of the convicts of the December 2012 case to a lifetime in prison, and in doing so, the lead the nation towards the vision of a society based on equality and justice, not revenge and retribution.</p>

<p><img src="https://1847884116.rsc.cdn77.org/telugu/news/sunitha200718_t-69d.jpg" alt="img">
It has been rumoured that talented and beautiful singer Sunitha, who has a large fan base, will be marrying an IT professional later this year. On Thursday, she took to Facebook to say a few words in the morning. &ldquo;Why are people always curious about personal lives?&rdquo; But these words were ambiguous. Many thought that she was indirectly confirming her marriage but wanted the media to not talk about her personal life so much.</p>
<p>But in the evening, Sunitha came LIVE on Facebook and spoke directly to her supporters. &ldquo;Ever since the media started speculating that I am going to marry an IT guy, I have been flooded with messages. The response has been overwhelming. I am glad that so many people want me to settle down in life. They have so much affection for me. But let me make it clear. No, I am not getting married at all. I have no such plans as of now,&rdquo; Sunitha said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Different websites and channels have been writing the same news. I want to tell my supporters, friends, and well-wishers that I am a very private person. Don&rsquo;t believe any speculations. I don&rsquo;t need to give any clarification, but since so many messages have been coming, I wanted to speak to you directly. I had never received these many messages even when I won Nandi and Filmfare,&rdquo; Sunitha said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all know that it has been long since I was divorced. The (second marriage) news was totally unnecessary. Nobody wrote anything bad about me but the news should have been avoided,&rdquo; she signed off.

Launched in 2014, StoryBites is a weekly feature from YourStory, featuring notable quotable quotes in our articles of this past week. This special series of compilations focuses on India’s COVID-19 struggle (see last week’s post here). Share these quotes and excerpts with your networks, and check back to the original articles for more insights.</p>
<p>Despite some finger-pointing and blame games between countries, cooperation across the board is picking up as countries battle the global coronavirus crisis. Humanity is being tested as never before, but is also rising to the challenge.</p>
<p>Frontline healthworkers need the most technical and emotional support in these times, and a number of innovations and systems are falling into place in India. The vast socio-economic divides in the country call for special measures to reduce loss of livelihood and promote economic recovery.</p>
<p>Dealing with uncertainty and flat growth is the new business normal. Interestingly, digital transformation is receiving a boost as never before, and sectors like gaming, online education and IT security are witnessing significant growth.</p>
<p>Despite a number of unfortunate incidents of hate speech and community bias in some news organisations, stories of heroic efforts by institutions and individuals continue to be highlighted. Many brands are transforming their messages in this time of crisis, and competitors are becoming collaborators.</p>
<p>In response to the crisis, YourStory has set up the Resource Centre for Startups and SMBs. When worry, fear, and misinformation are spreading, this online resource helps set the record straight through expert advice, business tips, wellness practices, and workflow suggestions. See also our pick of 60 quotes on coping with a crisis.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the greatest lesson that COVID-19 can teach humanity is that we are all in this together. - Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, Biocon</p>
<p>COVID-19 has affected the world at large, but this has also given us a glimpse of the good that exists. - Amit Gupta, Yulu</p>
<p>The fact is, uncertainty is the reality of the moment. - Samir Parikh, Fortis Healthcare</p>
<p>To beat this worldwide pandemic, the world has to, must come together. - Shah Rukh Khan</p>
<p>In the fight to end this crisis, we truly can&rsquo;t afford to lose anyone behind. - Priyanka Chopra Jonas</p>
<p>Social distancing is an important response to the pandemic, but we need to ensure that it does not become social isolation or alienation, particularly for the vulnerable groups of our society. - Bharti Gitay, Mpower</p>
<p>There is nothing short term about this crisis. Even in Beijing and Shanghai, it has taken three months for people to come back on the streets. - Gautam Chhugani, Bernstein</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t lower our guard. We are still far from half-time. - Erna Solberg, Norway’s Prime Minister</p>
<p>It is clear that a remote vital tracking system is the need of the hour. - Ranjana Nair, RayIoT</p>
<p>Aarogya Setu, India&rsquo;s app to fight COVID-19, has reached 50 million users in just 13 days - the fastest ever globally for an app. - Amitabh Kant, Niti Aayog</p>
<p>Usually, intubation is a complicated process, which needs trained respiratory therapists. - Siraj Dhanani, InnAccel</p>
<p>There is a need for a huge amount of non-invasive ventilation as well because invasive ventilation, which puts a lot of pressure on the lungs, can cause damage to the lungs that are already under distress. - Hyma Goparaju, Avyantra</p>
<p>Due to coronavirus, both focus on air pollution and respiratory wellness will significantly increase in times to come. - Namita Gupta, Airveda</p>
<p>Access to medicines 24X7 is a basic right of all citizens as a medical emergency can never be predetermined. - Obaid Abdul Aziz, Medicalwale.com</p>
<p>Some people are panicking as they do not know whether they have coronavirus or the simple flu. They do not know how or when to get tested. - Saurav Bhaik, Tagbin</p>
<p>With teleconsultation, one can interact with the doctor comfortably from home, share their feedback and decide when is the need to visit the hospital and avoid any unnecessary visits. - Vijayarathna Venkatraman, Motherhood Hospitals</p>
