<p>On the roster: Populists left and right seek social media control - Scott unveils bill to curb police brutality - Fauci pleads for caution as death toll rises - Trump offers donors $1.2 million convention package - Somebody call Shrek</p>
<p>POPULISTS LEFT AND RIGHT SEEK SOCIAL MEDIA CONTROL</p>
<p>The progressive populists on the left and the nationalist populists on the right are in a state of high alarm over the way tech companies do business.</p>
<p>This is one of the main proving grounds for the direction and durability of the bipolar populist movement that emerged out of the Panic of 2008 and subsequent recession.</p>
<p>It was technology, particularly social media, which in large part facilitated the movement’s success against the broad, bipartisan establishment. Now, as the movement is solidifying into an establishment of its own, leaders from both ends of the spectrum are looking to fence in the horses they rode to power.</p>
<p>At the progressive pole, Facebook is the preferred target. Some Democrats, who partly blame the social media giant for their 2016 defeat, are furious because the company does not do more to limit what people can say on its platform.</p>
<p>At the nationalist pole, Twitter is the preferred target. Some Republicans, including the president, are outraged because they believe the company is unfairly limiting their speech.</p>
<p>While they may disagree about what speech these corporations should or shouldn’t allow, they agree on how to punish them for their perceived abuses.</p>
<p>The threat from Sen. Josh Hawley, a rising star of the populist right, is the same as from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a doyenne of the populist left: The companies must change their policies to match their demands or Congress will rescind legal protections the platforms currently enjoy and the federal government will start regulating social media content.</p>
<p>Hawley’s latest bill, released today, would create a new system for social media users to sue the companies for claims of bias. It joins his other proposals that would, among other things, try to limit the time users spend on social media and establish federal oversight of content.</p>
<p>That matches the approach of the Ocasio-Cortez group in the House. Democrats are warning Facebook that if the company does not establish content standards that meet their demands, lawmakers will roll back protections that let the companies administrate users’ posts and set standards without being held liable for posts.</p>
<p>You can’t sue Twitter if someone uses the platform to defame you. You have to sue the user. But you can sue the New York Times for libel over an article it publishes by someone else. The threat from both Ocasio-Cortez and Hawley factions’ is to let users sue social media companies for content posted on their platforms, effectively wrecking their business models.</p>
<p>The nationalist and the progressive populists are also in sync on the threat of federal action against tech companies’ business practices. As the Trump Justice Department is exploring anti-trust action to break up big tech firms, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is coming after the companies for targeting users with ads suggested by their profiles.</p>
<p>There are efforts on the left and right to rein in Google and Amazon, too, but it is social media where the fight is the most urgent, and that stands to reason.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that the nationalist populist revolt that put President Trump in the White House could have ever gotten off the ground without social media. Imagine what Pat Buchanan could have done in 1992 with a Twitter pitchfork brigade.</p>
<p>Similarly, there would have been no Bernie Sanders democratic socialist wave for Ocasio-Cortez to surf without social media and online fundraising. Their message has been the same for 50 years, but they have tools Eugene McCarthy and his crew did not.</p>
<p>Team Nationalist and Team Progressive are understandably alarmed that their preferred vehicles to obtain power are in the hands of private companies.</p>
<p>Corporations are designed to produce profits for shareholders, not facilitate political movements. And as the companies mature alongside the movements they have helped facilitate, shareholders may seek paths that reduce the populists’ advantages.</p>
<p>For now, the threats seem mostly like political theater. There’s no chance of this Congress taking action as sweeping as Hawley and Ocasio-Cortez imagine. There are enough free-speech liberals and free-market conservatives to prevent that.</p>
<p>But it is easy to see how through this election year and in the Congress that follows, this could be a place where populists left and right will seek to establish a new power structure with themselves at the center of it.</p>
<p>THE RULEBOOK: ONE WOULD THINK</p>
<p>“Is it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the true interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and philosophic spirit?” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 6</p>
<p>TIME OUT: THE MIRACLE OF THE SUPERMARKET</p>
<p>The Atlantic: “Long-suffering as one of the thinnest-margined businesses in existence and one of the least-looked-forward-to places to visit, the supermarket has, for more than a decade, been under assault from e‑commerce giants, blamed for making Americans fat, accused of contributing to climate change, abandoned in favor of restaurants, and, in parts of the country, disappearing at a concerning pace. … Yet in recent months, the supermarket has assumed a new centrality in Americans’ lives. Cashiers, stockers, distributors, wholesalers, packers, pickers, and truck drivers have, even in the absence of adequate health safeguards, continued working to ensure that shelves stay stocked. Foodtowns, Nugget Markets, and Piggly Wigglys have emerged as crucial lifelines, spawning a broad reappreciation for one of the most distinctly American institutions. Grocery shopping is no longer one in a long list of mundane errands. For many people, it’s the errand—the only one—and it now seems not inevitable, but somewhat amazing to be able to do at all.”</p>

<p>SCOTT UNVEILS BILL TO CURB POLICE BRUTALITY</p>
<p>Fox News: “Senate Republicans on Wednesday unveiled their ‘Justice Act’ police reform legislation to hold officers accountable with an enhanced use-of-force database, pursue restrictions on chokeholds and create new commissions to study law enforcement and race. Sen. Tim Scott, the lone African-American GOP senator, spearheaded the legislation in the wake of George Floyd&rsquo;s death and nationwide protests demanding racial justice &ndash; including activists&rsquo; calls to dismantle police departments. He framed the legislation as a bridge between law enforcement and communities of color. ‘The answer to the question of which side do you support is ‘I support America,’’ Scott, R-S.C. said, ‘And if you support America you support restoring the confidence that communities of color have in institutions of authority. If you support America, that means you know that the overwhelming number of officers in this nation want to do their job, go home to their family. It is not a binary choice. This legislation encompasses that spirit.’ Scott said the overwhelming number of officers in America are good people. But he acknowledged the real fears people of color have about encountering the police.”</p>
<p>Poll shows huge support for protests, concerns over racism - Quinnipiac University: “With the United States at a moment of racial reckoning, voters say 68 - 27 percent that discrimination against black people in the United States is a serious problem, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released today. There are wide gaps by party, as 96 percent of Democrats and 69 percent of independents say discrimination against black people is a serious problem, while only 34 percent of Republicans say that. Broken down by race, 95 percent of black voters, 76 percent of Hispanic voters, and 62 percent of white voters say discrimination against black people is a serious problem. … Voters support the protests 67 - 28 percent. … More than half of voters, 57 percent, have a favorable opinion of the Black Lives Matter movement, while 30 percent have an unfavorable one. Voters think 55 - 38 percent that protests around the country calling to end racial inequality will lead to meaningful reforms.”</p>
<p>FAUCI PLEADS FOR CAUTION AS DEATH TOLL RISES</p>
<p>WSJ: “Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government’s top infectious-disease expert, warned the nation risks a resurgence of coronavirus infections should states fail to remain vigilant as they reopen their economies. ‘When I look at the TV and I see pictures of people congregating at bars when the location they are indicates they shouldn’t be doing that, that’s very risky,’ Dr. Fauci said in an interview Tuesday. ‘People keep talking about a second wave,’ he added. ‘We’re still in a first wave.’ … With coronavirus infections increasing rapidly in a number of states, Dr. Fauci said a relaxed approach to public-health measures that reduce risk and spread poses significant hurdles to state and federal efforts. Throngs of people have gathered in many parts of the country, often without social distancing or mask wearing, prompting new warnings from state leaders of a return to shutdowns or possible punitive actions.”</p>
<p>Cuomo under increasing scrutiny for nursing home deaths - ProPublica: “On April 3, Stephanie Gilmore, a 34-year-old nurse working at the Diamond Hill nursing home in Troy, New York, was summoned to a supervisor’s office. The home’s administrator and nursing director were there to relay some distressing news. Gilmore said they told her that a resident in the home had recently gone to the hospital, where she tested positive for COVID-19. The resident was set to return to Diamond Hill, making her the first confirmed COVID-19 case at the 120-bed facility north of Albany. The risks to the home’s staff and other residents were obvious: The virus was ravaging nursing homes across the country. But the week before, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his health commissioner, Howard Zucker, had all but made such discharges mandatory. If a hospital determined a patient who needed nursing home care was medically stable, the home had to accept them, even if they had been treated for COVID-19. Moreover, the nursing home could not test any such prospective residents — those treated for COVID-19 or those hospitalized for other reasons — to see if they were newly infected or perhaps still contagious despite their treatment. It was all laid out in a formal order, effective March 25. New York was the only state in the nation that barred testing of those being placed or returning to nursing homes.”</p>
<p>States look to Colorado as guide for safe reopening - Politico: “Colorado was the first Democratic-run state to reopen from a coronavirus lockdown, and so far it has avoided the fresh spikes in infection rippling across the West. Its measured approach could be a lesson for the country on how to reopen effectively. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis stood out because he embarked on a slow and methodical economic recovery in late April — even before the White House’s stay-at-home guidelines expired. Polis limited when restaurants and other businesses could reopen, at first only allowing curbside pickups at stores, imposing strict social distancing on salons and other personal services and prohibiting gatherings over 10 people. Colorado also benefited from a relatively young, healthy, active population that bought into the state public health officials’ message about wearing masks and social distancing. That experience could influence other states as localized outbreaks pop up even as people clamor for a more rapid reopening of the economy and something resembling a more normal way of life.”</p>
<p>Jason Gay: ‘If there’s no baseball, will you miss it?’ - WSJ: “This is what the past couple of months have taught us: Humans evolve. We miss our rituals and past behaviors – but we adjust. I have not worn nice pants since the Super Bowl. It’s fine. I’ve become the Steve McQueen of Drawstring Sweatpants. I rotate the same three T-shirts. I will probably never go back to personal sartorial dignity. … This is what baseball needs to know. The creaky old pastime is fighting again, yowling about how there might not be a 2020 season, how the billionaire owners and millionaire players can’t come to terms on a deal to play a pandemic-shortened season. It wants us to yowl, too – demand that all parties come to the table and hash this dispute out. It wants us to get very, very, angry, and act like this is very, very important and very, very essential. But the danger isn’t public anger. It’s ambivalence. It’s whether there are enough people who care enough to care.”</p>
<p>TRUMP WOOS DONORS WITH $1.2 M CONVENTION TRIP</p>
<p>Bloomberg: “President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is enticing big-spending donors to the Republican Party’s convention in August by offering packages that cost almost $1.2 million dollars per couple. Trump Victory, the joint effort of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, sent out invitations Tuesday with details of the perks available at the convention in Jacksonville, Florida, from Aug. 24-27. The invitations, obtained by Bloomberg News, offer various tiers of support, all with different levels of access to Trump as well as RNC and campaign officials. The offers rise by increments to a maximum of $1,161,200 per couple for the ‘Presidential Trust’ package, which guarantees premier access to the convention arena, with ‘special Trump Victory hospitality,’ including lounge benefits, priority seating and a behind-the-scenes tour. There is also a ‘Vice Presidential Trust’ for $580,600.”</p>
<p>Biden keeps up torrid fundraising pace - Fox News: “Joe Biden hauled in a record amount at a virtual fundraiser on Monday evening with the help of former Democratic presidential primary rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Biden’s campaign said the that the former vice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee raised $6 million from 620 donors attending the online fundraiser. That’s the largest haul to date for the Biden Victory Fund, the joint fundraising operation set up jointly by the Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee in late April. Biden praised Warren, adding, ‘Thank you for asking your friends to help me out. It&rsquo;s the biggest fundraiser we&rsquo;ve ever had. And it&rsquo;s all because of you. Thank you.’ The event was hosted by Warren as well as retired software entrepreneur Paul Egerman and National Center for Learning Disabilities board member Shanti Fry. Soon after the conclusion of Monday’s fundraiser, the campaign announced that Biden will team up with his boss for eight years – former President Obama – for a virtual fundraiser next week. The June 23 event is Obama’s fundraising debut for his former vice president and will target small-dollar donors.”</p>
<p>Scaramucci and other GOPers launch pro-Biden super PAC - Axios: “A group of prominent Republican operatives that includes former officials from the Trump and George W. Bush administrations are launching a super PAC to turn out GOP voters for Joe Biden in November, organizers tell Axios. The ‘Right Side PAC’ aims to identify former Trump supporters across the country who have cooled to the president&rsquo;s approach in office and convince them to vote for Biden, says founder Matt Borges, a former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. Anthony Scaramucci, who was fired after 10 days as Trump&rsquo;s communications director and later turned on the president, also is part of the effort. The PAC will initially target voters in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida. They&rsquo;ll use digital, mail and telephone to reach voters. They&rsquo;ll encourage absentee voting. They do not have plans to run TV ads.”</p>
<p>Judge denies Oklahomans’ efforts to block Trump&rsquo;s rally - SF Gate: “A Tulsa judge on Tuesday denied an effort by city residents and business owners to block President Donald Trump from holding an indoor campaign rally this weekend that some fear could further the spread of the coronavirus. The lawsuit in the district court of Tulsa County sought a temporary injunction against the company that manages the 19,000-seat venue, the BOK Center, ‘to protect against a substantial, imminent, and deadly risk to the community,’ according to a copy of the complaint. Judge Rebecca Nightingale denied the request. There have been mounting concerns among Democrats, civil rights activists, and even some Republicans that Trump&rsquo;s rally could inflame racial tensions in Tulsa and contribute to further spreading of the coronavirus. Some opponents plan to protest Trump&rsquo;s presence. At the same time, Trump&rsquo;s supporters eagerly awaited Saturday night&rsquo;s gathering, already lining up four days ahead of time.”</p>
<p>ETHICS COMMITTEE CLEARS LOEFFLER ON STOCK SALES</p>
<p>Politico: “The Senate Ethics Committee has ended its investigation into Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s stock trades, according to a letter sent Tuesday to the Georgia Republican. The news comes three weeks after Loeffler’s office said the Justice Department had also dropped its probe into her stock trades. Deborah Sue Mayer, the Ethics Committee’s chief counsel and staff director, wrote in the letter that the panel examined stock transactions made by both Loeffler and her husband Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. ‘Based on all the information before it, the Committee did not find evidence that your actions violated federal law, Senate Rules or standards of conduct,’ Mayer said. ‘Accordingly, consistent with its precedent, the Committee has dismissed the matter.’ It’s a welcome development for Loeffler, though significant political damage has already been done as she seeks to stay in the Senate past November.”</p>
<p>Dems settle on challenger in key Atlanta suburb race - Roll Call: “Public policy professor Carolyn Bourdeaux was declared the outright winner Tuesday of a crowded Democratic primary in suburban Atlanta, as absentee ballots continued to be counted a week after the chaotic June 9 elections. Bourdeaux had 52.7 percent of the vote in Georgia’s 7th District in tallies posted Tuesday afternoon, when The Associated Press called the race. … Bourdeaux was below that level last week, when the AP said she would face a runoff with Rep. Brenda Lopez Romero, who had 12.4 percent. Progressive activist Nabilah Islam was a close third in the six-candidate field, with 12.3 percent. Bourdeaux was the 2018 Democratic nominee and unexpectedly came within 1 percentage point of beating GOP Rep. Rob Woodall. Woodall was one of the first House members to announce his retirement this cycle.”</p>
<p>Dems dump Sasse challenger over raunchy texts to staff - NYT: “The Nebraska Democratic Party has withdrawn its support for its Senate candidate, Chris Janicek, after he made sexually explicit comments about one of his campaign staff members in a group text that included her. The party said in a statement on Tuesday that it had received a copy of the text messages last week, and that party leaders had met with Mr. Janicek on Thursday and urged him to drop out of the race. On Monday, Mr. Janicek refused to do so, and the party’s executive committee voted unanimously to withdraw its support and resources from his campaign. ‘Our Democratic Party has no tolerance for sexual harassment,’ Jane Kleeb, the chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said in the statement. ‘Our party will not extend resources or any type of support to any candidate that violates our code of conduct and doesn’t treat men and women with the dignity and respect they deserve.’”</p>

<p>“Y’all still wearing those kente cloths over there @SenatorDurbin?” – Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., tweeted in response to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called the GOP police reform bill a “token” approach during his floor speech.</p>
<p>FROM THE BLEACHERS</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;ll be brief. ‘His supporters, you included, I’d guess, like that he kicks over hornets’ nests.’ That&rsquo;s why people voted for him. People were convinced that he wouldn&rsquo;t stand for the status quo. Ya gotta kick some hornet&rsquo;s nests to drain the swamp. I love the Halftime Report!” – Yvonne McGowen, Dacula, Ga.</p>
<p>[Ed. note: Quite so, Ms. McGowen! Thanks for reading and taking the time to write.]</p>
<p>“We don’t really need a legislative branch of government anymore. The SCOTUS seems to be able to take care of both jobs. In the ‘old days’ laws were made in pursuance of the Constitution. I have tried hard to find something that upholds the power of the federal government to regulate personnel rules in private businesses but it’s just not there.” – Jim King, Chesapeake, Va.</p>
<p>[Ed. note: To get to days that old, Mr. King, you’d have to go back at least a century. I’m not talking about what the Constitution says about the power of the federal government to regulate private enterprise &ndash; a subject beyond my ken and to which have been devoted enough articles to lift the Supreme Court to the moon. But the “old days” would have to predate not just the administrative state expansions of the second half of the 20th century, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, New Deal restrictions on commercial activity and Progressive Era labor regulations before them. There is no doubt that our Congress is in a pitiful state, having devolved its own power for the sake of political comfort, but I would argue that the courts have taken a less activist role in recent years. The doctrines of judicial restraint and deference to Congress have waxed, not waned.]</p>
<p>“‘Twelve years ago, Barack Obama ran for president as an explicit opponent of same sex marriage.’ Please provide your source for this claim.” – Stephen Meyer, Albuquerque, N.M.</p>
<p>[Ed. note: Here you go!]</p>
<p>“Presidential candidates with women vice presidents are 0 for 2 so far. I´m not saying it could hurt, but why does Biden think a women vice president will help him that much? Even for Hillary, who was a presidential candidate, women didn’t turn out that much compared to Obama. Why does Uncle Joe think a woman vice president would improve his chances that drastically?” – Akiva Neuhaus, Miami</p>
<p>[Ed. note: While I can see something to the argument that Sarah Palin hurt John McCain’s chances in 2008, I hardly think it’s fair to blame her or Geraldine Ferarro for their parties’ respective defeats. I can’t imagine any running mate saving McCain or Walter Mondale. Biden’s pledge to pick a female running mate was not about the general election, anyway. It was aimed at wrapping up the nomination of a party that was deeply frustrated by the failures of what at first seemed a promising crop of female contenders. Biden’s promise was aimed at women holding out for Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. Democratic voters are majority female and these considerations, especially following Hillary Clinton’s Hindenburg act, are a big deal. As for the general, I don’t think gender matters nearly as much as you or they seem to think. I think what will matter for Biden are the qualities and capabilities of the woman he chooses. If Biden picks someone smart, capable and politically astute, she will be an asset. If he picks an unqualified goofball, it might do in his candidacy. Candidate qualities make the difference, not gender.]</p>

<p>WAGA: “A place in the north Georgia mountains that celebrates the magic of make-believe finds itself facing some real-world troubles. … It’s easy to zip past Sleepy Hollow. It sits along busy Highway 515 near Blairsville, tucked behind some trees on a piece of land that rolls gently up to a home and workshop. On that land, Art Millican has built a world of whimsy, a collection of gnome houses and fairy cottages that children can play in for as long as they like. Or as long as their parents’ patience holds out. … But if you haven’t seen Sleepy Hollow, you better get up here quick. It will soon be gone, to make way for a $103 million highway widening project. … If the two sides can’t agree, the state is allowed to condemn the property and let the courts decide the value.”</p>

news, local-news,</p>
<p>Dubbo Westview Drive-In is emerging from an &ldquo;absolutely devastating&rdquo; setback at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to become one of the city&rsquo;s first attractions to reopen at the weekend as restrictions ease. Drought and dust battered the emerging regional drawcard in the past year, before the virus shutdown forced its sell-out March event to be postponed four days out from kick-off. &ldquo;Serious discussions&rdquo; about the future ensued, but with dedicated supporters and a $10,000 NSW government grant, it was finding a way forward, a spokesman for the drive-in operator said. Working closely with Dubbo MP Dugald Saunders to liaise with NSW Health, a COVID safe plan had been approved, &ldquo;which outlined how we were going to operate to keep ourselves and our patrons safe&rdquo;, he said. The return of movies to the outdoor big screen will start with a screening of Shrek on Saturday night, and the June long weekend will feature 80s classics Footloose and The Man From Snowy River. Having to postpone the Running on Empty event planned for March 21-22 was a huge blow. &ldquo;It was absolutely devastating, we had over a thousand people coming from right across four states, 75 different communities and we put a lot of work into that, especially coming out of the drought,&rdquo; the spokesman said. Securing the $10,000 grant from the state government, available to small businesses highly-impacted by COVID-19, proved vital. &ldquo;We had some serious discussions that we couldn&rsquo;t continue, and it&rsquo;s not a lot of money, but it was enough to really help us pay the bills we had to pay and help us get some advice on how we keep going forward,&rdquo; the spokesman said. Worldwide interest in drive-ins amid the pandemic was also &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo;. &ldquo;We started working with our distributors, and we thought well if there&rsquo;s a demand, and there&rsquo;s really not much on, and talking to parents, there&rsquo;s no sport, there&rsquo;s not a lot on, where people can go out with their families,&rdquo; the spokesman said. &ldquo;&hellip;we&rsquo;re really looking forward to having everyone back out there and seeing the smiles on everyone&rsquo;s faces again.&rdquo; One keen patron is Dubbo businessman and car fan Chris Seton, a sponsor of the Running on Empty event. He&rsquo;s been a regular since the drive-in started again after a three-decade break. &ldquo;When I was a kid, that was the thing we did on Saturday night, we all came over to the drive-in, especially when you turned 16, 17, it was the place to go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s like old times.&rdquo; Details about tickets and COVID measures are available on the drive-in&rsquo;s website.</p>

These are the exceptions. Mostly, we all want mac and cheese right now. Universal Studios was first out of the gate late spring, offering drive-ins new and old a nice big platter of mac and cheese ― largely ‘80s and ’90s retro titles on a single hard drive. When the McHenry re-opened in early May, nobody I talked to prior to “The Flintstones” was there because “The Flintstones” was playing. They didn’t care what was playing, really. They cared about going to the drive-in, and getting out of the house in a reasonably safe context.

<h3 id="cuánta-gente-se-quedará-en-quibi-al-acabar-el-periodo-de-prueba-la-plataforma-se-enfrenta-a-su-primer-gran-reto">&ldquo;¿Cuánta gente se quedará en Quibi al acabar el periodo de prueba? La plataforma se enfrenta a su primer gran reto&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/Mx-mR_M2RfrAwABjKv7uK6NJ10A=/1000x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/BZJMIZPASDQZIXSWUO6FLMYNCQ.jpg" alt="img">
La penúltima plataforma de streaming en entrar en el mercado audiovisual quería hacerlo a lo grande con una oferta que apostaba por lo pequeño. De momento, ese envite ha estado mal calculado. Quibi, creada por el veterano de Hollywood Jeffrey Katzenberg y la empresaria Meg Whitman, se estrenó el pasado abril con una propuesta que a priori podría funcionar: series, documentales y reportajes de menos de diez minutos para consumir en los dispositivos móviles en cualquier sitio, en cualquier momento.</p>
<p>Hoy falta el éxito popular y llamativo que les coloque en el mapa. La plataforma se acerca se enfrenta a su primera gran prueba de fuego: el fin de los tres meses de su periodo de prueba gratis. El número de suscriptores que se quede, abonando la tarifa completa, será su primera indicación de éxito sostenible. La única, de hecho. Los efectos de la crisis sanitaria en la industria audiovisual y las luchas internas entre sus dos creadores han dejado a la plataforma con un tibio arranque. Las perspectivas no son buenas y la palabra fracaso sobrevuela el proyecto: si sigue así, en su primer año habrá conseguido menos de un 30% de los suscriptores que había previsto, según The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Quibi, nombre compuesto por el inicio de las palabras quick bites (pequeños bocados), y que pudo haberse llamado Omakase (el nombre del restaurante japonés preferido de Katzenberg y que en ese idioma significa “confiar en el chef”), contaba con llegar a los 7,5 millones de suscriptores (supondrían unos 227 millones de euros en ingresos) de todo el mundo en abril de 2021 (la plataforma está disponible en España, aunque nadie se encargó de anunciarlo). Los números que manejan muestran que van a fallar por más de cinco millones, según fuentes internas citadas por el periódico estadounidense.</p>
<p>En Quibi han apuntado que las cifras son “incorrectas”, pero no han ofrecido otros datos. En su salida, la plataforma, que tiene como objetivo los usuarios de entre 18 y 44 años, lo hizo con los tres primeros meses gratis de oferta (ahora han bajado a dos semanas de prueba; 8,99 euros al mes después), un periodo que para los primeros suscriptores finaliza la primera semana de julio. Los medios especializados vaticinan la baja de muchos de ellos a lo largo del verano. Gigantes como Disney, NBCUniversal, Warner, Sony o ViacomCBS han invertido en el proyecto 1.750 millones de dólares (unos 1.557 millones de euros), pero la compañía calcula ya que para seguir viva en la segunda mitad de 2021 necesitará recaudar de los inversores al menos otros 180 millones de dólares.</p>
<p>La vida de Jeffrey Katzenberg está llena de éxitos empresariales en Hollywood tras su paso por Paramount Pictures, los estudios Disney y la creación junto a Steven Spielberg y David Geffen de Dreamworks (Shrek, Madagascar&hellip;.), pero también de desencuentros con otros miembros de la industria. Incluso dentro de sus propias compañías. Según The Wall Street Journal, los enfrentamientos con Whitman han sido constantes desde el principio del proyecto en 2018. Esta última incluso ha tenido que aceptar un recorte de un 10% de su salario (junto a otros ejecutivos de la empresa) por los malos resultados iniciales.</p>
<p>La jefa de marketing, Megan Imbres, abandonó Quibi dos semanas después del lanzamiento y en noviembre hizo lo propio Diane Nelson, jefa de operaciones de contenido. En las últimas semanas, Katzenberg y Whitman han achacado parte del fracaso de su plataforma a la crisis por la Covid-19 e incluso por reducir su campaña de marketing por no interferir en “cómo el país está ahora comprometido en un importante diálogo y movimiento social focalizado en el Black Lives Matter”.</p>
<p>Entre la fecha de su debut, el 6 de abril, y el 28 de mayo, la aplicación de Quibi fue descargada alrededor de cuatro millones de veces, según la consultora Apptopia, un buen número que no se corresponde con las altas en el servicio. La compañía tenía previsto que sus contenidos solo pudieran consumirse en móviles y tabletas, pero en esta travesía por el desierto en la que se han convertido sus primeros meses, han tenido que ceder para que también se puedan proyectar a los televisores a través de servicios como AirPlay (Apple) y Chromecast (Google). Un paso atrás que rompe con la filosofía original del proyecto y que podría no ser el último para convencer a los usuarios de que su oferta es tan válida como la del resto de plataformas. Entre los contenidos que pueden encontrarse en Quibi hay series, noticias y reportajes de cadenas como la BBC o la NBC, e incluso concursos.</p>
<p>Entre los mejor valorados en la página Rotten Tomatoes, que agrega críticas profesionales y de los espectadores, están productos como las series documentales Run this City (que sigue el día a día del alcalde más joven en la historia de Massachussetts) y I Promise (con el baloncestista LeBron James), el concurso Gayme Show! (compiten heterosexuales que deben demostrar sus conocimientos sobre la comunidad LGTBI), el thriller The Stranger y la serie antológica de terror 50 States of Fright, creada por Sam Raimi. El catálogo se completará en los próximos meses con productos de Steven Spielberg, Guillermo del Toro, Antoine Fuqua, Peter Farrelly y Ridley Scott, entre otros.</p>
<p>Los contenidos de la plataforma se pueden ver en formato horizontal y en vertical, basta con girar el dispositivo y se ajusta de forma automática, pero se pierde calidad e información visual. Las series están rodadas en origen para su consumo horizontal, el habitual en televisiones. Al voltear el móvil, aunque de primeras resulte bastante fluido y pueda resultar muy cómodo para lo que está pensado Quibi (visionados en el transporte público, mientras se hace cola en algún sitio, ocupar pequeños momentos de tiempo en el que se tiene el móvil a mano) se dejan de ver muchas cosas. Por ejemplo, en una persecución se puede ver a una furgoneta huyendo de varios coches policía, pero al ponerlo en vertical, se ve solo la parte delantera de la furgoneta, se pierde todo el contexto. Se queda todo en un pequeño bocado para un plato demasiado grande.

<h3 id="study-of-youtube-algorithms-find-lgbt-shrek-among-demonetized-terms">&ldquo;Study of YouTube algorithms find LGBT, Shrek among demonetized terms&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/bsd/bcb62a8f-e04d-4a03-967e-9db6e51f7c96.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
An independent study of YouTube algorithms recently came out, claiming that YouTube algorithms were acting in a ‘bigoted’ manner, targeting videos with the word ‘Gay’ or “Lesbian’ in the title and demonetizing them.</p>
<p>This study, led by three YouTube-centric researchers came out on Monday, September 30 when Sealow, the Ocelot AI CEO; Andrew of YouTube Analyzed channel; and Een of Nerd City gathered together to begin investigating reports that YouTube&rsquo;s algorithm automatically demonetized certain words, causing the creator to lose their ability to gain income from that video via advertising revenue. Each of the aforementioned creators eventually decided to run specific videos on the topic, but each one was relying on the same dataset:</p>
<p>As expressed by The Verge:</p>
<p>“Andrew manually tested 15,300 words between June 2nd and July 5th, 2019, using the most common terms in Webster’s Dictionary, UrbanDictionary, and Google search results. The second round of experiment ran between July 6th and July 21st, and it included 14,000 words that were automated using YouTube’s data API by Sealow. Een collaborated with his own sources and helped produce the main video.”</p>
<p>The trio of researchers eventually posted the list of words onto an Excel document that is available to the public for reading and reproduction.</p>
<p>Each video was kept on a simple format, with minimal content or images that would trigger the bots. They were designed specifically to test the effect of words on it.</p>
<p>As they began to dig into the particulars, they found that pro-LGBT content, most notably gay, lesbian, progressive, and liberal were quickly demonetized, as were keywords like ;You, that, abuse, needle, Shrek, Indonesia, and many others. Some demonetized words were clearly political in nature, such as Afghanistan or abortion, while others appeared to hold double-entendre/sexual meanings, such as penis or nipple. However, terms like conservative or Republican did not trigger the software, implying an implicit bias in the bots regarding the political spectrum, or at least realizing patterns of content creation which lead directly to dissent and tension for advertisers. The research also found that swapping words like gay for happy immediately caused a change in the data itself.</p>
<p>In the cases of these videos being demonetized, creators do have the option to resubmit them so that a human re-evaluator can handle the case themselves and determine if this was a fair analysis by said bot.</p>
<p>YouTube has denied multiple times that their bot software targets these keywords. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki stated in an interview that “We work incredibly hard to make sure that when our machines learn something — because a lot of our decisions are made algorithmically — that our machines are fair… There shouldn’t be [any automatic demonetization].”</p>
<p>But despite the CEO’s words, there still is said demonetization going on.</p>
<p>These developments occurred a month after a number of LGBT YouTubers filed a lawsuit against YouTube for their discriminatory acts.</p>
