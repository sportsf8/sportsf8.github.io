HARVEY WEINSTEIN has undergone a ‘historic fall from grace’ and deserves mercy, his lawyers have told a judge.

The convicted rapist ‘cannot walk outside without being heckled’ according to a letter filed in advance of his sentencing today.

His defence team added he should be given a minimum jail term in view of his serious health issues.

However, prosecutors are expected to seek a severe punishment for the ailing 67-year-old.

In the letter, Weinstein’s lawyers asked Judge James Burke to jail him for no more than five years instead of the potential 29-year maximum term.

‘Simply put, his fall from grace has been historic, perhaps unmatched in the age of social media,’ they argued.

Even if he is given a lesser term, ‘the grave reality is that Mr Weinstein may not even outlive that term’ making it ‘a de facto life sentence’, the court papers say. Weinstein’s use of a walking frame in court appearances raised questions about his health.

After his New York trial last month he was sent to Bellevue Hospital amid concerns about high blood pressure and heart palpitations. He has since been transferred to an infirmary at the Rikers Island prison.

Weinstein’s lawyers said he was also struggling with unsuccessful surgery on his back after a car crash last summer and also has an eye condition.

Prosecutors said that ‘a lifetime of abuse toward others, sexual and otherwise’ required a sentence that ‘reflects the seriousness’ of his offences and his ‘total lack of remorse’.

For his criminal sex act conviction, he faces a sentence of five to 25 years, while the third-degree rape count carries a maximum four-year sentence.
