<p>&lsquo;I see myself at Liverpool, I wouldn&rsquo;t change anything&rsquo; - Adrian content at Anfield amid rumours of potential La Liga return</p>
<p>The Spanish goalkeeper insists that his focus is locked on helping the Reds secure a first Premier League title rather than his future</p>
<p>Adrian has insisted he is happy at and &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t change anything&rdquo; about his current situation, despite rumours of a potential return to swirling ahead of the summer transfer window.</p>
<p>Liverpool brought Adrian in to serve as a back-up goalkeeper behind Alisson as previous number two Simon Mignolet made his way to back in August.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old, who enjoyed a previous stint in the Premier League with West Ham between 2013 and 2019, was initially expected to play a bit-part role in the Reds&rsquo; latest campaign, but has benefitted from Alisson&rsquo;s struggles with a series of niggling injuries.</p>
<p>Adrian has stepped in for the Brazilian in 18 games across all competitions for the Reds this season, helping them rise to the top of the table while also starring in a UEFA Super Cup final win over .</p>
<p>The experienced shot-stopper is contracted to remain at Anfield until 2021 and has the option to extend his stay by an extra year, but he has been linked with a move away from the club when the transfer market reopens.</p>
<p>A number of La Liga clubs have been credited with an interest in Adrian, including his former employers , who are reportedly eager to lure the keeper back to Benito Villamarin Stadium for a second spell.</p>
<p>However, the Spaniard is content in his current surroundings on Merseyside, as he told Radio Sevilla: “I see myself in Liverpool at the moment.</p>
<p>“I still have many years of football left, and we will see. I have one more year and another optional one. Right now I wouldn’t change anything to be here in Liverpool and enjoy this beautiful moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this moment I honestly don’t know, football is a lot of fun. In the summer, being a free agent, I saw the possibility of returning to Betis was there, but it vanished.</p>
<p>“You have to live in the present, and we’ll see what happens next. Having to leave home was complicated but looking at it now with perspective it’s clear that I’ve grown as a professional and as a person.”</p>
<p>Adrian went on to reveal how close he came to re-joining Betis last summer, before insisting his mindset has changed after a &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo; year at Liverpool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth, now I see it being a little more difficult (to return to the Betis),&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>“After six seasons at West Ham and being free this past summer, it is true that I saw myself closer to returning home or to and continuing my career there.</p>
<p>“Here I signed two seasons plus an optional one and this has been my first year, which has been fantastic.</p>
<p>“We hope to finish the season if possible, with total security, on the pitch, but then we don’t know anymore.</p>
<p>“The future is very uncertain; we can’t plan much more about tomorrow and what we have now. If the opportunity is given in the future, God will say.”

<h3 id="liverpool-chief-michael-edwards-spent-12-months-persuading-star-to-snub-chelsea-transfer">&ldquo;Liverpool chief Michael Edwards spent 12 months persuading star to snub Chelsea transfer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/750x445/1293989.jpg" alt="img">
Michael Edwards reportedly spent a year trying to convince Alisson and his representatives that Liverpool was the best destination for him once he left Roma. The Brazilian sealed his £67million switch to Anfield on the back of the World Cup in Russia in a move that proved a game-changer for Jurgen Klopp .</p>
<p>Liverpool snubbing Werner may not spell end of their Leipzig exploits</p>
<p>Two Liverpool deals now the priority after Timo Werner snub</p>
<p>Liverpool knew all about Alisson&rsquo;s quality, despite putting seven past him in the Champions League semi-finals.</p>
<p>That season, he was among the best goalkeepers in Europe in a market where there were not many standout number ones.</p>
<p>Liverpool were looking to strengthen between the sticks given the inconsistency of both Loris Karius and Simon Mignolet, who had both failed to nail down the No 1 spot.</p>
<p>Both were prone to an error, something that proved costly for the Reds in the Champions League final defeat against Real Madrid in Kiev.</p>

<p>After the dramatic Champions League success in Istanbul and a fraught title battle with Manchester United, it all ended with an underwhelming goalless draw.</p>
<p>Rafa Benitez’s last game in charge of Liverpool was a 0-0 draw away to Hull City in May 2010, a result that saw his side finish seventh in the Premier League. It was a disappointment, and less than a month later the Spaniard had parted ways with the club by mutual consent.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;ll always keep in my heart the good times I&rsquo;ve had here, the strong and loyal support of the fans in the tough times and the love from Liverpool,” an emotional Benitez said. “I have no words to thank you enough for all these years and I am very proud to say that I was your manager.”</p>
<p>Liverpool fans need no reminder of what came next. The appointment of Roy Hodgson and the results that followed - as well as the financial state the club found themselves in - left Liverpool at their nadir.</p>
<p>A decade on, Liverpool are thriving under Jurgen Klopp. So much has changed that Benitez’s tenure seems like a distant memory. Here we take a look at what happened next to the starting XI from his final game in charge.</p>
<p>(Image: 2010 Getty Images)</p>
<p>Pepe Reina</p>
<p>The Spanish goalkeeper stayed at Liverpool until 2014, and had made a total of 396 appearances by the time he left for Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>After a year spent mostly on the bench in Germany, Reina joined Napoli, where he enjoyed three successful seasons. Then it was onto Milan, who earlier this season allowed the 37-year-old to move to Aston Villa on loan.</p>
<p>Javier Mascherano</p>
<p>The tenacious Argentine left Liverpool shortly after Benitez, making the switch to Barcelona, where he spent a productive eight years - which included five La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues - playing mostly as a defender.</p>
<p>After two seasons with Hebei China Fortune, Mascherano, 35, is now back in his homeland, at Estudiantes.</p>
<p>Jamie Carragher</p>
<p>The definition of a one-club man, Carragher remained at Liverpool until his retirement as a player in 2013. He had been a key man under Benitez, and indeed every other Liverpool manager at the time.</p>
<p>Carragher, who finished with 737 Liverpool appearances to his name, is now a pundit and co-commentator for Sky Sports, where he has formed an unlikely partnership with Gary Neville.</p>
<p>Sotirios Kyrgiakos</p>
<p>Kyrgiakos, now 40, most recently played for Sydney Olympic in 2014, after spells at Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga and Sunderland.</p>
<p>The long-haired centre-back also made 61 appearances for Greece.</p>
<p>Daniel Agger</p>
<p>The hard-nosed defender remained a mostly reliable performer at Liverpool until 2014, when he left for Brondby in the Danish Superliga.</p>
<p>After two seasons in his homeland, Agger retired in 2016, at the age of just 31. He has since moved to Marbella in Spain, where he runs a sewer company called KloAgger. Agger is also a qualified tattoo artist and invested in Tattoodo, a social platform that allows users to share inspiration for new designs.</p>
<p>Alberto Aquilani</p>
<p>Much was expected of the Italian midfielder when he was brought in for £20million from Roma in 2009.</p>
<p>Aquilani never really produced at Liverpool, though, and left in 2012 having made just 28 appearances. He returned to Italy, spending three years at Fiorentina.</p>
<p>Then it was onto Sporting CP, Pescara and, finally, Las Palmas in Spain. A year after being released by the Gran Canaria club, Aquilani announced his retirement in 2019.</p>
<p>Lucas Leiva</p>
<p>Lucas was relatively early in his career when Benitez left, a young midfielder who played with real maturity and intelligence.</p>
<p>That allowed him to remain a reliable player for Liverpool until 2017, when he was sold to Lazio as Klopp looked to revamp his squad.</p>
<p>Lucas is 32 now, but has impressed for Lazio in Serie A, named the club’s player of the season in both 2017/18 and 2018/19.</p>
<p>Steven Gerrard</p>
<p>A Liverpool great and without question one of the best players in Premier League history, Gerrard retired in 2016 after two seasons with LA Galaxy.</p>
<p>His brief stint in MLS won’t be remembered for long, though. Instead, the talk will always be of his 120 Premier League goals, of his 710 appearances in a Liverpool shirt and of his performance in Istanbul in 2005.</p>
<p>Gerrard has been Rangers boss since 2018 and is showing plenty of promise in his first managerial job.</p>
<p>Ryan Babel</p>
<p>Babel was always a player capable of producing moments of brilliance at Liverpool, but his inconsistency eventually led to his departure. He was sold to Hoffenheim in 2011 and has since played for a host of clubs, including Ajax, Kasimpasa, Al-Ain, Deportivo La Coruña, Beşiktaş and Fulham.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old is currently contracted to Galatasaray, but has been on loan at Ajax since January.</p>
<p>Dirk Kuyt</p>
<p>A tireless runner who seemed likely to be one of those players who would continue on well into his 40s, Kuyt retired in 2017 while at Feyenoord.</p>
<p>And he went out in style, scoring a hat-trick on the final day of the Eredivisie season to help his club to their first title since 1999.</p>
<p>In 2018, he briefly came out of retirement to provide another attacking option for Quick Boys, where he was already assistant manager. He was a quick boy only in name, and managed just three appearances before hanging up his boots for good.</p>
<p>Kuyt remains a favourite at Liverpool, where he was a regular goal scorer and a consistently selfless performer until his exit for Fenerbahçe in 2012.</p>
<p>Nabil El Zhar</p>
<p>El Zhar was a young winger who showed plenty of potential at Liverpool but never established himself and as a result was sold to Levante in 2011.</p>
<p>The Morocco international stayed in Spain until last year - with spells at Las Palmas and Leganes - before moving to Al Ahli, where he has scored five goals in 16 appearances.

<h3 id="ronaldo-in-la-liga-and-premier-league-champions-xi">&ldquo;Ronaldo in La Liga and Premier League champions XI&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2020/04/25170035/Cristiano-Ronaldo-Manchester-United-1.jpg" alt="img">
We’ve already had the Coppa Italia and FA Cup winners XI. Now, because of the return of La Liga this week, here’s an XI made up from players who have won the Premier League title and La Liga title…</p>
<p>Goalkeeper: Thibaut Courtois</p>
<p>Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois will be hoping to add a second La Liga title to his honours list now football in Spain is resuming. The Belgian ‘keeper won the competition back in 2014 with Atletico Madrid, whilst on loan from Chelsea. He ousted Petr Cech at Stamford Bridge to win a Premier League title under Jose Mourinho and went on to lift the trophy again in 2017. Chilean international Claudio Bravo is another goalkeeper who has won the league in Spain and England.</p>
<p>Right-back: Danilo</p>
<p>Former City defender Danilo has a La Liga title from his spell at Real Madrid and two Premier League titles from his brief stay in England, having left these shores for Italy last year. Now at table-topping Juventus, he’ll be hoping to win the Coppa Italia and Serie A this season. The Brazilian international certainly looks on course to possess one of the most eclectic trophy collections in football.</p>
<p>Centre-back: Gerard Pique</p>
<p>A bit-part player at Manchester United, Gerard Pique featured sporadically for the Red Devils in their successful 2007/08 season, when he was just 21 years old. Now 33, the Spanish defender has eight La Liga titles sitting alongside his solitary Premier League medal. Not bad for a guy bullied by Bolton.</p>
<p>Rooney: “Bolton away more or less finished Gerard Pique’s career at United.” https://t.co/c3nPvs4DIO — beIN SPORTS USA (@beINSPORTSUSA) May 21, 2020</p>
<p>Centre-back: Ricardo Carvalho</p>
<p>A three-time Premier League title winner with Chelsea, Ricardo Carvalho spent six seasons in England. The Portuguese international and London-born John Terry formed a superb partnership at the back under Jose Mourinho, with the side conceding just 15 goals in the 2004/05 campaign. Carvalho left for Spain in 2010 but suffered with injuries during his spell at Real Madrid. However, he did manage to win a La Liga title with Los Blancos in 2012.</p>
<p>Left-back: Gabriel Heinze</p>
<p>A Premier League winner with Manchester United, Argentinean defender Gabriel Heinze could’ve missed out on a La Liga title if he had made the controversial move to Liverpool instead of Real Madrid in 2007. Giovanni Van Bronckhorst is also eligible for this side, having won top-flight titles with Arsenal and Barcelona.</p>
<p>Right wing: David Beckham</p>
<p>The iconic David Beckham couldn’t add to his solitary Champions League medal whilst playing for Real Madrid but he did pick up a La Liga title to sit alongside his impressive collection of six Premier League titles. Dutch winger Arjen Robben also lifted trophies in England and Spain, before his decade-long spell in Germany.</p>
<p>Beckham: “One of the nicest moments as a Madrid player was when we won La Liga because it looked like we wouldn’t. Another moment was my last training session with Zizou; he sat next to me and said, ‘thank you for everything and for being a wonderful teammate.’” [marca] pic.twitter.com/rZlgy5H3VO — SB (@Realmadridplace) May 15, 2020</p>
<p>Central midfield: Cesc Fabregas</p>
<p>Former Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas only featured in the League Cup during the Gunners’ ‘Invincibles’ season, with the talented Spaniard unable to inspire the side to another first-place finish during his seven-year spell in the first team. The Spanish midfielder did lift the La Liga title with Barcelona in 2013, before returning to London with Chelsea the following year and adding two Premier League medals to his honours list.</p>
<p>Central midfield: Yaya Toure</p>
<p>Despite possessing former La Liga talents Pablo Zabaleta, David Silva and Sergio Aguero in the 2011/12 season, Manchester City’s first ever Premier League-winning team contained only one man who lifted the Spanish title. Yaya Toure was part of Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering Barcelona side before making his move to England. Former Chelsea players Claude Makelele, Deco and Tiago are other midfielders who won the Premier League and La Liga during their careers.</p>
<p>Left wing: Cristiano Ronaldo</p>
<p>The most obvious candidate for the side, Ronaldo has six league titles and five Champions League titles. Four of those came at Manchester United, whilst he picked up six of those medals during his stay at the Bernabeu. There’s probably a few more to come before he hangs up his boots. The sadly departed Jose Antonio Reyes and Chelsea’s Pedro are also eligible for this side.</p>
<p>Congratulations to @Cristiano on becoming the first player to win The Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. A wonderful achievement. 👏👏 — Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) April 20, 2019</p>
<p>Striker: Ruud Van Nistelrooy</p>
<p>Former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Ruud Van Nistelrooy never got past the last four in the Champions League but he did lift the Premier League trophy in 2003, before going on to win two La Liga titles with Los Blancos. Another ex-United forward is eligible for this side, with Henrik Larsson briefly delighting the Old Trafford crowd in the 2006/07 season. The Swedish star won two La Liga titles with Barcelona after a lengthy spell in Scotland with Celtic.</p>
<p>Striker: Thierry Henry</p>
<p>Larsson was part of the Barcelona side that defeated Thierry Henry’s Arsenal in the 2006 Champions League final. The influential Frenchman went on to play for the Spanish giants a just over a year later and picked up two La Liga titles there to go alongside his two Premier League titles with the Gunners. Former Chelsea forwards Eidur Gudjohnsen and Diego Costa also won both competitions.</p>

<h3 id="english-premier-league-recognises-high-risk-games-involving-liverpool-arsenal-chelsea">&ldquo;English Premier League recognises ‘high-risk’ games involving Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/fa-cup.jpg" alt="img">
English Premier League is contemplating shifting some of the “high risk” games to neutral grounds amid fears that fans may throng outside the closed venues, breaking the social distancing guidelines and risking an outbreak of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Home games of Liverpool, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal have been recognised as “high risk” matches and the clubs can be asked by Premier League to shift their home games to neutral venues.</p>
<p>Liverpool will restart their season in the Merseyside derby against Everton and will then play Manchester City and Chelsea and those games have been considered as high-risk ones.</p>
<p>The Reds need just two victories to grab the title after 30 years and officials fear fans would not want to miss the chance for celebration and, thus, believe shifting their home games away would be safer.</p>
<p>However, according to Evening Standard, the Liverpool chiefs are confident that the Merseyside police and Safety Advisory Group will give them a green light to have their matches at the Anfield.</p>
<p>List of high-risk games according to English outlet Metro:</p>
<p>Everton vs Liverpool</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur vs West Ham United</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Crystal Palace</p>
<p>West Ham United vs Chelsea</p>
<p>Manchester City vs Liverpool</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Aston Villa</p>
<p>Crystal Palace vs Chelsea</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Burnley</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur vs Arsenal</p>
<p>Liverpool vs Chelsea</p>
<p>Crystal Palace vs Tottenma Hotspur</p>
<p>The English Premier League clubs on Thursday agreed on June 17 as the resumption date for the 2019-20 season. If everything falls in place the competition will return after a suspension of more than 100 days due to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“Premier League Shareholders today agreed to a new provisional restart date for the 2019/20 season of Wednesday 17 June, provided that all safety requirements are in place,” the Premier League said in a statement.

<h3 id="laliga-preview-the-best-players-in-laliga-revealed-as-spanish-football-prepares-for-restart">&ldquo;LaLiga preview: The best players in LaLiga revealed as Spanish football prepares for restart&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sportinglife.com/images/news/1260x709/18a6b141-7c99-499b-a7b2-28343bfaad74.jpg" alt="img">
LaLiga is back! And we&rsquo;ve got five players that you need to be watching when Spanish football returns after a three-month break.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no surprise to see who&rsquo;s top of the list, but how can you even dare to compile a rundown of LaLiga&rsquo;s best anything without putting the great Lionel Messi in there though? Whisper it quietly, but there is more to LaLiga than just Messi though - and there are four more top quality players here who are worth keeping on the right side of. These players could prove decisive from now until the end of the campaign. Lionel Messi (Barcelona)</p>
<p>Lionel Messi in action for Barcelona against Real Madrid in El Clasico</p>
<p>Who else? The Barcelona captain and six-time Ballon d’Or winner is always, always worth watching. And with 19 goals and 12 assists so far this season, Lionel Messi has played a direct role in 31 of Barça’s 63 goals (49%) and could essentially determine the destination of the 2019-20 LaLiga title. Barcelona have Luis Suarez back from injury, but their squad still looks a little short compared to that of their direct rivals. Messi will be the man they look to for inspiration and to lead them through to what would be a ninth LaLiga title in 12 seasons. Martin Odegaard (Real Sociedad) The 21-year-old Norwegian has been, without doubt, one of the stars of the 2019-20 LaLiga season. Currently on loan at the Basque club from Real Madrid, Odegaard finally looks to be fulfilling the promise that drove Los Blancos to buy him as a 15-year-old.</p>

<p>With a silky touch and an almost unrivalled ability to unpick defences with a single pass, Odegaard will be key in La Real’s push to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2013. Thibaut Courtois (Real Madrid) After an up-and-down first season in the Spanish capital, Courtois has cemented his reputation as one of the world’s best goalkeepers. Imperious this campaign, the Belgian international has conceded just 0.67 goals per game, putting him top of the rankings for LaLiga’s top goalkeeper. Real Madrid sit just two points behind reigning champions Barcelona, and a watertight defence will be key in the remaining 11 games if Zinedine Zidane’s side want to overtake their eternal rivals in the standings. Lucas Perez (Alaves) Former Arsenal and West Ham striker Lucas Perez is flying in LaLiga and has formed a fine partnership with former Stoke and Newcastle forward Joselu at Alaves.</p>
<p>Lucas Pérez is on 🔥</p>

<p>pic.twitter.com/MhtV23S3u9 — Premier Sports 📺 (@PremierSportsTV) November 5, 2019</p>
<p>Perez was having a terrific 2019-20 campaign before the break playing alongside Joselu in Alaves’ 4-4-2 system, and currently sits level with Levante’s Roger Marti and Villarreal CF’s Gerard Moreno on 11 goals in then race for the Zarra trophy, the award for the top Spanish goal scorer in LaLiga. Alaves have no natural backup for Perez in their squad, meaning the Coruna native will need to keep performing at a high level from now until the end of the season. Marcos Llorente (Atletico Madrid) For many football fans, the last major footballing moment before the enforced break was Atletico de Madrid’s dramatic win over Liverpool at Anfield in the Champions League. The star man for the Rojiblancos that night was Marcos Llorente, who came off the bench to ping in two goals from distance.
