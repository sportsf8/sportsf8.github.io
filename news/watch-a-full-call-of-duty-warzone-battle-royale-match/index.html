Call of Duty's new free-to-play Warzone battle royale mode is coming very soon, as it's scheduled to arrive on Wednesday, March 10, across PS4, Xbox One, and PC. While you have to wait a little while longer to play the game, a series of gameplay videos of it have emerged online.

YouTuber Drift0r and the PlayStation Access YouTube channel are among those who were invited to play the game early, and they've posted full-match gameplay videos. These videos contain a huge number of previously unannounced details about Warzone, so they are well worth watching in full for players who want to know everything there is to know about the mode.

Everyone who already owns Modern Warfare will see Warzone pop up from the main menu, next to standard multiplayer, co-op, and campaign. Warzone is also available to everyone as a free-to-play standalone game that you can download from the PlayStation and Xbox stores, in addition to PC.

Warzone launches first for people who own Modern Warfare, while free-to-play users will have to wait four extra hours to begin playing. The Warzone battle royale mode supports up to 150 players, which is larger than the maximum player counts for Fortnite, Apex Legends, and PUBG.

In addition to battle royale, Warzone features a second mode, Plunder, which is basically a race to collect the most cash by looting, stealing it from other players, and completing mid-match objectives.

Both of Warzone's modes take place across the same map, Verdansk, which Activision describes as "an expansive city with multiple named zones and well over 300 points of interest." You'll be able to find five different vehicle types across the map, including ATVs, cargo trucks, and helicopters. You can read more details about Warzone on the official Call of Duty website.
