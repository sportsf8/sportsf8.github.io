<p>They recently returned to Berlin to resume filming for the highly anticipated Matrix 4.</p>
<p>And Keanu Reeves and the cast of the sci-fi thriller enjoyed a celebratory July 4 meal in the German capital on Saturday night</p>
<p>The actor, 55, was joined by his girlfriend Alexandra Grant, 47, and Carrie-Anne Moss, 52, who starred as Trinity alongside Keanu in the previous three films of the series.</p>
<p>The Matrix Reunited: Keanu Reeves and his girlfriend Alexandra Grant enjoyed a dinner on Saturday in Berlin with the Matrix 4 cast</p>
<p>Neil Patrick Harris was also spotted later on as the cast met at a private apartment in the edgy Kreuzberg district.</p>
<p>Keanu cut a low-key figure in a smart suit and shirt, while his long hair and beard look a world away from the clean cut Neo of the first film in 1999.</p>
<p>His philanthropist girlfriend was similarly suited and booted for the get-together in a dark jacket with white detailing on the arms.</p>
<p>Suited and booted: The couple had dressed to impress with Alexandra in a smart black suit with polka dots</p>
<p>Dinner date: The John Wick star rocked up in a grey shirt and a dark suit for the get-together in the Kreuzberg district</p>
<p>Cast dinner: Keanu&rsquo;s Matrix costar Carrie-Ann Moss rocked up in a denim jacket and a shirt as they celebrated July 4</p>
<p>Friendly face: Carrie-Anne, 52, starred as Trinity alongside Keanu in the previous three films of the series</p>
<p>The Matrix 4 will be released in 2021 and production began in early January with Lana Wachowski returning as co-writing and director, and while filming stopped in Berlin in March the stars returned to Berlin last month.</p>
<p>When the new movie was announced, Lana said in a statement: &lsquo;Many of the ideas Lilly and I explored 20 years ago about our reality are even more relevant now&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m very happy to have these characters back in my life and grateful for another chance to work with my brilliant friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Aleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell co-wrote the Matrix 4 script alongside Wachowski. Keanu is again playing Neo with Carrie-Ann back as well.</p>
<p>Mixing in: Many passersby and tourists appeared oblivious to Keanu as he walked down the street</p>
<p>Return: The Matrix 4 will be released in 2021 and production began in early January with Lana Wachowski returning as co-writing and director</p>
<p>Heading home: Later on in the evening Keanu cut a low-key figure as he made his farewells and left the party</p>
<p>Catching up: Carrie-Anne Moss shortly followed Keanu and Alexandra after they enjoyed their dinner together</p>
<p>Highly anticipated: The Matrix 4 will be the first film in the hit series since 2003&rsquo;s Matrix Revolutions</p>
<p>The Matrix 4 will also also feature Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who&rsquo;s best known to audiences as Black Manta in 2018&rsquo;s Aquaman.</p>
<p>Reeves&rsquo; next film is the next Bill And Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure with Alex Winter.</p>
<p>Ever since Reeves and Grant went public with their relationship in November, there has been much speculation about when their romance.</p>
<p>Some publications said they had been together for only a few months but in June, Jennifer Tilly told Page Six that they had been an item for &lsquo;years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Close couple: Keanu and Alexandra have kept much of their relationship out of the public eye</p>
<p>Returning: Keanu starred as as Neo in the hit 1999 film as he tried to free humanity from the Matrix, a virtual reality system</p>
<p>Way back when: Joe Pantoliano, Laurence Fishburne, Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss pictured in the poster for the original Matrix in 1999</p>
<p>Blockbuster: The philosophical thriller was a huge hit, winning four Oscars and plaudits from viewers and critics</p>
<p>Grant is an artist and philanthropist. Born in Ohio, she has been working in the arts since graduating from Swarthmore College in 1994 with a BA in history and studio art.</p>
<p>The artist is known for her use of language and exchanges with writers as a source for imagery in her sculpture, painting, drawing, and video works.</p>
<p>The talented artist fostered her love for the spoken word as a child, after growing up around the world, living in Mexico, Spain and France.</p>
<p>She has exhibited at prestigious spaces around the world including Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), Galerie Gradiva in Paris and The Harris Lieberman Gallery in New York.</p>
<p>Couple goals: Ever since Reeves and Grant went public with their relationship in November, there has been much speculation about when their romance</p>
<p>In 2008, Alexandra founded the philanthropic grantLOVE project which produces and sells original artworks and editions to benefit artist projects and arts non-profits.</p>
<p>Alexandra and Keanu have a history that goes back years, first collaborating together on a grown-up&rsquo;s picture book, Ode to Happiness, in 2011.</p>
<p>The book was a success, sparking the poet-artist duo to create their second book together, Shadows, in 2016, with Grant photographing Reeves while he was filming John Wick.</p>
<p>Perfect match: Alexandra and Keanu have a history that goes back years, first collaborating together on a grown-up&rsquo;s picture book, Ode to Happiness, in 2011</p>
<p>Since then, the two have been spotted together at art galleries, book signings, posed for Vogue Spain and even traveled to Germany to work together.</p>
<p>Speaking of working together on their second book, Grant told W Magazine: &lsquo;We can spend a lot of time debating. Like, A raspberry hue? And should it be darker? We can get obsessive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shadows is compiled of dark silhouette images of Reeves taken by Grant and poetry written by the Matrix actor.</p>
<p>The Matrix 4: The Matrix franchise is the brainchild of transgender sisters Lana and Lilly Wachowski who created and wrote the billion dollar trilogy and the pair are returning to helm the fourth film which began filming in San Francisco in February (pictured)</p>
<p>Grant told the LA Times of her collaborator: &lsquo;No one can move the way he can. He&rsquo;s a really extreme performer. That&rsquo;s a huge piece of why those images are so interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew that if I moved the camera as we danced together, as photographer and subject, we could create these wonderful optical illusions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two founded publishing company X Artists&rsquo; Books in 2017, with a focus on &lsquo;unusual collaborations&rsquo; and books that &lsquo;don&rsquo;t really have a place because they&rsquo;re between genres&rsquo;.

<p><img src="https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shutterstock_editorial_10464371ab-1.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C2564px%2C1347px&amp;resize=1200%2C630" alt="img">
Keanu Reeves Is One Lucky Guy! Get to Know His Gorgeous Girlfriend Alexandra Grant</p>
<p>Meant to be! Alexandra Grant is the lucky woman who stole boyfriend Keanu Reeves‘ heart. When the artist revealed she was dating the Matrix actor, all of her friends called her up to gush about her new relationship.</p>
<p>“Every single person I knew called me in the first week of November, and that’s fascinating,” Alexandra previously gushed to Vogue. Although her friends and family knew she was dating the actor, the public didn’t find out until Life &amp; Style Weekly broke the news in November 2019 after they were spotted holding hands at the LACMA Art + Film Gala.</p>
<p>“It’s really astonishing to me how in the last five months, all of a sudden, she goes to an event with him and everybody goes insane, like, ‘It’s his new girlfriend,’ because she had gone to a lot of events with him. It’s just suddenly surfaced that he’s been dating her for several years,” Alexandra’s friend Jennifer Tilly previously told Page Six.</p>
<p>During the interview, Jennifer said the duo are the “perfect couple” because Alexandra is a “cool, elegant woman” and Keanu is “a really great guy.”</p>
<p>“I think everybody wishes that they had something like that. It’s not a razzle-dazzle Hollywood romance,” she said. What makes their relationship work so well is that the couple “inspire each other on every level,” an insider previously Closer Weekly. “That’s what makes them such a great match.”</p>
<p>Although the silver-haired beauty and her beau haven’t talked about marriage as yet, it’s only a matter of time before they tie the knot. “They’re practically inseparable,” another source told Life &amp; Style Weekly. “They’re in love … Keanu can see himself spending the rest of his life with her. She’s kind, warm and spiritual, just like [him], and a great communicator.”</p>
<p>Until they’re ready to take the next step in their relationship, Keanu and his love will continue taking things slow. After all, the Point Break star was in a “dark place for so long” when his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Syme died in a traffic collision in 2001. He didn’t really “turn his life around” until Keanu met Alexandra. Her “positive outlook” on life was enough to keep him going. Now, Keanu feels great that he’s found love again.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Alexandra-Grant-Keanu-Reeves-Sandra-Bullock-dating-history.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&amp;resize=1200%2C630" alt="img">
There’s no doubt about it, Keanu Reeves is one good looking guy! The Matrix actor has dated some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood such as Sofia Coppola and his current girlfriend, Alexandra Grant. The pair walked the red carpet together at the LACMA Art and Film Gala and Alexandra has already made a good impression on the actor’s mom, Patricia.</p>
<p>“What Patricia loves most about Alexandra is her caring nature and the fact that she’s with Keanu for who he is rather than his fame and money,” a source previously told Closer. Not only that, but Keanu’s mom has “seen a huge change” in her son since he first met Alexandra at a dinner party in 2009.</p>
<p>“He’s more positive about life,” the insider dished. “Seeing her son so happy makes her happy!” But Alexandra is not the only woman who has occupied Keanu’s heart. During a May 2019 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Keanu said he used to have a “crush” on his Speed costar Sandra Bullock.</p>
<p>“She’s such a wonderful person, such a wonderful actress,” he gushed. “It was nice to go to work.” Even though Keanu never told Sandra he had feelings for her, the Proposal actress did tell Ellen DeGeneres that she was smitten with her costar too. “I think of how sweet Keanu was and how handsome he was,” Sandra gushed about the time they spent together on Speed. “It was hard for me to like, really be serious. Like, he would look at me and I’d be like [giggles]. And I’d have to try to, you know [be serious].”</p>
<p>Love never blossomed between the two. After they did Speed together, the duo went on to star in the 2006 flick The Lake House where they played a couple who were divided by time.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain in words why Sandra and I have chemistry on-screen or why we work well together. We just do, and I’m glad because I like her tremendously as a person,” the actor previously told Entertainment Weekly, before Sandra chimed in. “I love being around Keanu. I really do. He is such a good person.”</p>

<p>Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant are allegedly engaged. Meanwhile, some outlets claimed that they already tied the knot. Continue reading to know the real score between the lovers.</p>
<p>Are Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant already engaged</p>
<p>According to OK! magazine, Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant are already engaged. The Matrix actor reportedly popped the big question with a $200K engagement ring.</p>
<p>The outlet alleged that Reeves and Grant had been engaged for at least a month.</p>
<p>“He popped the question about a month ago over a cozy dinner at home – Italian takeout, candlelight, and Frank Sinatra music. He said he wanted them to spend the rest of their lives together, and then got down on one knee,” the source said.</p>
<p>Sandra Bullock planning an engagement party for the two</p>
<p>OK! also claimed that Keanu Reeves’ Speed co-star Sandra Bullock was planning an engagement party for the couple.</p>
<p>“Sandra is going to handle it all – the invites, the catering the music. She promised it’s going to be the perfect evening, and not too over the top,” an unnamed source said.</p>
<p>However, Gossip Cop debunked the claims. Although Reeves and Bullock are close friends, it is not true that The Proposal star is hosting an engagement party for the lovers.</p>
<p>Reeves and Grant want a secret wedding</p>
<p>The same outlet claimed that Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant were planning a secret wedding in Malibu. However, it didn’t explain why the pair chose the location.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another source claimed that they would have a beach wedding in Honolulu later this year. They reportedly wanted the event to be low-key because they would elope afterward.</p>
<p>According to the rumor-debunking site, all of those claims were not true.</p>
<p>Reeves’ spokesperson responded</p>
<p>Gossip Cop reached out to Keanu Reeves’ spokesperson for comments to clarify the various speculations between him and Alexandra Grant. The actor’s representative vehemently denied the claims.</p>
<p>“Your story is completely false and has no basis in any truth. This is completely fabricated for your own financial gain. If you publish anything else as our comment, then any such statement will be false and we will take appropriate action,” the statement it sent to the tabloid read.</p>
<p>Reeves and Grant are not yet engaged. Also, the couple is not getting married anytime soon.</p>
