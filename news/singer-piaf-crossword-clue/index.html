<p>TUESDAY PUZZLE — Maybe you solve your crossword puzzles and then just go about your day, but I am a highly suggestible person and find that all sorts of things bubble up for me as I fill in the squares. And they tend to stay with me.</p>
<p>This is how I wound up sitting my kids down on the couch and subjecting them to a Mel Brooks movie marathon, beginning with “Blazing Saddles.&rdquo; It didn’t matter to me that they had already seen many of them (I consider it my duty as a parent to expose my children to only the finest of culture so that they would grow the highest brows possible), it only mattered that they watch them again. This is a weird timeline that we are all living through, and a Mel Brooks movie marathon is an excellent way to regain one’s perspective.</p>
<p>Anyway. The thing that triggered this bout of mandatory family fun was Joel Fagliano’s puzzle, which made me think of this scene:

MONDAY PUZZLE — This puzzle by Brad Wilber was delightfully unexpected for two reasons.</p>
<p>The first is that Mr. Wilber has primarily been a late week puzzle maker, offering some of the toughest puzzles in the New York Times Crossword archive.</p>
<p>Second, the theme surprised me because it came from a man. And before anyone says anything about that: It’s not so much that a man wouldn’t know about this topic, but I just assumed that it wouldn’t be top of mind for him. Then I remembered that there is a version of the object in the theme that is targeted to the men’s market, so maybe that’s what Mr. Wilber was thinking about. Kudos to him for including theme entries that any gender might carry.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>5A: I can’t believe I’m saying this, but hi, kids! “TAXI” was a sitcom that ran on NBC and ABC from 1978 to 1983. It was memorable not only because it was hysterically funny, but also because it began the careers of quite a few people, Danny DeVito included. If the man in this scene looks familiar, that’s because the character was played by Christopher Lloyd, who also played — among other roles — “Doc” Emmett L. Brown in the “Back to the Future” movies.

<p><img src="https://www.newyorker.com/favicon.ico" alt="img">
The California-based producers Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva, who work together as the Kitchen Sisters, have been producing immersive, beautifully observed, historically relevant stories for public radio since 1979. Their style is both distinctive and invisible: rich in audio delights but minimally hosted, narrated largely by interviewees. “The Kitchen Sisters Present,” from Radiotopia, is a treasure trove of the duo’s recent and earlier work. “Waiting for Joe DiMaggio,” from 1993, about the retired ballplayer’s attempt to visit the Sicilian village of his family’s origin, tells a quiet story that amazes, as does “Tupperware,” an influential early piece, from 1980, that takes us to—and far beyond—a Tupperware party. Other classic episodes feature Studs Terkel’s “Working” interviews; Charles Aznavour reminiscing about nights with Edith Piaf; and, in “Shirley,” a Vietnamese-American nail salon and the legacy of Shirley Temple. For quarantined listeners wistful for another New York, the 2001-02 “Sonic Memorial” series, about the World Trade Center area, and a recent foray into the New York Public Library’s Lou Reed Archive are particularly striking, warm, and powerful.

<h3 id="rufus-and-martha-wainwright-review--quirky-magnificent-festive-blowout">&ldquo;Rufus and Martha Wainwright review – quirky, magnificent festive blowout&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbeb477f36e84963c47299785e366ed424875c0b/991_134_2904_1742/master/2904.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=d1ebe5ec13374675a646d377d5753895" alt="img">
Royal Festival Hall, London Chrissie Hynde, Neil Tennant and Sophie Ellis-Bextor joyously topped up the Wainwright siblings’ big-hearted Christmas fundraiser, A Not So Silent Night</p>
<p>Christmas with the extended family can be an ordeal. After too many days in close proximity to rarely encountered aunts or cousins, the Yuletide season’s compulsory mood of forced jollity can switch to listless ennui or murderous rage.</p>
<p>Despite this, the Wainwright family’s festive musical shindig, usually held in Canada or New York, is quite a tradition. Rufus and Martha last threw a Christmas party in London 10 years ago, six weeks before the death from cancer of their folk-icon mother, Kate McGarrigle. To mark the anniversary, this show is a benefit to raise funds to provide music-therapy resources for cancer patients.</p>
<p>The Wainwrights make for well-heeled but idiosyncratic Xmas hosts, despite their own history of family dysfunction. Between twinkling Christmas trees, the many family members and their party guests take turns to perform then loll on plush red sofas on a set resembling a lavishly appointed country-house sitting room.</p>
<p>Martha and her sister Lucy Wainwright Roche kick off the festivities, turning Jackson Browne’s The Rebel Jesus into a soft Irish air. It’s charming – as is Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s reshaping of O Little Town of Bethlehem into immaculately enunciated lounge jazz, backed by numerous Wainwright siblings and cousins.</p>

<p>Splendid in a specially grown Santa beard, Rufus duets What Are You Doing New Year’s Eve? with Ed Harcourt, complete with a sub-Strictly waltz, like a high-camp modern take on the Rat Pack. Neil Tennant and Martha imbue McGarrigle’s I Cried for Us, long covered by Pet Shop Boys, with fervent yearning, despite Tennant’s career-long habit of singing through his nose.</p>
<p>Guy Garvey joins Rufus for a sumptuous croon through In the Bleak Midwinter before Martha trills Trois Anges, in French, like a Yuletide Piaf merry on sweet sherry. Duetting with Rufus on Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Chrissie Hynde’s voice is, as ever, a sultry throb.</p>
<p>It’s all a very warm, big-hearted celebration. Rufus’s husband, Jörn Weisbrodt, unleashes a surprisingly powerful, Lee Marvin-like basso profundo on White Christmas and Heilige Nacht. Not to be outdone, opera soprano Janis Kelly crafts an epic gothic take on Burl Ives’s Silver and Gold.</p>
<p>With Rufus’s barbed wit largely sheathed tonight, it’s Martha who is the life and soul of the party, giddily exuberant on the Waitresses’ 1981 fun-punk romp Christmas Wrapping, and turning trad folk song Mary Had a Baby into racked blues. Her brother’s microphone-free, a cappella rendition of Minuit, Chretiéns/O Holy Night is captivating.</p>

<p>After Chrissie Hynde drawls 2000 Miles, sounding like Christmas incarnate, the entire company gather for a nicely shambolic roister through John and Yoko’s Happy Xmas (War is Over). The encore brings a delicate rendering by the three Wainwright siblings of Proserpina, the last song written by McGarrigle before her death.</p>
<p>The evening ends as all Christmas shows should. “This is a song about alcoholics from Galway,” notes the reliably waspish Rufus, before he and Martha lead an ensemble romp through the Pogues’ Fairytale of New York. It’s been a magnificent Christmas bash: a night of joyous depths and shallows.</p>
<p>• This article was amended on 8 December 2019 to correct a misspelling of the song Proserpina and to remove the claim that Kate McGarrigle was Lucy Wainwright Roche’s mother.

<h3 id="charles-aznavour-i-wanted-to-break-every-taboo">&ldquo;Charles Aznavour: &lsquo;I wanted to break every taboo&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>

Charles Aznavour, one of the greatest singer-songwriters France has ever known, sits in a velvet armchair a few days before his 91st birthday, discussing the whiff of ladies’ armpits.</p>
<p>A song on his new album, in which he declares, “I love the smell of your underarms,” worried his Swedish wife of 50 years, but Aznavour knows his audience. If he’s the most successful French crooner in the world – a lyricist who defined the country’s popular culture for decades – it’s precisely because his songs have always been risky.</p>
<p>When Aznavour began writing in the 1940s, sex was something that happened with the light off. It was OK for women singers to howl over their broken hearts, but men didn’t sing about their own emotional despair – and later their dodgy prostates. Aznavour shone a spotlight on masculinity and libido, singing about depression, sex, prejudice and rape. His hits ranged from the 1970s story of a gay transvestite in What Makes a Man, to the once-banned ballad of muggy, post-coital exhaustion, Après l’Amour, and the controversial You’ve Let Yourself Go – the plea of a man whose wife has grown dowdy and fat (“I gaze at you in sheer despair and see your mother standing there”).</p>

<p>He is unrepentant. “It’s a kind of sickness I have, talking about things you’re not supposed to talk about. I started with homosexuality and I wanted to break every taboo.” The armpit line comes in a new ballad about a blind lover’s sense of smell. “When I wrote a song about the deaf [Quiet Love], I learned sign-language to perform it on stage. On this album, I wanted to describe what it was like for someone non-sighted.” He pauses. “I still don’t know how I’m going to perform it …” In his shows, he takes on various personas with dramatic gestures that resemble a mime act. He’s an actor who sings rather than a Frank Sinatra-style singer who acts.</p>
<p>Aznavour is still composing and performing, he’s written around 1,200 songs and sold more than 100m records in his 70-year career. France worships him as the last living legend of a golden era. Like many popular singers who came to represent the very essence of France – such as Georges Moustaki and, to a certain extent, Edith Piaf herself – Aznavour is shaped by his foreign roots. Born Shahnour Varenagh Aznavourian in Paris to an actor-father and singer-mother who had fled the Armenian genocide, he left school and became a child actor at the age of nine. He survived the German occupation of Paris singing in cabarets, while his parents hid fellow Armenians, Jews, Russians and Communists in their apartment and his father joined the resistance.</p>
<p>Piaf pestered him to have a nose job. Afterwards he presented himself for inspection. &lsquo;I preferred you before,&rsquo; she said</p>
<p>But Aznavour’s path to success was long and torturous. French critics dismissed him as repulsively ugly, too short, with a terrible voice and dubious song titles. It wasn’t until the end of the 50s, a decade after Piaf had taken him on as her songwriter, flatmate and all-round bag-carrier that he finally began to make it. In 1960, he played the shy and haunted piano-player in François Truffaut’s classic New Wave film, Shoot the Piano Player (he went on to act in over 60 films). But his global singing fame was cemented in the 70s with a triumphant crossover into the US and UK – something he puts down to the excellent translation of his lyrics into English. (The bittersweet British No 1, She, is hardly known in France). Britain was seduced by this scrawny Frenchman crooning about painful crushes in a 10-ton accent. “I often say: ‘France is for lyrics, England is for music’,” he muses.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Aznavour is a “dinosaur” – his word – who trades on agelessness. His 51st studio album is out in the UK now and he is working on his 52nd. He loves being sampled by adoring French rappers. He relishes the irony that at 30 he was considered ugly, but past 90 he is now seen as dashing. What it’s like being 91? “I wouldn’t have a clue,” he says, wide-eyed. “I don’t feel 91. I’ve always thought a person must never lose the gaze of a child.” At 5-foot-3, he holds his tiny frame perpetually taut (keeping his shoulders straight is one his secrets of eternal youth). But he’s brutally honest about performing on stage. “I hide nothing from the audience,” he says. He tells them he has an Auto-cue because his memory is fading, and says his mouth ulcers make it hard to sing. He relies on hearing aids. But he loathes what he calls the show-business “cult of youth”.</p>
<p>“More and more men are changing themselves, having surgery, and you can see it on TV, because their dyed-black hair turns blue under the lights,” he says. “I had a problem with my nose, I got it done. I made some white hair that was falling out grow back. But I left my wrinkles where they are. And I look younger than the others because I have never retouched nature’s work.”</p>

<p>In fact, it was Edith Piaf cabaret superstar and queen of chanson française, who forced Aznavour to have a nose job 50 years ago. She pestered him for months to fix what she deemed his too-large hooter. He eventually went under the knife, and presented himself for inspection. “I preferred you before,” she said.</p>
<p>There’s a song about Piaf on the new album. It is the first time he has written about her, though they lived together – platonically – for eight years. “We were like cousins. We had this extraordinary complicity. I never had a love affair with her – that’s what saved us.” Why did Piaf, the star, latch on to him, an unknown nine years her junior? “I brought her my youth, my madness, she loved my whole jazzy side.”</p>
<p>I can’t say anything about [Kim Kardashian], because I would anger half the Armenians.</p>
<p>His other main role today is as one of the world’s most famous Armenians. He has finally taken dual Armenian citizenship, is Armenian ambassador to Switzerland and travelled with the French president François Hollande to mark the centenary of the Armenian genocide this year. But France still defines his identity. “I’ve always felt totally French. That really vexed the Armenians in Armenia, but now they’re used to it.” He politely declines to say what he thinks about his challenger as pop culture’s international symbol of the Armenian diaspora: Kim Kardashian. He’s never met her. Does he watch her reality show? “I can’t say anything about it, because I would anger half the Armenians.” He laughs nervously. “I suppose Armenians are quite prudish and don’t like too much nudity …”</p>

<p>A few years ago, he caused shockwaves in France by saying he’d paid backhanders to figures on all sides of the political spectrum after being told he was facing a tax inspection, presumed to have been in the 1970s. A later tax investigation found no irregularity. Decades ago, he left France to live just over the border in Switzerland. “I was never a tax exile,” he is at pains to point out. “I didn’t have a penny when I left.”</p>
<p>The phrase Aznavour probably hates the most is “farewell tour”. He swears he has never uttered the words, and vows to keep performing until he dies.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to learn to leave the table when love is no longer being served,” he once crooned. But with audiences still dishing up a never-ending pot of it, he’s happy to stick around.

The Weekly Challenge is a column that tackles self-improvement seven days at a time.</p>
<p>There is something vaguely romantic about crossword puzzles. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the fact that just sitting down to do one is an indulgence the majority of us don&rsquo;t tend to afford ourselves in these time-strapped days, iWhatever days.</p>
<p>Next year, the beloved brainiac institution turns 100. The first-ever &ldquo;word-cross&rdquo; puzzle was created by a Liverpudlian journalist named Arthur Wynne and published in the Dec. 21, 1913, edition of New York World. There were some early tweaks (originally the puzzles were diamond-shaped), but for the most part the grid-based mind-bender has remained unaltered.</p>

<p>And it has endured in an increasingly competitive market – word game apps are all the rage these days, many of them designed to suit shrinking attention spans and less-than-impressive vocabulary skills. Crosswords, on the other hand, require concentration, commitment and a willingness to resist the urge to just Google whatever our brain doesn&rsquo;t spit out in two seconds.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s just me, but in our ideal lives don&rsquo;t we all spend Sunday mornings lying in bed, sipping a French-press coffee and noodling away at The New York Times crossword? Soft lighting, silk pyjamas, Édith Piaf playing on an antique gramophone … okay, the reality isn&rsquo;t quite so rose-tinted, but I decided to spend a week puzzling over the daily crossword.</p>
<p>Pencil is another word for cheater</p>
<p>Because each day tends to get away from me, I decided that attacking the crossword would be the first thing I did every morning – before e-mail thrust me into the realities and obligations of the hours ahead. I also set a time limit, since I couldn&rsquo;t ignore said realities altogether.</p>
<p>On day one, I poured a coffee and grabbed a pencil, thinking that was the most appropriate writing instrument. Apparently not. My boyfriend, who is a seasoned crossword solver, explained that doing the puzzle in ink is all part of the experience. Apparently, the actor and puzzle devotee Jerry Orbach used to say that using a pencil qualified as cheating. Who was I to argue with the moral compass of Detective Lennie Briscoe?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to say this was one of those fish-to-water experiences where I excelled from the get-go – I am a writer, after all, so it stands to reason that I should be halfway decent at word games. Instead it was a battle punctuated by periods of extreme frustration (eight-letter word for askew?) and moments of extreme elation (cockeyed!). When I was stuck on a clue, I could actually feel my brain operating like a rusty old crank, but as the week progressed, the wheels churned a little smoother.</p>
<p>Giving the cerebrum a workout</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Puzzles are a form of cerebral exercise, so I suppose all these mental pushups were building muscle. I was also enjoying myself, and not just for the dopamine rush. Devoting the first part of my day to a single, solvable activity was the intellectual equivalent of eating my Wheaties. After doing a puzzle I felt calm and capable of facing the workday ahead. I may have been behind on a deadline and buried under a pile of laundry, but at least I had solved 13 across.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Marcel Danesi, a University of Toronto professor who authored a study called The Puzzle Instinct: The Meaning of Puzzles in Human Life, creating order in the midst of confusion is a key part of the appeal. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about you, using your own mind, without any method or schema, to restore order from chaos. … And once you have, you can sit back and say, &lsquo;Hey, the rest of my life may be a disaster, but at least I have a solution,'&rdquo; he told The New York Times. Another great argument for becoming a puzzle person involves ritual mental exercise as a way to stave off brain decay and maybe even dementia. Scientists continue to disagree about this connection, but common sense tells us that a half-hour spent mentally engaged in a crossword has to be preferable to an episode of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.</p>
<p>In a week, I never completed a puzzle. I came close, though, and already I can see how regular people turn into the junkie-type figures featured in the 2006 crossword documentary Wordplay. (Wow, do those people take their crossword completion seriously.) Fact is, I would never drink coffee in bed and I don&rsquo;t own a single Édith Piaf album, but I would dearly love to fill in the last clue on a crossword. In pen, of course.</p>
<p>The next challenge: The mayor of Newark, N.J., just pledged to spend one week living on a food-stamp budget (under $5 a day) to raise awareness of poverty and hunger. Can you do the same? If a week is too long, try just a day. Let us know at fb.me/globelifestream.
