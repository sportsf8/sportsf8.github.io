Republican Southern Grandma: &ldquo;We the people are the rightful masters of both Congress and the courts, not to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the Constitution.” - Abe Lincoln. William Barr is far more dangerous than Trump to our constitution and democracy. Barr is literally wearing a police uniform as he commits his crimes and obstructs justice, and he has a long history of doing this going way back. Back in 1992, the last time Bill Barr was U.S. attorney general, New York Times writer William Safire referred to him as “Coverup-General Barr” because of his role in burying evidence of then-President George H.W. Bush’s involvement in “Iraqgate” and “Iran-Contra.” Remember, John Mitchell, Nixon’s AG, ended up going to jail for everything that Bagdad Barr is doing now - conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and sooner or later perjury. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Barr to the U.S. Department of Justice as Assistant Attorney General. He wrote a complete advisory opinion justifying the U.S. invasion of Panama and arrest of Manuel Noriega for the DOJ. Barr then declined a congressional request for the full opinion, but instead provided a document that &ldquo;summarizes the principal conclusions.&rdquo; Congress subpoenaed the opinion, and its public release after Barr&rsquo;s departure from the Justice Department showed he had omitted significant findings in the opinion from his summary document. Barr’s summary to Congress was the opposite of his own complete advisory opinion, which is exactly what he did with the Muller Report.

Chris Trousdale, a former member of the boy band DreamStreet, died Tuesday from complications of coronavirus, according to reports. He was 34.</p>
<p>A family member said Trousdale died from the effects of COVID-19, TMZ reported. Former bandmate Jesse McCartney confirmed the cause on Instagram. A rep told Billboard Trousdale died of an “undisclosed illness.”</p>
<p>McCartney wrote about their time together as 12- and 14-year-olds and said Trousdale was the most popular in the group. “I truly envied him as a performer,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“Although we were a band for only 3 years, at that age, it felt like a lifetime and we built a real brotherhood,” McCartney added. “My deepest sympathies go out to his mother whom I know cherished him dearly. RIP Chris.”

Chris Trousdale’s music career continued post-Dream Street, and he even tried to mix that world with his budding television career. This led to his audition on The Voice in 2013, which ended when all four coaches passed on him in the audition round. On the episode, Trousdale expressed sadness at not being able to recapture the success of his youth, and being recognized by fans at his day job who didn&rsquo;t understand why he wasn&rsquo;t living his dream (via Dailymail).
