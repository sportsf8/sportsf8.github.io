<p>I’m guessing the most out-there answer for the bulk of solvers is PORT OF HUALIEN. Why would I pick a geographic location that specific and perhaps unknown to many American solvers? It may take a bit of film knowledge to get the first aha moment, but do you see a movie title hiding in there? It’s right at the end of each theme answer, and you can confirm it by the parenthetical year that the movie was released:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>SHREDDED WHEAT &ndash;&gt; HEAT, a 1995 film starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Val Kilmer.</p>
<p>BOX OFFICE SMASH &ndash;&gt; MASH, from 1970.</p>
<p>FOR THE NONCE &ndash;&gt; ONCE, from 2007. This is the original movie that the award-winning Broadway musical is based on.</p>
<p>DODGE DURANGO &ndash;&gt; RANGO, from 2011.</p>
<p>BATTLE SCARS &ndash;&gt; CARS, from 2006.</p>
<p>ETHICAL DILEMMA &ndash;&gt; EMMA, from 1996. If this puzzle had come out two weeks later, I could have made the parenthetical year 2020</p>
<p>PORT OF HUALIEN &ndash;&gt; ALIEN, from 1979.</p>
<p>So, now we’ve got the movies that appear at the ends of the theme entries, but we’re not done yet. Two of the films (HEAT and EMMA) are from the 1990s, so it wouldn’t make sense if one of them was the answer and the other one wasn’t. Now you have to think about the other word in the title, “Twist.” That’s a common signal in puzzles (especially cryptic crosswords) for anagrams. The second aha is to find that each title has been anagrammed to another word in the grid:</p>
<p>HEAT &ndash;&gt; T HEA at 91D: [“Queer as Folk” actress Gill]</p>
<p>MASH &ndash;&gt; H AMS at 30A: [Melodramatic sorts]</p>
<p>ONCE &ndash;&gt; E CON at 25D: [Specialty in demand, briefly?].</p>
<p>RANGO &ndash;&gt; G ROAN at 70A: [Pained utterance].</p>
<p>CARS &ndash;&gt; A RCS at 119A: [Plot trajectories].</p>
<p>EMMA &ndash;&gt; M AME at 77A: [Musical auntie].</p>
<p>ALIEN &ndash;&gt; E LIÁN at 116A: [González in 2000 headlines].</p>
<p>The final step is to take the first letters of those anagrammed words, match them up in thematic order, and you spell out THE GAME , a 1997 film starring Michael Douglas.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why I picked THE GAME as the meta answer, it’s for a few reasons:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a memorable twist ending of its own, so it’s appropriate on that level. You can read about its twist here if you don’t plan on watching the movie (scroll down to No. 19), but I’d recommend a viewing; I saw it many years ago and remember thinking it was clever.</li>
</ol>
<p>AD</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Though there are other movies out there with more well-known twist endings (like PSYCHO or THE SIXTH SENSE), THE GAME felt like the title with the most natural connection to puzzles, and the film itself is a puzzle-solving mystery of sorts, though you don’t have to have seen it to solve the meta.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letters of THE GAME worked out nicely for the way I wanted to execute the meta, at least for the most part. I needed one-word movie titles that could fit at the end of unrelated phrases and could also anagram to other words beginning with specific letters. It was surprisingly difficult to find ones that worked for the letters T and E. That’s why I ran with PORT OF HUALIEN to hide ALIEN and THEA to anagram HEAT.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>AD</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I still liked the idea enough to make the meta before someone else did. You never know what other meta constructors like Matt Gaffney, Peter Gordon or Mike Shenk are thinking!</li>
</ol>
<p>AD

<h3 id="a-famous-argument-against-free-will-has-been-debunked">&ldquo;A Famous Argument Against Free Will Has Been Debunked&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/gvrZJQ2a_1h3D8QKlUNtYYp3Tsw=/0x434:5182x3134/960x500/media/img/mt/2019/09/GettyImages_514023648/original.jpg" alt="img">
This momentous discovery was the beginning of a lot of trouble in neuroscience. Twenty years later, the American physiologist Benjamin Libet used the Bereitschaftspotential to make the case not only that the brain shows signs of a decision before a person acts, but that, incredibly, the brain’s wheels start turning before the person even consciously intends to do something. Suddenly, people’s choices—even a basic finger tap—appeared to be determined by something outside of their own perceived volition.</p>
<p>As a philosophical question, whether humans have control over their own actions had been fought over for centuries before Libet walked into a lab. But Libet introduced a genuine neurological argument against free will. His finding set off a new surge of debate in science and philosophy circles. And over time, the implications have been spun into cultural lore.</p>
<p>Today, the notion that our brains make choices before we are even aware of them will now pop up in cocktail-party conversation or in a review of Black Mirror. It’s covered by mainstream journalism outlets, including This American Life, Radiolab, and this magazine. Libet’s work is frequently brought up by popular intellectuals such as Sam Harris and Yuval Noah Harari to argue that science has proved humans are not the authors of their actions.</p>
<p>It would be quite an achievement for a brain signal 100 times smaller than major brain waves to solve the problem of free will. But the story of the Bereitschaftspotential has one more twist: It might be something else entirely.</p>
<p>The Bereitschaftspotential was never meant to get entangled in free-will debates. If anything, it was pursued to show that the brain has a will of sorts. The two German scientists who discovered it, a young neurologist named Hans Helmut Kornhuber and his doctoral student Lüder Deecke, had grown frustrated with their era’s scientific approach to the brain as a passive machine that merely produces thoughts and actions in response to the outside world. Over lunch in 1964, the pair decided that they would figure out how the brain works to spontaneously generate an action. “Kornhuber and I believed in free will,” says Deecke, who is now 81 and lives in Vienna.</p>
<p>To pull off their experiment, the duo had to come up with tricks to circumvent limited technology. They had a state-of-the-art computer to measure their participants’ brain waves, but it worked only after it detected a finger tap. So to collect data on what happened in the brain beforehand, the two researchers realized that they could record their participants’ brain activity separately on tape, then play the reels backwards into the computer. This inventive technique, dubbed “reverse-averaging,” revealed the Bereitschaftspotential.</p>
<p>The discovery garnered widespread attention. The Nobel laureate John Eccles and the prominent philosopher of science Karl Popper compared the study’s ingenuity to Galileo’s use of sliding balls for uncovering the laws of motion of the universe. With a handful of electrodes and a tape recorder, Kornhuber and Deecke had begun to do the same for the brain.

<h3 id="bear-market-signals-over-80-chance-of-recession-hitting-us">&ldquo;Bear market signals over 80% chance of recession hitting US&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bostonglobe.com/pf/resources/images/logo-bg.jpg?d=173" alt="img">
The benchmark index’s record-long bull run ended an explosion Thursday, with stocks plunging 9.5 percent in the biggest rout since 1987’s Black Monday. Investors grew increasingly anxious that policy responses to the spreading virus won’t offset the economic damage as more areas around the world curtail sporting events and limit travel.</p>
<p>Thirteen times the S&amp;P 500 has completed the requisite 20 percent plunge in the last 93 years. In just two of those episodes did the American economy not shrink within a year: 1987 and 1966. It works the other way around, too. Among 14 recessions over the span, only three weren’t accompanied by a bear market.</p>
<p>You can search for years and get nowhere, examining stock gyrations for clues about economic growth. But when US benchmarks slide into a bear market, that’s a different story.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“That’s what people have to be realistic about,” said Jerry Braakman, who helps oversee about $1.9 billion as chief investment officer of First American Trust, in Santa Ana, Calif. “We are in unknown territory, it could get worse. As the government takes action, people will be thinking about great-financial-crisis situations. People are panicking.”</p>
<p>It’s a common adage: the stock market isn’t the economy. But the saying loses its pull at times like this, both because of the force it takes to knock the market this hard, and the impact of equity losses on consumer psychology. Also: usually the market warns something is awry long before economic growth goes negative.</p>
<p>The spreading coronavirus and historic oil-price shock have ushered in the most volatile period in markets since the financial crisis, and a Bloomberg Economics model places the odds of a recession over the next year at 52 percent, the highest since 2009.</p>
<p>According to JPMorgan’s John Normand, financial markets across assets have priced in an 80 percent probability of recession happening — the highest it’s ever been without the United States actually being in one (and we may already be). With the Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, surging to the highest since 2008, and massive swings and marketwide trading halts essentially becoming the norm, investors are questioning what’s to come.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Leuthold Group, takes the view that a drop in the stock market not only reflects a dire outlook for growth, but also has the potential to hurt American confidence and spending. His firm trimmed its equity exposure last week.</p>
<p>“For many months we’ve argued that fragile consumer and business confidence could be shattered by even a moderate market setback of 8-10 percent, finally sending the economy into recession,”’ he wrote in a note to clients. “It is very likely this market setback will prove the final death blow to the longest ever economic expansion.”</p>
<p>A Bloomberg Intelligence model shows equities are close to pricing what the average US recession looks like. Down to 17 from above 22, the S&amp;P 500’s trailing P/E ratio has contracted close to 24 percent. That’s just short of the average drop of 24.5 percent during the past six growth scares, according to strategists led by Gina Martin Adams — and above the average of 21 percent excluding the 2008 crisis.</p>
<p>Forecasters across Wall Street are taking a knife to their predictions. Goldman Sachs’s David Kostin Wednesday called for an end to the bull market and called for earnings to drop at least 12 percent in each of the next two quarters, just before the Dow closed down 20 percent from a high, ending the bull run.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 9.5 percent 2,480.64 Thursday, triggering market-wide circuit breakers for the second time in a week. According to Lori Calvasina, the head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, if 2,700 on the S&amp;P 500 doesn’t hold, the move will likely indicate that investors are pricing in a recession.</p>
<p>During economic downturns going back to the 1930s, the S&amp;P 500 has on average posted a 32 percent peak-to-trough decline, RBC data show. From the S&amp;P’s record a few weeks ago, a decline of this magnitude would push the index to 2,302.</p>
<p>Still, Calvasina doesn’t see a recession in the United States as her base just yet. She lowered her year-end forecast Thursday for the S&amp;P 500 to 3,279 and cut her estimate for S&amp;P 500 EPS by $9 to $165. That would imply a gain of about 1.5 percent for the benchmark this year and a second straight year of zero profit growth. The most recent rout has been reminiscent of post-Financial Crisis growth scares, such as those in 2011 and 2018, and a rebound later in the year could be “fast and powerful,” she wrote to clients.</p>
<p>UBS strategists led by David Lefkowitz also cut their profit forecast for companies in the S&amp;P 500, estimating no growth this year. They reduced their year-end target to 3,200 from 3,400, about in line with RBC’s Calvasina’s. But they too said a deeper hit to the economy can’t be ruled out with containment measures in the United States “behind the curve.” In the case of a mid-year recession, S&amp;P 500 EPS could fall to $145, resulting in a year-end price target of 2,500.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“We have less confidence in our forecasting abilities this year than in any in recent memory,” Lefkowitz wrote in a note.</p>
<p>He’s not alone.</p>
<p>“Investors are really dealing with the unknown as far as how long this lasts. That’s the key element,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA. “The risks continually rise and the impacts widen — the worst is yet to come.”

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/09/video/xxivid-iran-plane-2/xxivid-iran-plane-2-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Video verified by The New York Times appears to show an Iranian missile hitting a plane near Tehran’s airport, the area where a Ukrainian jet crashed on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board.</p>
<p>As investigators work to determine an official cause of the accident, the video offered new clues about the crash, which came hours after a violent confrontation between Iran and the United States. American and allied officials on Thursday said they believed an Iranian missile had accidentally brought the plane down.</p>
<p>A small explosion occurred when what appears to be a missile hit the plane above Parand, a city near the airport, but the plane did not explode, the video showed. The jet continued flying for several minutes and turned back toward the airport, The Times has determined. The plane, which by then had stopped transmitting its signal, flew toward the airport ablaze before it exploded and crashed quickly, other videos verified by The Times showed.

Here are the latest updates and maps of where the virus has spread.</p>
<p>Some recent developments:</p>
<p>Test results could be released today for some of those aboard a cruise ship that has been held off San Francisco, after two former passengers were found to be infected.</p>
<p>Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the outbreak, reported today that it had no new infections outside its capital, Wuhan. The news is a milestone in the Chinese government’s campaign to combat the epidemic.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases in New York has doubled to 22, and more than 2,700 people are isolated at home.</p>
<p>Some health care workers in California and Washington State say they lack the protective gear and protocols to keep themselves and their patients safe.</p>
<p>In Japan, public anger is mounting over Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s clumsy response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>A mathematician who studies the spread of disease explained some coronavirus figures.</p>
<p>Related: “Don’t touch your face” has become a common piece of advice, but it’s not an easy habit to break. Keeping tissues handy and keeping your hands busy are among the tricks to help you stop.</p>

<p>The economic toll of the coronavirus</p>
<p>“Just as the disease poses a particular threat to older patients, it could be especially dangerous for more mature economies,” writes Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor and a former adviser to President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>That’s because economies like the U.S. are dominated by face-to-face service industries, which are damaged when people stay home.

As Europe reported more than 3,400 deaths and 82,000 confirmed cases, Italy alone reported 475 deaths in a single day — the highest daily total in any country so far. Here’s the latest and maps of the outbreak.</p>
<p>“Take it seriously,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a televised address to Germany, which has 8,200 cases and counting. “Since German reunification — no, since World War II — our country has never faced a challenge where we depended so much on our collective actions and solidarity.”</p>
<p>But there were signs of fraying unity as the resurrection of border controls caused chaos and traffic jams, particularly in Hungary.</p>
<p>The virus has also created generational friction: Some older Europeans criticize young people for blithely ignoring warnings about social distancing, while young activists wonder why governments aren’t bringing the same urgency to the climate crisis that they do to the pandemic.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>The British pound fell to its lowest level in 35 years against the American dollar, as Wall Street had another disastrous day and the American oil benchmark dropped 24 percent. We have live updates.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank announced a program to buy up to 750 billion euros’ worth of financial assets, and President Trump signed a $1 trillion relief package that would provide sick leave, unemployment benefits and free coronavirus testing.</p>
<p>Countries in southern Europe that cut back on health care spending during the eurozone debt crisis are tragically vulnerable to the pandemic, writes our business correspondent in Frankfurt. But northern countries have their own weaknesses.</p>
<p>The American economy is poised for the worst quarterly contraction ever — more akin to what happened in wartime Europe than during the financial crisis. Our DealBook columnist, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has a not-so-modest proposal for how the U.S. government can cope with the Covid-19 economic crisis.</p>
<p>The border between Canada and the U.S., the world’s longest, will close to all but essential traffic.</p>
<p>Glastonbury, the music festival in Britain, and the Eurovision Song Contest are among the latest events to be canceled.</p>
