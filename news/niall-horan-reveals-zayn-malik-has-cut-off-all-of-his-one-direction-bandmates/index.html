Niall Horan has revealed that it's highly unlikely One Direction will reunite anytime soon, as Zayn Malik has cut off contact with all of his former bandmates.

In an interview with The Sun, Niall, 26, has revealed that the only way the chart-topping collective would come together in full again is if Zayn, 27 – who quit the band in 2015 – gets back on speaking terms with his former pals.

The Irish singer said of Zayn: 'He’s quite a hard fella to keep in touch with. He’d probably tell you that himself, to be fair. I don’t particularly talk to him a lot. I mean, if he’s got something coming out or something I will text him.

'He might not reply but I’ll give him a shout, but I don’t know... After the band, he left for his reasons and then he never really spoke to us much afterwards.'

The Slow Hands singer added of Zayn: 'I’ve got no bad blood with him at all but some things have a lifespan. I don’t know. We will see what happens. Maybe one day we can reconvene at some point, but not right now.'

Niall's words comes one month after bandmate Louis Tomlinson revealed he doesn't feel ready to make amends with Zayn, who he believes has been 'disrespectful'.

Back in the day: Niall and Zayn are pictured with fellow One Direction stars (L-R) Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, and Harry Styles in August 2013

The singer, 28, admitted that he thinks Zayn has talked 's***' in interviews but said he can understand that when you're in a certain mood sometimes you just want to 'run your mouth', referring to his negative comments about the band.

During an interview with The Sun, Louis didn't want to rule out a reunion with Zayn in the future however he confessed he doesn't feel ready to 'yet'.

When quizzed on whether he felt Zayn was disrespectful, he said: 'Yeah, I do. But I can understand it. We have a lot of situations where we're sat in interviews and if you're in a certain mood you might run your mouth.'

'The older you get the more you can tell if these things actually carry any malice or if they're just a prod in the back. That's life, innit? Sometimes people chat s**t and that's the reality.'

As the discussion moved to his former band mates, he revealed he is still in contact with Harry Styles, Niall, and Liam Payne 'sporadically' however he no longer talks to Zayn.

Louis was asked if he's tried to make up with his former band mate and he said: 'No, but I've not actively tried. We've all got a lot on our plates and there might be a day where I wake up and think: "OK, I want to right that wrong", but not yet.'

The comments contrasted slightly against those made by Louis earlier that same week, where he admitted he 'loves' his One Direction band mates, as he hit out at the idea of members 'chatting s***' about a group once they'd split for 'cool points.'

Louis, who is in a relationship with Eleanor Calder, was speaking to Rolling Stone magazine about his debut album Walls, when he gushed about his time with Harry, Liam, Niall, and Zayn.

The Kill My Mind singer is 'super proud' about his stint with the boy band and would never say anything bad about the group as he thinks it looks 'desperate' when solo artists slam their beginnings.

After Zayn repeatedly admitted he isn't a fan of 1D's music and Liam has admitted being in the group could be 'toxic' and hinted he didn't get on with everyone, Louis was asked why he's never complained about the band.

He explained: 'I absolutely f***ing love the band. I'm super proud about where I've come from. At the end of the day, I'm from Doncaster, and the band gave me such a nice opportunity.

'But also, there's a big history of that, people coming out of bands and chatting s***. I just think they just look so obvious. It's such a desperate attempt to try and get cool points.

Show: Louis took to the stage to perform in concert at La Riviera in Madrid, Spain, on Tuesday

Proud: The star said he is 'super proud' about his stint with 1D and would never say anything bad about the group as he thinks it looks 'desperate' when solo artists slam their beginnings

'So I don't think it's authentic. I f***ing love the boys, and I love everything we've done together. And I still miss my time with them.'

Louis added that he felt the other One Direction members 'would be lying' if they claimed they didn't enjoy their time in the band.

The singer also claimed that seeing the very different solo music each member - including Harry and Niall - have been producing shows the 'strength' of the band was that every one of them brought something different to the group.

Explaining that every member of the group have been making 'really f***ing good music', so he always enjoys it when he tunes into the radio and hears their songs.

Louis also added that he thought he and his bandmates were 'lucky' because they weren't so tightly controlled as other boy bands had been, and he thinks that was key to their appeal.

The singer shot to fame nearly 10 years ago aged 18 when appearing on the X Factor and joining boyband One Direction.

While appearing on the 2010 edition of the show, Harry was handpicked by Simon Cowell alongside Louis, Niall, Liam, and Zayn to form the group.

Despite finishing 3rd in the competition the band went on to have global success winning nearly 200 awards and topping charts worldwide.
