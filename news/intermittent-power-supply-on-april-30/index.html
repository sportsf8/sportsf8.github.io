AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>So this week: Supply clever, funny clues for as many as 25 of the words and multi-word terms in this grid, as in the examples above. The clues don’t need to be as brief and crossword-authentic as real ones; we won’t even run clues for all the words in the grid. Go for funny.</p>
<p>How to format your entry so that the Empress can sort them without going even insaner:</p>
<p>Please write each entry on its own line, beginning with the grid word, in the form WORDFROMTHEGRID (without spaces even if you interpret it as multiple words): [your clue],” as in the examples above. You can explain it after the clue, as with ONEAL above.</p>
<p>Note: This is an American-style crossword, not the British type in which the clue is a sentence containing an anagram of the word.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Submit up to 25 entries at wapo.st/enter-invite-1364 (no capitals in the Web address). Deadline is Monday, Jan. 6; results will appear Jan. 26 in print, Jan. 23 online.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Winner gets the Lose Cannon, our Style Invitational trophy. Second place receives a genuine taxidermied jackalope, complete with really stupid antlers (um, facing each other isn’t going to do the trick) and flocked bunny “fur” that feels like AstroTurf. It’s also a piggy bank. Donated by aspiring Loser Harrison Schott.</p>
<p>Other runners-up win one of our new “For Best Results, Pour Into Top End” Loser Mugs or our “Whole Fools” Grossery Bag. Honorable mentions get one of our lusted-after Loser magnets, “Too-Weak Notice” or “Certificate of (de) Merit.” First Offenders receive only a smelly tree-shaped air “freshener” (FirStink for their first ink). See general contest rules and guidelines at wapo.st/InvRules. The headline “Frosted Fakes” is by Chris Doyle; Kathy Al-Assal wrote the honorable-mentions subhead.

<h3 id="review-just-in-time-for-valentines-day-the-photograph-casts-a-seductive-if-intermittent-spell">&ldquo;Review: Just in time for Valentine’s Day, ‘The Photograph’ casts a seductive if intermittent spell&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/30aa4f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+75/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2Fee%2F0dbe83f04aeda8c2f48fa81eede6%2F2524-t1-00092r.jpg_cmyk.jpg" alt="img">
In her sparkling 2016 debut feature, “Jean of the Joneses,” the Canadian writer-director Stella Meghie gave one of her characters a revealing bit of dialogue: “Sometimes when you don’t know what to do, you do nothing.”</p>
<p>It’s a line that has reverberated through her subsequent movies, including “The Weekend” (2018), a sharply written comedy about a getaway gone sour, and now an uneven but often intoxicatingly lovely romantic drama called “The Photograph.” Meghie’s protagonists are black women, often artistically ambitious and romantically rudderless, and what she grants them is something both simple and remarkably rare in the movies: the luxury of time. She lets them sit back, take a deep breath and do the aforementioned nothing for as long as it takes to figure out what they want from life, work, family and love.</p>
<p>There are two women doing the soul-searching in “The Photograph.” In the first story, set in the mid-’80s, young Christina (Chanté Adams) abruptly leaves her Louisiana hometown to pursue her dream of becoming a photographer. The second, more dominant story takes place in the present day and follows Christina’s only child, Mae (Issa Rae), who works as a curator at a New York art museum. Christina has recently died of cancer, bequeathing her estranged daughter a long, intimate letter and an old black-and-white photograph — both clues to a none-too-complicated mystery of maternal regret that Mae will spend the rest of the movie slowly unraveling.</p>
<p>As she processes her grief, as well as her ambivalence toward a mother who could be distant and inattentive, Mae meets and befriends Michael (Lakeith Stanfield), a magazine reporter who is writing a story on Christina. His research leads him to New Orleans, where he stumbles on an old trove of her work and interviews her ex-boyfriend Isaac (Rob Morgan), a gentle old soul who boils crabs and mourns what might have been. But it is Mae to whom Michael keeps returning, Mae who intrigues and excites him even if the moment isn’t exactly opportune: He’s just gotten out of a relationship and is eyeing a possible job overseas.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Y’lan Noel and Chanté Adams in the movie “The Photograph.” (Sabrina Lantos / Universal Pictures)</p>
<p>The fact that life doesn’t slow down to accommodate our difficult decisions — new opportunities, new relationships — is all too readily apparent. But the movie’s loveliest scenes seem almost to contradict this simple wisdom, carving out moments in which time briefly stands still for Mae and Michael. The actors fill those moments with slow-simmering chemistry and playful verbal jabs: She’s charmed but slightly guarded; he’s wary of commitment but also clearly smitten. “Insecure” fans used to seeing Rae in comic firecracker mode may take some time to adjust to her more contained dramatic rhythms here, though she and Stanfield, with his sleepy-eyed leading-man charm, quickly find a groove.</p>
<p>“The Photograph” is a movie of seductive, slow-savored pleasures: It’s about the joys of flirting over a glass of whiskey and making love during a hurricane while Al Green croons in the background. Meghie and her cinematographer, Mark Schwartzbard, bring a richly burnished warmth to the interiors and a free-flowing sense of movement to the exteriors, where Mae and Michael are often seen walking, in no particular hurry. They have time to riff and argue, to debate Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, and to contemplate the future.</p>
<p>Their freedom to do as they please is very much the point. (The silky, jazzy progressions of the score, by the Grammy-winning pianist Robert Glasper, serve the theme nicely.) Meghie has noted movies like “Love Jones” and “Love &amp; Basketball” as personal inspirations, and “The Photograph,” even more than her earlier movies, luxuriates in the spectacle of black characters falling in love on-screen, and in narrative configurations notably devoid of drugs, violence or indeed any overt conflict. The movie is also tonally dexterous enough to accommodate the occasional shifts into broader comedy, much of it courtesy of Michael’s wisecracking family-man brother (Lil Rel Howery, “Get Out”) and his ambitious intern (Kelvin Harrison Jr., in a nicely goofy change of pace).</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>These moments are so graceful and expansive — you want to wrap them around you like a blanket — that they make the story’s big-picture schematics feel clunkier by comparison. The movie keeps shifting back to ’80s Louisiana, where we see Christina falling in love with a young Isaac (Y’lan Noel), heeding the stern advice of her own mother (Marsha Stephanie Blake) and slowly, determinedly figuring out what she wants to do with her life. New Orleans, with its heat and jazz and clapboard houses, provides a welcome atmospheric contrast with New York, and Adams, so electrifying in the indie hip-hop biopic “Roxanne Roxanne,” is terrific here in a more tamped-down role.</p>
<p>You wish there were more of her, frankly, and also that the story had achieved a more exquisite balance between its parallel tracks. As it is, the juxtaposition of time frames can’t help but put the narrative in a reductive bind. It’s only a matter of time before Mae absorbs the lessons of the past, and before “The Photograph,” a movie that makes a surprising virtue of uncertainty, arrives at its own foregone conclusion. You almost wish the characters could go on beautifully doing nothing forever.

<p>M. Calverley: Stir cup of tea audibly: the sound of happiness? (‘brew’ + ha-ha).</p>
<p>Dr I. S. Fletcher: Could be one about HRH shifting focus of devotion (anag. incl. a less ot, &amp; lit.).</p>
<p>J. Grimes: Pantomime turn getting quick laugh in woman’s underwear (U + hah in bra).</p>
<p>M. Hodgkin: Stir rhubarb that’s stewing, after trimming ends (anag. less r, b, t, t).</p>
<p>G. Johnstone: ‘Much Ado’ plot, we hear, leads to the sound of laughter (‘brew’ + ha-ha).</p>
<p>J. C. Leyland: Raab dithering with Wuhan? He might create a new ——! (comp. anag. &amp; lit.).</p>
<p>T. J. Moorey: No end to coronavirus, surge stopping BA and numberless Chinese getting fever (ru(s)h in BA + Ha(n)).</p>
<p>M. G. Payne: Intermittent borough’s ashcan collection causes clamour (alternate letters).</p>
<p>A. Plumb: Rub awfully hard and expression of surprise is on Aladdin’s face in pantomime (anag. + H + ah + A).</p>
<p>T. Rudd: Snarling ‘ach!’ in Hamburg area – enough to create a Germanic ——? (comp. anag. &amp; lit.).</p>
<p>I. Simpson: Stir forced rhubarb, with ends cut off, to get a hot filling (a H in anag. less r, b).</p>
<p>A. Vick: Unlimited rhubarb crumbles: what boundless excitement! (anag. less r, b + ha).</p>
<p>J. Vincent &amp; Ms R. Porter: Leaders in Brussels resent UK’s high-handedness, and half anticipate a ruckus (first letters).</p>

<p>Comments</p>
<p>176 entries, with very few mistakes, mainly to do with ABORNE. Although this has no dummy entry of its own in Chambers (which tends to be a bit patchy in its treatment of such irregular forms) it should not have been too difficult to relate it to abear, where it does appear. One or two of you queried the spelling of the clue word, even to the point of suggesting that I had misspelt it myself (and in one case even insisting on cluing it as BROUHAHA). It is difficult to account for the fact that C includes it at all since not even the OED has it. One of life’s little mysteries, I guess, and not the easiest of words to clue (in either form), but most of you had a pretty good stab at it, the best being very good indeed. Despite the new PM’s diktat about avoiding its further use, Brexit still figured widely in clues submitted. Perhaps it will quietly die over the coming months, though this household at least continues to mourn the whole wretched business.</p>
<p>Of 16 clues nominated as clue of the month, the one receiving most votes was ‘Little in Italian court one comprehends, words being truncated’ for APOCOPATION. My reference to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in my clue to DAIL drew a few wry comments on how the recent Irish election may affect his career. I expect he’ll continue as a member of parliament, if not a star (and he will forever remain the very pleasing anagram of AARDVARK, of course!).</p>
<p>There are plenty of ways to define a br(o)uhaha. One I could not accept involved omitting the hyphen from noun definitions, e.g. ‘to-do’ and ‘carry-on’, thus converting them into verbal phrases and thereby changing their meaning for the benefit of the surface reading of the clue. There is no way that BR(O)UHAHA can be seen as a verb.</p>
<p>And finally, in connection with the Azed 2,500 lunch in May, the splendidly diligent organisers ask me to mention that they are still taking bookings for the event. The email address for enquiries is <a href="mailto:heald.richard@googlemail.com">heald.richard@googlemail.com</a>.

<h3 id="were-living-in-the-golden-age-of-crossword-puzzles">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re Living in the Golden Age of Crossword Puzzles&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.gizmodo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/hrwck3vvjsgljwoitucn.jpg" alt="img">
During a time when we’re stuck inside and looking for things to occupy ourselves with, may I humbly suggest the crossword puzzle?</p>
<p>As something of a crossword enthusiast – in more normal times, I typically do one each day on my train commute into work – I can say with certainty that we are living in the Golden Age of this specific kind of puzzle. Hear me out. You can carry them everywhere with you via apps on your pocket computer, you can enable helpful features like work-check, and you can even play them with a partner, as with the New Yorker’s recently introduced crossword Partner Mode – that is, if you don’t mind sharing some of the victory of puzzle completion with a friend.</p>
<p>And you should. Right now, during an unprecedented time of physical separation from those we love, puzzling can offer the twofold benefit of human connection with a shared goal. Don’t get me wrong, hosting a meet-swap with my colleagues in Animal Crossing or FaceTiming with close friends and family are great, for a time. But there’s something sweet about completing a puzzle that you can work on together intermittently – a task you can pick up throughout the day in those spare moments between work or other tasks, especially while sheltering at home. If you’re a monster, maybe you’ll even convince your partner to complete the puzzle in a single go. One of the many beauties of puzzling is there’s really no wrong way to do it.</p>
<p>That’s another great thing about puzzles right now: Unlike the ol’ pen-and-paper method, apps open up a whole new way to play. Features like auto-check and word-check mean that you’ve got a good chance at completing even more advanced puzzles, like those that arrive later in the week from the New York Times. Reveal a single letter, a row, or the entire grid to move your puzzle along or complete it entirely. Some might think this is puzzle heresy, but again, puzzling’s rules are singularly defined by you, the person completing the puzzle.</p>
<p>Me? I’m a bit of a puzzle completionist, and I’d rather know the answer to a clue that’s stumped me than abandon a puzzle entirely – a thing that wasn’t always possible before puzzles went digital, and one of the reasons I tend to prefer them. (Though I still cherish my puzzle book and the occasional newspaper puzzle, when I have the chance to grab one.)</p>
<p>All of this is to say, now’s as good a time as any to pick up puzzling. Who knows, puzzles may be just the thing you need right now.</p>

Violence against women: The French government unveiled new measures to combat the problem, days after tens of thousands of people marched in Paris and other cities to rally against what some call an epidemic of “femicide.” (Meanwhile, a surging far-right party in Spain reaffirmed its demand for the repeal of a gender violence law.)</p>
<p>Spanish politics: Members of a Catalan separatist party overwhelmingly voted to support a Socialist-led government in exchange for talks over secession. The Socialists, who oppose Catalonia’s independence movement, won just 120 seats in an election this month — short of the 176 they would need to form a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>U.S. impeachment inquiry: A judge ruled on Monday that the former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify about President Trump’s efforts to obstruct the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>Truck deaths: A 25-year-old driver from Northern Ireland, one of three people charged after dozens of Vietnamese were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain last month, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property.</p>
<p>Julian Assange: More than 60 physicians signed a letter saying that the WikiLeaks founder was suffering from mental and physical deterioration so severe that without urgent expert medical assessment, he could die before his February hearing on extradition from Britain to the U.S.</p>
<p>Doping in Russia: A panel at the World Anti-Doping Agency has recommended that Russia face a new Olympic ban for flouting antidoping rules. The organization’s board will vote on the recommendation next month.</p>
<p>Eye of the beholder: LVMH said on Monday that it would buy the jeweler Tiffany for $16.2 billion, the biggest-ever deal in luxury. Here’s a field guide to Bernard Arnault, the LVMH founder and chairman.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — Welcome to another tricky Thursday, where things are not always as they seem, and hurling epithets at the grid is not only allowed, but actively encouraged until the theme reveals itself. In a nice way, of course, because Julie Bérubé’s puzzle is not only entertaining, but will also be challenging to solvers who have not seen this sort of theme before.</p>
<p>But first, something for our East Coast solvers.</p>
<p>The Crossword Show Comes to the East Coast</p>
<p>The madcap, live group solving event known as The Crossword Show, hosted by comedian Zach Sherwin, has gained a following in Los Angeles and the Bay Area, and it is now coming to five cities on the East Coast for a limited tour.</p>
<p>Information on dates, times and locations is at the bottom of this column.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>23A: What, you don’t start your sentences with the contraction ‘TWAS? I do, especially when I’m describing the time of day when the slithy toves are gyring and gimbling.</p>
<p>34A: With that question mark, you know that “Where you might go for a spell?” is not about traveling. The focus is on the word “spell,” and the kind of place you might go for one is a spelling BEE.
