Ok, look. I hate to be the one that has to tell you this… but the Nintendo 64 came out 24 years ago. I know. Take a deep breath. Everything is going to be alright.</p>
<p>Yes, this ancient piece of gaming technology might be considered an antique by some, considering there are people of legal drinking age who are younger than it, but the N64 was host to a slew of incredible games that are still worth revisiting today. (Please make this pocket-sized version a reality asap!) Even if you only consider system exclusives—sorry, Tony Hawk Pro Skater—we’re left with a bevy of top-tier titles that are difficult to contain in a Top 10 – but that doesn’t mean we didn’t try.</p>
<p>First things first though, you’ll probably need a console. You can grab one on eBay, they’ve got a great selection here.</p>
<p>Here’s our list of the Top N64 games of all time (in no particular order because, damn, they’re all just so damn good).</p>
<p>Star Fox on the SNES might have made a name for itself as a decent third-person rail shooter but Star Fox 64 truly perfected the formula and made the franchise a household name. The game felt epic, allowing players to navigate their Arwing throughout the Lylat solar system to battle it out on fully realized planets and in massive space encounters. Each level consisted of dizzying corridors or arenas full of enemy ships only for players to be tossed into an intense climactic battle against a colorful new boss character.</p>
<p>Despite numerous titles in the franchise that have since been released, Star Fox 64 remains the crowning jewel to which all subsequent games are seemingly compared. Sure, it’s a little short and not the most difficult gaming experience, but the incredible charm and arcade-style scoring system have kept us coming back to battle Andross’s forces (and perform “barrel rolls”) again and again.</p>

<p>The N64 definitely wasn’t known for its RPGs but when they touted a spiritual successor to the ever-popular Super Mario RPG, it was big news. Paper Mario ditched the top-down, 3D aesthetic of its predecessor for an adorable 2D cutout version of the Mushroom Kingdom and the results are stunning. Plus, our favorite Italian plumber utilizes new paper-related abilities that remain unique to this series alone.</p>
<p>In true RPG fashion, Paper Mario focused just as much on its characters and environment as its combat. It brings the Mushroom Kingdom to life as a vibrant community rather than just a side-scrolling world full of Bowser’s minions and features tons of witty dialogue and a brilliant soundtrack by Yuka Tsujiyoko (of Fire Emblem fame). While not your typical Mario game, it was the perfect swansong for the N64 in 2001.</p>

<p>Describing Banjo-Kazooie to someone who’s never heard of it will make you sound like you need to be institutionalized. Yes, you’re an anthropomorphic bear. Yes, you’re also a giant bird that resides in the aforementioned bear’s backpack. Yes, you’re on a mission to take down an evil witch that literally just wants to be as hot as the bear’s sister.</p>
<p>Of course, as anyone who’s played it can attest, Rare’s N64 action platformer has the perfect amount of charm, humor, and floating objects to collect to make it an unforgettable treat. With a bevy of moves to learn from a large cast of memorable characters and a wide variety of expansive levels, Banjo-Kazooie not only earned a sequel that was equally as impressive but it rooted a special place in our childlike hearts forever.</p>

<p>Combine a solid racing formula with the late-90s obsession with extreme sports and you get 1080 Snowboarding. It’s arguably the best sports title on the N64 (though, NFL Blitz 2000 definitely gave it a run for its money) and paved the way for every snowboarding video game you’ve ever played since.</p>
<p>It featured incredible graphics and physics for its time and blended racing and tricks in a natural way, not unlike the SSX series, which released a year later. Sadly, the 1080 games came to an end after a rather mediocre Gamecube sequel, but the entry title—with its bumping soundtrack and genre-defining gameplay—was anything but forgettable.</p>

<p>Super Smash Bros. truly came out of nowhere with Nintendo announcing the game only three months before its Japanese release, but looking back, it’s crazy that nothing like it had happened before. The game adopted a zoomed-out third-person perspective more in-line with platforming titles than traditional fighting games and forced 12 of Nintendo’s most iconic mascots to launch each other off of a stage rather than tick away at a health bar.</p>
<p>Critics complained that the game lacked depth and balance, disqualifying it from being considered a true fighting title, but any SSB fan knows its chaotic nature is what truly sets it apart as something special. Now, the franchise has grown into a pillar of the competitive gaming community, but there’s no way the series would be where it is today without this quirky and ridiculously fun initial title.</p>

<p>PC gamers had been familiar with high-intensity, laser-filled dog fights for a while thanks to the X-Wing and TIE Fighter flight sim series, but Rogue Squadron finally introduced console players to Star Wars aerial combat in all its glory. Sure, you could make the argument that Shadows of the Empire introduced the Star Wars piloting experience two years prior with its opening mission on Hoth, but Rogue Squadron provided the polish and depth that we craved after being teased with that initial (somewhat janky) snow level.</p>
<p>With 15 regular missions, each taking place on a new planet, Rogue Squadron truly gave players the experience of battling the might of the Empire from the cockpit of just about every Rebel Alliance starfighter. Add a medal system for each mission and opportunities to replay levels with different spacecraft and you’ve got one hell of a flight combat simulator. The only thing we’re really bummed about is the lack of a multiplayer mode, which would have fit into this one perfectly.</p>

<p>It might not have been the first Mario Kart game but Mario Kart 64 was the first to incorporate 4-player split-screen for ultimate multiplayer mayhem. The single-player experience was admittedly a little shallow but it only took one Grand Prix run or high-intensity round of battle mode with four of your buddies to make you realize that this game was truly one for the ages.</p>
<p>The mix polygons and sprites give the game a genuinely cartoony feel that seemed perfect for the series and the addition of the blue shell, while controversial, is noteworthy if only for the number of friendships it has ruined. It probably isn’t the best Mario Kart entry in the franchise but there’s a good chance it’s the one that holds the fondest memories.</p>

<p>Arguably THE multiplayer experience, GoldenEye 007 was the game responsible for the severing of friendships, broken controllers, and completely dominating our lives… and we loved it. Sure, it’s technically based on a James Bond film of the same name, but the vast majority of players remember it predominantly for its frantic and addictive split-screen multiplayer.</p>
<p>While PC players had been playing first-person shooters for years, GoldenEye became the definitive FPS for console gamers, and it has held a sort of legendary status ever since. The single-joystick control scheme might feel a bit wonky and dated compared to the dual-sticks of modern console shooters, but games like Halo and Call of Duty definitely wouldn’t be where they are today if GoldenEye 007 hadn’t paved the way. You could also make the argument that Rare’s Perfect Dark improved upon the mechanics and gameplay of GoldenEye, but which game gave you more memories with proximity mines? Yeah, that’s what I thought.</p>

<p>Few games, if any, made a splash in the video game community like Super Mario 64. It was the first game to feature Nintendo’s jumping mustachioed plumber in a fully 3D environment, but you’d never know it given the smooth-as-hell platforming gameplay, wide array of new jumping abilities, and diverse level designs. It was truly the perfect translation from two dimensions to three, and Shigeru Miyamoto and his team did it in one try!</p>
<p>There was so much to do in this game—not only in the levels themselves but in the castle overworld, too—that it’s easy to lose sight of the overarching goal (sorry, Princess). Sure, the camera can be a little finicky and graphical glitches are an occasional annoyance, but this N64 launch title is a brilliant entry in Mario’s fabled franchise and still a must-play to this day.</p>
<p>Buy it here.</p>
<p>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time wasn’t even close to the first game in the fabled franchise but it was the first time Nintendo allowed us to take control of Link in a fully 3D rendered world, and, boy, oh boy, did they nail it. Boasting an astounding (at the time) 40 hours of gameplay across vast fields, mountains, and lakes, Ocarina of Time felt enormous and truly epic as you watched Link grow from child to adulthood, battle incredible bosses, learn magical new abilities, and time travel to finally defeat Ganon.</p>
<p>From the music and sound design to gameplay and cutscenes, everything in this game was top-notch and completely immersed players in its version of Hyrule. Plus, the monumental conclusion is canonically responsible for splintering the franchise into its multiple timelines, so not only is Ocarina of Time a crucial installment in the world of video games but possibly the most important entry in the entire Zelda franchise.</p>

After a disputed election last month, the police and the armed forces eventually broke with the president and sided with protesters in demanding his resignation. Mr. Morales has insisted he is the victim of a coup.</p>
<p>Background: Mr. Morales, who came to power in 2006, stayed in the presidency longer than any other current head of state in Latin America. After leading Bolivia through an era of economic growth and shrinking inequality, he had pushed to change the law to run for a fourth term.</p>
<p>What’s next: An opposition lawmaker, Jeanine Añez, said that she would assume the interim presidency. But she would need a congressional quorum to approve a transfer of power, and Mr. Morales’s party, the Movement for Socialism, controls both houses of Congress.</p>
<p>Tech’s failure to rein in child abuse images</p>
<p>Photographs and videos of child sexual abuse that were circulated across the internet haunt victims into adulthood as criminals exploit search engines, social networks and cloud storage. (A warning: The linked article contains graphic descriptions of abuse.)

<h3 id="crossword-blog-25-years-of-pauls-puzzles">&ldquo;Crossword blog: 25 years of Paul&rsquo;s puzzles&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ff4519bcf50ecc248184268bc6837cb15134e25/411_706_2011_1207/master/2011.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=2b03d80133762af9bee1afc9cde2b404" alt="img">
We sometimes talk about the Guardian’s stable of setters as if there is one lot who have been around forever and a bunch of newer, rowdier setters. Setters like Paul, who can be mischievous, funny, even smutty.</p>
<p>In fact, as of this weekend, Paul has been a Guardian setter for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>Saturday’s puzzle – I think of Saturdays’ as prize puzzles even though the unpleasantness has put a pause on actual prizes – is a reprint of the first puzzle Paul created for this paper … with some changes.</p>
<p>And its first iteration, in 1995, did not come quickly. In the early 90s, John Halpern – as he was then – was a postgraduate student: the subject was maths and music, that pair of passions we find common to setter after setter.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a warning to a possible future self, the young Halpern says he used to wake at 5am, take a cup of tea to the train station near his home and watch the commuters setting off. “I was going to become a cryptic crossword setter. The rest of the world was mad. I was the only sane one.”</p>
<p>Guardian cryptic crossword setters Araucaria and Paul</p>
<p>After a couple of years of clue-writing, he had two puzzles that he thought might be good enough to send to his favourite setter – Araucaria, who has been a favourite setter to many. He got a lunch invitation in return. “Without him,” Paul tells me, “I’m not sure where I’d be.” The uncrosswordy pseudonym, Paul, is a tribute to his brother, who died when Halpern was 18; their father had died three years earlier and, he says, “Araucaria became my father figure. I loved him. I mean, loved him, as a man.” And when Araucaria picked him up for that lunch and Paul saw the condition of his Fiat Uno, he realised that crosswords make nobody rich.</p>
<p>Paul himself quickly became a favourite of many solvers, because of what he told me in 2011 was the key to a good clue: “the smile factor”. Put simply, he’s tremendously funny. He’s also fair. The Guardian’s crossword editor Hugh Stephenson says that a key piece of Araucaria advice heeded by Paul is “that in the battle of wits between setter and solver, the aim of a good setter is to ensure that the solver, perhaps after a struggle, must be able to win.”</p>
<p>It would be remiss not to mention now that Paul can also be deeply rude. Sometimes the rudeness is right there in the clue; other times you might miss it, such as the puzzle with answers including HORSEMEN, WIDOW TWANKEY, CHARDONNAY, SCUNTHORPE, HOT WATER and, well, MISHIT. Has having become a father and the subsequent years of contact with bodily fluids made him more or less prone to this kind of thing?</p>
<p>“I think tackling a Paul puzzle is considerably less messy than potty training,” he says. “Incidentally, ‘Potty train (4)’ was a clue in my very first puzzle.” Paul had thought this might have been the gem that got him hired until, 15 years later, a stranger in a pub pointed out that while the answer (LOCO) can mean “potty”, it doesn’t really mean “train” so much as the locomotive engine part of a train.</p>
<p>Over the years, Paul has become an evangelist for wordplay, seemingly always out and about: TEDx talks, workshops, a memorable marathon where he set a puzzle while running, a book and of course, in the current age, the inevitable Zoom solves. How does it feel to have become one of the old guard? “Hit me where it hurts, why don’t you?”</p>
<p>He claims to keep young by borrowing ideas from children’s books: “I recently defined HUMAN CANNONBALL as ‘He’s fired’, which came from there. I don’t see myself as old guard – yet.”</p>
<p>OK then, what does the reworked version of the original puzzle (which will feature in his next newsletter) tell us about how he’s changed? We’ll avoid spoilers, but one change is at 14 across (“Nowadays I would be very careful with mental health issues”) and another is at 13 down, which Paul says “was an unpleasant and negative word”.</p>
<p>“I would avoid these nowadays”, he adds; “I hope I’d be more present to my commitment to making people happy.” Job done. Here’s to the next 25 years.
