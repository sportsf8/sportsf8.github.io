<p>TOKYO &ndash; The escalating U.S. pressure against China over Hong Kong has left Japan facing a delicate diplomatic balancing act between toeing the line with the top ally and boosting ties with a neighbor ready to send its leader for a state visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be a G-10, G-11,&rdquo; U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday as he suggested postponing this month&rsquo;s Group of Seven summit until at least September and extended an invitation to Russia, Australia, India and South Korea.</p>
<p>Australia, India and South Korea are key members of the &ldquo;Free and Open Indo-Pacific&rdquo; strategy &ndash; the U.S.-Japan alliance&rsquo;s answer to China&rsquo;s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. The invitee list conspicuously excludes China, the world&rsquo;s second largest economy, but includes Russia, one of Beijing&rsquo;s closer allies. The move is widely seen as Trump&rsquo;s attempt to form a coalition against China.</p>
<p>With the coronavirus death toll mounting in the U.S., Trump is taking a tougher line against China to drum up support for his reelection bid in November.</p>
<p>He has slammed Beijing&rsquo;s new legislation that places broad national security powers over Hong Kong. An expanded G-7 group could serve as a forum to encourage participants to follow the U.S. in criticizing Beijing.</p>
<p>But this push poses a dilemma for Japan.</p>

<p>The U.S. is an ally and a critical security partner for Tokyo in responding to Beijing&rsquo;s growing maritime ambitions in the East and South China seas. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has leveraged his personal rapport with Trump into agreements on trade, security and other issues.</p>
<p>Yet Japan cannot simply go along with U.S. proposed sanctions against mainland and Hong Kong officials and stripping the financial hub of special treatment on trade and travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the impact on our economy, Japan cannot easily fall in line with the U.S.,&rdquo; a Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry source said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong accounted for 2.5% of Japan&rsquo;s total trade in 2019, making the city its ninth-largest trading partner. Over 1,400 Japanese companies had operations in the city as of October 2018, according to the foreign ministry, and Japan also grants special travel considerations for Hong Kong residents.</p>
<p>Mainland China holds even greater economic importance for Japan. The country has been Tokyo&rsquo;s top trading partner for more than a decade, and it accounted for 21.3% of Japan&rsquo;s total trade last year.</p>
<p>Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declined to comment on the U.S. approach to the Hong Kong issue during a news conference Monday. He also offered little on any expansion of the G-7, except to say that the bloc &ldquo;is an important partner for Japan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The G-7 counts the U.K. and other European countries among its members, and thus the U.S. does not hold sway over everything. Japan&rsquo;s strategy has been to work with European members to prevent the escalation of the U.S.-China confrontation.</p>
<p>But an expanded G-7 targeting China could force Tokyo to take a harder stance on Beijing as well.</p>
<p>Abe&rsquo;s office has been preparing for a state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping since last year, designed to symbolize an improved relationship between the countries. The trip was postponed in the spring due to the coronavirus, and now likely will not be rescheduled until after the G-7 summit.</p>
<p>The foreign affairs arms of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party issued a resolution Friday criticizing Beijing and urging Japan to reconsider Xi&rsquo;s state visit. Mishandling the situation could fuel domestic criticism for the Abe government as well.</p>
<p>Japan and the European Union plan to urge China to uphold the &ldquo;one country, two systems&rdquo; framework and human rights in Hong Kong, based on the Sino-British Joint Declaration that outlined Hong Kong&rsquo;s treatment after its handover to China.</p>
<p>But the G-7 summit now stands at least three months away. If Beijing makes further inroads on the Hong Kong security law, the U.S. could intensify pressure on Japan and the EU to toughen their rhetoric on China.

<h3 id="japan-threads-the-needle-as-us-china-animosity-hits-new-highs">&ldquo;Japan threads the needle as U.S.-China animosity hits new highs&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/np_file_16403-870x580.jpeg" alt="img">
When it comes to increasingly fraught U.S.-China relations, Japan is facing a “be careful what you wish for” moment.</p>
<p>Tokyo, which has long pushed the U.S. to take a tougher stance against an aggressive China, is now finding itself caught in the middle as the two superpowers duke it out in the economic and security spheres — and over the response to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But regardless of the results of this fight, from which a clear winner is unlikely to emerge any time soon, if at all, Japan must thread the needle with both countries, something Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has already proven successful at doing.</p>
<p>Courting Xi</p>
<p>In his annual speech before the Diet in January, Abe emphasized that the two Asian powers “share large responsibilities for peace and prosperity in the region and the world” and vowed to build a “new era” of “mature Japan-China relations.”</p>
<p>The remarks came after years of growing tensions and bickering between Tokyo and Beijing, mainly about lingering historical issues and concerns over Chinese moves near disputed islands. Over the past year or so, the relationship has steadily improved.</p>
<p>Abe had been eager to use a planned April state visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to cement a new, forward-looking relationship with the world’s second-largest economy.</p>

<p>But then a mysterious and deadly strain of coronavirus began to spread rapidly across the globe from the Chinese city of Wuhan.</p>
<p>Japan was forced to confront the virus after scores of passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship tested positive for COVID-19. At roughly the same time, the government dispatched charter flights to repatriate Japanese citizens trapped in Wuhan. As it became clearer that the deadly contagion would continue to spread, Abe came under heavy pressure to immediately close Japan’s borders to Chinese visitors.</p>
<p>But with the threat of a devastating economic blow on the horizon — and with a once-in-a-decade state visit by a Chinese leader at stake — Abe appeared reluctant to take sweeping steps to ban visitors from China like the United States and Australia did, disregarding calls from both hard-line conservative lawmakers and opposition parties.</p>
<p>Although China suspended all group tours in late January, Japan continued to permit entry to individual tourists. Later, the government limited travel from two provinces declared to be virus hot spots. All visitors from China were ultimately banned in early April.</p>
<p>Abe denied that Xi’s planned state visit had clouded his judgment to quickly ban entry to Chinese visitors. In early March, Xi postponed his trip and it remains uncertain if it will happen this year — or at all, considering growing opposition over Beijing’s crackdown on Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Japan’s blind spot</p>
<p>With tourist numbers tanking and factory operations suspended, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed one of Japan’s blind spots: overdependence on China.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic engulfed the world and sapped international travel, visitors from China comprised almost 35 percent of all tourists to Japan. Close to 925,000 arrived in January alone, according to Japan National Tourism Organization data. The figure plummeted to just 10,400 in March and a mere 200 in April, after the travel ban went into effect.</p>

<p>While the nation’s foreign direct investment in China was about ¥7.67 trillion ($70 billion) in the first six months of 2019, the government in April earmarked in its supplementary budget roughly ¥243.5 billion to assist Japanese firms in relocating their operations out of China. The funds were to help either bring those operations back to Japan or relocate them elsewhere.</p>
<p>But finding an alternative to China is no simple task, said Amy King, a specialist in Sino-Japanese relations at Australian National University in Canberra.</p>
<p>“From what I’ve seen in Japan’s case, a lot of the actual firms are resisting some of the efforts to diversify away from China because there are simply not very good alternatives,” King said. “And it’s actually harder than ever right now to open up a new manufacturing plant in Bangladesh or Vietnam.”</p>
<p>Trump’s shift on China</p>
<p>Concerns about Beijing may also turn out to be less vexing — or at least more predictable — than dealing with the United States as the administration of President Donald Trump contends with the volatile situation there.</p>
<p>Trump, in a double-barreled challenge to his presidency, is facing down nationwide protests over systemic racism and police brutality while also battling scathing criticism over his administration’s handling of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 110,000 Americans.</p>
<p>Looking to deflect some of the anger over these events as his campaign hits full-stride ahead of the November presidential election, Trump has unleashed his administration to mount some of the strongest attacks by the U.S. against Communist Party-ruled China in recent memory. These attacks and measures have not been confined to mere rhetoric. From Hong Kong to the South China Sea to Beijing’s coronavirus response and its phase-one trade deal with the U.S., the White House has been ramping up pressure on the trade, security and diplomatic fronts.</p>
<p>Beijing, far from backing down, has also bolstered its own campaign against Washington, slamming its credibility as a “beacon of freedom” and looking to take advantage of the current turmoil.</p>

<p>Amid the strife, Abe has spoken obliquely of a larger global role for Japan and building a new international order while signaling that the country will cooperate with other nations that share the “universal values of freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and the rule of law.”</p>
<p>While some experts have said these kinds of remarks are undoubtedly aimed at Beijing, they have also warned that they could come back to haunt Abe.</p>
<p>There’s “no doubt these comments are targeted at China,” said Yuki Tatsumi, co-director of the East Asia Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington. “But I would say when it comes to China, I think Japan is in the middle of a ‘be careful what you wish for’ moment.”</p>
<p>Tatsumi said that Japan has long been frustrated with the lack of urgency in Washington toward Chinese assertiveness, and had long hoped it would come out as “more explicitly critical of some of China’s problematic behavior.”</p>
<p>“But now that the Trump administration has been demonstrating in no uncertain terms its hard-line stance toward China, Japan is feeling anxious whether it can align itself with Washington all the way,” she said, adding that this dilemma was likely only to grow as the talk of “decoupling” with Chinese supply chains continues and the U.S. weighs on allies like Tokyo.</p>
<p>Abe’s ace in the hole</p>
<p>Sandwiched between two global superpowers at each other’s throats, Abe has seized on the tumult as a blessing in disguise allowing him to flex his muscles in one of his strongest suits: diplomacy.</p>
<p>Asked at a May 25 news conference which country he would side with amid the acrimony, the U.S. or China, Abe avoided a straight answer but instead offered a carefully worded assessment saying that Japan would maintain ties to both countries irrespective of the rising tensions.</p>

<p>Abe reiterated the importance of Japan’s alliance with the U.S. but also stressed the importance of further incorporating China into the global rule-making process.</p>
<p>Beyond his dealings with the fraught Sino-U.S. relationship, Abe also appears to be forging his own path.</p>
<p>Late last month, he spoke with European Council chief Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen via videoconference, a hopeful indication that diplomacy — hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic — was re-emerging in earnest. The talks effectively served to reassure mutual support of multilateralism and solidarity despite the growing U.S.-China animosity.</p>
<p>What remains unclear is what Tokyo is willing to do if Washington or Beijing take aim at the multilateral groupings Japan has painstakingly helped to cultivate.</p>
<p>“Already the Abe Cabinet has navigated around U.S. retrenchment, but it has also taken on Chinese ambitions via coalition-building within existing frameworks,” said Sheila Smith, senior fellow for Japan studies at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. “What happens when either China or the U.S. breaks one of these frameworks remains to be seen.”</p>
<p>Regardless, she said, Tokyo has a long history of building such partnerships as it pursues its interests. “We should expect it to continue — or even become more necessary — even as the U.S. and China deepen their antagonism.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Japan certainly has areas where it can step up to the plate, like in maritime security, public health, rule-making in investment, technology and data-sharing, Australian National University’s King said. Still, Japan cannot independently exercise its leadership: it must choose to work cooperatively with China — or compete with it.</p>
<p>“I absolutely do think Japan does have the capacity to play a more important role, but I guess the caveat is whatever role Japan plays in the region, it will need to choose how it relates to China and to the United States,” King said.</p>
<p>“In particular, the United States looks increasingly like it may pull out of (the) regional and global order to some extent altogether. … But China is very much active and trying to shape an order in the region, so whatever role Japan wants to play, it will need to negotiate with China to some extent,” she said.

The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC&rsquo;s U.S. team. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases globally rose above 5.4 million, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. In Japan, the government is seeking to end the state of emergency for Tokyo and other areas while considering $1 trillion in fresh stimulus for the battered economy. Ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, all states in the U.S. began to lift some restrictions implemented to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Government officials are still urging people to practice social distancing and to wear masks in public. Changing opinions from scientists and health officials have contributed to some people refusing to wear masks because public health authorities initially advised against wearing masks, saying there was little evidence that it would help prevent people from getting sick. China&rsquo;s top diplomat criticized U.S. efforts to hold China accountable for its alleged role in the spread of the coronavirus, calling any aims to force Beijing to pay compensation for the coronavirus a &ldquo;daydream.&rdquo; This is CNBC&rsquo;s live blog covering all the latest news on the coronavirus outbreak. This blog will be updated throughout the day as the news breaks. Global cases: More than 5.4 million</p>
<p>Global deaths: At least 345,059</p>
<p>Countries with the most cases: United States (more than 1.6 million), Brazil (363,211), Russia (344,481), United Kingdom (260,916), Spain (235,772) The data above was compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson faces party anger for backing aide who traveled across the U.K. during lockdown</p>
<p>9:00 a.m. London time — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under fire from members of his own party after supporting an aide who drove 250 miles across the country during its coronavirus lockdown. Conservative party lawmakers have called for the aide, Dominic Cummings — a close confidant of the prime minister and an architect of the 2016 Brexit campaign — to resign. &ldquo;As much as I despise any baying pitchfork-led trials by social media, I&rsquo;m unconvinced by the PM&rsquo;s defence of Cummings,&rdquo; Conservative lawmaker David Warburton wrote on Twitter Sunday. —Natasha Turak</p>
<p>New Zealand to allow gatherings of 100 people from Friday</p>
<p>12:55 pm Singapore time — New Zealand will allow gatherings of up to 100 people from noon this Friday, the government announced. That is an increase from the 10-person limit now and will apply to gatherings at home, events outside of home and at public venues. It will also apply to church services, weddings and funerals. New Zealand applied stringent coronavirus containment measures early and has managed to bring the outbreak under control with just two cases last week. —Huileng Tan</p>
<p>Japan seeks to lift state of emergency for Tokyo</p>
<p>10:45 am Singapore time — Japan is seeking to lift a state of emergency for Tokyo and other remaining areas, Reuters reported, citing the Nikkei newspaper. The government is also reportedly considering almost 100 trillion yen ($930 billion) in fresh stimulus for the battered economy. Social distancing restrictions were lifted for most of Japan on May 14 as the number of new cases fell, but the government had kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under observation. The Japanese government will seek approval from key advisers for the lifting of the state of emergency later on Monday. If approved, Japan would no longer have any regions under the state of emergency that was first put in place on April 7. —Huileng Tan</p>

<p>5:21 pm ET — U.S. President Donald Trump suspended travel into the country from Brazil, citing the South American country&rsquo;s surging coronavirus case count. Any travelers who have been in Brazil within a 14-day period will not be granted entry, effective May 28. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country. These new restrictions do not apply to the flow of commerce between the United States and Brazil,&rdquo; White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement. Earlier in the day, Brazil surpassed Russia in total confirmed cases of Covid-19, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Brazil has recorded 347,398 cases of the virus, second only to the U.S.&lsquo;s 1,639,872. Russia has recorded 344,481. —Sara Salinas</p>

<p>2:18 pm ET — Spain is set to reopen some beaches on Monday and relax restrictions on dine-in restaurants in Barcelona and capital city Madrid, according to a report from the Associated Press. Restaurants in the two cities will be allowed to seat 50% of their outdoor dine-in capacity. Madrid and Barcelona account for more than half of the Spain&rsquo;s 28,700 confirmed deaths resulting from Covid-19, the AP reports. But the country has reported fewer than 100 deaths for eight consecutive days, a considerable drop from the hard-hit nation&rsquo;s peak at more than 900 deaths a day. —Sara Salinas</p>

<p>12:35 pm ET — National security adviser Robert O&rsquo;Brien said the U.S. is likely to impose new travel restrictions on Brazil. The administration will likely make the decision on Sunday and will &ldquo;take a look at other countries&rdquo; on a case by case basis,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien said in an interview on CBS&rsquo; &ldquo;Face the Nation.&rdquo; President Donald Trump recently said he is considering imposing a travel ban on Brazil shortly after the South American country&rsquo;s deadliest day on record from the virus. Brazil has the third-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections worldwide behind the U.S. and Russia, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. —Emma Newburger</p>
<p>New York professional sports leagues will be allowed to start training camps, NY Gov. Cuomo says</p>
<p>12:29 pm ET — New York professional sports leagues will be allowed to start training camps in the state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced. &ldquo;We want you up. We want people to be able to watch sports. It gives people something to do. It&rsquo;s a return to normalcy. We are working and encouraging all sports teams to start their training camps as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said during a news briefing. Last week, Cuomo asked major league sports teams to start planning to reopen or start their seasons without fans. While the stadiums aren&rsquo;t allowed to have fans, he said the games could still be televised. —Jasmine Kim</p>

This is a program that is just starting up,&rdquo; Rosengren said in an interview on CBS&rsquo; &ldquo;Face the Nation.&rdquo; The $600 billion program gives four-year loans to companies that are too big to meet the criteria of the Paycheck Protection Program, but too small to access the credit markets. Businesses that are eligible must have 15,000 employees or less. —Emma Newburger</p>
<p>Mental health apps draw wave of new users as experts call for more oversight</p>
<p>11:30 am ET — With in-person therapy paused amid ongoing shelter-in-place restrictions, Americans continue to turn to their smartphones for help. Therapy app makers — including Talkspace and BetterHelp — have been rushing to meet a flood of new customers, but health experts remain divided on how to introduce more transparency and oversight into the ecosystem. &ldquo;Data is really the currency in the app market,&rdquo; Quinn Grundy, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto&rsquo;s Faculty of Nursing, said in an interview. &ldquo;What this pandemic is doing is laying bare pre-existing issues.&rdquo; CNBC spoke to six mental health experts, who all echoed these concerns around privacy and efficacy, especially amid the coronavirus-induced surge in demand. According to app market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, first-time downloads of the top 20 mental wellness apps in the U.S. hit 4 million in April.

<p>Pandemic will drive major changes to the nursing home industry</p>
<p>10:30 am ET — Nursing homes and assisted living facilities throughout the country stopped allowing family members to visit elderly or ailing loved ones as the novel coronavirus spread across the nation. Many families with loved ones in those facilities are desperate to be able to visit them again. But that so-called return to normalcy will take time. Virtual visits over Zoom and WebEx will likely be the norm for the foreseeable future and family members also should be prepared to undergo tests in order to visit.

<p>Wearing a mask is not about politics, says Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine</p>

<p>10:10 am ET — Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told NBC&rsquo;s Chuck Todd that the ongoing debate on wearing masks should not be about choosing a political party but about protecting each other. &ldquo;This is not about whether you&rsquo;re liberal or conservative, left or right, republican or democrat. You wear the mask not to protect yourself so much as to protect others,&rdquo; De Wine said. In response to North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum&rsquo;s emotional message on Friday to be more empathetic instead of shaming those who wear masks, DeWine agreed and said Burgum is &ldquo;spot on.&rdquo; &ldquo;This is one time when we truly are all in this together. What we do directly impacts others,&rdquo; he added. Ohio reopened its retail businesses and personal-care services earlier this month. The governor said the state&rsquo;s reopening plan has been &ldquo;going well.&rdquo; While Ohio is not ready to allow mass gatherings of people yet, DeWine said restaurants and businesses are adapting well to public health measures. —Jasmine Kim</p>
<p>U.S. unemployment rate could still be in double digits in November, says White House adviser</p>

<p>9:36 am ET — The U.S. unemployment rate could still be in double digits in November as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to White House senior advisor Kevin Hassett. The unemployment rate rose to 14.7% in April, with more than 38 million people filing unemployment claims since Mid-March when the outbreak forced national shutdowns. Hassett told CNN&rsquo;s Dana Bash that there would be other promising signs of economic improvement, as unemployment numbers may move slower than other indicators. But he said the unemployment rate is likely headed north of 20% in the month of May. &ldquo;The unemployment rate will be higher in June than in May, but then after that it should start to trend down,&rdquo; Hassett said. —Emma Newburger</p>
<p>Air travel is going to look different this summer because of the coronavirus</p>
<p>9:03 am ET — Memorial Day weekend is the traditional kickoff to the peak travel season and while demand is showing some signs of life, it is still down about 90% from a year ago. The virus and concerns about it spreading have prompted new procedures at airlines and federal agencies. The Department of Homeland Security, which includes TSA and customs, is exploring temperature checks at airports. The Transportation Security Administration is also changing some polices to limit physical contact, such as asking travelers to scan their own boarding passes and that they remove food and other items from their bags so officers don&rsquo;t have to touch bins. Starting this month, U.S. airlines require that travelers wear masks on board. They are tweaking boarding to fill seats from back to front to limit contact with other travelers. Some airlines are limiting the number of travelers on board, or letting travelers know when their flights are full. Experts warn its nearly impossible to socially distance on an aircraft, however. —Leslie Josephs</p>

KYODO NEWS - May 25, 2020 - 21:26 | All, World, Coronavirus, Japan</p>
<p>TOKYO - Japan is expanding its entry ban to India and 10 other nations as part of efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday.</p>
<p>The move, which takes effect Wednesday and will remain in place &ldquo;for the time being,&rdquo; means foreign nationals who have been to these areas within the last 14 days will be turned away upon arrival.</p>
<p>The other countries are Afghanistan, Argentina, Bangladesh, El Salvador, Ghana, Guinea, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, South Africa and Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry had raised its travel advisory for the 11 nations last week, urging against any trips to the areas.</p>
<p>With their addition, the number of countries and regions covered by Japan&rsquo;s entry ban climbs to 111, including the United States, most of Asia including China and South Korea, and all of Europe.</p>
<p>Speaking at a meeting of a government task force on the coronavirus response, Abe also said Japan will maintain other border control measures, including visa suspensions and a 14-day quarantine period for all arrivals including Japanese nationals, until the end of June.</p>
<p>The number of foreign travelers to Japan has plummeted since the measures were introduced, dealing a heavy blow to the world&rsquo;s third-largest economy.</p>
<p>Inbound figures were down 99.9 percent in April from a year earlier to just 2,900, according to the Japan Tourism Agency.

The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.</p>
<p>TOP OF THE HOUR:</p>
<p>— Japan approves lifting state of emergency in three prefectures.</p>
<p>— Japan considers attending G-7 summit if it is rescheduled by Trump, host nation U.S.</p>
<p>— China prepares for country&rsquo;s biggest political meeting of the year.</p>
<hr>
<p>TOKYO — Japan&rsquo;s economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighboring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts at the meeting approved the plan to lift the measure in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo.</p>
<p>The measure will be kept in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement.</p>
<p>The three are among the eight prefectures still under the emergency status after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted the measure last week in all but eight of the 47 Japanese prefectures. Abe declared the state of emergency on April 7 in parts of Japan including Tokyo and later expanded it to nationwide.</p>
<p>Under Japan&rsquo;s state of emergency, which does not enforce lockdowns, many people have followed the social distancing requests but others had to continue commuting, while a sizeable minority continued to dine out or picnicked at parks. More stores, restaurants and bars have started to reopen recently, under new anti-infection guidelines.</p>
<p>Abe will formally announce the plan later Thursday after approval by parliamentary committees.</p>
<p>Japan has about 16,424 confirmed cases and 777 deaths as of Wednesday, according to the health ministry.</p>
<hr>
<p>TOKYO — Japan&rsquo;s top government spokesman said Thursday that the country is considering attending the Group of Seven summit meeting, if the U.S. reschedules the canceled gathering.</p>
<p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was responding to a question about President Donald Trump&rsquo;s tweet Wednesday that he is considering rescheduling the canceled G-7 meeting with world leaders in the U.S., because it would be a &ldquo;great sign to all&rdquo; of things returning to normal during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Trump had scheduled the G-7 summit for June 10-12 at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. The summit was canceled it in March because of the pandemic, and Trump said the leaders would confer by video conference.</p>
<p>Suga said Thursday that he interpreted Trump&rsquo;s tweet as &ldquo;an expression of the President&rsquo;s intention to normalize the global economy quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said his understanding is that details such as the dates and format of the meeting are still being studied by the U.S. as host nation.</p>
<p>Suga said Tokyo and Washington are in discussion, but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Japan is still partially under a coronavirus state of emergency. Abe plans to announce lifting of the measure in three of the remaining eight prefectures later Thursday, while keeping it in place in Tokyo and four other areas.</p>
<hr>
<p>BEIJING — The central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global coronavirus pandemic is believed to have originated, has issued a total ban on the hunting, breeding and human consumption of wild animals.</p>
<p>The move is in an apparent response to research showing the virus most likely originated among bats and was transmitted to people via an intermediary wild species sold for food at a market in the city.</p>
<p>The regulation issued Wednesday seeks to carry out measures passed at the national level covering protected land animals as well as sea life, promising financial relief to help dealers move into other lines of business.</p>
<p>However, it contains numerous exceptions, including for animals used for traditional Chinese medicine, as long as they are not consumed as food for humans. That left it unclear whether the ban would cover pangolins, small mammals whose scales are used for traditional Chinese medicine but which are thought to have been the intermediary carrier of the virus.</p>
<p>The regulation will be enforced immediately and will be in effect for five years.</p>
<hr>
<p>BEIJING — China reported two new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Thursday, as the country prepares to hold its biggest political meeting of the year under strict social distancing rules.</p>
<p>One of the new cases was imported and detected in the southern industrial center of Wuhan, while the other was a case of domestic transmission found in the financial hub of Shanghai. No new deaths were reported, leaving China&rsquo;s total at 4,634 among 82,967 total cases.</p>
<p>Just 84 people remain in treatment, while another 382 were in isolation and being monitored as either suspected cases or for having tested positive while showing no symptoms.</p>
<p>On Friday, China will open the annual session of the National People&rsquo;s Congress, its ceremonial parliament, which usually brings around 3,000 delegates to Beijing, along with a similar number of members of its advisory body, the Chinese People&rsquo;s Political Consultative Conference, which convenes on Thursday.</p>
<p>Economic issues and health care are expected to dominate the meeting this year, which also comes amid sharpening trade and political frictions with the United States.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, authorities are pressing ahead with an drive to conduct virus tests on all 11 million citizens of the central city of Wuhan, believed to be the epicenter of the global pandemic. More than 2 million people have been tested so far, according to state media citing local health officials, with 71 testing positive but showing no symptoms. The city accounted for more than 50,000 of China&rsquo;s total cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas — A court ruling that paved the way in Texas for a dramatic expansion of mail-in voting over fears of the coronavirus is now on hold.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals voted Wednesday to temporarily put aside any expansion of mail-in voting while the case is under review. The order came less than 24 hours after a federal judge in San Antonio ruled that Texas must give all 16 million registered voters in the state the option of casting a ballot by mail during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The fight in Texas is one of several nationwide over expanding access to mail-in voting during the pandemic. Texas generally limits mail-in ballots to voters 65 or older, or those with a &ldquo;sickness or physical condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Republican Texas Attorney General Paxton has asserted that fear of getting the virus doesn&rsquo;t qualify as a disability under the law.</p>
<hr>
<p>RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina restaurants, barber shops and salons can welcome patrons inside starting this weekend, after Gov Roy Cooper announced Wednesday the loosening of rules because he says state COVID-19 trends remain largely stable.</p>
<p>But bars, gyms and indoor entertainment venues will remain closed five more weeks.</p>
<p>The Democratic governor announced a new executive order launching the second phase of easing business and assembly restrictions after nonessential businesses and dine-in restaurant service were initially shuttered in March. Two weeks ago, Cooper allowed more businesses to open.</p>
<p>Cooper said he now feels comfortable about the virus data to lift the stay-at-home order and extend partial openings starting Friday afternoon for dine-in eating at restaurants and for personal care services such as barbers.</p>
<p>But Cooper said he didn&rsquo;t feel good enough about the trends to reopen public playgrounds, movie theaters, fitness centers and other entertainment locales. They&rsquo;ll have to remain closed until at least June 26.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, the state reported more than 20,100 confirmed cases and 700 deaths, according to Department of Health and Human Services data.</p>
<hr>
<p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand: New Zealand&rsquo;s prime minister wants employers to consider switching to a four-day work week as a way to promote tourism, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern said in a Facebook Live video this week that people had learned a lot about flexibility and working from home during the nation&rsquo;s lockdown, which was eased last week.</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s tourism industry had accounted for about 10% of the economy, but has ground to a halt during the outbreak.</p>
<p>The South Pacific nation&rsquo;s borders remain closed, but Ardern said that as much as 60% of tourism was domestic and that more flexible working arrangements could allow New Zealanders to travel more within their own country.</p>
<p>Ardern said she would encourage employers to think about whether or not a four-day work week is something that would work for their workplace, &ldquo;because it certainly would help tourism all around the country.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea &ndash; South Korea has reported 12 new cases of the coronavirus and one more death, bringing its totals to 11,122 cases and 124 deaths.</p>
<p>The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday said 10 of the new cases came from Seoul and nearby Incheon, where health workers have been scrambling to track and test potential virus carriers following dozens of infections linked to nightspots.</p>
<p>At least 1,191 infections have been linked to passengers arriving from abroad.</p>
<p>South Korea was reporting around 500 new cases a day in early March, but since managed to stabilize infections with an active test-and-quarantine program, which has so far allowed the country to avoid real lockdowns.</p>
<hr>
<p>HARRISBURG, Pa. &ndash; Pennsylvania is working on guidelines to allow sporting events, exhibitions and leagues, both professional and amateur, to get back to &ldquo;some semblance of normalcy&rdquo; after practically everything shut down to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a conference call with reporters, Wolf said he has been in touch with major professional organizations including NASCAR, the NFL, NHL, Major League Baseball and others to figure out how they can resume.</p>
<p>Wolf said he expected that his administration will, in the coming days, produce guidelines for the various venues, sports and activities to resume. But, he said, the ultimate success of the events and leagues will rest on whether people feel safe to attend and participate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the end, the ultimate arbiter of our fate here when it comes to sporting events are going to be individuals who want to participate, individuals who want to be part of sports, whether its amateur or professional,&rdquo; Wolf said. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve got to make sure that we give them the confidence to then go to these sporting events and feel safe, that they&rsquo;re not taking their lives or health into their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>LAS VEGAS &ndash; Nevada gambling regulators are calling casino companies to a health and safety workshop next week aimed at sharpening rules for reopening the state&rsquo;s shuttered gambling establishments.</p>
<p>With no opening date currently set, the meeting that the Nevada Gaming Control Board scheduled for Tuesday morning could help show when Gov. Steve Sisolak plans to lift his mid-March order that stopped gambling in Nevada and closed casinos to prevent groups from gathering and spreading coronavirus.</p>
<p>A control board statement said regulators are working to determine how reopening will occur, and the governor will determine when.</p>
<hr>
<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — A member of the Illinois General Assembly was removed from the first gathering in 10 weeks after refusing to wear a face covering.</p>
<p>Republican Rep. Darren Bailey of Xenia, 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Chicago, voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; on a face-covering rule to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, which was adopted 97-12. Bailey said he was speaking for Illinois residents who feel &ldquo;captive&rdquo; and &ldquo;burdened&rdquo; by state-ordered restrictions on movement.</p>
<p>Bailey, who filed a legal challenge to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker&rsquo;s stay-at-home order, in effect since March 21, represents growing dissent to stay-at-home rules in central and southern parts of the state, which have had far fewer coronavirus infections than Chicago.</p>
<p>Pritzker, who later announced another 147 Illinois deaths related to COVID-19 at his daily briefing, said, &ldquo;The representative has shown callous disregard for life, callous disregard for people&rsquo;s health &hellip;. The representative has no interest in protecting others.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>HELENA, Mt. &ndash; Armed demonstrators were among a group gathered at the Montana Capitol to protest the state government&rsquo;s response to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Independent Record reported about 60 protesters convened outside the Capitol building in Helena on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some demonstrators carried guns and others held signs, including many referencing Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock.</p>
<p>Bullock enacted travel restrictions and a stay-at-home order March 28 in response to the spread of COVID-19. Bullock lifted the stay-at-home order for individuals April 26 and for many nonessential businesses April 27 as part of a phased reopening plan, while keeping some social distancing requirements in place.</p>
<hr>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California&rsquo;s Tulare County is facing pushback from the state as it pushes the boundaries on reopening beyond what state officials allow.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom&rsquo;s administration told Tulare County officials they could lose out on state and federal disaster funding if they don&rsquo;t follow the state&rsquo;s rules. The Central Valley county&rsquo;s board of supervisors voted Tuesday to allow most businesses and churches to reopen.</p>
<p>More than half the state&rsquo;s counties have won state approval to reopen things like restaurants for diners and other businesses. Newsom has outlined a four-stage process to ease restrictions put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<hr>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond says school districts will make their own decisions about when, and how, to open during this COVID-19 era.</p>
<p>Thurmond said Wednesday he expects most school districts to open as usual in late August or September, but with classes that look radically different to maintain social-distancing standards.</p>
<p>Expected is a mix of in-person and distance learning with fewer children in classes, hallways and other common areas. They will wear masks, as will teachers and staff.</p>
<p>Thurmond plans to hold a virtual meeting Thursday with representatives from 1,000 districts to get an idea of what schools are thinking they&rsquo;ll have to do to keep students safe and buildings sanitized.</p>
<p>California has 6 million K-12 students.</p>
<hr>
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO — The administration of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday unveiled new measures to expand use of chloroquine, the predecessor of an anti-malaria drug promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a treatment for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The new guidelines were approved by Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, who became interim Health Minister after his predecessor was fired five days ago. Pazuello had no health experience until he became the ministry&rsquo;s No. 2 official in April.</p>
<p>Bolsonaro wrote on his official Facebook page that &ldquo;there is still no scientific evidence, but it is being monitored and used in Brazil and worldwide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Health officials say the virus has killed nearly 18,000 Brazilians and infected at least 271,600 people in the South American country.</p>
<p>In Sao Paulo, Brazil&rsquo;s most populous city, authorities announced a six-day &ldquo;mega-holiday&rdquo; in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus, after the state&rsquo;s death toll surpassed 5,000 this week.</p>
<hr>
<p>MOSCOW — The Russian military has set up a quarantine facility at a Siberian gold mine where hundreds have been infected with the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Olimpiada mine in the town of Yeruda has emerged as a top spot of contagion, with more than 800 workers testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Defense Ministry said Wednesday that it has set up a quarantine camp capable of accommodating 2,000 people. Those who get sick will be treated at a nearby field hospital set up by the military, which has sent 77 medics and hundreds of support personnel to the mine to deal with the outbreak.</p>
<p>Russia has ranked second behind the United States in the number of infections, with more than 300,000 coronavirus cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>MADRID — The regional authority of Madrid is appealing to Spain&rsquo;s Supreme Court over the Spanish government&rsquo;s refusal to ease its lockdown.</p>
<p>The Madrid regional government said in a statement Wednesday it believes that technical assessments over what areas can loosen restrictions adopted to stem the new coronavirus outbreak are not being applied in the same way in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>The Madrid region has officially recorded almost 67,000 of the country&rsquo;s 232,000 COVID-19 cases, making it the hardest-hit area.</p>
<p>The conservative Popular Party, which is the Socialist-led national government&rsquo;s main opposition, has a controlling majority in the Madrid regional authority.</p>
<hr>
<p>TORONTO — Canada is recommending that its citizens wear masks if proper social distancing can&rsquo;t be maintained.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s Chief Public Health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, says the use of non-medical masks, or face coverings, is recommended as an added layer of protection when physical distancing of 2 meters (6 feet) is difficult.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he&rsquo;s started wearing a mask when he&rsquo;s out of his home and can&rsquo;t keep a safe distance from others at all times. He was wearing one when he arrived at Parliament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials once recommended against the wearing of face masks but adjusted that advice in early April when it became clear the novel coronavirus can be spread by people who aren&rsquo;t showing symptoms.</p>
<hr>
<p>OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington state&rsquo;s unemployment rate shot up to 15.4% in April and the state&rsquo;s economy lost 527,000 jobs in the month as a result of the economic downturn from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the highest jobless rate the state has seen since it started keeping records in the 1970s. The previous record was 12.2% in November 1982, said Paul Turek, an economist for the state&rsquo;s Employment Security Department.</p>
<p>April&rsquo;s rate, released Wednesday, is a significant jump from March&rsquo;s 5.1%, though officials had warned April&rsquo;s numbers would more truly reflect the widespread closing of restaurants and other businesses, which began in mid-March.</p>
<p>February&rsquo;s unemployment rate was 3.8%.</p>
<hr>
<p>BERLIN — German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the country won&rsquo;t be cutting foreign aid due to the coronavirus pandemic, and further relief for poor nations is needed.</p>
<p>Speaking Wednesday after a video meeting with heads of the World Bank, the International Monetary fund and three other global economic bodies, Merkel noted last month&rsquo;s agreement to freeze poor countries&rsquo; debt obligations and said that &ldquo;as far as the sustainability of debt is concerned further steps need to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merkel didn&rsquo;t spell out whether Germany would go so far as agreeing to debt relief.</p>
<hr>
<p>CHICAGO — Ford resumed production of the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator on Wednesday morning at its Chicago SUV factory, only to shut down again after running short of seats made at a Lear Corp. factory in nearby Hammond, Indiana.</p>
<p>Lear confirmed that production was suspended after an employee told the company of a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>Ford temporarily halted production at the factory twice on Tuesday after two workers tested positive for the disease, and on Wednesday a worker at the company&rsquo;s pickup truck plant in Dearborn, Michigan, also tested positive for COVID-19, forcing a work stoppage there.</p>
<p>Employees who came in contact with the worker in Dearborn were sent home for 14 days. Production was expected to resume Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The company says all three workers contracted COVID-19 outside the factories, triggering protocols that included sanitizing equipment and isolating employees who came in contact with the affected workers.</p>
<p>The shutdowns on Tuesday came just a day after Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler restarted their U.S. factories after being idle for about two months due to the disease.</p>
<hr>
<p>GENEVA — The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization says an end to U.S. funding for the U.N. health agency would have a &ldquo;major implication for delivering essential health services to the most vulnerable people in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Ryan was responding to questions from reporters about a letter sent by U.S. President Donald Trump threatening an end to funding from the United States, its biggest donor, unless the agency reforms.</p>
<p>The comments came on a day when a total of 106,000 COVID-19 cases were reported to WHO over a 24-hour period, the most in a single day since the outbreak began.</p>
<p>Ryan said the U.S. funding that reaches the WHO emergencies program was &ldquo;on the order of $100 million a year&rdquo; and much of it goes to &ldquo;humanitarian health operations all over the world, in all sorts of fragile and difficult settings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan expressed concern about any such funding cuts and said, if necessary, the agency would have to work with other partners to make sure the money is there.</p>

<p>MILAN — More than two weeks into Phase II of gradual reopening in Italy, the number of reported new coronavirus infections grew by 665 on Wednesday to 227,364, with nearly half in the northern region of Lombardy that has been the epicenter for Italy&rsquo;s epidemic.</p>
<p>Five regions reported no new cases of COVID-19 and nine regions reported no deaths, according to the civil protection agency.</p>
<p>Deaths in the country rose by 161 to 32,330, the lion&rsquo;s share in Lombardy, and pressure on hospitals continued to ease, with 400 fewer beds occupied with COVID-19 patients, including 40 in ICUs.</p>
<hr>
<p>ANKARA, Turkey — Turkey&rsquo;s health minister does not expect a second wave of infections in the country in the coming months, but says his ministry is monitoring the possibility of a risk in September or October.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Wednesday following a weekly meeting of the country&rsquo;s scientific advisory council, Fahrettin Koca said the country is preparing to open to domestic travel next month by introducing a system of certification that will allow passengers with no health issues to travel on planes and trains. The system will also allow health authorities to easily track travelers and anyone they came into to contact with if they fall ill, he said.</p>
<p>The country is also preparing to accept travelers from 31 nations who want to visit Turkey for medical purposes, Koca said.</p>
<p>The announcement came as the number of confirmed infections and deaths in the country continued to drop. Turkey registered 23 COVID-19 deaths and 972 new confirmed cases in the most recent 24-hour period, the first time the number of infections was below 1,000 in two months. The total number of confirmed infections now stands at nearly 153,000 with 4,222 deaths.</p>

<p>ATHENS, Greece — Greece&rsquo;s long-awaited tourist season will begin on June 15 with the opening of seasonal hotels.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis says international flights will begin heading directly to tourist destinations on July 1. In a televised address to the nation on Wednesday, Mitsotakis says visitors would be subject to sample coronavirus testing and &ldquo;our general health protocols will be adhered to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The government imposed a lockdown early in Greece&rsquo;s outbreak, which has been credited with keeping the number of deaths and critically ill people at low levels.</p>
<p>Mitsotakis announced a reduction in consumer taxes on transportation from 24% to 13%, which will lead to cheaper boat, plane and bus tickets during the tourist season. There&rsquo;s also a cut on tax on coffee, soft drinks and open-air movie theater tickets.</p>
<p>Health authorities announced one death Wednesday and 10 new confirmed coronavirus cases. That brings the total confirmed cases to 2,850 and 166 dead in the country of nearly 11 million people.</p>
<hr>
<p>MADRID — Spain has registered a fourth consecutive day of fewer than 100 deaths from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s down from more than 900 fatalities a day at the height of its outbreak in early April.</p>
<p>The Spanish Health Minister reported 95 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 Wednesday, taking the overall death toll to 27,888.</p>
<p>The health ministry also reported 416 new infections over the last 24 hours confirmed by laboratory tests. More than 232,000 infections have been confirmed by laboratory tests, and 49,600 Spaniards have tested positive from an antibody test.</p>
<p>Spain is edging toward reactivating its economy, and wearing a face mask is mandatory while outside the home.</p>
<hr>
<p>BERLIN — Germany hopes to reach agreement with fellow European countries on rolling back travel restrictions in time for the summer holiday season.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Heiko Maas says &ldquo;we hope to be able to lift the worldwide travel warning at least for the European Union after June 14 and replace it with lower level travel advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maas says countries had gotten &ldquo;a good bit closer&rdquo; to that goal with Germany&rsquo;s nine neighbors and an earlier round of negotiations with 11 other European countries this week.</p>
<p>Maas says Germany wants a &ldquo;coordinated and transparent process&rdquo; across the EU that avoids individual countries pressing ahead in a bid for income from tourism when the pandemic isn&rsquo;t yet defeated.

<p>12:15 a.m. U.S. Sen. Rick Scott accuses China of trying to sabotage coronavirus vaccine development by Western countries. &ldquo;What I really believe is, whether England does it first or we do it first, we&rsquo;re going to share,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Communist China, they&rsquo;re not going to share.&rdquo;</p>

<p>12:23 p.m. China&rsquo;s exports contracted in May as global coronavirus lockdowns continued to devastate demand, while a sharper-than-expected fall in imports pointed to mounting pressure on manufacturers as global growth stalled. Overseas shipments in May fell 3.3% from a year earlier, after a surprising 3.5% gain in April, customs data shows.</p>
<p>11:39 a.m. China&rsquo;s foreign exchange reserves rose unexpectedly in May even as the yuan weakened on worries over an escalation in Sino-American tensions.

<p>Saturday, June 6</p>
<p>10:30 p.m. Potential coronavirus treatment Avigan is now expected to take until July at the earliest to complete a clinical trial, further delaying government approval in Japan, Nikkei has learned.

<p>5:00 a.m. The Dow closes 3.2% higher and the S&amp;P 500 climbs 2.6%. For the week, they were up 6.8% and 4.9%, respectively, the sharpest gains since the week ending April 10.</p>

<h3 id="can-japan-maintain-strong-ties-with-both-unreliable-us--belligerent-china-amid-flaring-us-china-tensions">&ldquo;Can Japan Maintain Strong Ties With Both ‘Unreliable US’ &amp; ‘Belligerent China’ Amid Flaring US-China Tensions?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/11-14.jpg" alt="img">
Is Japan bearing the brunt of flaring tensions between global superpowers, China and the US? Japan’s diplomatic relations have been majorly peaceful with both the rival nations, throughout the years.</p>
<p>Japan’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, stands at a crossroads where US President Donald Trump stands as a military ally, whereas, Chinese President Xi Jinping is his most important trading partner.</p>
<p>According to William Pesek, an award-winning Tokyo-based journalist and author, this puts Japan in an impossible situation, not wanting to take sides in a brawl that has few possible good outcomes for the world’s third-biggest economy. “If Abe falls, Japan’s economy will go with him,” wrote Pesek.</p>
<p>“Certainly, Xi has stirred trouble with aggressive behaviour and provocations in the South China Sea. But Abe has had to spend the last few years mending fences with Asia’s superpower as Trump has shown himself unreliable,” observed Pesek.</p>
<p>As reported earlier by the Eurasian Times, US President Donald Trump has reiterated that his administration would soon “do something” about the situation.</p>
<p>Trump has threatened to revoke Hong Kong’s special economic status because of Beijing’s contentious security law which has drawn widespread protests in the semi-autonomous city. Pesek states that this latest front in Trump’s trade war is fast becoming a threat to Japan’s economic trajectory.</p>
<p>“Japan entered 2020 in poor shape. Then came the COVID-19 shock, which has Abe scrambling to support growth. So far, his government has announced about $2 trillion of fiscal spending, roughly 40% of gross domestic product. Second-quarter growth might contract about 22%, the worst drop since the 1950s,” he wrote.</p>
<p>With increasing political disturbances in Hong Kong, the city runs the risk of companies relocating to neighbouring nations which might disrupt its economy. “As Beijing meddles with Hong Kong’s press freedoms and legal system, Japan Inc. might consider relocating in ways that hurt corporate profits and infuriate China,” stated Pesek.</p>
<p>Shinzo Abe is facing troubles not just from the outside but also on the inside with political rivals taking advantage of the decreasing popularity due to inadequate COVID-19 response. Abe has also been involved in a scandal and has been accused of altering key documents leading to favouritism.</p>
<p>This scandal has led to low popularity ratings for Abe in Japan. “Approval for his cabinet fell 2.3 points to 39.4% in a recent Kyodo News survey. Political rivals smell blood in the water,” wrote Pesek.</p>
<p>According to the author, Abe cannot afford to lose the support of either of its allies. “Abe has to demonstrate to the Japanese public he is not nearly as feckless as the opinion polls now indicate,” says Jeff Kingston, head of Asian studies at Temple University’s Tokyo campus.</p>
<p>“He has bounced back before, but now he seems to have lost his mojo and seems distracted by political manoeuvring rather than keeping his attention focused on urgent matters,” he added.</p>
<p>Pesek concluded that Japan cannot afford to fall out neither with China nor the US. “The China part is a difficult juggling feat on its own: supporting Hong Kong’s autonomy without drawing Xi’s ire.</p>
<p>Add Trump’s unpredictability to the mix and Abe faces a near-impossible task of keeping his footing. He must step very carefully. It is not like there is a net below should Tokyo stumble,” he wrote.
