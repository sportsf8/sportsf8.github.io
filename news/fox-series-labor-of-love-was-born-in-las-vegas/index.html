Chase Stevens Las Vegas Review-Journal @csstevensphoto</p>
<p>The Fox series “Labor of Love” should, um, pacify TV viewers’ continuing thirst for dating game shows.</p>
<p>Naturally, the concept was conceived in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The father of this new series is Vegas producer (or, in this case, re-producer) Marklen Kennedy, who brought “Gigolos” to Showtime from 2011-2016. Kennedy hosted a small viewing party Thursday night for the launch of “Labor,” in which 15 gentlemen compete for the opportunity to start a family with a 41-year-old divorcee.</p>
<p>Her name is Kristy Katzmann. No relation, but she’s a catch. Kristin Davis of “Sex &amp; the City” is the show’s host, narrator and sorta counselor.</p>
<p>For the premiere party, Kennedy invited his friend (and recent Kats! column bicycling partner) Billy F. Gibbons of ZZ Top. Kennedy introduced Gibbons to his friend and guest Mark Baker, saying, “This is my friend, John. He’s a lookalike for Billy Gibbons.”</p>
<p>Baker runs the graphics company Color Reflections. His wife, Desirae, is with Orange Realty Group and was the Realtor for Billy and his wife, Gilligan Stillwater Gibbons, as they bought their Rancho Circle home.</p>
<p>Baker looked at the person who is obviously Billy Gibbons and said, “You look just like Billy Gibbons.”</p>
<p>“I get that all the time,” said Gibbons, now playing the role of “John.”</p>
<p>This went on most of the night, with Baker referring to Gibbons as “John,” as in, “John, can I get you a drink?” By the end of the night he finally learned that John was actually Gibbons.</p>
<p>“I was super confused,” Baker said.</p>
<p>As for the show, Fox has described it as a “parody” in its YouTube trailer. Whatever the case, the show presented a scene in which all 15 contestants were required to produce semen samples in a fertility trailer. The guys all proved to be impressive specimens.</p>
<p>The total sperm count of each guy was measured and, yes, a sperm champ was announced. Kennedy’s group busted up at that scene.</p>
<p>An early pick from here to win Kristy’s heart is Jason, a flooring business owner from Charlotte, North Carolina. Jason has two dispositions: charming and drunk. But I’d bet he can pick Billy Gibbons out of a lineup, no problem.</p>
<p>Buckin’ out stock</p>
<p>The upcoming PBR Monster Energy Challenge at South Point Arena and Equestrian Center will return rodeo’s most popular event to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>More relevant, the series will also help return the city to the live-event TV format. The Professional Bull Riders competition airs Fridays and Saturdays, with highlight broadcasts Sundays, from June 5-28 on CBS Sports Network.</p>
<p>Every event features three “games,” each showcasing a head-to-head matchup of three riders from one team against three riders from another on the sport’s top bulls.</p>
<p>These are nonticketed events, with the Equestrian Center in effect serving as a large TV studio. The series caps at the Denny Sanford Premier Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, July 10-12. Those are ticketed events. The PBR promises it will adhere to all safety protocols.</p>
<p>PBR has already held three “closed”events — in Oklahoma. This includes the Unleash the Beast event in Guthrie on April 25. That one had initially been scheduled for the South Point.</p>
<p>Following the PBR’s activity in Oklahoma, South Point General Manager Ryan Growney worked for two months with resort owner and legend Michael Gaughan and arena director Steve Stallworth to land the TV segments in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“This is a good start of a model that can work to get Las Vegas back on television,” Growney says. “Have you seen the Strip empty? We need to change that. This is going to lead to some action to take the town in the right direction, do it successfully, and show what an event will look like in this new world.”</p>
<p>The “closed” PBR concept should boost the UFC’s position to hold its no-fan fight cards in Las Vegas. The Nevada Athletic Commission is meeting Wednesday to review options to hold UFC events at its Apex Facility in southwest Las Vegas. The next event is approaching fast, on Saturday. All three of the UFC’s no-ticket events have been a marketing boon to Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>But the stage for the Las Vegas-based UFC should rightfully be Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“I can’t speak directly to UFC, but I can say we’re going to be the guinea pig for a lot of these events,” Growney says. “I 100 percent know that if they can do it in Oklahoma, or Florida, we can do it here, with that Las Vegas sex appeal.”</p>
<p>Mob scene on hold</p>
<p>The Mob Museum is plotting a return for Sunday, though live music and grooving will have to wait. The downtown Las Vegas attraction won’t present live entertainment in its Underground tavern and music club when it reopens.</p>
<p>But the singers and players in Great Gatsby garb will be back, eventually.</p>
<p>Mob Museum President and CEO Jonathan Ullman said Saturday that performances in the downstairs speakeasy, and events in the adjacent Distillery, are in the attraction’s long-term forecast. The Museum itself is planning to reopen next week conditional on the state setting aside restrictions for gatherings in such nonessential public spaces.</p>
<p>“We want to bring back music and events, but we have to be aware that having three or four musicians performing requires a lot of thought and planning,” Ullman said. “It changes the setup significantly. But we know people like the entertainment, and they like the events we’ve had in the distillery, too.”</p>
<p>The Mob Museum has been on point with jazz lineups rotating in the cozy speakeasy, and the distillery has offered the Bootlegger Boogie, where guests have learned such period dances as the Charleston and Balboa. Those lessons have been staged monthly, on Mondays.</p>
<p>The Balboa swing dance, especially, is an aggressive violation of social distancing. Maybe that’s a measure of when we are fully clear of COVID-19: We can Balboa again in safety in the basement of The Mob Museum.</p>
<p>A new Eldo haunt</p>
<p>El Dorado Cantina at Tivoli Village has reopened its dining room and patio. The restaurant had just debuted in January and was open 24 hours before COVID-19 forced takeout and delivery only. But the place was doing impressive (if socially distant) business Sunday night. Try the flan, really.</p>
<p>Look for some expansion action at Tivoli, too. The Lounge at El Dorado is set to open in the two-story structure next to the restaurant that was formerly the Hamptons’ space. The Lounge and restaurant will share the courtyard.</p>
<p>The opening is planned for late summer or early fall, with the menu, cocktail program and entertainment concepts to be annoucned. Some key staffers from Clique Hospitality and Hakasaan Group leading the operations team. Count me intrigued.</p>

Watch it on: Sundance Now</p>
<p>Trying</p>
<p>Trying is the latest installment in a glut of British sadcoms poking at tragedy within a comedic setup ( see also : Fleabag), but it’s also the rare series to tackle infertility as a theme, which it handles with care and good humor. Jason (Rafe Spall) and Nikki (Esther Smith), after trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant, decide to adopt, a process that plays out next to their attempts at self-betterment and the pursuit of “real” adulthood. The story lines can be farcical, and Trying turns London into an unrealistically idyllic backdrop, but the show’s sweetness and endearing optimism set it apart.</p>
<p>Watch it on: Apple TV+</p>
<p>Read: ‘Trying’ is a sadcom in the ‘Fleabag’ mold</p>
<p>Shows About Coping</p>
<p>Back to Life</p>
<p>At the beginning of Back to Life, Miri (Daisy Haggard) is released from prison after serving an 18-year sentence for a crime whose specifics form the mystery at the core of the show. Miri is sweet and goofy and understandably bewildered by how much things have changed since she last saw the outside world; at the same time, she’s a figure of loathing in her community, which hampers her attempts to start living normally again. Haggard, who co-wrote the show, communicates Miri’s vulnerability but also her irrepressible optimism. And after six episodes, the show’s revelations offer a moving and hopeful conclusion.</p>
<p>Watch it on: Showtime</p>
<p>Barry</p>
<p>Alec Berg and Bill Hader’s black comedy about a hit man who just wants to be loved contains multitudes—including genial Chechen mafiosi, psychotic children, and one of TV’s best portrayals of the narcissism inherent to performance. But its biggest asset is Hader as Barry, a Marine who learns to kill in the military, then learns to leverage those kills as an assassin, then discovers acting class and realizes what a “normal” life might look like. The question of whether people can really change and make amends for past offenses hangs over the show, and Hader’s ability to make Barry both endearingly sympathetic and intermittently terrifying keeps viewers from getting too comfortable.</p>
<p>Watch it on: HBO</p>
<p>Read: The dark humanity of ‘Barry’</p>
<p>Russian Doll</p>
<p>Another show that’s achieved eerie new resonance over the past few months, Russian Doll, from Leslye Headland, Natasha Lyonne, and Amy Poehler, is still one of Netflix’s jewels—a brilliantly ambitious piece of storytelling that offers more and more every time you watch. Nadia (Lyonne) is a video-game developer in New York’s East Village who, in the first episode, dies, and finds herself reverting over and over again to the same moment on her 36th birthday. The more she tries to cheat death, the more convoluted the mystery of what’s happening to her becomes. Whether you read it as a metaphor for the cyclical nature of addiction or for the Groundhog Day sameness of life under lockdown, Russian Doll makes an argument for human connection and kindness that feels more powerful now than ever.

Daytime Emmys back on TV, but with socially distanced show</p>
<p>Chris Pizzello / AP</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — The Daytime Emmy Awards are skipping a theater ceremony because of the coronavirus but the honors will be presented on a TV broadcast.</p>
<p>CBS&rsquo; decision to air the awards on June 26 is a bright spot for the daytime honors, which had been consigned to an online presentation in recent years as viewer interest dwindled.</p>
<p>Nominations for the 47th annual Daytime Emmys are to be announced Thursday on CBS&rsquo; “The Talk,” with categories including best drama series, talk show and game show.</p>
<p>The New York-based National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, which organizes the daytime awards, had previously announced it wouldn&rsquo;t hold the traditional theater ceremony out of pandemic safety concerns.</p>
<p>Awards will be presented on the CBS broadcast in leading categories, with winners and “other special guests appearing from home in light of the COVID-19 pandemic,” the network and academy said in a joint announcement.</p>
<p>Winners in other categories will be announced on Twitter during the two-hour telecast, with more awards to be presented in a July ceremony, the academy said.</p>
<p>CBS is “thrilled to welcome back the Daytime Emmy Awards,” said Jack Sussman, the network&rsquo;s executive vice president in charge of specials and live events. The network is the home of daytime shows including soap operas “The Young and the Restless” and “The Bold and the Beautiful.”

<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/05/18/PREN/5f4e523d-ffae-4e69-b290-072c58755c78-Screen_Shot_2020-05-18_at_10.51.51_AM.png?crop=1635,920,x78,y0&amp;width=1635&amp;height=920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
LAS VEGAS – As resorts prepare to reopen in the era of the coronavirus pandemic, tourism authorities here are pitching a &ldquo;new Vegas for the new reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority and R&amp;R Partners – the advertising company behind the &ldquo;What happens here&rdquo; campaign – launched a new 30-second television spot, reports the Reno Gazette Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world has changed,&rdquo; a narrator says, &ldquo;and Vegas is changing with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ad is a response to the post-pandemic Las Vegas landscape – one that shut down in March to stem the spread of COVID-19, leaving thousands out of work and resorts scrambling to develop reopening plans.</p>
<p>The new campaign is called “Reimagined” and offers a toned-down glimpse of Las Vegas tourism, focusing on outdoor recreation and intimate settings. One shot shows a man and woman in a warm bar conversation, a glass of wine separating them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things will be a little different when we open again – at least for a while,&rdquo; the narrator says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re working to make it more intimate, with more space and the excitement you&rsquo;ve come to expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new Las Vegas ad comes four months after tourism authorities unveiled the destination&rsquo;s new slogan: &ldquo;What happens here, only happens here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Las Vegas resorts prepare to reopen</p>
<p>In the aftermath of COVID-19, the casino experience in Las Vegas and greater Nevada will look a much different.</p>
<p>The Nevada Gaming Commission recently approved the Gaming Control Board&rsquo;s reopening policies, laying out what more than 400 large and small casinos need to do when shutdown orders are lifted.</p>
<p>Occupancy limits in gaming areas will be cut in half. Tourists will see chairs and stools in front of every other gaming machine. Gathering in groups – one time a staple of the Las Vegas experience – will be prohibited.</p>
<p>Dealers will even offer card players a complimentary squirt of sanitizer between hands.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is still spreading in Nevada</p>
<p>As tourism authorities plot new ways to entice travelers to return, the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Nevada.</p>
<p>The number of Nevadan’s who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 increased to 6,906 on Monday, an increase of 49 new positive cases.</p>
<p>That rise is comparatively low to what the state has seen for nearly two months. The last time Nevada saw a lower single-day increase was March 24, when there were 43 new cases, according to a Reno Gazette Journal analysis of the numbers.</p>
<p>But Monday’s small increase is not necessarily a good sign.</p>
<p>While few people tested positive statewide, Nevada performed its smallest number of tests in several weeks – just 1,140. That figure is eclipsed by the 6,500 tests performed the day before.</p>
<p>With 49 positive residents out of a total of 1,140 tested, Nevada’s test positivity rate went up for the first time since May 2. That metric, which measures the proportion of people who test positive on a given day, increased from 8.5% to 8.6%.</p>
<p>The total number of Nevadans who’ve died from COVID-19 had not yet been updated on Monday and remains at 350.</p>

In this article, we will take a look at five of the best movies that were set in Vegas. With the rise in popularity of casino gaming and betting we’re also guaranteed to see even more movies about gambling. Especially the quite young industry of Novelty Betting might be a good starting point. With novelty bets you can bet on pretty much everything; politics, the ending of a TV-Show or even who will be the next James Bond. This for sure will offer great opportunities for more gambling-themed movies.</p>
<p>But let’s get back to casinos in particular. There have been lots of successful movies in recent decades, that we condensed to just the top-5 best Casino movies you have to know.</p>

Back at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Micky Rosa, a professor, challenges Campbell with the Monty Hall Problem, and he solved it successfully. Rosa invited Campbell to become a member of his blackjack team. Using covert signaling and card counting, the team increased their probability of winning in casinos, which led them to get substantial profits.

The film follows friends Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and Danny Ocean (Clooney) who plan to rob famous casinos: MGM Grand, Mirage, and Bellagio. Rusty and Danny recruit 8 criminal specialists and former colleagues. Several members of the team carry out a survey at the Bellagio Casino to get information about the behaviors of the staff, the routines, the security, and the building itself. While planning, the team learns that Tess, Danny’s wife, is Benedict’s girlfriend. As a result, Rusty urges Danny to quit the team, believing that he’s not capable of sound judgment when Tess is involved. However, Danny refuses.</p>

This will help them find their friend Doug who is due to marry Tracy. The trio used clues to retrace their steps and went to a hospital. Here, they discovered that someone drugged them with roofies or Rohypnol, which resulted in their memory loss. From the hospital, they went to a chapel, where Stu married Jade, a stripper. Outside the chapel, gangsters attacked the trio. They flee and managed to track Jade. The police then arrested them for stealing a police cruiser. The three friends were released after unknowingly accepting to act as targets for a taser demonstration.
