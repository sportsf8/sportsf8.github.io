<h3 id="alexandra-david-néel-the-first-western-woman-to-enter-lhasa-tibet">&ldquo;Alexandra David-Néel, the first western woman to enter Lhasa, Tibet&rdquo;</h3>

The scholar and opera singer who sneaked into Tibet in the 1920s was also an anarchist, ran a casino and adopted a Buddhist monk</p>
<p>Place and date of birth Paris, 24 October 1868</p>
<p>Claim to fame</p>
<p>Undoubtedly most famous for being the first European woman to visit Lhasa in Tibet, Alexandra David-Néel was also a runaway, an anarchist, an opera singer, a Buddhist scholar, a pioneering traveller and a prolific author. Her extraordinary life lasted more than a century. One of her earliest memories was the bloody aftermath of the Paris Commune in 1871; she died just a few weeks after Jimi Hendrix played Woodstock, living long enough to see her unconventional personal philosophy – “No commandments! Live your life! Live your instinct!” – enter the cultural bloodstream of the west in the 1960s.</p>
<p>Almost as a side note, she helped run a casino in Tunis, sang at the Hanoi opera house and studied Buddhist texts at the British Museum. In middle age, she married a wealthy Frenchman, Philippe Néel de Saint-Sauveur, whom she promptly abandoned to spend 14 years travelling around India, Tibet, China, Nepal, Korea, Mongolia and Japan. In Tibet, she met a 14-year-old monk called Aphur Yongden, whom she adopted in 1929. He was her companion for 40 years.</p>

<p>Supporting documentation</p>
<p>David-Néel wrote anarchist pamphlets, travelogues and scholarly studies of Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism and her own translations of Tibetan scripture. Her most famous work, My Journey to Lhasa, recounts her visit to the Tibetan capital in 1924 – at a time when it was closed to outsiders. In order to sneak in, she had to disguise herself as a Tibetan, lengthening her hair with a yak’s tail and dying it black.</p>

<h3 id="family-of-chinese-national-who-died-did-not-know-he-had-covid-19">&ldquo;Family of Chinese national who died did not know he had Covid-19&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/06/10/st_20200610_cwworker10aid5_5729493.jpg?itok=XfSji5bN" alt="img">
Every day, foreign worker Wu Liyou would make a video call to Feidong county in China&rsquo;s Anhui province to chat with his family.</p>
<p>But last Thursday, there was no call from the 41-year-old Chinese national for the first time since April.</p>
<p>Instead, his employer called Mr Wu&rsquo;s family to tell them that he had died.</p>
<p>They were stunned, left speechless with grief and in disbelief, as he did not tell them he had been infected by the coronavirus, nor did they see any hint that he was ill.</p>
<p>Mr Wu, who had worked in Singapore for the past 10 years, became the youngest person on the island to succumb to Covid-19 last Thursday.</p>
<p>He died of complications two weeks after he was discharged, and was cremated yesterday evening. The coroner certified the cause of death as a massive pulmonary thromboembolism following the Covid-19 infection.</p>
<p>Mr Wu&rsquo;s son Wu Feixiang told The Straits Times over the phone from China that his father had looked healthy in all their video conversations, and never mentioned having any health problems.</p>
<p>The family knew there was widespread infection in the foreign worker dormitory where Mr Wu stayed, said the 22-year-old.</p>
<p>But his father, he added, did not tell them he had Covid-19, but said that he had been moved to various locations, including a cruise ship, for quarantine purposes.</p>
<p>When they last spoke to him last Wednesday, he was on the cruise ship and appeared well, even asking after another family member in China who was sick, said his son.</p>
<p>Risk of blood clots forming in recovered Covid-19 patients, experts warn</p>
<p>Medical experts have warned about the risk of thrombosis - the formation of blood clots - in Covid-19 patients even after they have recovered from the disease. Mr Wu Liyou, a 41-year-old Chinese national who recovered from Covid-19, died last Thursday after a blood clot entered his lung. He became the youngest person to die from the disease in Singapore. Research into the exact link between Covid-19 and thromboembolism - the blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot that has formed and travelled from another part of the body - is still ongoing, but early studies have shown an association between the two. Scientific journal Nature reported last month that studies from France and the Netherlands found that clots might occur in 20 per cent to 30 per cent of critically ill Covid-19 patients. Experts said doctors in Singapore could turn to laboratory markers to assess critically ill Covid-19 patients for a more severe disease associated with clots. Doctors could turn to blood thinning medication for patients deemed to be at high risk to prevent clots. Imaging studies could also be done if a clot is suspected.</p>
<p>The following day, the younger man was told that his father had collapsed suddenly on the cruise ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was very healthy when he left China, but now he is coming home in an urn,&rdquo; said Mr Wu Feixiang, who is the older of two sons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother has been in a daze for the past few days, none of us can believe it,&rdquo; he said, adding that his grandparents had not been told that their son was dead.</p>
<p>The family are afraid the elderly couple would not be able to accept the news, as they are in their 70s and have a host of medical problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no greater tragedy than to have parents &lsquo;send off&rsquo; their child,&rdquo; Mr Wu Feixiang said, quoting a Chinese saying.</p>
<p>He is also worried about the family&rsquo;s finances as his father had taken care of most of their expenses and was paying off some debts.</p>
<p>His mother Wang Shengqun had undergone surgery to remove a tumour in her uterus, and the family had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. His younger brother, who is 12, is still in school, he said.</p>
<p>His father scrimped and saved most of his salary as a metal worker, and sent home around $2,000 every month to pay their bills, he added.</p>
<p>Now, he will have to take over these responsibilities with his pay as a hairstylist.</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s employer said it will give a small sum to the family to help tide them over this period, he added.</p>
<p>The employer declined to be interviewed but said it is working with the Migrant Workers&rsquo; Centre to help the family.</p>
<p>Separately, a group of Chinese nationals here is raising funds for the late Mr Wu&rsquo;s family. The informal group is led by senior engineer Xiong Gang, 47, and it is also helping the family of the 51-year-old Chinese migrant worker who died here of Covid-19 on May 31.</p>
<p>NO CHANCE TO SAY GOODBYE I have always thought that my father would retire and rest at home when we are all grown up. But now, he can no longer watch us grow, witness our graduation ceremonies and our weddings, or even carry his grandchildren. We didn&rsquo;t even have the chance to say goodbye to him. MR WU FEIXIANG, 22, the elder of two sons, on his father Wu Liyou.</p>
<p>Mr Wu Feixiang said his family&rsquo;s priority is to ensure his father&rsquo;s ashes are laid to rest in their home town in Anhui. They are waiting for the ashes to arrive as flights are infrequent, he said.</p>
<p>In the 10 years that his father worked in Singapore, he returned home only once every one or two years, said his son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always thought that my father would retire and rest at home when we are all grown up,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, he can no longer watch us grow, witness our graduation ceremonies and our weddings, or even carry his grandchildren,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even have the chance to say goodbye to him.&rdquo;

<h3 id="this-week-the-world-lost-ravi-zacharias-a-look-inside-his-life">&ldquo;This week, the world lost Ravi Zacharias: A look inside his life&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ksat.com/resizer/19WeoWwzr239LXI-Uhgu3RoqkZM=/1600x1066/smart/filters:format(jpeg):strip_exif(true):strip_icc(true):no_upscale(true):quality(65)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/RIBPQG3SINHNBIPLC4J55W6UC4.jpg" alt="img">
This week was a sad one for Christians around the world, as advocate, author and apologist Ravi Zacharias died Tuesday of sarcoma.</p>
<p>Zacharias was 74. He died at his home in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Millions around the world are mourning Zacharias, a native of India who moved to North America and obtained citizenship in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>He was one of the world’s most influential Christian authors, one of several reasons why he had such a following in the worldwide Christian community.</p>
<p>Here are notable facts about the life of Zacharias:</p>
<p>He was an atheist until a suicide attempt changed his life.</p>
<p>When he 17 years old, Zacharias was an atheist who didn’t take school or life very seriously. He attempted suicide by swallowing poison, but he survived, and his life completely changed while at an Indian hospital, according to the Ravi Zacharias International Ministries website.</p>
<p>It was there that he was introduced to the Bible and John 14:19, with the words “Because I will live, you will also live,” touching Zacharias so much that he committed his life to Jesus.</p>
<p>At age 19, Zacharias won a preaching contest, and his life in ministry was off to a flying start.</p>
<p>He made it his life mission to confront skeptics peacefully.</p>
<p>The basis of Zacharias’ ministry was to be a Christian apologetic, which meant defending Christianity and its principles among questions from skeptics.</p>
<p>In 1983, while speaking at a Billy Graham Evangelistic Association conference in Amsterdam, Zacharias felt a call toward apologetic ministry because it was an area of the faith that was lacking.</p>
<p>Through grace, respect, clarity and an intellectual philosophy, Zacharias gave countless speeches and wrote numerous books answering key objections and questions about the origin, meaning and morality of Christianity.</p>
<p>In 2004, Zacharias helped start the Oxford Centre for Christian Apologetics at Oxford University in England.</p>
<p>He was a sought-after author and speaker.</p>
<p>Zacharias wrote 28 books and was a requested speaker around the world.</p>
<p>He spent the summer of 1971 speaking to American troops in Vietnam.</p>
<p>At one point in Vietnam, the car Zacharias was traveling in broke down.</p>
<p>One passing Jeep refused to help, but Zacharias and his traveling partner ultimately got the car to start, according to his obituary.</p>
<p>A short time later, Zacharias discovered the Jeep that passed by riddled with bullets and all four people inside dead, the obituary says.</p>
<p>In 1992, Zacharias was invited to speak in the Soviet Union at the Lenin Military Academy, and in 1993, he spoke to judiciary members in Colombia.</p>
<p>Zacharias also spoke at events in the United Arab Emirates, the Philippines and Bethlehem Bible College in Palestine, as well as universities around the country.</p>
<p>He also was invited to speak by the United Nations on four different occasions in the 21st century and had a radio show called “Let My People Think,” which is syndicated to more than 2,000 stations in 32 countries.</p>
<p>His organization impacted millions around the world.</p>
<p>In 1984, Zacharias founded Ravi Zacharias International Ministries, with the mission of “helping the thinker believe and the believer think.”</p>
<p>Based in Atlanta, the worldwide organization has offices in the U.S., Canada, Peru, the United Kingdom, Romania, Turkey, South Africa, Singapore and India, and works with 100 speakers and 250 employees.</p>
<p>The organization trains new leaders and attempts to educate the public through books, studies, biblical resources, publications, podcasts and TV and radio programs.</p>
<p>The organization also offers humanitarian support.</p>
<p>Tweets from around the world pay tribute.</p>
<p>Celebrities, politicians and church leaders around the world paid tribute to Zacharias this week on Twitter. Here are a few examples.</p>
<p>Tim Tebow</p>
<p>To my friend, my mentor and a great hero of the faith @RaviZacharias — Thank you.</p>
<p>I know I’ll see you again and I look forward to that day. Love you brother! — Tim Tebow (@TimTebow) May 19, 2020</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence</p>
<p>Upon the death of Abner, the Bible tells us David said “do you not know that a prince &amp; a great man has fallen today?” Ravi was such a man &amp; he will be missed. Karen &amp; I send our deepest sympathies to his family and know he heard “Well done good and faithful servant.” pic.twitter.com/x8Bsor8OUv — Mike Pence (@Mike_Pence) May 19, 2020</p>
<p>Franklin Graham</p>
<p>Don’t feel sorry for @RaviZacharias–his fight w/cancer is over, &amp; he has placed his crowns at the feet of the One who deserves all glory &amp; honor. For those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ, we will see him again on the other side of the river. — Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) May 19, 2020</p>
<p>David Crowder (singer)</p>
<p>Today heaven rejoices &amp; welcomes home a giant of the faith. Today we miss &amp; mourn the loss of a friend &amp; a teacher.</p>
<p>“When you come to a religion, you come to a place. When you come to Jesus, you come to a person.” @RaviZacharias</p>
<p>Today Ravi meets Jesus in person. That’s amazing pic.twitter.com/nilHO0EUzQ — David Crowder</p>
<p>South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley</p>
<p>Rest In Peace to a man who has given so much to so many. You will be missed. Prayers for the family, friends, and followers of @RaviZacharias. We are all better for knowing you. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/4KROHGSpwN — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) May 19, 2020</p>

<h3 id="indian-elephant-dies-after-eating-fruit-packed-with-firecracker-police-investigating">&ldquo;Indian elephant dies after eating fruit packed with firecracker, police investigating&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/06/03/ym-elephanty-030620.jpg?itok=bLs3F-6R" alt="img">
KOCHI (REUTERS) - A pregnant elephant died in India apparently after eating some fruit containing a firecracker that exploded in her mouth, prompting a criminal investigation into suspected cruelty towards animals, forestry officials said on Wednesday (June 3).</p>
<p>The incident drew outrage on social media after a forestry officer, Mr Mohan Krishnan, posted an emotional apology to the elephant last Saturday in which he said the animal died from eating a pineapple or another fruit stuffed with a firecracker.</p>
<p>Forestry officials said the incident happened on May 23 in the Palakkad district of Kerala state in southern India, near farmland where locals sometimes scatter fruit spiked with firecrackers to discourage animals from damaging crops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only know that the injury (to the elephant) was caused by some explosive substance,&rdquo; forestry official Sunil Kumar said. The perpetrators, he said, could face animal cruelty charges that could bring fines or even a jail term.</p>
<p>India has the world&rsquo;s largest population of the Asiatic elephant but they are classified as an endangered species.</p>
<p>Incidents of human-animal conflict are not uncommon, as elephants often stray into human settlements hunting for food.</p>
<p>The pregnant elephant had wandered out of the local Silent Valley National Park in search of food when the incident occurred, forestry officials said.</p>
<p>They later found the elephant trying to cool herself in a stream but as locals tried to heave it out of the water to take it to a treatment centre, the animal collapsed and died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry sister,&rdquo; Mr Krishnan, who witnessed the elephant&rsquo;s death, wrote in a Facebook post. &ldquo;With her mouth and tongue destroyed in the explosion, she paced around hungry without being able to eat. She must have been more worried about the health of the child inside her than about her own hunger.&rdquo;
