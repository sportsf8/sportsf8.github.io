<p>Watch Now: We Need to Talk: Matt Rhule on coaching the Panthers during a pandemic ( 3:37 )</p>
<p>The Carolina Panthers may have hired a new, first-year head coach this offseason, but there are not many reasons to be excited heading into 2020. Carolina orchestrated a messy breakup with longtime quarterback Cam Newton, ditched tight end Greg Olsen and then star linebacker Luke Kuechly moved from on-field talent to talent scout. The Panthers have one of the lowest win totals of any NFL team entering this season, as William Hill Sports Book currently has the over/under listed at 5.5. While it&rsquo;s clear Carolina is entering somewhat of a rebuild, safety Tre Boston believes that the Panthers hired the right coach to get them back on track.</p>
<p>Boston says that Rhule has already made an excellent impression on the players despite the unprecedented virtual offseason, and he told Ian Rapoport of the Rapsheet + Friends podcast that Rhule has what it takes to fast-track the Panthers&rsquo; rebuild and get this franchise back into the win column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this guy has an edge to him. I think he has a certain &lsquo;it&rsquo; that coaches have to have,&rdquo; Boston said, via NFL.com. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to see him more in person with the guys, because right now, I think he started with a nice lead because he has a nice momentum going in between how he&rsquo;s treated us, how he&rsquo;s respected us, how he respects our time. That means a lot to professionals and men, adults, as well. So, I think Rhule has set himself up for success with his men. We trust him. We believe in him. And when we get together, it&rsquo;s all about building chemistry and knowing that we are the Carolina Panthers and we&rsquo;re gonna do what it takes to win ballgames around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhule impressed in his introductory press conference &ndash; talking about how he will build a hard-working team and surround that team with a staff that loves football to encourage an atmosphere where players will want to be the best at whatever they do. He established himself as a bit of a problem-fixer in college football over the past few years. Rhule took a two-win Temple team to two-straight 10-win seasons and then took a one-win Baylor team to the Sugar Bowl in just two years time. Panthers general manager Marty Hurney is hoping Rhule can bring that reputation for orchestrating a quick turnaround to the next level.</p>
<p>Boston is also excited to be playing for who he considers to be a &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; off the field. While some of the moves this new staff pulled off early in the offseason were questionable, Rhule has been putting in work behind the scenes to create relationships with his new players.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s a good guy,&rdquo; Boston said. &ldquo;Before you&rsquo;re ever a coach and Xs and Os, I want to know the type of guy you are as a human being. Type of guy you are as a man around your family. The type of husband you are. From what I&rsquo;ve seen, he&rsquo;s a great guy. A loving father. A great husband. The way he speaks to his men. The way he is about his details. The way he gets the guys rallying and gets them going. And we might just be on Zoom and little stuff like that. To get guys pumped up over a video, that means a lot. That&rsquo;s who Rhule is.&rdquo;

<h3 id="will-muschamp-talks-south-carolina-handling-protests-pandemic">&ldquo;Will Muschamp talks South Carolina handling protests, pandemic&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/739/805/9805739.jpg?fit=bounds&amp;crop=1200:630,offset-y0.50&amp;width=1200&amp;height=630" alt="img">
Despite it being a unique college football offseason and a delayed start to spring and summer football activities, South Carolina is making their presence felt in the community. Head coach Will Muschamp is leading the charge.</p>
<p>Amid protests across the country and many dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, college football players are doing what they can to stay healthy, learn and help. Since most football workouts are voluntary as campuses begin to reopen, many are focusing on their off the field and classroom efforts.</p>
<p>Speaking with ESPNU Radio on Sirius XM, Muschamp detailed how his football team handled the peaceful protests and pandemic while preparing to get back on the field.</p>
<p>“I’m really proud of our team,” Muschamp said. “They&rsquo;ve handled the situation and we were able to get a lot of guys registered to vote last week which I was really proud of and how some guys have stepped up. We went to a peaceful protest here in Columia. I am really proud of our football team and how they handled that. Obviously the pandemic, we had the highest GPA in school history with our football team with a 3.6. So many guys handled the situation really well. That&rsquo;s part of growing up in life. That&rsquo;s part of being a man. You gotta be able to handle the situation and the cards you&rsquo;ve been dealt and do the best you can with it and I&rsquo;ve been proud of how they&rsquo;ve handled it.”</p>
<p>With the success of the field, it could very well translate to their on the field success. Muschamp is 26-25 in four years at South Carolina, going 4-8 last season, their first without a postseason appearance under the former Florida coach. Their best season came in 2017, when the Gamecocks finished 9-4 and were winners in the Outback Bowl.</p>
<p>Along with offensive coordinator Mike Bobo, Muschamp is excited for his quarterback room ahead of the 2020 season.</p>
<p>“Mike is really excited about that room, the talent level in that room, and the competition in that room,” Muschamp said. “Starting with Ryan (Hilinski), playing as a freshman (like he did last year) is hard. But playing the most difficult position to play on the field in our league and the schedule we play is really difficult. We didn’t do enough as a staff (to help him) and it’s my fault. We didn’t play well enough around him and didn’t give him enough help to be successful. We threw it 38 more times than anyone in our league through 12 games. That’s not a great recipe for a true freshman quarterback. I’m really excited about Ryan’s upside.</p>
<p>“Collin (Hill) has come in from Colorado State, who Coach Bobo had there. He’s a guy that has a lot of experience coming off of an injury. Jay is athletically a guy that gives us some different things. Luke is a freshman we are really excited about. He’s a low 4.5, high 4.4 guy that is probably one of the best athletes on the team.”

The Carolina Panthers have seen more roster turnover this year than any team in the NFL. Throw in a virtual offseason program and a new coaching staff and it’s more difficult to project who’s going to make the team in 2020 than any time in recent memory.</p>
<p>That said, let’s take a stab at it. Here is our first early prediction at who will make the Panthers’ 53-man roster this season.</p>

<h3 id="online-originals-high-school-football-returns-to-eastern-north-carolina">&ldquo;Online Originals: High School football returns to eastern North Carolina&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.wnct.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2020/06/IMG_8316-1.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
PITT COUNTY, N.C. (WNCT) High School athletes are back on the field this week after their long coronavirus break.</p>
<p>Training programs began on Monday for high school football players with many changes because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Unlike regular practice and stuff, we are having to split kids up in pods. We have been inside this week so we are using the big gym, the auxiliary gym, and the locker room,” said Todd Lipe, Ayden-Grifton Head Coach. “We are going from station to station and trying to do social distancing.”</p>
<p>High schools are finding new ways to get their players in shape while keeping them safe.</p>
<p>“Right now we are not allowed in the weight room. We have had to move our equipment outside,” said Will Bland, J.H. Rose Head Coach.</p>
<p>“Everything they touch we have to clean off,” said Lipe. “We are just trying to follow guidelines so that we can keep doing what we are doing.”</p>
<p>Despite the changes, local teams are all on the same page– united in learning, building and coping.</p>
<p>“We are all working through this together. We all want to get to see each other compete because we love sports,” said Nate Conner, D.H. Conley Head Coach. “I think it’s very positive and I think from a community perspective what’s good is there’s some hope in the future.”</p>
<p>Over at the Hollywood Crossroads, the D.H. Conley Vikings are one of the many eastern North Carolina teams embracing the grind.</p>
<p>“You know, the boys are looking great! We are very proud of how they’ve been doing. Their commitment level shows every day by doing what we need them to do,” said Conner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, first-year head coach, Will Bland, is ready to lead the J.H. Rose Rampants.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to getting back on the field and showing that Rose football is back! We’ve got some really, really talented kids,” added Bland.</p>
<p>The Ayden-Grifton Chargers on the other hand, seek to keep the tradition growing.</p>
<p>“I’m excited about this year and the opportunity with the kids we’ve got,” said Lipe. “We’ve got a good group of kids, a good mix of kids. Coach Cornwell had done a great job here building a tradition and we are just trying to keep it going.”</p>
<p>While each team continues to work quietly, the sports world knows the competition, and the countdown is on.</p>
<p>“Let’s get ready for some football! It’s about time and I think we need it. I think everybody is waiting for us so we can get everything back to normal. We are ready to put our product on the field,” concluded Lipe.

<h3 id="sam-howell-will-have-more-of-a-breakout-year-than-last-year">&ldquo;Sam Howell will have &lsquo;more of a breakout year than last year&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/832/805/9805832.jpg?fit=bounds&amp;crop=1200:630,offset-y0.50&amp;width=1200&amp;height=630" alt="img">
Sam Howell exploded onto the scene last year during his freshman season at North Carolina. Head coach Mack Brown definitely took notice.</p>
<p>Brown returned to his head coaching position with the Tar Heels in 2019 after six seasons into retirement, post his tenure at Texas. In his first season back, Brown led the team to a 7-6 record and postseason victory. A key cog to that team: Howell.</p>
<p>Speaking with Fox College Football, featuring former college coaching and playing stars Urban Meyer, Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart, Brown explained what makes Howell so special and who he compares to in the NFL.</p>
<p>“I think he compares to, people have said Baker Mayfield because he&rsquo;s built more like Baker,” Brown said. “Colt McCoy was the most accurate quarterback I’ve ever seen. Against us in the National Championship game, you (Matt Leinart) hit 16 of 17 in the second half. Quarterbacks need to have good feet and have a good head, but they have to be accurate. If you can&rsquo;t complete all the balls against air, you&rsquo;re probably not going to be very good. Sam competes, he&rsquo;s very smart, he&rsquo;s a team leader, he works as hard as anyone on the team, so they follow him. But he&rsquo;s so accurate. He can throw all the balls. He has touch, he has zip. He can throw the long ball and I think that&rsquo;s what makes him so special. We didn&rsquo;t have a backup for him last year with experience so he couldn&rsquo;t run. He can run. He&rsquo;s not a great runner, he&rsquo;s a good runner, an adequate runner.</p>
<p>“I really think instead of a sophomore slump, he&rsquo;s going to be much better this year because we’ll have a better team. we have everyone back on offense, he’ll have better protection, we’ll do a better job coaching&hellip;so I really think Sam Howell has more of a breakout this year than he did last year.”</p>
<p>As a freshman, Howell played in all 13 games and finished the season with 3,641 yards, 38 touchdowns, seven interceptions and a 61.4 percent completion percentage. He was named the 2019 ACC Rookie of the Year and named to the USA Today freshman All-American team.</p>
<p>Anthony Treash of Pro Football Focus singled out five college football programs on the rise entering the upcoming season, naming North Carolina as one of those ready to take a big leap in 2020.</p>
<p>“Howell had one of the best true freshman seasons of the PFF College era (2014 – present),” Treash wrote. &ldquo;And while he could certainly improve his decision-making and poise under pressure, he showed that he could do some serious damage downfield with his arm. Howell earned the second-highest-grade among quarterbacks in college football last year when throwing 20-plus yards downfield from a clean pocket, and he threw 15 touchdowns of 30-plus air yards over the course of the season — five more than any other quarterback in college football.”</p>
<p>As a member of the Class of 2019, Howell was a four-star prospect according to the 247Sports composite. He was the No. 2 overall prospect in the state of North Carolina, the No. 3 dual QB prospect in the country and the No. 93 overall prospect in the country.

<h3 id="aunt-jemima-brand-retired-by-quaker-due-to-racial-stereotype">&ldquo;Aunt Jemima brand retired by Quaker due to racial stereotype&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://stmedia.stimg.co/1592399790_17382801+1jemima061820.jpg?h=630&amp;w=1200&amp;fit=crop&amp;bg=999&amp;crop=faces" alt="img">
NEW YORK — America’s painful struggles over racism have finally caught up with Aunt Jemima, that ubiquitous fixture served up at breakfast tables for 131 years.</p>
<p>Quaker Oats announced Wednesday that it will retire the Aunt Jemima brand, saying the company recognizes the character’s origins are “based on a racial stereotype.” Indeed, the logo was inspired by 19th century minstrel celebrating the “mammy,” a black woman content to serve her white masters. A former slave, Nancy Green, became the first face of the pancake product in 1890.</p>
<p>Aunt Jemima&rsquo;s downfall is the latest signal of the powerful cultural moment unleashed by the Black Lives Matter protests, which have spread around the world and prompted companies to rethink their policies, from hiring practices to giving employees off for Juneteenth, the anniversary of the end of the slavery in the U.S.</p>
<p>Other companies said they are reconsidering racial imagery in their branding.</p>
<p>The owner of the Uncle Ben’s rice says the brand will “evolve” in response to concerns about racial stereotyping. Caroline Sherman, a spokeswoman for parent company Mars, said the company is listening to the voices of consumers, especially in the black community.</p>
<p>Geechie Boy Mill, a family-owned operation in South Carolina that makes locally-grown and milled white grits, said it is “listening and revising our overall branding,&rdquo; though no decisions have been made. Geechie is a dialect spoken mainly by the descendants of African-American slaves who settled on the Ogeechee river in Georgia, according to Merriam-Webster.com. In a statement to The Associated Press, the company said a name change has been under consideration for the past year and discussions have ramped back up given the current climate.</p>
<p>A bottle of Aunt Jemima syrup sits on a counter, Wednesday, June 17, 2020 in White Plains, N.Y. Pepsico is changing the name and marketing image of its Aunt Jemima pancake mix and syrup, according to media reports. A spokeswoman for Pepsico-owned Quaker Oats Company told AdWeek that it recognized Aunt Jemima’s origins are based on a racial stereotype and that the 131-year-old name and image would be replaced on products and advertising by the fourth quarter of 2020.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Land O’Lakes announced that it would no longer use the Native American woman on its packages of butter, cheese and other products since the late 1920s.</p>
<p>But reconsideration of the images also raises questions about why they have endured for so long in the first place, beyond the Civil Rights movement and ensuing decades of protests against discrimination and violence against African-Americans. Brands with ethnic and racial stereotypes still abound, from Nestle’s Eskimo Pie and Miss Chiquita of banana fame, to the ongoing debate over the Washington Redskins football team.</p>
<p>Riché Richardson, an associate professor of African American literature at Cornell University, called for Aunt Jemima&rsquo;s retirement five years ago in a New York Times opinion piece — part of a wider discussion about Confederate statues and other imagery after the massacre of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
<p>Richardson said Aunt Jemima epitomizes the dark comfort that some Americans take from imagery of black servitude, so normalized that it&rsquo;s on their box of pancake mix. She said it was problematic that Aunt Jemima is such a ubiquitous symbol of black femininity when there are so many real women who are icons of African American history.</p>
<p>“The question becomes, ‘do we want to hold onto images that hearken back to a past when blacks were servants and expected to know their place?’” Richardson said. “People who are holding onto these symbols are almost suggesting that those are times they are nostalgic about. I don&rsquo;t think people intend to send that message but at this time, we cannot afford to send mix messages.”</p>
<p>Quaker, which is owned by PepsiCo, said its overhauled pancake mix and syrup will hit shelves by the fourth quarter of 2020. The company will announce the new name at a later date. PepsiCo also announced a five-year, $400 million initiative “to lift up black communities and increase black representation at PepsiCo.”</p>
<p>“We recognize Aunt Jemima’s origins are based on a racial stereotype,&rdquo; said Kristin Kroepfl of Quaker Foods North America. &ldquo;While work has been done over the years to update the brand in a manner intended to be appropriate and respectful, we realize those changes are not enough.”</p>
<p>Quaker tried over the years to purge Aunt Jemima of her “mammy” roots, exchanging her kerchief for pearls by 1989. Still, the image was of eager domesticity and her name could not be dissociated from its racist origins.</p>
<p>Aunt Jemima’s years of success as a marketing image made it risky for the company to part with it completely, said Brenda Lee, founding director of the marketing research firm Vision Strategy and Insights.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge deal. They’ve invested quite a bit in establishing that brand with all that goes along with the logo,” Lee said. “The calling to make this change has been around for years and the most they had been willing to do was update her looks, but they were not willing to relinquish the name.”</p>
<p>Lee said the risk calculation for companies is quickly changing, in part because of the Black Lives Matter movement’s effort to draw attention to where black dollars are spent.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the singer Kirby posted a TikTok video called “How to Make a Non Racist Breakfast” explaining some of the backstory of the Aunt Jemima brand. That video went viral.</p>

<h3 id="unc-football-senior-linebacker-chazz-surratt-earns-first-team-all-american-honors">&ldquo;UNC Football: Senior linebacker Chazz Surratt earns First-Team All-American honors&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNp0we5a3iRiaiYK1qApvlMckD8=/0x0:2667x1396/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20038660/usa_today_13841494.jpg" alt="img">
Raise your hand if you thought that when freshman quarterback Chazz Surratt started his UNC career he would be a First-Team All-American by the time he was a senior. If your hand is up, lower your hand because there is a good chance you are lying. No offense to him, as there were many (systemic) reasons to have thought that it wasn’t possible, but now the senior linebacker version of Chazz Surratt has achieved such an accomplishment.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was announced that Surratt is a Street &amp; Smith’s First-Team All-American.</p>

<p>Big things ahead for Chazz Surratt. #CarolinaFootball #BeTheOne pic.twitter.com/ApEXDs6LqD — Carolina Football (@TarHeelFootball) June 16, 2020</p>
<p>This honor was bestowed upon Surratt following his fantastic first season for the Tar Heels as a linebacker. He finished the season with a team-leading 115 tackles, 66 solo tackles, 49 assisted tackles, 6.5 sacks, a forced fumble, and an interception. This is all after he spent his freshman and sophomore seasons as a quarterback during the Larry Fedora era, with the sophomore year more or less being a wash thanks to an injury he sustained earlier in the season. When Mack Brown returned to UNC, the decision was made to have Surratt play on the other side of the ball altogether. It may have been the best decision of his life, as it is now very hard to see a path for him that doesn’t result in the NFL drafting him next spring.</p>
<p>It’s remarkable how the return of Brown has changed the conversation about Carolina Football, but it may be even more impressive how his return changed the way we talk about Surratt. It’s easy to say that he is the most exciting player returning to the roster, and if it weren’t for Sam Howell it’d be hard to argue that he also may be the most talented. His ability to disrupt opposing offenses has been remarkable so far, and one can only imagine what kind of havoc will ensue now that he has had another spring to perfect his craft. It’s unfortunate that we will only get two years of seeing him play in Jay Bateman’s defense, but I have no doubt that he will make this final season count.</p>
<p>What do you think of Surratt earning All-American honors? Do you think that there is still more preseason honors to come for him or other Tar Heels? let us know in the comments below.
