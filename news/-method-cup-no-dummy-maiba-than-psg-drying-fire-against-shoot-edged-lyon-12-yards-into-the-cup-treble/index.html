<p>周五法國聯賽盃上演決賽爭逐，上周捧起法國足總盃的巴黎聖日耳門鬥里昂。結果雙方經過法定時間90分鐘後未有進賬，加時30分鐘的尾段里昂雖然少打一人，但仍然保住0:0戰局，雖以互射12碼分勝負。然而，里昂前鋒貝查特查奧爾在突然死亡期間宴客，最終互射12碼以5:6不敵PSG，而PSG亦成功橫掃今季法國球壇的三大本土賽事冠軍。</p>
<p>兩軍在今仗過後亦需出戰歐聯賽事，PSG雖然有基利安麥巴比因傷缺陣，但尼馬、莫路伊卡迪，以及迪馬利亞等進攻主力繼續擔正；里昂方面則有傷癒復出的荷蘭國家迪比及莫沙迪比利合作攻堅。PSG早段已有入球機會，一次短角球配合，尼馬接應堤亞高施華回傳禁區外起腳，可惜僅僅柱邊出界。但其後雙方戰情膠着，只有伊迪沙古爾的遠射被里昂門將安東尼盧比斯撲出稍具睇頭，結果半場互交白卷。</p>
<p>易邊再戰雙方都加強攻力，里昂先有迪比的射門省中人後柱邊出界；PSG則有尼馬的罰球再被安東尼盧比斯撲出，最終雙方90分鐘後仍打成0:0進入加時。加時雖然PSG稍佔優勢，但依舊未能射破安東尼盧比斯的十指關，雖然尾段有拉菲爾被逐，但未有影響比數，比賽要以互射12碼分勝負。</p>
<p>雙方前五輪全部射入，但里昂的第6輪曾效力車路士的貝查特查奧爾射門被基羅拿華斯成功捉路撲出，其後PSG沙拿比亞射入，成功以6:5擊敗里昂，事隔一年再次捧走法聯盃，同時間再一次成為法國國內三冠王。

巴黎聖日耳門周二在5000人觀戰下友賽些路迪，結果以4:0大勝，這場比賽是球會慶祝成立50周年的活動之一。安巴比（Kylian Mbappe）在半場受訪時，為PSG球迷帶來喜訊：「我在這兒，在球會計劃部份的第4年。球會50周年對球會、球迷及所有人而言都是重要的，所以不論發生甚麼事，我都會在這兒。」 於2017年從摩納哥來投的他，矢言要為球隊帶來錦標，並展示自己最佳的一面。之前有傳包括皇家馬德里及利物浦在內的勁旅，有意向他招手。主帥杜查爾亦堅信安巴比會留隊：「他與我們有合約，會方沒準備出售他，他無比重要，是重心球員。與他共事是一大獎賞。」 說回這場友賽，安巴比為PSG先開紀錄，加上尼馬、安達靴里拉及沙拉比亞建功大勝，為球隊周五於法國盃決賽鬥聖伊天打下一針強心針。</p>

<p><img src="https://s.newtalk.tw/album/news/434/5f07ee81a6d92.jpg" alt="img">
《英雄聯盟》PSG Talon戰隊昨（9）晚宣布，中路選手Candy正式離隊，宣告他兩年半的旅台生涯告一段落。Candy僅表示自己離隊的原因是因為需要休息，並未詳細說明是否有其他原因導致自己決定離隊。</p>
<p>PSG《英雄聯盟》戰隊近日在PCS聯賽都讓另一名中路Tank上場，而非原先春季賽與季中盃的主力選手Candy，引起粉絲議論紛紛。昨晚PSG戰隊宣布，Candy已與戰隊達成協議解約，將正式離隊。Candy在離隊影片中僅簡短表示「自己需要休息一段時間」，打野選手River也表示「希望Candy哥回韓國後好好休息一下，明年希望再看到你。」不過並未說明Candy為何需要休息或是身體是否出現了什麼狀況。</p>
<p>今年24歲的Candy自2017年11月正式與GRX簽約開始，已經在LMS與PCS賽區出賽兩年半，也已經是粉絲們非常熟悉的韓援。Candy回國後是否會繼續挑戰職業，仍有待未來進一步觀察。

<h3 id="theres-a-great-confidence-in-the-team---sarabia-says-psg-are-ready-for-champions-league-after-securing-a-fourth-trophy">&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a great confidence in the team&rsquo; - Sarabia says PSG are ready for Champions League after securing a fourth trophy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a great confidence in the team&rsquo; - Sarabia says PSG are ready for Champions League after securing a fourth trophy</p>
<p>The club remains masters of French football, and they proved it again on Friday despite being taken to penalties by Lyon</p>
<p>Pablo Sarabia said would grow in confidence for their upcoming mission after sealing another clean sweep of French football.</p>
<p>The Spanish midfielder tucked away the decisive 12th penalty in a 6-5 shoot-out win over at the Stade de , following a disappointing goalless 120 minutes, in what was the last ever Coupe de la Ligue final.</p>
<p>PSG&rsquo;s victory meant they added to their Trophee des Champions, and Coupe de France triumphs, further underlining their domestic dominance.</p>
<p>Having now secured a historic domestic quadruple, Sarabia says that PSG&rsquo;s French achievements will only bode well for their European push as PSG prepare for their return to the Champions League.</p>
<p>They face a difficult test when the Champions League does resume, though, as PSG will take on in-form in their quarterfinal match.</p>
<p>Sarabia told Canal+ Sport: &ldquo;It was an especially difficult game. But it&rsquo;s true that we won four titles this season. It was important to give a good impression and show good rhythm before the Champions League.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This win will give us confidence. There&rsquo;s a great confidence in the team. Now we want to make sure we&rsquo;re physically ready for the game against Atalanta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That clash with the free-scoring Italians is the Champions League quarter-final game that will take place in Lisbon on August 12.</p>
<p>Atalanta have scored 28 goals in 12 matches since the restart, remaining unblemished while securing 30 points during that time period to make their mark as one of Europe&rsquo;s most in-form teams.</p>
<p>Sarabia&rsquo;s midfield colleague Marco Verratti said PSG would deservedly celebrate on Friday before turning their focus to Atalanta, as the team remains far from full strength as a return to European football looms.</p>
<p>Verratti told France 2: &ldquo;To play a 120-minute match, after a four-month hiatus &hellip; we suffered. It&rsquo;s nice to win at the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added, according to L&rsquo;Equipe: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to party and tomorrow we&rsquo;ll be thinking about another great match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked about Marquinhos and Thiago Silva who went off with physical complaints, Verratti said both were &ldquo;doing well&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had a bit of cramp,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Playing 120 minutes isn&rsquo;t easy, but it&rsquo;s nothing serious.&rdquo;

PSG beat St Etienne to win Coupe</p>
<p>‘WORRIED’: Paris Saint-Germain face an anxious wait over the fitness of Kylian Mbappe after the France star limped off in tears in the first half with an ankle injury</p>
<p>AFP, PARIS</p>
<p>Neymar scored the winning goal as Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) on Friday defeated 10-man AS Saint-Etienne 1-0 in the Coupe de France final, the first competitive fixture in the country since March 11 following the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>However, coach Thomas Tuchel faces an anxious wait over the fitness of Kylian Mbappe ahead of next month’s UEFA Champions League quarter-final against Atalanta BC after the France star limped off in tears during the first half with an ankle injury.</p>
<p>The UEFA World Cup winner was later seen emerging from the tunnel on crutches following a dreadful challenge that resulted in the dismissal of Saint-Etienne captain Loic Perrin.</p>

<p>“Everyone is worried. Everyone who saw the foul is worried. Of course I’m worried,” Tuchel said. “I’m very happy because we won, but we have to stay patient because we don’t have any news. I think he will undergo tests tonight.”</p>
<p>PSG secured the first of a potential three trophies this summer, claiming a record-extending 13th Coupe de France with the Coupe de la Ligue final against Olympique Lyonnais to come on Friday next week before the resumption of their European campaign in Portugal.</p>
<p>“It was very difficult, which is perhaps the best thing,” added Tuchel, whose side added to their league title awarded in April after the season was ended prematurely.</p>
<p>The final at the Stade de France was the first official match in one of Europe’s top soccer nations to allow fans to attend since March, albeit in severely restricted numbers with just 2,805 spectators — including French President Emmanuel Macron — inside the 80,000-seat venue.</p>
<p>A minute’s applause was held ahead of the start for the victims of COVID-19 and in support of frontline workers.</p>
<p>PSG had racked up 20 goals without reply in three friendlies building up to the final, but Yvann Macon’s crunching tackle on Neymar in the first minute suggested no such goodwill would be afforded by Saint-Etienne in their first Coupe de France final appearance since 1982.</p>
<p>The challenge set the tone for a fractious opening period and Denis Bouanga was inches from firing Saint-Etienne ahead when his strike rebounded back off Keylor Navas’ left-hand post.</p>
<p>Unfazed by that scare, PSG led on 14 minutes as Mbappe burst into the penalty box after an exchange with Angel Di Maria and Neymar crashed home the rebound via the underside of the crossbar after a fine save from Jessy Moulin.</p>
<p>Bouanga twice forced Navas to turn away, while Moulin produced a sensational one-handed stop to tip over from Di Maria, earning plaudits from the Argentine himself.</p>
<p>However, Saint-Etienne’s hopes of fighting back were hampered midway through the first half when Perrin — likely on his final appearance for the club — was sent off for a dreadful challenge on Mbappe.</p>
<p>He required lengthy treatment, but was forced off after his right ankle was trapped between the legs of Perrin, whose yellow card was upgraded to red following a video assistant referee review.</p>
<p>Emotions boiled over with five players booked in the aftermath following an ugly melee, but the greater concern for PSG is the severity of Mbappe’s injury.</p>
<p>The France star reappeared from the tunnel on crutches in the second half, with less than three weeks before PSG’s Champions League tie against Atalanta on Aug. 12.</p>
<p>Moulin kept Saint-Etienne in with a remote shot of ending their 43-year wait for a seventh Coupe de France title, repelling Mauro Icardi and Di Maria before spreading himself superbly to deny Pablo Sarabia.</p>
<p>The goalkeeper even raced forward for a late corner, but PSG held firm to atone for last year’s defeat in the final by Stade Rennais on penalties, clinching the trophy for the fifth time in the past six seasons.</p>
<p>“It’s really tough to take, especially like that. We had chances and we pushed them,” Moulin said. “There are things to be pleased about, but losing a final is always hard to digest.”

<h3 id="psg-coach-believes-french-league-cup-final-against-lyon-will-be-of-champions-league-standard">&ldquo;PSG coach believes French League Cup final against Lyon will be of ‘Champions League standard’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tuchel-e1595666547928.jpg" alt="img">
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) manager Thomas Tuchel has said that their French League Cup final against Lyon on Saturday will be a “top-level game” like the Champions League fixtures. Tuchel has asked his players to draw inspiration from their French Cup victory over Saint-Etienne last week.</p>
<p>“We’re going to choose the XI after tonight’s training session. We have a big challenge ahead of us tomorrow, it’ll be a top-level game, Champions League-standard. We won a big and difficult game last week, that’s good for the confidence and the atmosphere in the dressing room. A new challenge now awaits us. We have to prepare well, and that’s what we’ll do,” Tuchel said as quoted on the official website of PSG.</p>
<p>“We always want to have the ball. We try to play with intensity, to speed the game up, to press. It was a difficult choice to leave Marco Verratti on the bench last week, but Paredes and Gueye deserved to start the final. They worked well and found solutions in midfield. I have several options again for tomorrow,” he added.</p>
<p>However, on being asked if PSG will treat Saturday’s final against Lyon as a preparatory match for their Champions League contest against Atlanta next month, Tuchel denied saying that Lyon’s style of play is different from the Italian club.</p>
<p>“It is not possible to tactically prepare for Atalanta in a match against Lyon. I don’t know a team that plays like Atalanta. We can just work on our state of mind and show our hunger to win. This will prepare us from this point of view if we get a good result tomorrow,” the PSG boss said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tuchel expressed his hope of having Kylian Mbappe available for their match against Atlanta. But he admitted that the chances of Mbappe playing are slim and that it would be a “miracle” if he does.</p>
<p>Mbappe, the World Cup winner with France in 2018, had suffered a horrific injury during their tie against Saint-Etienne at the Stade de France last week. The 21-year-old had limped off the ground after Loic Perrin’s strong tackle had left him suffering in pain.</p>
<p>“This will have an important influence for us, but I hope that the solution will be found. “We still hope [he can play against Atalanta], but the chances will be very, very small. Every day counts to achieve a miracle, but tomorrow we will have to adapt without Kylian,” Tuchel said.

<h3 id="bahrain-buys-into-paris-fc-with-plans-to-use-it-as-a-billboard">&ldquo;Bahrain Buys Into Paris F.C., With Plans to Use It as a Billboard&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/sports/29soccer-paris1/29soccer-paris1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Team officials also left little doubt about Bahrain’s goal: As at P.S.G., the owners hope the soccer team will act as a billboard for the Gulf state, and attract tourists to a nation that is still reeling from the reputational damage it sustained when the country’s monarchy put down pro-democracy uprisings during the height of the Arab Spring.</p>
<p>“I think they saw a fantastic opportunity for investment, and Paris F.C. is a good tool of communication to promote the country,” Fabrice Herrault, the director general of the team, said in an interview. As part of the agreement in which Bahrain’s sovereign wealth fund took a 20 percent stake in the club, Paris F.C. will, starting next season, have the words “Explore Bahrain” emblazoned on its uniforms.</p>
<p>The National Communication Centre in Bahrain did not respond to requests for comment, sent through its embassy in the United Kingdom, about the kingdom’s investment in Paris F.C. or about claims by multiple groups and even its citizens that it has engaged in human rights abuses in crushing antigovernment protests.</p>
<p>By investing in soccer, Bahrain is following its Gulf neighbors down a well-trodden path. Qatar has owned P.S.G. since 2011, and the billionaire brother of the ruler of the United Arab Emirates has spent lavishly to assemble one of the best teams in the world at Manchester City in England. A Saudi Arabian prince owns another Premier League club, Sheffield United, and that kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund has bid to buy a third, Newcastle United. Gulf owners also control teams in Spain and Belgium.
