<p>For many, Monaco conjures up images of billionaires, super-yachts and casinos, not to mention its status as a tax-free haven for the super-rich. Yet its ruling family would like that to change, as seen in a new three-part documentary series starting on BBC Two tonight.</p>
<p>Inside Monaco has rare access to the House of Grimaldi, featuring interviews with Prince Albert II and his wife Princess Charlene, as well as offering a behind-the-scenes look at the Formula 1 Grand Prix, plus Monaco&rsquo;s glamorous casinos and hotels, including a new suite inspired by one of its most famous residents, Princess Grace.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Yet behind the fast cars and the playboy setting, Monaco has the oldest population in the world, with the 40,000 residents having an average age of 52. Some of the most famous include Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green (68), Walgreens share holder Stefano Pessina (79) and Sir David and Frederick Barclay, owners of The Telegraph (85).</p>

<p>This is something the principality is keen to change, with the newly launched Monaco Influencer Awards hoping to attract bright young things (with money) to the glamorous Cote d&rsquo;Azur location.</p>
<p>It is the brainchild of Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a close friend of Prince Albert, who married Prince Charles of Bourbon in a glittering ceremony in Monaco in 1998.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I moved to Monaco about 25 years ago, I can remember there was a lot of — how can I say — elderly people,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;It would be a disaster to stay a place where only elderly people come and retire. We don’t want that, we want Monaco to be the glamorous place, the diamond place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of Monaco&rsquo;s famous paparazzi ban, she says that the youth now are more comfortable with taking photographs, &lsquo;Royalty often grows up saying you should not take pictures. We have a different approach to everything that has to have social media. Tonight we are posting everywhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the documentary, Prince Albert opens up about life as a royal, saying: &lsquo;I can’t say that every day is wonderful bliss and enjoyment. It’s not easy for anybody in a position of responsibility. There are some very unpleasant meetings. I try to think what nice things will come after my meetings are over&hellip; having a nice glass of wine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He also talks about his parents. Of his father, Prince Rainier III, he says, &lsquo;We did behave when we knew that he was watching. He had ways of raising his voice that was impressive for a six, seven, eight, nine or ten-year-old. Even at 21.&rsquo; And of his mother, Princess Grace, &lsquo;It’s just incredible that so many years after her passing she still very much has a vivid presence in a lot of people’s minds and hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the documentary crew are given a sneak peek at a new £35,000-a-night hotel suite at the Hôtel de Paris which was inspired by Grace Kelly, with the design overseen by Albert himself.</p>

<h3 id="alberto-de-mónaco-recuerda-a-sus-padres-grace-kelly-era-más-tolerante-que-rainiero-que-tenía-formas-de-alzar-la-voz-que-impresionaban">&ldquo;Alberto de Mónaco recuerda a sus padres: Grace Kelly era &lsquo;más tolerante&rsquo; que Rainiero, que &lsquo;tenía formas de alzar la voz que impresionaban&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://aws.revistavanityfair.es/prod/designs/v1/assets/1200x630/214398.jpg" alt="img">
Grace Kelly es parte de la historia del cine, de la época dorada de Hollywood, esa actriz que dejó su carrera para ser princesa de Mónaco y convertirse en recurrente icono de estilo, glamour y belleza. A su hijo, Alberto de Mónaco, le sorprende que siga tan presente 38 después de su muerte en un trágico accidente de tráfico: “Es increíble que tantos años después de su fallecimiento todavía tenga una presencia vívida en la mente y el corazón de muchas personas”. Era una madre “más tolerante”, ha dicho, que Rainiero de Mónaco como padre. “Nos portábamos bien cuando sabíamos que nos estaba mirando. Tenía formas de alzar la voz que impresionaban a un niño de seis, siete, ocho, nueve o diez años. Incluso a los 21…”, recuerda el príncipe Alberto que aún tiene muy presente cuando su padre le habló sobre el trabajo de ser príncipe y le dijo: &lsquo;Estarás solo en esa habitación y tienes que estar preparado para ello psicológica y emocionalmente&rsquo;.</p>
<p>La vida no siempre es fácil para un royal, ni siquiera para el gobernante del este pequeño país de millonarios donde él no es una excepción (aunque se ha bajado significativamente el sueldo, se le queda en 8 millones de euros): &ldquo;No hay suficiente espacio para la espontaneidad, incluso la espontaneidad tiene que ser programada&rdquo;, se lamenta Alberto que tampoco puede decir que &ldquo;todos los días sean una maravillosa dicha y disfrute&rdquo;. La responsabilidad a veces conlleva ciertas situaciones complicadas (“hay algunas reuniones muy desagradables”, confiesa), que trata de sobrellevar pensando en la “buena copa de vino” de la que disfrutar cuando todo pase.

<h3 id="influencer-awards-monaco-2019-digital-oscars-for-influencers">&ldquo;Influencer Awards Monaco 2019: «digital Oscars» for influencers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomonaco.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Skiss-1134.jpg" alt="img">
Influencers are a 21st century phenomenon that even the world’s largest brands don’t dare to ignore today. Having built their images within social networks, these young and successful representatives of the «digital generation» have achieved recognition from their followers by the millions. Today the label of being a «Celebrity» is not only reserved to Hollywood’s rich and famous but has transcended to being «Instafamous» as well.</p>
<p>The Principality of Monaco is a place where key actors from different industries meet on a regular basis. Since 2018, «digital entrepreneurs» have their own annual event to officially celebrate their achievements, the Influencer Awards Monaco.</p>
<p>On October 6, Monaco hosted the 2nd Influencer Awards ceremony, which received an incredible response from around the world. We spoke with Lolita Abraham, founder of IAM who shared some statistics with us: «Last year, we organized the 1st edition of IAM and the impact was amazing. We reached about 7 million people and had over 81 million interactions which really put Monaco in the spotlight».</p>
<p>Since her childhood, Lolita has been involved in the fashion industry and has grown up amongst entrepreneurs. 2 years ago she came to the conclusion that the work of influencers was underrated and while searching for her next project, decided to create IAM.</p>
<p>In Lolita’s quest to further structure the digital world surrounding influencers, next year the young entrepreneur plans to create a charitable foundation, which in the future will support associations collaborating with influencers and bring to light another key aspect of their work and dedication.</p>
<p>And if that wasn’t enough, Lolita teamed up with Monaco-raised Maureen Kragt and the pair co-founded MonacoLab, a leading Agency in transformative visual identity and communications.</p>
<p>Maureen who has also been an integral part of the IAM team since its beginning heads up the influencer press relations; she told us what made the 2019 edition so special.</p>
<p>«The 2nd edition was exceptional; twice as many influencers as the first year and over 30 nationalities gathered in the Principality. IAM’s vision grows with each edition. This year we gained credibility as an awarding body, thanks to the hard work and dedication from everyone involved. Our main goal has always been to provide support and recognition to all of the influencers and their commitment to these «digital» careers that have developed with the boom in Social Media, especially Instagram.</p>
<p>This year, we wanted to «up the game» and put extra effort into making the main Gala event unforgettable. It was amazing to be able to work with exceptional partners like Ali Bakhtiar who has been designing events and interiors for almost 3 decades, working with VIPs and royalty across the globe».</p>
<p>According to Maureen, this year’s edition saw new categories emerge like «Gaming» and «Best brand marketing campaign». It is important to recognise brands who are influencer friendly and reward them for being pioneers of their time, recognizing the power that influencers have on society.</p>
<p>This year, winners were selected in 14 categories. Among the influencers honoured during the ceremony were Hofit Golan, Tony Kelly, Maya Malnar and many others.</p>
<p>This year, Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies presided over the jury. Exclusively for HelloMonaco, she highlighted the selection criteria for the winners and pointed out that influencers’ work is mistakenly regarded as superficial.</p>
<p>«The influencers are so devoted. It’s a job. I mean, people think that being an influencer is superficial. Actually, not at all. It’s a real job, it takes dedication. You work 24 hours a day. No holidays!»</p>
<p>What does a representative of the Italian royal family have to do with the digital industry?</p>
<p>«You see, I come from a background of traditions, values, and history. The way I explain it to my husband, who is a member of the Italian royal family, is that I want to become a bridge of sorts between modern times and the past», explained the wife of Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.</p>
<p>Winners are selected according to definite criteria. «We know how many followers people have», Princess Camilla continues. «But it’s especially the quality of their Instagram feed, of what they post every day that matters». The quality and frequency of publications, the absence of fake followers and a powerful message behind their Instagram feed: these are the main criteria of success for every influencer.</p>
<p>Another jury member shared with us his vision of being a «digital businessman». Jeetendr Sehdev knows what it means to be an influencer firsthand, because he is the author of the bestselling book «The Kim Kardashian Principle», where he explained what popularity depends on. Jeetendr is a pop-culture expert and a columnist at the Financial Times. He told us what it means to him to be an influencer:</p>
<p>«I think being an influencer is a big responsibility. But the power of influencers comes from the fact that they are very much living their lives on their own terms and doing what they want to do. And I think that is a very inspiring message, that’s a very responsible message to youth audiences today. They say ‘Look, we have this life, we have to be grateful for it, we’ve got to make the most of it, and we’ve got to carve out our own path, so we don’t necessarily have to conform and do what everyone else is doing’. I think that’s their largest responsibility».</p>
<p>After the success of the 2nd IAM edition, it’s quite clear that this event, organized by young, ambitious and influential people, will take root in the Principality for years to come.</p>

<p>Last year, for the launch of IAM, founded by Lolita Abraham, Pauline Ducruet assumed the role of President of the jury. This year, she passes the torch to Princess Camilla de Bourbon-Two Sicilies.</p>
<p>Thus, Mickey Boardman, editorial director of US Paper magazine, Julian Macdonald, fashion designer, Denis Jacquet, founder of Day One, Jeentendr Sehdev, author of “The Kim Kardashian Principle”, Céline Saint Remy, co-founder of the agency talents ZAM / Obviously and Caroline Rush, executive director of the British Fashion Council will vote to elect representatives from each category (lifestyle, fashion, food, travel, health, etc). The winners will receive a work by artist Laurence Jenkell, a candy-shaped sculpture.</p>
<p>PEOPLE SIDE</p>
<p>The evening will be open for the public from 8pm on 6th October at the red carpet of the Sporting de Monaco. It will be possible to see the couple Caroline Receveur and Hugo Philip, Lufyyy, YouTubers and Instagrammers, the sisters Kaplan, Salif or the former Miss France, Laury Thilleman. Many other bloggers will be there, and the names will fall in the days to come.</p>
<p>Besides influencers, other celebrities are expected. Slimane, Vitaa, Soulking, Gims, the Gipsy Kings, to name a few. As well as other surprise guests.</p>
<p>As a true businesswoman, Caroline Receveur had won two awards last year. The ambassador for several brands, including APM Monaco, is now the founder of a clothing brand in addition to its detox tea brand.</p>
