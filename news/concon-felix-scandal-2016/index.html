<h3 id="how-dangerous-coronavirus-conspiracies-spread">&ldquo;How Dangerous Coronavirus Conspiracies Spread&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/coronavirus-conspiracies.jpg" alt="img">
Stephan Lewandowsky studies the way people think, and in particular, why they engage in conspiracy theories. So when the cognitive scientist from England‚Äôs University of Bristol observes wild speculation related to the COVID-19 pandemic, he sees how it fits into the historical pattern of misinformation and fake news.</p>
<p>I recently wrote about the viral video ‚ÄúPlandemic‚Äù as an investigative reporter assessing the range of unsubstantiated COVID-19 allegations put forth by a controversial researcher. Lewandowsky comes at the video and others like it from a science-based perspective. He is one of the authors of ‚ÄúThe Conspiracy Theory Handbook,‚Äù which explains the traits of conspiratorial thinking.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories related to the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be proliferating, and some may even be taking root. So I asked Lewandowsky to share how he identifies and understands them, and what we can do to sort through the confusion. The interview has been condensed for clarity and length.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs the difference between a real conspiracy and a conspiracy theory?</p>
<p>A real conspiracy actually exists, and it is usually uncovered by journalists, whistleblowers, document dumps from a corporation or government, or it‚Äôs discovered by a government agency. The Volkswagen emissions scandal, for example, was discovered by conventional ways when some engineers discovered an anomaly in a report. It was all mundane ‚Äî normal people having normal observations based on data. They said, ‚ÄúHang on, something‚Äôs funny here,‚Äù and then it unraveled. The same is true for the Iran-contra scandal. That broke via a newspaper in Lebanon. True conspiracies are often uncovered through the media. In Watergate, it was journalists not taking ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer.</p>
<p>A conspiracy theory, on the other hand, is discussed at length on the internet by people who are not bona fide journalists or government officials or whistleblowers in an organization or investigative committees of regulators. They‚Äôre completely independent sources, individuals who self-nominate and put themselves forward as being in possession of the truth. In principle, that could be true. But then if you look at the way these people think and talk and communicate, you discover their cognition is different from what I would call conventional cognition.</p>
<p>What are some differences between conventional and conspiratorial thinking?</p>
<p>You can start with healthy skepticism vs. overriding suspicion. As a scientist, I‚Äôm obviously skeptical. I‚Äôm questioning anything people say. I look at my own data and other people‚Äôs data with a skeptical eye. But after skeptics have been skeptical, they are quite capable of accepting evidence. Once something has withstood scrutiny, you accept it. Otherwise you‚Äôre in a state of complete nihilism and you can‚Äôt believe anything.</p>
<p>That crucial second step of acceptance is absent in conspiracy theorists. That is where conspiracy theorists are different. Their skepticism is a bottomless, never-ending pit of skepticism about anything related to the official account. And that skepticism is accompanied by extreme gullibility to anything related to the conspiracy. It‚Äôs an imbalance between skepticism for anything an official may say and complete gullibility for something some random dude on the internet will tweet out. It‚Äôs that imbalance that differentiates conspiracy thinking from standard cognition.</p>
<p>Conspiracy thinking is immune to evidence. In the ‚ÄúPlandemic‚Äù video, the absence of evidence is twisted to be seen to be as evidence for the theory. They say the cover-up is so perfect that you will never find out about it. That‚Äôs the opposite of rational thinking. Usually when you think of a hypothesis, you think of the evidence. And if there‚Äôs zero evidence, you give it up or say there is no evidence for it.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists may also simultaneously believe things that are contradictory. In the ‚ÄúPlandemic‚Äù video, for example, they say COVID-19 both came from a Wuhan lab and that we‚Äôre all infected with the disease from vaccinations. They‚Äôre making both claims, and they don‚Äôt hang together.</p>
<p>More generally, conspiracy theorists show this contradictory thinking by presenting themselves as both victims and heroes. They see themselves as these heroes in possession of the truth. But they also see themselves as victims. They feel they are being persecuted by this evil establishment or the deep state or whatever it is.</p>
<p>Why do you think some conspiracy theories are so popular?</p>
<p>Some people find comfort in resorting to a conspiracy theory whenever they have a sense of a loss of control or they‚Äôre confronted with a major adverse event that no one has control over. So every time there‚Äôs a mass shooting in the U.S., I can guarantee you ahead of time that there will be a conspiracy theory about it.</p>
<p>So you would expect conspiracy theories related to the pandemic. That doesn‚Äôt make them any less harmful. Here in the United Kingdom, people are burning 5G cell towers because of this extreme idea that 5G has something to do with causing COVID-19. More than 70 cell towers have gone up in flames because of this conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Is conspiracy thinking at an all time high?</p>
<p>Historical records show that there were rampant conspiracy theories going on in the Middle Ages when the plague hit Europe. It was anti-Semitism at the time. That tends to be part and parcel of pandemics. People engage in conspiracies that involve some sort of ‚Äúothering‚Äù of people. During previous pandemics, people chased doctors down the street because they thought they were responsible for the pandemic. In Europe, now a lot of antagonism is directed at Asians, because the pandemic started in China. The internet is helping the spread of conspiracy theories. It‚Äôs much easier now than it was 30 years ago. But it‚Äôs difficult to say we have more now.</p>
<p>Are conservatives or liberals any more likely to engage in conspiracy thinking?</p>
<p>There is a lot of research on this and political conspiracy theories tend to be most associated with extreme political views, on the right or the left. But if you quantify it, you frequently find more on the right than the left.</p>
<p>How do we talk to the conspiracy theorists in our lives?</p>
<p>It‚Äôs extremely difficult. In terms of strategy, the best people to talk to are people who are not conspiracy theorists. The vast majority of people are grateful for the debunking and responsive to it. That should be your target of communication if you have a choice. The hardcore conspiracy theorists are unlikely to change their minds. They will take what you say and display considerable ingenuity in twisting it and using it against you. On Twitter, I block them immediately because I‚Äôm concerned about my ability to have a rational conversation and I don‚Äôt want others to violate that right.</p>
<p>How do we prevent the spread of conspiracy theories?</p>
<p>By trying to inoculate the public against them. Telling the public ahead of time: Look, there are people who believe these conspiracy theories. They invent this stuff. When they invent it they exhibit these characteristics of misguided cognition. You can go through the traits we mention in our handbook, like incoherence, immunity to evidence, overriding suspicion and connecting random dots into a pattern. The best thing to do is tell the public how they can spot conspiracy theories and how they can protect themselves.</p>
<p>Are you aware of any cases where the conspiracy theorists turned out to be right?</p>
<p>There are tens of thousands of conspiracy theories out there, so I haven‚Äôt checked them all. But if you look at actual conspiracies, Volkswagen, Iran-contra, Watergate ‚Äî the real conspiracies ‚Äî they were uncovered by conventional cognition. There weren‚Äôt people there who took the absence of evidence to be evidence for the theory, or who reinterpreted contrary evidence to somehow support their theory. I‚Äôm not aware of any conspiracy theorists discovering something where they turn out to be correct.</p>

<p><img src="https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2018/03/AP_17334589263505-1522503304.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800" alt="img">
Just as was true when the Mueller investigation closed without a single American being charged with criminally conspiring with Russia over the 2016 election, Wednesday‚Äôs issuance of the long-waited report from the Department of Justice‚Äôs Inspector General reveals that years of major claims and narratives from the U.S. media were utter frauds. Before evaluating the media component of this scandal, the FBI‚Äôs gross abuse of its power ‚Äì its serial deceit ‚Äì is so grave and manifest that it requires little effort to demonstrate it. In sum, the IG Report documents multiple instances in which the FBI ‚Äì in order to convince a FISA court to allow it spy on former Trump campaign operative Carter Page during the 2016 election ‚Äì manipulated documents, concealed crucial exonerating evidence, and touted what it knew were unreliable if not outright false claims. If you don‚Äôt consider FBI lying, concealment of evidence, and manipulation of documents in order to spy on a U.S. citizen in the middle of a presidential campaign to be a major scandal, what is? But none of this is aberrational: the FBI still has its headquarters in a building named after J. Edgar Hoover ‚Äì who constantly blackmailed elected officials with dossiers and tried to blackmail Martin Luther King into killing himself ‚Äì because that‚Äôs what these security state agencies are. They are out-of-control, virtually unlimited police state factions that lie, abuse their spying and law enforcement powers, and subvert democracy and civic and political freedoms as a matter of course. In this case, no rational person should allow standard partisan bickering to distort or hide this severe FBI corruption. The IG Report leaves no doubt about it. It‚Äôs brimming with proof of FBI subterfuge and deceit, all in service of persuading a FISA court of something that was not true: that U.S. citizen and former Trump campaign official Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and therefore needed to have his communications surveilled.</p>
<p>Just a few excerpts from the report should suffice to end any debate for rational persons about how damning it is. The focus of the first part of the IG Report was on the warrants obtained by the DOJ, at the behest of the FBI, to spy on Carter Page on the grounds that there was probable cause to believe he was an agent of the Russian government. That Page was a Kremlin agent was a widely disseminated media claim ‚Äì typically asserted as fact even though it had no evidence. As a result of this media narrative, the Mueller investigation examined these widespread accusations yet concluded that ‚Äúthe investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.‚Äù The IG Report went much further, documenting a multitude of lies and misrepresentations by the FBI to deceive the FISA court into believing that probable cause existed to believe Page was a Kremlin agent. The first FISA warrant to spy on Page was obtained during the 2016 election, after Page had left the Trump campaign but weeks before the election was to be held. About the warrant application submitted regarding Page, the IG Report, in its own words, ‚Äúfound that FBI personnel fell far short of the requirement in FBI policy that they ensure that all factual statements in a FISA application are ‚Äòscrupulously accurate.'‚Äù Specifically, ‚Äúwe identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed.‚Äù It‚Äôs vital to reiterate this because of its gravity: we identified multiple instances in which factual assertions relied upon in the first FISA application were inaccurate, incomplete, or unsupported by appropriate documentation, based upon information the FBI had in its possession at the time the application was filed.</p>
<p>The specifics cited by the IG Report are even more damning. Specifically, ‚Äúbased upon the information known to the FBI in October 2016, the first application contained [] seven significant inaccuracies and omissions.‚Äù Among those ‚Äúsignificant inaccuracies and omissions‚Äù: the FBI concealed that Page had been working with the CIA in connection with his dealings with Russia and had notified CIA case managers of at least some of those contacts after he was ‚Äúapproved as an ‚Äòoperational contact&rsquo;‚Äù with Russia; the FBI lied about both the timing and substance of Page‚Äôs relationship with the CIA; vastly overstated the value and corroboration of Steele‚Äôs prior work for the U.S. Government to make him appear more credible than he was; and concealed from the court serious reasons to doubt the reliability of Steele‚Äôs key source. Moreover, the FBI‚Äôs heavy reliance on the Steele Dossier to obtain the FISA warrant ‚Äì a fact that many leading national security reporters spent two years denying occurred ‚Äì was particularly concerning because, as the IG Report put it, ‚Äúwe found that the FBI did not have information corroborating the specific allegations against Carter Page in Steele‚Äôs reporting when it relied upon his reports in the first FISA application or subsequent renewal applications.‚Äù To spy on a U.S. citizen in the middle of an election, one who had just been working with one of the two major presidential campaigns, the FBI touted a gossipy, unverified, unreliable rag that it had no reason to believe and every reason to distrust, but it hid all of that from the FISA court, which it knew needed to believe that the Steele Dossier was something it was not if it were to give the FBI the spying authorization it wanted. In 2017, the FBI decided to seek reauthorization of the FISA warrant to continue to spy on Page, and sought and obtained it three times: in January, April and June, 2017. Not only, according to the IG Report, did the FBI repeat all of those ‚Äúseven significant inaccuracies and omission,‚Äù but added ten additional major inaccuracies. As the Report put it: ‚ÄúIn addition to repeating the seven significant errors contained in the first FISA application and outlined above, we identified 10 additional significant errors in the three renewal applications, based upon information known to the FBI after the first application and before one or more of the renewals.‚Äù Among the most significant new acts of deceit was that the FBI ‚Äúomitted the fact that Steele‚Äôs Primary Subsource, who the FBI found credible, had made statements in January 2017 raising significant questions about the reliability of allegations included in the FISA applications, including, for example, that he/she did not recall any discussion with Person 1 concerning Wikileaks and there was ‚Äònothing bad‚Äô about the communications between the Kremlin and the Trump team, and that he/she did not report to Steele in July 2016 that Page had met with Sechin.‚Äù In other words, Steele‚Äôs own key source told the FBI that Steele was lying about what the source said: an obviously critical fact that the FBI simply concealed from the FISA court because it knew how devastating that would be to being able to continue to spy on Page. As the Report put it, ‚Äúamong the most serious of the 10 additional errors we found in the renewal applications was the FBI‚Äôs failure to advise [DOJ] or the court of the inconsistences, described in detail in Chapter Six, between Steele and his Primary Sub-source on the reporting relied upon in the FISA applications.‚Äù The IG Report also found that the FBI hid key information from the court about Steele‚Äôs motives: for instance, it ‚Äúomitted information obtained from [Bruce] Ohr about Steele and his election reporting, including that (1) Steele‚Äôs reporting was going to Clinton‚Äôs presidential campaign and others, (2) [Fusion GPS‚Äôs Glenn] Simpson was paying Steele to discuss his reporting with the media, and (3) Steele was ‚Äúdesperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being the U.S. President.‚Äù If it does not bother you to learn that the FBI repeatedly and deliberately deceived the FISA court into granting it permission to spy on a U.S. citizen in the middle of a presidential campaign, then it is virtually certain that you are either someone with no principles, someone who cares only about partisan advantage and nothing about basic civil liberties and the rule of law, or both. There is simply no way for anyone of good faith to read this IG Report and reach any conclusion other than that this is yet another instance of the FBI abusing its power in severe ways to subvert and undermine U.S. democracy. If you don‚Äôt care about that, what do you care about? * * * * * But the revelations of the IG Report are not merely a massive FBI scandal. They are also a massive media scandal, because they reveal that so much of what the U.S. media has authoritatively claimed about all of these matters for more than two years is completely false. Ever since Trump‚Äôs inauguration, a handful of commentators and journalists ‚Äì I‚Äôm included among them ‚Äì have been sounding the alarm about the highly dangerous trend of news outlets not merely repeating the mistake of the Iraq War by blindly relying on the claims of security state agents but, far worse, now employing them in their newsrooms to shape the news. As Politico‚Äôs media writer Jack Shafer wrote in 2018, in an article entitled ‚ÄúThe Spies Who Came Into the TV Studio‚Äù: In the old days, America‚Äôs top spies would complete their tenures at the CIA or one of the other Washington puzzle palaces and segue to more ordinary pursuits. Some wrote their memoirs. One ran for president. Another died a few months after surrendering his post. But today‚Äôs national-security establishment retiree has a different game plan. After so many years of brawling in the shadows, he yearns for a second, lucrative career in the public eye. He takes a crash course in speaking in soundbites, refreshes his wardrobe and signs a TV news contract. Then, several times a week, waits for a network limousine to shuttle him to the broadcast news studios where, after a light dusting of foundation and a spritz of hairspray, he takes a supporting role in the anchors‚Äô nighttime shows. . . . [T]he downside of outsourcing national security coverage to the TV spies is obvious. They aren‚Äôt in the business of breaking news or uncovering secrets. Their first loyalty‚Äîand this is no slam‚Äîis to the agency from which they hail. Imagine a TV network covering the auto industry through the eyes of dozens of paid former auto executives and you begin to appreciate the current peculiarities. In a perfect television world, the networks would retire the retired spooks from their payrolls and reallocate those sums to the hiring of independent reporters to cover the national security beat. Let the TV spies become unpaid anonymous sources because when you get down to it, TV spies don‚Äôt want to make news‚Äîthey just want to talk about it. It‚Äôs long been the case that CIA, FBI and NSA operatives tried to infiltrate and shape domestic news, but they at least had the decency to do it clandestinely. In 2008, the New York Times‚Äô David Barstow won the Pulitzer Prize for exposing a secret Pentagon program in which retired Generals and other security state agents would get hired as commentators and analysts and then ‚Äì unbeknownst to their networks ‚Äì coordinate their messaging to ensure that domestic news was being shaped by the propaganda of the military and intelligence communities. But now it‚Äôs all out in the open. It‚Äôs virtually impossible to turn on MSNBC or CNN without being bombarded with former Generals, CIA operatives, FBI agents and NSA officials who now work for those networks as commentators and, increasingly, as reporters.</p>

<p>The past three years of ‚ÄúRussiagate‚Äù reporting ‚Äì for which U.S. journalists have lavished themselves with Pulitzers and other prizes despite a multitude of embarrassing and dangerous errors about the Grave Russian Threat ‚Äì has relied almost exclusively on anonymous, uncorroborated claims from Deep State operatives (and yes, that‚Äôs a term that fully applies to the U.S.). The few exceptions are when these networks feature former high-level security state operatives on camera to spread their false propaganda, as in this enduringly humiliating instance:</p>
<p>John Brennan has a lot to answer for‚Äîgoing before the American public for months, cloaked with CIA authority and openly suggesting he‚Äôs got secret info, and repeatedly turning in performances like this. pic.twitter.com/EziCxy9FVQ ‚Äî Terry Moran (@TerryMoran) March 25, 2019</p>
<p>All of this has meant that U.S. discourse on these national security questions is shaped almost entirely by the very agencies that are trained to lie: the CIA, the NSA, the Pentagon, the FBI. And their lying has been highly effective. For years, we were told by the nation‚Äôs leading national security reporters something that was blatantly false: that the FBI‚Äôs warrants to spy on Carter Page were not based on the Steele Dossier. GOP Congressman Devin Nunes was widely vilified and mocked by the super-smart DC national security reporters for issuing a report claiming that this was the case. The Nunes memo in essence claimed what the IG Report has corroborated: that embedded within the FBI‚Äôs efforts to obtain FISA court authorization to spy on Carter Page was a series of misrepresentations, falsehoods and concealment of key evidence:</p>
<p>As the Rolling Stone‚Äôs Matt Taibbi ‚Äì one of the few left/liberal journalists with the courage and integrity to dissent from the DNC/MSNBC script on these issues ‚Äì put it in a detailed article: ‚ÄúDemocrats are not going to want to hear this, since conventional wisdom says former House Intelligence chief Devin Nunes is a conspiratorial evildoer, but the Horowitz report ratifies the major claims of the infamous ‚ÄòNunes memo.‚Äô‚Äù That the Page warrant was based on the Steele Dossier was something that the media servants of the FBI and CIA rushed to deny. Did they have any evidence for those denials? That would be hard to believe, given that the FISA warrant applications are highly classified. It seems far more likely that ‚Äì as usual ‚Äì they were just repeating what the FBI and CIA (and the pathologically dishonest Rep. Adam Schiff) told them to say, like the good and loyal puppets that they are. But either way, what they kept telling the public ‚Äì in highly definitive tones ‚Äì was completely false, as we now know from the IG Report:</p>
<p>Yes. I am telling you the dossier was not used as the basis for a FISA warrant on Carter Page. ‚Äî Shane Harris (@shaneharris) January 12, 2018</p>
<p>New: Two Democratic members of House Intel tell me McCabe did not say dossier was basis of FISA warrant, disputing central claim of #NunesMemo ‚Äî Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) February 2, 2018</p>
<p>Over and over, the IG Report makes clear that, contrary to these denials, the Steele Dossier was indeed crucial to the Page eavesdropping warrant. ‚ÄúWe determined that the Crossfire Hurricane team‚Äôs receipt of Steele‚Äôs election reporting on September 19, 2016 played a central and essential role in the FBI‚Äôs and Department‚Äôs decision to seek the FISA order,‚Äù the IG Report explained. A central and essential role. It added: ‚Äúin support of the fourth element in the FISA application-Carter Page‚Äôs alleged coordination with the Russian government on 2016 U.S. presidential election activities, the application relied entirely on the following information from Steele Reports 80, 94, 95, and 102.‚Äù Just compare the pompous denials from so many U.S. national security reporters at the nation‚Äôs leading news outlets ‚Äì that the Page warrant was not based on the Steele Dossier ‚Äì to the actual truth that we now know: ‚Äúin support of the fourth element in the FISA application-Carter Page‚Äôs alleged coordination with the Russian government on 2016 U.S. presidential election activities, the application relied entirely on the following information from Steele Reports 80, 94, 95, and 102‚Ä≥ (emphasis added). Indeed, it was the Steele Dossier that led FBI leadership, including Director James Comey and Deputy Diretor Andrew McCabe, to approve the warrant application in the first place despite concerns raised by other agents that the information was unreliable. Explains the IG Report: FBI leadership supported relying on Steele‚Äôs reporting to seek a FISA order on Page after being advised of, and giving consideration to, concerns expressed by Stuart Evans, then NSD‚Äôs Deputy Assistant Attorney General with oversight responsibility over QI, that Steele may have been hired by someone associated with presidential candidate Clinton or the DNC, and that the foreign intelligence to be collected through the FISA order would probably not be worth the ‚Äòrisk‚Äô of being criticized later for collecting communications of someone (Carter Page) who was ‚Äúpolitically sensitive.‚Äù The narrative manufactured by the security state agencies and laundered by their reliable media servants about these critical matters was a sham, a fraud, a lie. Yet again, U.S. discourse was subsumed by propaganda because the U.S. media and key parts of the security state have decided that subverting the Trump presidency is of such a high priority ‚Äì that their political judgment outweighs the results of the election ‚Äì that everything, including outright lying even to courts let alone the public, is justified because the ends are so noble. As Taibbi put it: ‚ÄúNo matter what people think the political meaning of the Horowitz report might be, reporters who read it will know: Anybody who touched this nonsense in print should be embarrassed.‚Äù No matter how dangerous you believe the Trump presidency to be, this is a grave threat to the pillars of U.S. democracy, a free press, an informed citizenry and the rule of law. * * * * * Underlying all of this is another major lie spun over the last three years by the newly-minted media stars and liberal icons from the security state agencies. Ever since the Snowden reporting ‚Äì indeed, prior to that, when the New York Times‚Äô Eric Lichtblau and Jim Risen (now with the Intercept) revealed in 2005 that the Bush-era NSA was illegally spying on U.S. citizens without the warrants required by law ‚Äì it was widely understood that the FISA process was a rubber-stamping joke, an illusory safeguard that, in reality, offered no real limits on the ability of the U.S. Government to spy on its own citizens. Back in 2013 at the Guardian, I wrote a long article, based on Snowden documents, revealing what an empty sham this process was.

<h3 id="44-years-41-allegations-how-the-past-caught-up-to-a-former-olympian">&ldquo;44 years. 41 Allegations. How the past caught up to a former Olympian.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/0730/r577090_1296x729_16-9.jpg" alt="img">
An Outside the Lines Investigation 44 years. 41 allegations. Now the past is catching up.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quiet, early morning at UCLA&rsquo;s Drake Stadium, the sun still low. The world&rsquo;s greatest track athletes have run here through the years, in front of thousands of cheering fans. But on this Tuesday in June 2016, only a dozen or so anonymous men and women stretch and tick off laps.</p>
<p>Among them is Benjamin, a wiry, 20-year-old UCLA sophomore. He is not on the Bruins&rsquo; track team, but he is training toward his dream of making his home country&rsquo;s national squad. As he stretches, Benjamin (who asked that his real name not be used) sees a figure walking stiffly and deliberately toward him across the infield. The man comes into focus: early 30s, flowing blond hair, piercing blue eyes. He looks like an athlete, firm and thin, but he&rsquo;s wearing street clothes.</p>
<p>The stranger approaches Benjamin; he nods in the direction of an older man in a track jacket and white Adidas cap, perched on a folding chair about 10 feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you train with this guy?&rdquo; the stranger asks.</p>
<p>Benjamin hesitates, partly because his coach, a former Olympian and trainer of elite athletes, always has demanded secrecy: Our training is our business.</p>
<p>The stranger continues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurs to Benjamin that he actually doesn&rsquo;t know his coach&rsquo;s full name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach Avondale,&rdquo; Benjamin says. &ldquo;Look, you can go talk to him if you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he can f&mdash; himself,&rdquo; comes the reply. &ldquo;His name is Conrad Montgomery Avondale Mainwaring. He&rsquo;s a serial child molester, and he molested me when I was at UCLA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trusted this guy, I thought it was OK, but what he did to me f&mdash;ed me up for the next 10 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger keeps talking, but the words are mostly a blur to Benjamin. Finally, the man turns and approaches the coach, raising his cellphone to record the encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to f&mdash;ing jail!&rdquo; the man says.</p>
<p>The man lays into the coach for what seems like forever. Benjamin tries to focus on his workout, but it&rsquo;s no use. He gathers his stuff and walks off the track, trying to process the stranger&rsquo;s words: He molested me at UCLA.</p>
<p>What the stranger didn&rsquo;t know was that Benjamin himself had been molested by Mainwaring &ndash; only nine hours earlier. Nor did the stranger realize that he had just pulled a thread that would begin unraveling the mystery and misdeeds of Conrad Mainwaring, a former Olympian who coached Olympic-level athletes, including a two-time gold medalist.</p>
<p>In June 2018, Outside the Lines began investigating a tip that Mainwaring allegedly had molested a 12-year-old boy in the 1970s and might have continued such activity to the present day. The tip led to a 13-month reporting effort that uncovered scores of allegations spanning five decades and two continents &ndash; and sparked a police investigation that resulted in Mainwaring&rsquo;s recent arrest.</p>
<p>Those who have accused Mainwaring, now mostly middle-aged men, were interviewed multiple times each and over hundreds of hours in total. Efforts were made to corroborate their stories, including speaking with family members, friends and spouses they had confided in over the years, as well as reviewing letters, journals, photos, official documents and news articles.</p>
<p>As startling as the sheer number of accusations was the fact that for years Mainwaring &ndash; who rejected repeated interview requests &ndash; remained a cipher, a man with almost no public footprint who was able to stay one step ahead of the allegations and the law.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>A Family Secret Andrew Zenoff says his older brother, Victor, spun into a life of drugs and risky behavior after his alleged abuse by Conrad Mainwaring. ‚ÄúConrad‚Äôs molesting was a huge contributor to his unhappiness ‚Ä¶ and ultimately his death.‚Äù 00:00 / 00:00 Rachel Bujalski for ESPN</p>
<p>IN MAY 2018, a phone rings at the Marin County, California, office of Andrew Zenoff, an entrepreneur who initially struck it big two decades ago by selling a pillow for nursing mothers. &ldquo;My Brest Friend,&rdquo; he called his invention. Zenoff grabs his cellphone. It&rsquo;s a friend &ndash; a reporter &ndash; following up on an earlier conversation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That guy you told me about &ndash; the one you said molested your brother back in the &rsquo;70s &hellip; what&rsquo;s his name again?&rdquo; the reporter asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conrad Mainwaring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zenoff, now 54, recounts the tragically short life of his older brother, Victor: They grew up on the East Coast in the 1970s. Victor was easygoing and affable. Everybody seemed to like him, and he excelled in most sports &ndash; basketball, baseball, tennis, soccer.</p>
<p>Each summer, starting when Victor was 12, the Zenoff brothers went to Camp Greylock for Boys, a sleepaway sports camp in New England. There, Victor developed a close relationship with a certain counselor, a man whose distinctive qualities drew campers to him. He carried an aura of authority and spoke in a proper British accent. Most impressively, he was an Olympian. His name was Conrad Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was sort of like a hero figure to my brother,&rdquo; Zenoff says.</p>
<p>But Victor changed over three summers at camp. By 15, he was consumed by drugs and risky behavior, and the family had moved to the West Coast. One time, he rolled his car and nearly killed himself. After that, his parents bought him a used highway patrol car, thinking it would be &ldquo;a safe tank,&rdquo; but he was pulled over driving faster than 100 mph.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1980, Victor was approaching his 18th birthday &ndash; barely out of high school &ndash; when he told his mother he had been sexually abused by Mainwaring repeatedly over several summers. The next day, Victor left on a camping trip to California&rsquo;s Yosemite National Park with a friend he had met at a Grateful Dead show. A few days later, officers knocked on Nisha Zenoff&rsquo;s front door. Victor was dead, found at the bottom of a 600-foot cliff. Police deemed it a hiking accident.</p>
<p>Andrew says he never had Mainwaring as a counselor and was never approached by him, and he didn&rsquo;t learn of the alleged abuse until after Victor&rsquo;s death. At that point, he says, the Zenoffs were too devastated to tell anyone else what Victor had confided to his mother.</p>
<p>Besides, maybe Victor was Mainwaring&rsquo;s only victim.</p>
<p>‚ÄòSeduced By His Interest‚Äô Vernon Sharples says Mainwaring molested him in the 1970s.</p>
<p>IN THE SUMMER of 1975, the textile hub of Leicester, England, a gloomy, downtrodden city 100 miles north of London, had little to offer 15-year-old Vernon Sharples. When he wasn&rsquo;t working as an assistant at a sporting goods store, he was smoking cigarettes and pilfering alcohol from his parents, who he says weren&rsquo;t very attentive.</p>
<p>And then one day, Conrad Mainwaring walked into the store where Sharples worked, MC Sports. &ldquo;I was aware that he was going to the Olympics because he used to come into the shop and try and get a bit of stuff for free,&rdquo; says Sharples, now a slender, balding 59-year-old.</p>
<p>Though not good enough to make England&rsquo;s national team, the 23-year-old Mainwaring was to compete as a hurdler for his native Antigua at the upcoming 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.</p>
<p>Mainwaring&rsquo;s athletic accomplishments interested Sharples, but he was most taken by the attention the track star heaped on him at the store. So when Mainwaring invited Sharples to train with what he called his &ldquo;squad&rdquo; of athletes at Saffron Lane Athletics Stadium in Leicester, the boy leaped at the chance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just seduced by his interest,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>The coach preached sobriety and celibacy, citing booze and girls as obstacles to athletic success. He had a word for messing around with members of the opposite sex: wenching. Mainwaring was an avid reader and classical music aficionado who seemed, at least to a kid from Leicester, to know everything. Some evenings after practice, the two would ride a bus downtown, where the coach &ndash; he went simply by &ldquo;Conrad&rdquo; &ndash; took Sharples to a Chinese restaurant and treated him to chicken and chips. Often, the coach would talk about a group of other select youngsters he trained &ndash; his &ldquo;international squad&rdquo; &ndash; at a summer camp in America.</p>
<p>During one of their conversations, Mainwaring explained that he was doing research in psychology and wanted Sharples to be one of his subjects. The fieldwork, Mainwaring told the teenager, involved masturbation habits. It lasted several weeks, during which time Sharples says the coach asked about frequency, timing, duration and other aspects of self-gratification. At one point, Sharples says, Mainwaring told him to see how long he could go without indulging.</p>
<p>Timeline A PATH OF ALLEGED ABUSE Outside the Lines pieced together the details of Conrad Mainwaring&rsquo;s life and identified allegations against him that span from England in the 1970s to Los Angeles in 2016. Oct. 2, 1951 Born in Antigua as Conrad Avondale Montgomery Mainwarren. 1971 Mainwaring, who has grown up in England, leaves the grammar school he attended in the city of Leicester, as shown in this class photo. 1975 Mainwaring meets Vernon Sharples (above), his earliest known accuser, in a Leicester sporting goods store. Mid- to late-1970s Mainwaring works at Camp Greylock for Boys. Seven men now say he molested them there, including Michael Waxman (above, right), shown with the coach in a yearbook image. 1976 Mainwaring competes for Antigua-Barbuda in the 110m and 400m hurdles during the Montreal Summer Olympics. 1980-1985 Mainwaring forms a &ldquo;squad,&rdquo; including several high school students, while working at Syracuse University. Fourteen men, including Robert Bender (above), now allege they were molested during this time. 1985-87 Mainwaring works in the admissions office at Colgate University. Two men now allege they were molested during this time. 1987-88 Mainwaring works at the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech. Three men now allege they were molested during this time. 1990 Mainwaring works in the Disability Services and Programs office at the University of Southern California. 1996 Sharples files a police statement in England, alleging he was abused in the 1970s. 1990s-2016 Mainwaring coaches in the Los Angeles area. Fourteen men say they were molested during this time. 2004 Mainwaring helps coach Felix Sanchez to Olympic gold in the 400m hurdles in Athens. He would repeat eight years later in London, again with Mainwaring as a coach. 2005 UCLA runner David O&rsquo;Boyle is allegedly abused. 2011 Mainwaring&rsquo;s name is mentioned in a comment on an obscure blog written by Tym De Santo (above). The first mention linking Mainwaring to abuse wouldn&rsquo;t appear on the blog until 2013. June 27, 2016 Mainwaring allegedly molests a runner at his student apartment on the UCLA campus. August 2016 After a Title IX investigation spurred by O&rsquo;Boyle, UCLA bans Mainwaring from Drake Stadium and the university. PDF June 2018 Outside the Lines begins investigating Mainwaring, eventually identifying 41 alleged victims. 2018 A tribunal in England substantiates Sharples&rsquo; claim of abuse. PDF December 2018 The former UCLA runner allegedly molested in 2016 contacts an ESPN reporter and later meets with LAPD investigators. June 20, 2019 Mainwaring is charged with sexual battery by fraud in the June 27, 2016, case. He pleads not guilty. PDF</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just kept on saying that I&rsquo;m this amazing guy &hellip; kind of showering me with compliments,&rdquo; Sharples says. &ldquo;And so I just went along with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After workouts, Mainwaring gave Sharples and other squad members massages; he called it &ldquo;physiotherapy.&rdquo; Calling it &ldquo;massage [would] really wind him up,&rdquo; Sharples says. One day, Sharples was the last squad member to receive treatment, lying face up on a table when Mainwaring instructed him to &ldquo;think up an erection&rdquo; and then &ldquo;think it down.&rdquo; All part of the research, he was told. Sharples says this happened a few times before the sessions went to a new level: &ldquo;He would rub my penis over my shorts &hellip; until I ejaculated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More than 40 years later, Sharples can&rsquo;t recall how long the alleged abuse lasted. At the time, he didn&rsquo;t think of it as abuse; Mainwaring used clinical language, never sexualizing the &ldquo;physiotherapy.&rdquo; Sharples doesn&rsquo;t remember why Mainwaring stopped, but he says, &ldquo;When it did stop, I remember feeling almost rejected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharples continued to seek his coach&rsquo;s approval throughout the remainder of high school. Although communication diminished, the conversations were meaningful, he says. Often, talk turned to Mainwaring&rsquo;s international squad in America.</p>
<p>When Sharples turned 18, Mainwaring invited him to cross the Atlantic and work as a counselor at Camp Greylock for Boys in Massachusetts. Sharples didn&rsquo;t need much persuading; he felt honored.</p>
<p>By then, the summer of 1978, Mainwaring was well on his way to establishing a dramatic legacy at Greylock. And soon, he would be in America to stay.</p>
<p>Pitch-Black Woods David Allinson (not pictured) says Mainwaring promised him greatness if he followed his direction. Mainwaring worked with hundreds of boys at Camp Greylock, as shown in this photo from a camp yearbook. ‚ÄúHe started down this path of, ‚ÄòHow bad do you want the Olympics?‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòMore than anything in my life.‚Äô‚Äù 00:00 / 00:00</p>
<p>ON THE WESTERN edge of Massachusetts, in the heart of the Berkshire Mountains, is a summer camp where boys have gone to play for more than a century.</p>
<p>Camp Greylock spreads across 300 acres near the town of Becket, a bucolic setting of top-flight sports facilities &ndash; 15 tennis courts, five baseball fields, three soccer fields, two 100-yard flag football fields, an in-line hockey rink, a nine-hole golf course, a climbing wall, a zip line, a lake and a weight room &ndash; and cabins nestled amid abundant forest.</p>
<p>The camp was founded in 1916 by three brothers, who sold it to a group of former campers in the late 1940s. Those men would operate Camp Greylock for Boys for the next 50 years, until it was sold again in 1994 to a new generation of former Greylock employees. Through the years, the camp has catered to the children of wealth &ndash; the sons of entertainers and sports executives, politicians and architects. This year&rsquo;s tuition is $12,800 for seven weeks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how or exactly when Mainwaring arrived at Greylock, but he was a stalwart for at least five summers. He was a captivating figure to many of the young men and junior counselors, famous for his participation in the 1976 Montreal Olympics. Even if the campers knew he had finished last in his preliminary heats in the 400- and 110-meter hurdles, it didn&rsquo;t seem to matter.</p>
<p>Camp Greylock Map The athletic fields at Camp Greylock were surrounded by woods, as seen in this map from a camp yearbook. One man told Outside the Lines he was 14 when Mainwaring took him from a night activity (A) to an athletic field (B), where he was molested.</p>
<p>That was true for David Allinson, a track star with Olympic ambitions in 1979. He was 17 and heading into his senior year of high school in New Rochelle, New York, when Mainwaring got him a job as a junior counselor at Greylock. Allinson had been introduced to the coach the previous summer and had trained with him thereafter. Allinson admired the way Mainwaring carried himself and how he tried to be a father figure, something Allinson says he lacked at home.</p>
<p>But Allinson says the relationship took a dramatic turn that summer at Greylock. He remembers it this way: Soon after Allinson arrived in Becket, Mainwaring summoned him to the soccer field to work on a special athletic feat the coach liked to show off. He would leap next to a soccer goal and touch his foot to the crossbar. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to get to college and be a decathlete or get to the Olympics, you need flexibility, so we need to do this drill tonight,&rdquo; the coach said. Oh, and one more thing, Mainwaring added: Before you come to the field, brush your teeth.</p>
<p>That night, after brushing his teeth, Allinson walked from his cabin to the field. It was pitch-black, surrounded by trees. He was nervous and called out for Mainwaring. &ldquo;Shhh, keep your voice down,&rdquo; the coach said, waving a flashlight. They walked and talked a bit, did a few exercises. Gradually, Mainwaring led Allinson into the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bad do you want the Olympics?&rdquo; Mainwaring asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than anything,&rdquo; the boy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you willing to do for it, how much mental energy are you prepared to give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach said the boy needed to give him a hug. He told Allinson to relax: &ldquo;You need to be able to focus, and you need to learn how to slow your heartbeat down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then suggested Allinson think up an erection. &ldquo;That is the ultimate mental test, because I&rsquo;m not gay, and you&rsquo;re not gay, and this isn&rsquo;t about sex,&rdquo; Mainwaring said. &ldquo;This is about showing me you have the mental ability to control your body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach then masturbated the boy to climax.</p>
<p>Afterward, the coach presented another &ldquo;mental challenge.&rdquo; He wanted the boy to kiss him, and Allinson obliged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, this has been a big test for you, and I&rsquo;m happy to say you passed it and you are on your way to the Olympics,&rdquo; Mainwaring said.</p>
<p>Allinson, now a corporate executive living with his wife and children in Northern California, says after that night, &ldquo;I knew my life had completely changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who I was or what I was,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t even think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allinson says the abuse continued and eventually &ldquo;started happening in the bunks, while the campers were out playing &hellip; maybe a dozen times. I remember getting emotional and saying, &lsquo;When is this going to stop?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>He remembers Mainwaring saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to stop when you realize what&rsquo;s necessary in your training, and your training isn&rsquo;t there. If you stop, I won&rsquo;t coach you.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, as an adult, Allinson says he contemplated suicide. He says he hid the abuse out of shame, fear and confusion &ndash; all of which he blames for a lifelong struggle with alcohol.</p>
<p>In all, seven men told Outside the Lines they were sexually abused by Mainwaring when they were campers or junior counselors at Camp Greylock in the mid-to-late 1970s.</p>
<p>The men who ran the camp when Mainwaring worked there are dead. After several unsuccessful attempts to reach the camp&rsquo;s current owners, Outside the Lines received an email from an attorney who said the latest iteration of the camp has never had any &ldquo;affiliation whatsoever with Mainwaring.&rdquo; The lawyer did not respond to repeated emails seeking additional comment. Several staff members from that time period and one former camper who is now a staffer told Outside the Lines they couldn&rsquo;t recall anyone matching Mainwaring&rsquo;s description.</p>
<p>A Culture of Secrecy Robert Bender, who met Mainwaring on his first day at Syracuse, says the coach had a &ldquo;powerful way of &hellip; pulling you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BY 1980, MAINWARING was 28, had landed at Syracuse University in upstate New York and was pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in counseling and guidance. He worked for the school in student housing.</p>
<p>His latest squad was a mix of students attending the university and younger athletes he had met at local track meets while working as a counselor at a nearby high school. Mainwaring insisted the squad train in secret.</p>
<p>Robert Bender, a lanky freshman, met Mainwaring on his first day at Syracuse. His mom parked outside his dorm and the two were unloading boxes to take up to his room when Mainwaring approached, offering to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you an athlete?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Before long, Bender was part of Mainwaring&rsquo;s squad, lured more by his presence and attitude than by any of the physical training. The freshman was struck by how Mainwaring would &ldquo;alternate between being really smiley, laughy and exuberant,&rdquo; then turn on this &ldquo;dead-on kind of expression [that looked] like he&rsquo;s kind of burrowing in to you psychologically, he&rsquo;s penetrating you psychologically. He had a very powerful way of pulling you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coach pushed his mental training, and he was adamant there should be no girlfriends and no sex. These were things, Mainwaring said, that would dampen Bender&rsquo;s development as an athlete. Eventually, Bender says, the training turned physical, with the coach conducting &ldquo;physiotherapy&rdquo; that led to inappropriate touching. Bender says he pulled away after just a few experiences but couldn&rsquo;t bring himself to talk about it at the time, bowed by shame and the force of Mainwaring&rsquo;s message &ndash; secrecy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said I couldn&rsquo;t talk to anyone about it. Nobody,&rdquo; says Bender, now 57. &ldquo;I think he goes after heterosexual men, having a homosexual act with a heterosexual man, and you feel ashamed about it. You don&rsquo;t want anybody to know, and he relies on that horror that his victim will be equally invested in keeping it a secret as he wants it to be a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mainwaring, an avid letter writer, emphasized the need for secrecy in correspondence with Vernon Sharples in the early 1980s. &ldquo;Naturally I expect you to keep my address to yourself [Ed.&rsquo;s note: Emphasis is in the original.] as I requested in my last letter,&rdquo; he wrote, adding, &ldquo;I do not wish anyone at all to know this.&rdquo; In another letter to Sharples, he wrote, &ldquo;I trust that you will not tell anyone where I am or what I am doing, as for the first time I can be away from the newspaper and wagging tongues and people I cannot tolerate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sharples says he can&rsquo;t recall why Mainwaring wanted to keep a low profile. Other than a couple of 1976 clippings from the local Leicester newspaper that touted Mainwaring&rsquo;s spot in the Olympics, searches of old papers unearthed nothing unusual. Outside the Lines found no evidence of Mainwaring having trouble with the law in the United Kingdom, though criminal records there are not available to the public.</p>
<p>Bender and six other former Syracuse students say Mainwaring used his veil of secrecy to molest them in the dorms, using virtually identical tactics.</p>
<p>During his time in Syracuse, Mainwaring also kept office hours as a counselor at nearby Nottingham High School, according to two men who say they were minors when he abused them there. School district officials told Outside the Lines they found no records that Mainwaring was ever a staff member or a sanctioned volunteer.</p>
<p>Five other local high school students say they were molested by Mainwaring during the same time period. In total, 14 men told Outside the Lines they were abused by Mainwaring in the Syracuse area.</p>
<p>Among the Nottingham students was Robert Druger, who later attended Syracuse University and ran on the track team. Now an eye surgeon and aikido instructor in Syracuse, Druger, 56, says he visited Mainwaring for &ldquo;sessions&rdquo; in dorms where Mainwaring worked. He says the abuse went on for several years. Until recently, Druger says, he compartmentalized the darker parts of the relationship while crediting Mainwaring with helping to improve his life in some ways.</p>
<p>Sitting on the back deck of his home outside Syracuse last fall, Druger says the full gravity of the abuse didn&rsquo;t hit him until the past few years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like finding out the Wizard of Oz is only this guy behind the curtain, and instead of getting courage, a heart or a brain, you found out he was a child predator and abused you 40 years ago,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>A Syracuse University spokesperson told Outside the Lines that Mainwaring completed a master&rsquo;s degree in guidance and counseling and began working toward a doctorate, which he didn&rsquo;t complete. The spokesperson says the school wasn&rsquo;t made aware of any allegations against Mainwaring until this past February, at which point law enforcement authorities were notified and the school began a review of Mainwaring&rsquo;s time on campus.</p>
<p>Mainwaring left Syracuse in the summer of 1985 for Colgate University, about 40 miles down the road in Hamilton, New York, where he worked in the admissions department. Several Syracuse squad members would visit him at Colgate, and new members joined. Among them was Brian, who spoke on the condition Outside the Lines withhold his last name. Brian was 18 when he arrived at Colgate in the fall of 1987, a jazz guitarist and successful high school athlete who had struggled with motivation. He had partied heavily in high school and was in emotional upheaval when he got to college. A sympathetic friend said he just had to meet Conrad Mainwaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got different degrees. He&rsquo;s into music. He&rsquo;s into sports. He&rsquo;s totally different,&rdquo; the friend said. &ldquo;He knows the score, basically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it was that Brian found himself in Mainwaring&rsquo;s office one day, challenged to attain greatness through a mental strength and therapy session. All while being touched inappropriately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very clever, very diabolically clever because he was couching it as nonsexual,&rdquo; Brian says now.</p>
<p>But within weeks of Brian arriving at Colgate, Mainwaring was leaving for his next job. A school spokesperson confirmed that Mainwaring worked for two years in the admissions department but provided no details about why he left. Mainwaring told Brian he was headed to California for a new job, gave the young man his new number and said he could call collect anytime. In a letter to another squad member during that time, Mainwaring wrote that he was leaving for &ldquo;California Institute of Technology for my new position as Counseling Psychologist and Professor of Psychology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was only partly true.</p>
<p>‚ÄòDragging It Out of Him‚Äô Robert Oliver, who oversaw student housing at Caltech, said in an oral history that Mainwaring was secretive about his counseling sessions with students. ‚ÄúHe was much too secretive about the operations.‚Äù 00:00 / 00:00 California Institute of Technology Archives</p>
<p>CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY is a school for geniuses, a science and engineering powerhouse in Pasadena, just a few miles down the road from the Rose Bowl. The university manages NASA&rsquo;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and it is perennially viewed as one of the nation&rsquo;s top tech schools &ndash; the MIT of the West.</p>
<p>By the end of September 1987, Mainwaring had, indeed, landed at Caltech. But he was neither a professor nor, formally, a counselor. He was hired as the associate master of student housing, essentially the No. 2 spot in the department that oversees student living at Caltech.</p>
<p>His arrival was covered in the student paper, which described him as &ldquo;a man whom most students find easy to talk to because of his unassuming demeanor and his smooth English accent.&rdquo; Mainwaring, the article boasted, has &ldquo;degrees in music, theology, psychology; graduate degrees in education, developmental psychology, and counseling; as well as a diploma in physiotherapy.&rdquo; The article said that Mainwaring&rsquo;s job would make him &ldquo;available for more one-to-one interactions with the students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The position came with a house near campus. Squad members visited from the East Coast, and they were impressed by his two-story digs, which had access to a swimming pool. Brian came out from Colgate, and after a workout, Mainwaring gave him a massage and masturbated him, again couched as part of mental training.</p>
<p>Mainwaring began incorporating a new facet into his teachings with Brian: God. By this point, religion had become a central part of the young man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at him like a Christian disciple because he would intersperse his weird, whacked-out teaching with Bible aphorisms here and there,&rdquo; says Brian, who has a master&rsquo;s degree from Yale Divinity School. &ldquo;Like cults use the Bible, he used it in a way that he knew had pull with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But things soon unraveled for Mainwaring at Caltech. His boss, Robert Oliver, would note that Mainwaring was &ldquo;very charming, but he didn&rsquo;t volunteer very much information, so I had to get most of what I needed to know by kind of dragging it out of him.&rdquo; Oliver is now dead, but in an audio oral history recorded in 1988, he clearly was describing Mainwaring when he talked about hiring an associate master of student housing who was &ldquo;doing a dissertation at Syracuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one hand, Oliver said, it was a smart staffing decision to hire Mainwaring, whose name he didn&rsquo;t use on the recording. With a new deputy, there was someone else to handle middle-of-the-night calls to the dorms. But deputizing this person was &ldquo;a bad thing at the same time, because I wasn&rsquo;t totally aware of all the things that were going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was much too secretive about the operations,&rdquo; Oliver says. &ldquo;Indeed, I am told that he asked the people he was counseling not to divulge information about what was going on in their counseling sessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One former Caltech student, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, told Outside the Lines that Mainwaring quickly earned a reputation for providing informal couples counseling to students and, inevitably, urging the couples to break up. The former student says that during a session with his then-girlfriend in the spring of 1988, Mainwaring said the couple&rsquo;s relationship was stalled because the man&rsquo;s sex drive wasn&rsquo;t strong enough. Mainwaring said he had a fix, though, and invited the freshman to his house. Upon arrival, the man says, Mainwaring directed him to lie down on the couch. Soon, the coach&rsquo;s lotion-filled hands were under the man&rsquo;s pants and grabbing his penis. The former student says he left immediately. He didn&rsquo;t complain at the time, but Outside the Lines has learned that another student filed a complaint about Mainwaring.</p>
<p>Caltech fired Mainwaring on July 5, 1988, less than a year after he arrived, &ldquo;following an internal investigation related to a student complaint,&rdquo; a school spokesperson wrote in an email. The spokesperson declined to provide details about the nature of the complaint and added, &ldquo;The student was not a minor, and did not want to report the alleged incident to law enforcement.&rdquo; Asked if Caltech took any actions to warn other potential employers about Mainwaring, the spokesperson said the school had no further information.</p>
<p>In total, three men told Outside the Lines they were sexually abused by Mainwaring while he was at Caltech. If other students there were molested by him on or near campus, they hadn&rsquo;t sought justice; the Pasadena Police Department said it has no records of any complaints against Mainwaring.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1990, 18 months after he was fired from Caltech, Mainwaring was hired by the University of Southern California to work in its Disability Services and Programs office. He lasted just over a year. Citing employee privacy policies, a spokesperson for USC declined to say whether the school had known about Mainwaring&rsquo;s dismissal from Caltech or comment on why he left.</p>
<p>In the decade after his departure from USC, Mainwaring kept an even lower profile than he had in the past &ndash; back when he was telling Vernon Sharples to keep his whereabouts a secret. He worked a series of random jobs and continued to coach athletes, sometimes in an official capacity. One female athlete said he coached women for a time at Santa Monica College, and a school spokesperson confirmed that Mainwaring was employed part time as a track coach during the spring of 1996.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many new squad members Mainwaring began training in the 1990s. Some old members continued to visit him and stay in contact, but Outside the Lines spoke with only one accuser who says he met the coach during that time.</p>
<p>Power of the Track Yuri Nosenko (not pictured) met Mainwaring at UCLA in 2001. Mainwaring is shown at a Los Angeles-area track earlier this year. ‚ÄúThere was definitely this sense of ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt even interact with women.‚Äô‚Äù 00:00 / 00:00 RACHEL BUJALSKI FOR ESPN</p>
<p>DRAKE STADIUM&rsquo;S NINE dark azure lanes make up one of the most recognizable surfaces in track. Some of the fastest humans have run there, from Jackie Joyner-Kersee to Maurice Greene.</p>
<p>The power of the track was not lost on Yuri Nosenko, newly 18 and a freshman when he was training at Drake on a fall afternoon in 2001. He was on his own &ndash; not on the UCLA track team but hoping to get there. Nosenko came from athletic cloth. His dad was once one of the Soviet Union&rsquo;s top 400-meter runners, and his mom was among that country&rsquo;s best women&rsquo;s tennis players.</p>
<p>After Nosenko had finished his workout one day, Conrad Mainwaring walked up and introduced himself as &ldquo;Coach Av.&rdquo; Mainwaring said he noticed that Nosenko seemed serious about training, and he invited the young man to join his current squad. Some of the members were UCLA students, some were not and some were Olympic-level athletes who had finished college. It was an open invitation. Mainwaring wouldn&rsquo;t charge Nosenko for his services, but there were three requirements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First,&rdquo; Mainwaring said, &ldquo;No drinking or drugs. Second, no messing around with girls. And then third, you&rsquo;ve got to come to church with me once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first and third didn&rsquo;t seem like huge deals to Nosenko, and he didn&rsquo;t have a girlfriend at that point, so he agreed. Above all else, he just wanted to make the UCLA team.</p>
<p>Initially, Nosenko loved what he found. He enjoyed the training regimen, and Mainwaring was clearly legit: To Nosenko&rsquo;s surprise, the squad&rsquo;s standout member was Felix Sanchez, the Dominican American hurdler and then-Olympic hopeful. Nosenko ultimately would be one of Sanchez&rsquo;s training partners in the lead-up to the 2004 Olympics in Athens.</p>
<p>Before long, Mainwaring taught Nosenko about mental strength and began discussing testosterone levels, the purported connection between erections and athletic performance, and the importance of abstaining from masturbation. Again, secrecy was mandatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had code words for all these things,&rdquo; Nosenko says. &ldquo;&lsquo;Coffee&rsquo; was masturbation, and &lsquo;tea&rsquo; was a wet dream. There was a way to call him to schedule a therapy session. Ring once, hang up. Wait, call again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nosenko says he never discussed this part of the training with Sanchez or other members of the squad. Sanchez says he was never touched inappropriately by Mainwaring and wasn&rsquo;t aware of any allegations against his former coach until three years ago. &ldquo;I have heard a few comments since 2016, [but] to tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t believe them,&rdquo; he says, adding that he was &ldquo;fully surprised by the accusations.&rdquo; Outside the Lines spoke with several other men who say they trained with Mainwaring and had only positive experiences.</p>
<p>But Nosenko says that Mainwaring&rsquo;s apartment near UCLA &ndash; the same one he has lived in since 1990, according to public records &ndash; was a regular destination for many of the athletes who trained with Coach Avondale. Sometimes, squad members were at the apartment at the same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were several times when I watched him give my peers hand jobs,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;&hellip; He framed it so well as training &hellip; like, this is training, it&rsquo;s not sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the Lines spoke with 14 men who trained under Mainwaring at Drake Stadium or in the Los Angeles area from the mid-1990s to 2016 and say they were abused near campus, usually at Mainwaring&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>One man, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, competed for the UCLA track team from 2010 to 2013 and says he was coerced so artfully that a session occurred inside Mainwaring&rsquo;s apartment as the two men watched TV coverage of the Jerry Sandusky child abuse scandal.</p>
<p>Says the man, who also earned a law degree from UCLA: &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t even cross my mind that this was the same thing, that he was doing this for his own pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beginning of the End Tym De Santo&rsquo;s random blog post about a vacation improbably became a hub for Mainwaring&rsquo;s alleged victims. ‚ÄúAnyone that Googled him, evidently, was getting my blog.‚Äù 00:00 / 00:00 RACHEL BUJALSKI FOR ESPN</p>
<p>WHILE MAINWARING WAS busy coaching at the UCLA track, his past was beginning to catch up.</p>
<p>Two thousand miles away, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a man named Tym De Santo was just back from vacation in March 2010. He planned to write about the trip on his blog, where he called himself the Renaissance Guy. De Santo was a niche celebrity. He and his mop of blond hair appeared on the inaugural season of HGTV&rsquo;s &ldquo;Design Star,&rdquo; where he got his nickname because of his varied talents: designer, singer-songwriter, sculptor, photographer, mountain biker, former professional ski racer.</p>
<p>He wrote on the blog that he and his mother traveled to England, where the De Santo family had lived for a year when Tym was young. &ldquo;My time in UK was so pleasant and inspiring!&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>De Santo described a &ldquo;truly magical evening&rdquo; visit to Cambridge, where he &ldquo;sat in front of a long row of colleges, sipping on a cappuccino&rdquo; under the &ldquo;deepest indigo blue&rdquo; sky he had ever seen. He concluded, &ldquo;Hundreds of years of history, people, stories and events. Thank you Mom and thank you England!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a single mention of Conrad Mainwaring, whom De Santo met when he lived in England. Mainwaring later got him a job as a junior counselor at Camp Greylock in the late 1970s. There, De Santo says, Mainwaring molested him.</p>
<p>But by the time he posted about the England trip &ndash; more than three decades later &ndash; De Santo thought he had buried that past.</p>
<p>The blog item, probably read largely by close friends and family, sat dormant for a year. Then the strangest thing happened: A childhood friend of De Santo&rsquo;s named Glenn Stephens chimed in under the comments section, using an alias.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of the UK,&rdquo; Stephens wrote, &ldquo;I have some Conrad Mainwaring gossip for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Santo&rsquo;s talk of England, it turns out, had triggered Stephens to remember he had seen Mainwaring several years earlier working with a group of young men at UCLA&rsquo;s Drake Stadium. Stephens had briefly trained with Mainwaring decades earlier after being introduced by De Santo. He says Mainwaring once &ldquo;tried a bad touch on me&rdquo; during a post-workout massage, at which point Stephens cut the cord.</p>
<p>At the time that Stephens made his 2011 remark on De Santo&rsquo;s blog, Mainwaring was mostly invisible on the internet, despite having been an Olympian who coached Sanchez to a gold medal in 2004. Anyone who Googled him found little. But Stephens&rsquo; blog comment would prove to be a beacon for anyone typing in Mainwaring&rsquo;s name. The first to speak up, in 2013, was Brian, the man who says he was molested by Mainwaring when he was an 18-year-old freshman at Colgate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed a reference here to Conrad Mainwaring, who also goes by the alias Avondale Mainwaring,&rdquo; Brian wrote. &ldquo;He has abused many boys and young men, some of whom are my friends. While eternal justice awaits him, justice now, in history, for the victims, would be a good thing &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other comments trickled in over the next few years, until the fall of 2017, when the #MeToo movement was changing the national dialogue on sexual abuse and more people found De Santo&rsquo;s blog and shared their experiences. The details were vague, but they began to lay bare the path of destruction &ndash; from England to Greylock to Syracuse to Colgate to Southern California.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crafty SOB.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serial predator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got me and my good friend at Camp Greylock in 1977.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used his Olympic status to control me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was abused for several years by this despicable predator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grievous and utterly evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the longest and most detailed comments came from Vernon Sharples, in the U.K. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a long time to process everything,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;There is light at the end of the tunnel! We were all used and abused by Conrad. He not only stole our bodies but he stole our minds, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The network of men accusing Mainwaring jelled. Many of them had lived in pained silence. Some had spiraled into alcohol, drug or sexual addiction; others had considered suicide. Many had endured pervasive shame.</p>
<p>Now, they had found a support system. The more they connected privately through emails and phone calls, the more they discovered the similarity of their experiences &ndash; and the more emboldened they became to take action.</p>
<p>Andrew Zenoff sought out his reporter friend.</p>
<p>Others considered more direct routes to get at Mainwaring.</p>
<p>A Call to Repent Michael Waxman, shown near his home in Maine, says he was only 13 when Mainwaring molested him at Camp Greylock. ‚ÄúDid you then, or do you now, ever think of all the harm you‚Äôve caused?‚Äù 00:00 / 00:00 RACHEL BUJALSKI FOR ESPN</p>
<p>BRIAN WAS AT his office in southern Connecticut early one morning in April 2013. It was about 8:30 on the East Coast &ndash; but he had designs on waking up Conrad Mainwaring three time zones to the west, using a number he found online. Here&rsquo;s how he remembers it:</p>
<p>After a few rings, Mainwaring, now 61, picks up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conrad, do you know who this is? &hellip; It&rsquo;s Brian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember me? I&rsquo;m calling you to see if you repented for molesting young men and boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve struggled with this my whole life,&rdquo; Mainwaring says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in therapy since 2002.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you stopped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stopped in 2002.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brian knows this isn&rsquo;t true because of what he&rsquo;s learned through the network. He details the impact Mainwaring has had on his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you to forgive me,&rdquo; Mainwaring says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For what? What did you do?&rdquo; Brian wants clarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For ruining your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The call lasts about 15 minutes. Mainwaring stumbles through, at once self-critical &ndash; &ldquo;There is total hypocrisy in my life because I&rsquo;m still teaching young people.&rdquo; &ndash; and at other times seething over the memory of a woman who supposedly betrayed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a false teacher,&rdquo; Brian says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re deluded. You weren&rsquo;t following Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tells Mainwaring that if he is to truly repent, he needs to make a &ldquo;wholesale confession&rdquo; to all the men he wronged. Brian has a suggestion for whom to call first, and he offers a phone number.</p>
<p>A few days later, a man who asked to be referred to as Max is about to take a walk when his phone rings. Max says Mainwaring molested him starting when he was in high school in Syracuse in the early 1980s. He and Brian had connected through the survivor network and spent hours sharing their stories and feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Conrad,&rdquo; Mainwaring begins. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m calling to ask for your forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Max asks whether the sexual part of the &ldquo;training&rdquo; served any legitimate purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no logic to any of it. It was stupid, it was wrong,&rdquo; Mainwaring tells Max. He says his actions were &ldquo;Hitler-like. Everything I was doing was about control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they go back and forth, Max lays out the devastation he suffered, including thoughts of killing himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been darkness that has been part of my life,&rdquo; Max says. &ldquo;I went to prostitutes and massage parlors and reenacted my experience with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mainwaring says that he has been in therapy for years, that he left education, that he wasn&rsquo;t sexually abusive anymore. He says he and a counselor he&rsquo;s been seeing &ldquo;are pretty sure I experienced an event while I was young. That something happened with my cousins. I have flashes of it.&rdquo; He says his parents left him alone in Antigua until he was 9 and that &ldquo;some sort of molestation took place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be painful. I&rsquo;m sorry for what was perpetrated on you,&rdquo; Max says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more sorry that you turned around and perpetrated it on others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to answer that question. I don&rsquo;t know what to do about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. I hope you know that I&rsquo;m genuinely sorry. Good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you,&rdquo; Max answers, without thinking.</p>
<p>The call lasts 44 minutes, and Max immediately records everything he can remember in his journal, which he provided to Outside the Lines. Max writes that he felt pity for Mainwaring because he was &ldquo;infected with a sickness and then infected others.&rdquo; Then Max feels angry and worried that he failed to convey &ldquo;how much sorrow, shame and demoralization I felt over 30 years.&rdquo; And by finishing the call by saying, &ldquo;Good luck.&rdquo; What was that?</p>
<p>Max writes down what he wished he had said: &ldquo;Good luck as you proceed down a path for good rather than one of destruction. Good luck processing and understanding how much you&rsquo;ve hurt young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an effort both to learn about Mainwaring&rsquo;s family history and to address his claims of abuse as a boy in Antigua, Outside the Lines reached out to his brother in England and sister in New Zealand. Neither replied. But at least two things Mainwaring told Max were lies. First, Mainwaring hadn&rsquo;t voluntarily left education &ndash; at least not at Caltech &ndash; as he had suggested. Most notably, he allegedly hadn&rsquo;t stopped abusing young athletes.</p>
<p>Nor, apparently, would he stop.</p>
<p>‚ÄòSomething Weird Just Happened‚Äô David O&rsquo;Boyle describes his feelings as he prepared to confront Mainwaring in 2016.</p>
<p>IT&rsquo;S EARLY EVENING, June 27, 2016, and Mainwaring is giving Benjamin a ride to his student apartment after a workout at Drake Stadium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find parking,&rdquo; Mainwaring tells Benjamin. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come up and give you the full treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the past several months of training with Mainwaring, Benjamin has become a believer. His efforts to walk on to the UCLA track team haven&rsquo;t worked out, but under Mainwaring, his running times have improved, buoying his goal of making his country&rsquo;s national team. Sure, the talks about life and theories on training, the comments about testosterone and the connection between erections and athletic performance are weird, but they seem to fit into some grander plan.</p>
<p>Inside the apartment, Mainwaring has Benjamin lie on his back. Soon, he begins to work the groin area and tells Benjamin to conjure an erection. Ability to do so is an indication of high testosterone, Mainwaring says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal is to get from zero to 100,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Benjamin feels uneasy, but he is oddly pleased when Mainwaring says, &ldquo;Good, good, you&rsquo;re getting percentage quite quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Eastern European athletes and coaches do this all the time,&rdquo; Mainwaring tells him. &ldquo;And the Greeks used to do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mainwaring works his hands under Benjamin&rsquo;s underwear: &ldquo;To get the deep muscles, I need direct contact with the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eventually, Mainwaring masturbates Benjamin to completion. Benjamin lies there stunned, but almost hypnotized. He keeps thinking about the goal: higher testosterone levels, better performance.</p>
<p>After Mainwaring leaves, Benjamin replays the session over and over. He goes to his computer and searches for any information on performance and masturbation and testosterone levels. He comes up empty and texts a friend: &ldquo;Something weird just happened. I need to talk with you tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, Benjamin goes to bed. He has an early workout the next day at Drake. With Mainwaring.</p>
<p>Around the same time, about 30 miles away, in the L.A. suburb of Agoura Hills, 31-year-old UCLA alum David O&rsquo;Boyle is steeling himself for the next morning. He is planning to confront Mainwaring for abusing him 11 years ago. He had kept the pain mostly to himself all these years, but then he found De Santo&rsquo;s blog and learned that one man who accused Mainwaring of abuse might have been just 12 years old at the time.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Boyle can&rsquo;t stay quiet any longer. He has to do something.</p>
<p>‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Over For You‚Äô David O&rsquo;Boyle says he confronted Mainwaring partly to warn other athletes who were still training with the coach.</p>
<p>EARLY THE NEXT morning, June 28, 2016, Mainwaring picks up Benjamin outside his apartment en route to Drake, as if nothing unusual happened the night before. And O&rsquo;Boyle makes the 45-minute drive to UCLA.</p>
<p>As O&rsquo;Boyle parks and walks toward the track, he hasn&rsquo;t decided whether he&rsquo;ll record the confrontation. Marching across the infield, he can see young men stretching, and he spots Mainwaring. Adrenaline floods his brain. He decides to warn the athletes before doing anything else; he wants to do for them what nobody did for him, so he approaches the group. Benjamin looks up, bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you train with this man?&rdquo; O&rsquo;Boyle asks.</p>
<p>Benjamin feels paralyzed as O&rsquo;Boyle turns to Mainwaring and stays on him, relentlessly, for 12 minutes, video rolling.</p>
<p>How are you getting away with it, you m&mdash;&ndash;f&mdash;&ndash;?</p>
<p>How do you do it? How do you get these boys to believe in you so much? How do you get them to trust you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a total master manipulator.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing this anymore. It&rsquo;s over for you.</p>
<p>Mainwaring, in a purple shirt under a black jacket, avoids eye contact. He fumbles with a stopwatch. He takes out a note pad and starts writing. He points off camera toward what appear to be some of his squad members and suggests he is going to time them.</p>
<p>Look in that camera. I want a good picture to show the cops.</p>
<p>How many boys have you molested in your life? I know at least 5, maybe 6.</p>
<p>Mainwaring tries to walk away a couple of times, with the aid of a walker he has used since having hip surgery the year before. He is carrying a large umbrella, which he uses to take occasional swipes at O&rsquo;Boyle, connecting at least once.</p>
<p>Hittin' me with an umbrella! What are you, 7 years old? Is that when it happened to you?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re not doing this anymore. It&rsquo;s over for you. There&rsquo;s not gonna be any more boys. There&rsquo;s not gonna be any more molesting.</p>
<p>Eventually, O&rsquo;Boyle is done. He goes directly to UCLA police, where he tells an officer everything, from the alleged abuse a decade ago to the confrontation that day and Mainwaring hitting him with the umbrella. He just wants something &ndash; anything &ndash; done. He writes a letter to UCLA&rsquo;s athletic department, demanding an investigation and insisting Mainwaring be banned from the track. Several others write letters of support.</p>
<p>Benjamin, in a state of fatigue and despair, goes back to his apartment. Mainwaring calls him later that day, he says, and insists O&rsquo;Boyle is a disgruntled former athlete. Benjamin doesn&rsquo;t know what to believe, but he writes a detailed account of what happened in his apartment.</p>
<p>About two weeks later, Benjamin works up the nerve to tell his parents, who encourage him to file a report with authorities. So, UCLA police hear another account about Mainwaring. But according to Benjamin, officers suggest they can&rsquo;t bring charges because he is an adult. Any sexual contact, they say, would be seen as consensual. This contradicts California law, which states, in part, that if &ldquo;the perpetrator fraudulently represented that the touching served a professional purpose, [he] is guilty of sexual battery,&rdquo; regardless of the age of the victim.</p>
<p>Complaint to UCLA Police UCLA police took this report from Benjamin about two weeks after the runner witnessed David O&rsquo;Boyle&rsquo;s confrontation with Mainwaring.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Aug. 15, 2016, UCLA notifies Mainwaring he has been banned from campus and from working with UCLA athletes. If he doesn&rsquo;t comply, the letter says, he&rsquo;ll be subject to arrest. It reads, in part: &ldquo;We recently received several complaints that you utilized as an alleged training strategy inappropriate massaging of the genital region of male athletes,&rdquo; which complainants consider &ldquo;an assault.&rdquo; The letter also notes that UCLA police spoke with Mainwaring and that he &ldquo;acknowledged the nature of this physical contact on more than one occasion&rdquo; but &ldquo;indicated it may have been inadvertent.&rdquo; Outside the Lines was unable to review the investigative files, which are protected under state law.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Boyle later said UCLA police informed him that the umbrella strikes didn&rsquo;t merit criminal charges and that the statute of limitations had expired on his claims of sexual abuse. The department declined comment to Outside the Lines, citing confidentiality.</p>
<p>Although O&rsquo;Boyle&rsquo;s confrontation led to a small victory for those who have accused Mainwaring, none of them believed he would give up coaching. As one said, &ldquo;He was like a virus, a contagion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they weren&rsquo;t through fighting him.</p>
<p>Detectives Catch a Break LAPD Detective Sharlene Johnson says it was difficult to find any cases against Mainwaring that fell within the statute of limitations until Benjamin stepped forward.</p>
<p>ROBERT DRUGER, THE Syracuse eye surgeon recruited to Mainwaring&rsquo;s squad while in high school, was at a bar mitzvah in late 2018 when he met a federal prosecutor who had handled sexual abuse cases.</p>
<p>Druger had buried his abuse for decades; he hadn&rsquo;t told anyone about it &ndash; not even his family &ndash; until he found De Santo&rsquo;s blog, linked up with others who have accused Mainwaring and contacted Outside the Lines to give his account. But once Druger opened up, there was no stopping him. His bar mitzvah conversation led to a call with a federal agent in New York, which led to a call with the FBI in Los Angeles. Druger wanted Mainwaring brought to justice, but it wasn&rsquo;t looking good.</p>
<p>New York&rsquo;s criminal statute of limitations on Druger&rsquo;s allegations was long expired, and there was no evidence that Mainwaring committed a federal crime, so the FBI forwarded the case to the Los Angeles Police Department. If Mainwaring was still involved with boys or young men, it would be a matter for the LAPD.</p>
<p>Druger spoke to LAPD Detective Danetta Menifee, relaying his experience and putting her and her partner, Detective Sharlene Johnson, in touch with others who said Mainwaring abused them. Still, there wasn&rsquo;t much the detectives could do. All of the cases were too old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a little disheartening, listening to the victims, how they were affected back then, how they&rsquo;re still affected, and knowing that [we] couldn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Johnson told Outside the Lines.</p>
<p>But then the detectives caught a break. In December, a former training partner of Benjamin&rsquo;s had encouraged him to reach out to Outside the Lines. After talking with reporters, Benjamin learned about the LAPD investigation and contacted officers, sharing his own experience.</p>
<p>The report arrived just six months before expiration of California&rsquo;s three-year statute of limitations on sexual battery by fraud &ndash; touching the genitals under false pretenses. With Benjamin, the detectives had a shot at bringing a case to the district attorney. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy. Because the allegation did not include a claim of penetration, the sexual battery was what is referred to as a &ldquo;wobbler,&rdquo; meaning it might not be charged by prosecutors as a felony.</p>
<p>In an effort to increase their chances of getting a felony filed, the detectives sought to show prosecutors that the alleged offense was part of a pattern &ndash; in this case dating back to the 1970s. So Johnson and Menifee continued chasing down men whose accounts bolstered their case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of these men didn&rsquo;t even know they were victims of crimes until more recent things started coming out in the news about women, the #MeToo movement and what was happening to them,&rdquo; Johnson says. &ldquo;&hellip; I think a lot of that has to do with &hellip; society being more open to what is and is not a crime when it comes to all spectrums of sexual assault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the LAPD was building its case against Mainwaring, Outside the Lines spotted him at a local track meet and learned he was still coaching young athletes at Rancho Cienega Sports Complex, a public facility in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of March 21 of this year, reporters found Mainwaring sitting at the track alone, waiting for his athletes to show up. It was overcast, and the rush of Exposition Boulevard traffic was audible from a hundred yards off. A reporter approached, with a TV crew in tow.</p>
<p>Mainwaring sprang up, grabbed his walker and bolted, moving surprisingly fast for a 67-year-old man with hip problems. With cameras rolling and the reporter asking about the many men who accused him of sexual abuse, Mainwaring beelined across the parking lot. He refused comment, other than to accuse the reporter of harassment. Later, Outside the Lines attempted to contact Mainwaring by email, phone and a letter left at his apartment. He never replied.</p>
<p>Early on June 19, Los Angeles police arrested Mainwaring on one felony count of sexual battery by fraud, punishable by up to four years in prison. He pleaded not guilty and was released on bail a few days later.</p>
<p>It is unclear who bailed him out.</p>
<p>Outside the Lines broke the story of the arrest &ndash; prompting several additional men to contact reporters and describe how Mainwaring had sexually abused them.</p>
<p>Living With the Legacy Michael Waxman, Robert Bender and Vernon Sharples describe the lasting damage they say they suffered because of Mainwaring.</p>
<p>DECADES AFTER HER eldest son confided that he had been molested by Conrad Mainwaring and then died a few days later in a hiking accident, 78-year-old Nisha Zenoff sits on a couch in her Northern California home.</p>
<p>Her condo overlooks Richardson Bay in affluent Tiburon. It&rsquo;s tranquil and picturesque &ndash; a stark contrast to the dark hole in her life all these years later.</p>
<p>Nisha is a psychotherapist, with a specialty in grief and marriage counseling. She wrote a 2017 book titled, &ldquo;The Unspeakable Loss: How do you live after a child dies?&rdquo; Today, she is showing a reporter some old photos of Victor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is a good one. &hellip; I think that one was in Mexico. &hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sifts through the shots and smiles. &ldquo;Everybody loved Victor. &hellip; We would always say Victor had a certain sense of loving and being kind to people. &hellip; He smiled a lot. He was happy. He had that dimple. He was easygoing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But then: &ldquo;That summer camp experience with Conrad absolutely changed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Victor died, Nisha says, she vowed to her then-husband and others that she would go after &ldquo;this son of a bitch, wherever he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as Nisha&rsquo;s anger became consumed by grief, she says, her sense of urgency for justice was pushed to the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think our hearts were so broken that the most we could do was grieve his death,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But for me, it was always an unfinished piece of business. Always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, she is beginning to get some answers. Her son Andrew had helped set the wheels in motion by speaking with his reporter friend, and now Nisha was hearing about what Outside the Lines had unearthed about Conrad Mainwaring:</p>
<p>There are at least 41 men who have accused Mainwaring of abusing them. Victor was the youngest, just 12. The men now range in age from 22 to 59. According to their accounts &ndash; 15 on the record &ndash; Mainwaring carried out his abuse across two continents and four states, often while employed at prestigious institutions. A handful of the men say they tried to bring Mainwaring to justice in England and the United States, only to be met with shrugs or hindered by statutes of limitations.</p>
<p>The men told virtually identical stories &ndash; of being charmed, groomed, coached and sexually molested by Mainwaring for weeks, months or years under the auspices of sports training, mental training, spiritual guidance or some combination of the three. They say their coach used his Olympic credentials, coaching achievements, relationships with accomplished athletes and expertise in psychology and physiology to persuade them to train with him, often at no charge. Many said they had little or no previous sexual experience when they met him.</p>
<p>Collectively, they rendered a detailed and consistent picture of a con man so skilled that he often conducted the abuse without his victims even realizing they were used as tools of his perversion.</p>
<p>Many described a Faustian bargain driven by their desire for athletic success, combined with a sense that Mainwaring was truly their friend, their mentor, their guide on a journey toward a better life. In fact, to this day, some of the men report feeling wildly conflicted &ndash; angry and tortured by the abuse yet convinced that some of their achievements would not have been possible without him. One man still credits Mainwaring for his becoming a doctor. Another gave Mainwaring tens of thousands of dollars over the years; that man recently found himself crying alone in his car in the wake of the coach&rsquo;s arrest. Many invited Mainwaring into their homes to meet their parents, who were equally enamored of him. In recent years, several men banded together to raise $13,000 to help pay for Mainwaring&rsquo;s hip replacement.</p>
<p>As Nisha absorbs the breadth of the accusations and Mainwaring&rsquo;s lasting impact, she distills his influence to a &ldquo;manipulation of the brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a rape of the brain in that sense because it wasn&rsquo;t just an abuse of the body,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s abuse of the brain and the heart and the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For that moment, Nisha&rsquo;s analysis sounds detached, more professional than parental. But then, quickly, she is inside Victor&rsquo;s head and overwhelmed. She&rsquo;s fighting back tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pain of thinking what he must have gone through internally, holding a secret like that,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I really think of [Mainwaring] as a killer. I mean, that&rsquo;s pretty strong because I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s killed anybody. But somehow, I feel like he killed Victor&rsquo;s spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/03/h_15105838-1553966188-e1553966272673.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800" alt="img">
Among the Trump-Russia investigation‚Äôs many loose ends, one stands out: the Trump Tower Moscow project and the conflicting statements from President Donald Trump and his former advisers about their attempts to complete a lucrative business deal in Russia in the midst of the 2016 election. The man closest to the project, longtime Trump business associate Felix Sater, was set to appear before the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees this past week. But with many details of the 400-page special counsel investigation still shrouded in mystery, Sater‚Äôs testimony has been postponed indefinitely, or at least until members of Congress better understand the contents of the so-called Mueller report. Sater‚Äôs story is a familiar plotline in the Trump-Russia narrative: An opportunistic ex-con ingratiates himself into the Trump Organization, landing a rent-free office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower, then brokers connections between the future president, Trump‚Äôs family and company, and Russian elites, eventually including the Kremlin. When the unbecoming details of Sater‚Äôs past ‚Äî his secret prosecution, his ties to organized crime ‚Äî come to light, the president disavows their relationship. The less familiar story is how Sater got here, and how his path to the center of the current political scandal was enabled and, arguably, abetted by some of the same people who went on to work in the special counsel‚Äôs office. The government has acknowledged Sater‚Äôs long-running cooperation and he has spoken publicly about his purported role in obtaining Osama bin Laden‚Äôs phone numbers before 9/11, identifying a North Korean official seeking to buy nuclear weapons technology from the Russians, and helping to disrupt an assassination plot on former Secretary of State Colin Powell in Afghanistan. But the details and terms of Sater‚Äôs agreement with the government remain largely secret, contained in sealed court filings submitted in his 20-year-old criminal case. (Last month, The Intercept sought the unsealing of some of these materials, including his cooperation agreement. Judge Leo Glasser ordered both the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office and Sater‚Äôs counsel to respond by April 8.) Sater may have remained in the shadows, but long before special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs report found that the Trump campaign had not colluded with the Russian government, his name emerged in what seemed ‚Äî on its face ‚Äî to be direct evidence of such an effort. ‚ÄúI will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,‚Äù Sater famously wrote in a November 2015 email to Michael Cohen, then Trump‚Äôs personal attorney, that was first published in the New York Times. ‚ÄúOur boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it‚Ä¶I will get all of Putin‚Äôs team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.‚Äù That wasn‚Äôt collusion, Sater told The Intercept in an interview last week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called marketing. It‚Äôs giving both sides what they want.‚Äù</p>

<p>Eventually, Sater was called in to explain that to the prosecutors in Mueller‚Äôs office. While he declined to discuss the details of that interview, he did describe an exchange with Andrew Weissmann, one of Mueller‚Äôs senior prosecutors, during the meeting. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is it with these emails?‚Äù Weissmann asked, according to Sater. ‚ÄúYou really know how to be on the front page, don‚Äôt you, Felix?‚Äù If Weissmann‚Äôs tone sounds casual and even jocular, it might be because the two men have known each other for 20 years. Weissmann supervised the 1998 stock fraud case that originally brought Sater into the government‚Äôs orbit as a cooperator. He is not the only member of Mueller‚Äôs team who goes way back with Sater. FBI Special Agent William McCausland who worked on former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn‚Äôs prosecution, handled Sater as early as 2003, after he became an informant. (‚ÄúOne of the hardest-working and best FBI agents I‚Äôve ever worked with,‚Äù Sater said of McCausland.) Other former Eastern District prosecutors who were detailed to the special counsel include Zainab Ahmad and Greg Andres, who served as chief of the office‚Äôs criminal division at the time Sater was sentenced. Peter Carr, the spokesperson for the special counsel‚Äôs office, declined to comment. Sater‚Äôs history as an informant who worked with members of the special counsel‚Äôs team, coupled with his position at the center of the Trump-Russia story, raises the question of whether the Russia investigation was, ultimately, a circular exercise. Could Mueller‚Äôs investigation have been avoided ‚Äî or dramatically narrowed in scope ‚Äî had federal prosecutors not cut Sater a secret deal in 1998 but, instead, prosecuted him? This sort of hypothetical-in-hindsight may not sit well with members of Sater‚Äôs prosecution team, all but one of whom declined to speak to The Intercept for this story. The only exception, former Eastern District prosecutor and now New York state Sen. Todd Kaminsky, said it‚Äôs unfair to suggest that law enforcement officials should have anticipated Sater‚Äôs involvement in a political scandal implicating the president. ‚ÄúI think it would be very difficult to tell an FBI agent or a prosecutor in, let‚Äôs say, 2002, knowing what you know about Sater ‚Äî that he‚Äôs a savvy businessman, that‚Äôs he‚Äôs a stock defrauder, that he stabbed someone in the face with a martini glass ‚Äî and have them say, ‚ÄòYou know what, I don‚Äôt think we should get this information on Al Qaeda, because one day this guy is going to be in the middle of an international conspiracy that goes to the highest level [of government],‚Äô‚Äù Kaminsky said. For his part, Sater told The Intercept he didn‚Äôt play any role in investigations into Trump, before, during, or after the election. ‚ÄúThe FBI has never asked me to provide information about the Trump Organization or Donald Trump at any time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was never any connection with me from my case and the Trump investigation other than during interviews with Mueller.‚Äù Sater also said he never used his role as a senior advisor to Trump to carry out law enforcement work. Though, he would not say whether he signed an ‚Äúotherwise illegal activity‚Äù ‚Äî an authorization from the Department of Justice to violate the law in the context of an investigation ‚Äî which, in some instances, requires review by the director of the FBI. (Mueller was FBI director from 2001 until 2013, when Sater was cooperating with the bureau.) Sater also took exception to questions about whether he‚Äôd ever been approached by a foreign intelligence agency while acting as a government informant. ‚ÄúWhere do you think I got half this shit from? From a dentist?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWas I ever the subject of them trying to turn me? Who knows.‚Äù The Trump Moscow project, he said, was a straight-ahead real estate deal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, believe it or not, investigate it or not, there was no intelligence component to me trying to do a Trump Tower,‚Äù Sater said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a businessman. I‚Äôm a developer. I saw an opportunity. I went for it. It‚Äôs not right. It‚Äôs not wrong. It‚Äôs just what it is.‚Äù Yet nothing is ever quite as it seems with Felix Sater. He‚Äôs been called a spy, a stock cheat, a real estate developer, a gangster, a Russian, an American patriot. Twenty years ago, federal prosecutors saw him in more practical terms: as someone they could work with.</p>

<p>The Art of the Deal Sater‚Äôs cooperation did not occur in a vacuum. In the early winter of 1998, a group of federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York faced a perennial question: Do we prosecute this guy? Or do we cut him a deal? Sater was a 31-year-old ex-con, a Russian Jewish emigre who‚Äôd served a year in state prison for an assault stemming from a fight in a bar. That made for an unremarkable pedigree in their jurisdiction. He appeared to have graduated from his state-court felony to a sprawling federal white-collar conspiracy in which he was accused of defrauding retirees, including at least two Holocaust survivors, out of millions, according to court filings. The allegations against Sater alone made him a good target for prosecutors. Financial crime was a growing racket for the Italian Mafia and Sater was at the center of it. He said he could help penetrate a criminal underworld otherwise closed off to the FBI: the mob‚Äôs growing presence on Wall Street. (‚ÄúWhen you grow up in Brooklyn and Staten Island, everybody knows a guy,‚Äù he told The Intercept.) Sater was savvy, capable, and connected ‚Äî an ideal cooperator. Two decades later, those same qualities would put him at the center of the Trump-Russia story. The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in the Eastern District of New York had made its name flipping criminals, most notably Salvatore ‚ÄúSammy the Bull‚Äù Gravano, the Gambino family deputy who testified against John Gotti in 1992. After three acquittals, Brooklyn prosecutors finally secured a conviction against Gotti ‚Äî and a life term in prison. Gravano had a hand in 19 murders, but he received time served for his testimony. His deal is a case study in the stark moral logic underlying cooperation agreements: a lesser evil for a greater good. The Eastern District would go on to apply that logic to devastating effect against New York‚Äôs five Mafia families throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Former FBI Special Agent Leo Taddeo, the first agent to work with Sater, described the office‚Äôs culture of cooperation as ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Eastern District does the government‚Äôs business and it does it really well,‚Äù Taddeo said. ‚ÄúAnd part of that business is entering into cooperation agreements every day.‚Äù As the office branched out into national security cases after the September 11 attacks, criminal cooperation agreements took on an even more complex moral dimension. Prosecutors continued to successfully recruit cooperating witnesses in terrorism cases, even though the cooperators had in some cases been enemies of the state. One such witness, Bryant Neal Vinas, a Long Island man who joined Al Qaeda, provided key intelligence and testimony on the terror group‚Äôs operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In a 2015 case against three al-Shabaab members, prosecutors relied on the testimony of a man who helped plan and execute the 2010 World Cup bombings in Kampala, Uganda, which killed 70 people, including Nate Henn, a 25-year-old NGO worker from North Carolina, and injured six Americans and scores of others. The key witness, Mugisha Mohamoud, had served five years in prison in Kenya after confessing to his role in the attack and was living there when he testified. The U.S. has not publicly charged Mohamoud or extradited him. The three al-Shabaab defendants pleaded guilty and were sentenced in 2016.</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo Task Was Too Big‚Äù Within this context, Felix Sater presented a relatively straightforward profile as a cooperator. He hadn‚Äôt committed any death penalty-eligible offenses and, by his own account, he was contrite and eager to do the right thing. The Justice Department‚Äôs official position on Sater is that his value as a cooperator far outweighed any liabilities. It also implicitly outweighed concerns over his potential for recidivism. At Sater‚Äôs sentencing in 2009 ‚Äî 11 years after he first surrendered ‚Äî then-prosecutor Kaminsky told the judge: ‚ÄúFelix Slater was one of the best cooperators we worked with. There was nothing he wouldn‚Äôt do. No task was too big. He was really helpful and was the key to open a hundred different doors that they couldn‚Äôt open prior to that time.‚Äù Sater had hired two former Eastern District prosecutors to represent him at that hearing, Leslie Caldwell and Kelly Moore. Both had worked at the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office at the time he became a cooperator. Caldwell, who went on to become an assistant attorney general in the Obama administration, had represented the government in an early appearance in one of the stock fraud cases for which Sater provided information. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hesitant to use the word redemption, but I think it fits Mr. Sater,‚Äù Caldwell told the judge at the sentencing. ‚ÄúI think he has redeemed himself.‚Äù She explained that Sater had developed such a close relationship with the FBI that he had been traveling freely to Russia as part of his real estate business for 10 years without being required to report those trips to his handlers, as is generally required for informants. Caldwell closed her remarks on Sater‚Äôs character with a prediction. She told the judge that Sater is ‚Äúnot going to appear before this court or any other court again in the context of a criminal case.‚Äù Neither Caldwell nor Moore responded to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The prosecutors involved in Sater‚Äôs original case have since risen to some of the top positions in federal law enforcement. Loretta Lynch, who served as U.S. attorney in Brooklyn during his cooperation, became attorney general under President Barack Obama. Caldwell and Weissmann went on to lead the Enron task force before rising to even more senior positions, with Caldwell serving as assistant attorney general for the criminal division and Weissmann running the department‚Äôs fraud section. Weissmann also served under Mueller at the FBI. When his former boss was appointed special counsel, Weissmann joined what became known as the Mueller investigation. Their career success may have little to do with Sater‚Äôs cooperation, yet the two cannot be entirely disentangled. During her 2015 confirmation, when asked about Sater, Lynch said that he provided ‚Äúinformation crucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.‚Äù At Sater‚Äôs 2009 sentencing, Glasser chose not to give him prison time, even though the RICO statute exposed him to a potential 25-year sentence. Glasser instead imposed a $25,000 fine and told Sater, ‚ÄúThe extent of your cooperation over all of those years clearly manifests that you have a very sincere and deep respect for the law.‚Äù Fifteen years earlier, it was Glasser who had sentenced Gravano to time-served. Glasser, who is 94, still hears cases in the Eastern District; he declined to comment. A Lesser Evil Cooperation agreements are, by their very nature, transactional, and in the lesser-evil-for-the-greater-good formulation, Sater appeared to more than live up to his end of the bargain. Last year, in preparation for closed testimony before the House Subcommittee on Intelligence, he provided Congress a bulleted list of 23 examples of his intelligence and investigative work, according to a statement obtained by BuzzFeed. By his own account, Sater was an operative of superhero proportions ‚Äî someone who could cobble together a team of former Spetsnaz mercenaries to hunt bin Laden while unraveling terrorist financing schemes and also building his own intelligence network of spooks around the world, all without receiving compensation from the government. The breadth of his self-described activities suggests an uncanny understanding of the various markets for information in the U.S. government‚Äôs law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Most of Sater‚Äôs claims have so far proven impossible to independently verify. One former intelligence official who worked with the FBI‚Äôs New York office, but didn‚Äôt have direct knowledge of Sater‚Äôs cooperation, voiced skepticism. ‚ÄúSomebody who claims to have done all that he has screams bullshit,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIt sounds like he took the FBI for a ride.‚Äù So what did Sater get for his cooperation? His freedom, for one. In addition to the $25,000 fine, Sater forfeited a home in the Hamptons, but he did not spend a single night in jail. More important, Sater retained his identity. Judges and federal prosecutors agreed to conceal his charges and eventual conviction. His plea agreement required him to plead guilty to a single count in a racketeering indictment but, in a legal but entirely opaque practice favored by prosecutors the Eastern District, he did so in secret and under a false name. Even the courtroom was sealed, with reporters, the public, and ‚Äî had they shown up ‚Äî the victims of Sater‚Äôs fraud barred from entering the hearing. Unlike a cooperator who testifies in a public trial, Sater was never subjected to the adversarial system of justice. He was, in effect, represented by the government in both the prosecution and the defense. And with the press shut out of the closed proceedings, there was no one with an incentive to impeach his credibility or question the government‚Äôs version of events. In the eyes of the justice system, Sater was a two-time felon with links to both the Italian and Russian mobs who had been convicted of sophisticated financial crimes. While there was public information on his assault conviction, there was no public record on his conviction in the Eastern District. When Sater met Manhattan celebrity real estate developer Donald Trump in 2002, he appeared to be little more than a 38-year-old former Wall Street prodigy from Shearson Lehman trying to reinvent himself in New York real estate.</p>

<p>The Redemption To work effectively with the Trump Organization, Sater leveraged the two assets he‚Äôd secured from the Eastern District: his freedom and his identity. After September 11, he joined Bayrock, a real estate venture operating out of Trump Tower. There, Sater developed a working relationship with Trump, appearing at groundbreaking ceremonies and hosting Donald Jr. and Ivanka on a 2006 trip to Moscow ‚Äî where he boasted in an email to Michael Cohen that he ‚Äúarranged for Ivanka to sit in Putins [sic] private chair.‚Äù As a political refugee who fled anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union, Sater saw his relationship with Russia as all business. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been Russian in my life. I‚Äôm an American Jew who happened to have had the misfortune of being born in Moscow,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI went there to make money. I speak Russian. I can take advantage of an extra edge.‚Äù Sater‚Äôs signature project with the Trump Organization, Trump Soho, also broke ground in 2006. The next year, Trump discussed a potential Trump Moscow project during a deposition in a libel case. Throughout this period, Sater remained under a secret indictment in the Eastern District, awaiting sentencing. But as Sater struggled to get Trump Moscow off the ground, he discovered a problem with the Trump brand, he told The Intercept. ‚ÄúIt had no value,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt want to pay Trump the licensing fee because they‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòWho the hell is Trump in Russia? Who knows him?‚Äô‚Äù The solution materialized nearly a decade later when Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign began to get traction, Sater said.

<p><img src="https://cdn.amomama.com/0275e67e726c7e16b8c041482c47f0fc2274851579830635.jpg?width=650&amp;height=340" alt="img">
Although &ldquo;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&rdquo; only aired for two seasons, it made a lasting impact on television as one of the first futuristic shows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&rdquo; aired on NBC and features Anthony &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; Rogers, who led the launch of spacecraft Ranger 3.</p>
<p>With a surprising turn of events, Rogers is found frozen 504 years into the future where he has to adapt to the year 2491. Here&rsquo;s a look at the cast since the series ended.</p>
<p>GIL GERARD</p>
<p>Astronaut Buck may have had a difficult life in the future, but the actor who played him definitely did not. Gil Gerard went on to star in several other television shows and made a name for himself.</p>

<p>Initially, Gerard worked as an industrial chemist and ever reached the vice-presidential level of his company. However, acting was at his heart since his high school days.</p>
<p>The actor first landed a role as an extra in the film &ldquo;Love Story&rdquo; before getting into commercials of over 400. Gerard&rsquo;s first lead role was in &ldquo;The Doctors&rdquo; and later founded his own production company.</p>

<p>He later landed significant roles on &ldquo;Sidekicks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nightingales,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Code 3,&rdquo; which he hosted. The actor also appeared in the movies &ldquo;Nuclear Hurricane&rdquo; and &ldquo;Action Hero Makeover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recently, Gerard became the executive producer of the series &ldquo;2491,&rdquo; which refers to the year Rogers had to adapt to.</p>

<p>The show will likewise follow an astronaut who finds himself in the future and goes back to earth to find himself behind everyone else.</p>
<p>ERIN GRAY</p>
<p>Star Fighter pilot Col. Wilma Deering was played by Erin Gray, who continued to have a long list of credited on-screen appearances after the show.</p>
<p>Initially, the actress was scared to play the part because of how fiction the story was. She revealed to Closer Weekly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was scared to death on the one hand. You know, &lsquo;Oh, this is science fiction, which means that everything I&rsquo;m dealing with isn&rsquo;t real.'&rdquo;</p>

<p>The actress said she got by with the help of her cast members, adding that Gerard was the jokester of the crew, influencing Gray to show her comedic side instead of her serious one.</p>
<p>Gray appeared in over 40 productions, including &ldquo;Silver Spoons,&rdquo; &ldquo;Police Story,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gibbsville.&rdquo; However, her career began as a model in one of the most elite companies of her time.</p>
<p>She has since founded the booking agency Heroes for Hire and said: &ldquo;I throw myself into things that are scary and hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>TOM O&rsquo;CONNOR</p>
<p>Before Tom O&rsquo;Connor starred in the show, he appeared on the long-running series &ldquo;Peyton Place&rdquo; in 1964.</p>
<p>He was already, at that time, a familiar face on television with shows including &ldquo;The United States Steel Hour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Family Classics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After playing Dr. Elias Huer on &ldquo;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century,&rdquo; he starred as Jack Boland in &ldquo;General Hospital&rdquo; and Peter Falk in &ldquo;Columbo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His other appearances include &ldquo;Wheels,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Man with the Power,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tail Gunner Joe,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Murder in Peyton Place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FELIX SILLA</p>
<p>Before Felix Sila&rsquo;s career as an actor, he was a circus performer and toured with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Show.</p>

<p>He then became a stuntman in Hollywood and started out in &ldquo;The Ticklish Affair.&rdquo; He later had more notable roles in &ldquo;The Black Bird,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Addams Family,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Towering Inferno,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hindenburg,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Battlestar Galactica.&rdquo;
