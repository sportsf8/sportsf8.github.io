In the interview with Starcasm, Stephanie and Steven both revealed that it&rsquo;s unlikely Steven will appear on the show again. Depending on when he filmed My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now?, that can be taken with a grain of salt. But if he filmed it around the time they spoke to the outlet, then maybe he really is tired of the way he has been portrayed, as he expressed.</p>
<p>Am I the only one who&rsquo;s psyched to watch My 600 LB life season finale tonight? The return of the The Assanti Brothers, Steven and Justin.</p>
<p>Even if Steven never appears on My 600-lb Life again, he is easily one of the most memorable cast members to date. Hopefully he can still take some of Dr. Now’s advice and warnings to heart and live a healthier lifestyle, if only for his little family.</p>
<p>Watch My 600-lb Life on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.

Trying to lose weight requires a lot of strength and willpower because not only do you have to start exercising a little day after day, but you also have to change your entire lifestyle, especially if you want to maintain your weight loss. And that’s exactly what most of the morbidly obese individuals who appear on TLC’s ‘My 600-lb Life‘ aim to do – change their entire lifestyle.</p>
<p>Under the care and supervision of the renowned Iranian-American surgeon Younan Nowzaradan or Dr. Now, these individuals follow a strict diet plan and exercise routine so as to get approval for the weight-loss assist surgery, which would further help them shed their weight and live a happy and healthy life. While some patient’s stories end in tragedy, others are massive success stories.</p>
<p>Steven and Justin Assanti: My 600-lb Life Journey</p>
<p>Steven and Justin Assanti are two brothers who first made an appearance on the show in season 5. Their official episode synopsis on TLC reads: “Steven Assanti weighs nearly 800-lbs and his brother/nemesis, Justin, is almost 600-lbs. Though the brothers can’t stand each other, their father packs up the family to travel across the country to seek help, desperate to save both his sons’ lives.” And how true it is, the brothers could barely stay in the same room with each other for a few minutes without bickering or starting a conflict.</p>
<p>The Assanti brothers starting giving food a lot of priority in their life when they found comfort in it after a traumatic childhood. Their alcoholic mother neglected them as little kids, and when she finally abandoned them later on, the brothers had to take care of themselves and live in just each other’s company for a while before their father eventually found out and started taking care of them. But still, the damage was done, and the brothers couldn’t kick their bad habits.</p>
<p>Steven and Justin became one of the most prominent subjects of the series due to the elder brother’s horrific behavior. Not only did Steven continuously break Dr. Now’s diet plan, but he also used to throw tantrums and try to manipulate others to feed his painkiller addiction, so much so, that Dr. Now had to kick him off his program for a while and send him to rehab.</p>
<p>Despite everything, after a lot of effort and ups and downs, fortunately, both Steven and Justin were able to lose enough weight on their own to get approval for the weight loss surgery. Ever since then, they have continued to shed their weight and have been working hard to keep up with a healthy and fit lifestyle. Wondering what they’re up to now? Keep scrolling!</p>
<p>Where Are Steven and Justin Assanti Now?</p>
<p>While Steven doesn’t have much of a social media presence, we do know that he did get married to Stephanie Sanger (now Assanti) in Iowa in 2018. And from her Facebook profile and the images she shares of her and her husband, it’s evident that Steven is still strong about maintaining his weight loss and is happy to have found love with someone who accepts him as who he is.</p>

<p>Justin, on the other hand, is much more active on social media and has a public Facebook profile, where he keeps fans updated about his progress as well as a Reddit account where he answers a lot of fan questions. According to his Facebook, he has moved back to his hometown, Cranston, in Rhode Island and is thriving there without the shadow of his elder brother.</p>
<p>On his Reddit, when a fan asked him about his brother, Justin replied that he hasn’t bothered with them much ever since he got married. Having been a victim of Steven’s bullying ever since he was a kid, it seems like Justin is not too bothered about the fact that he has minimal contact with him. Along with this, Justin also revealed that he has lost over 200 lbs since he has left the show and that the business he started, Hobby Haven, is blooming.</p>

The Assanti brothers came to the show together with the hope of losing weight. Steven weighed over 700lbs while his brother, Justin weighed over 600lbs. While the duo came together to turn their eating habits into healthy habits, it was Steven&rsquo;s behavior that stood out the most. Viewers were not pleased to see his tantrums and attitude towards his family member so much that he soon became a hated person on the show.</p>
<p>Viewers were extremely angry with how Steven would often bully his brother while also disrespecting his father by showing him the middle finger. While one thought it would be the extent to how he behaves, things became difficult when Steven was admitted to the hospital to control his eating.</p>
<p>Steven refused to listen to the nurses and would often give them a hard time when they did not cater to his needs. He would often call them in small intervals to disturb them and when they failed to come on time, he decided to dump his urine on the floor. To make things worse, he was even kicked out of the hospital for sneaking in pizza.</p>
<p>Steven and Justin&rsquo;s family hoped that Dr Younan Nowzaradan would be able to help them lose weight but looking at how Steven behaved, his chances seemed dim. Justin also confessed during the show that he wasn&rsquo;t happy about how Steven used to behave with him. While the brothers had their differences, Steven&rsquo;s behavior also caused Dr Nowzaradan to lose his temper.</p>
<p>During Steven&rsquo;s time on the show, he lied to get an ambulance to take him to the hospital. Dr Nowzaradan was unhappy to see this behavior and ordered Steven to get out of the hospital. His behavior also gave rise to people calling him out. There was a petition that was started to take away Steven&rsquo;s free healthcare claiming that he had been misusing it.</p>
<p>His YouTube page also had people questioning his mental fitness as many thought he wasn&rsquo;t keeping well. Steven would often upload videos of himself dancing and YouTube videos would also put a cautionary message claiming that these videos might be &lsquo;inappropriate&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Despite all the odds, Steven was soon able to get back on track and agreed to work towards losing weight. He ultimately got approved for weight loss surgery. While his family was happy to see him shedding some weight, they were shocked to find out that he was getting addicted to pain killers.</p>
<p>He started stealing the pain killers from his brother&rsquo;s medications to satisfy his addiction. Dr Nowzaradan removed Steven from the surgery and decided to send him to rehab. Despite all this, Steven managed to shed a lot of weight and is looking at a positive and healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My 600-lb Life&rsquo; airs on Wednesdays at 8 pm ET on TLC.</p>

<h3 id="vite-al-limite-steven-assanti-oggi-come-è-diventato-dopo-la-dieta">&ldquo;Vite al limite, Steven Assanti oggi: come è diventato dopo la dieta&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.caffeinamagazine.it/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/58dc6df66b66d19a37e4f41e-1.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Cercare di perdere peso richiede molta forza di volontà, allenamento e un radicale cambio di stile di vita. Ed è esattamente ciò che la maggior parte dei patologicamente obesi protagonisti di “Vite al limite” devono fare per tornare a un peso forma e vivere una vita normale e sana.</p>
<p>Sotto la cura e la supervisione del famoso chirurgo iraniano-americano Younan Nowzaradan o Dr. Now, queste persone seguono un rigoroso programma di dieta ed esercitano la routine in modo da ottenere l’approvazione per l’intervento bariatrico per perdere peso. Alcune storie di pazienti sono finite in tragedia, altre sono grandi storie di successo. Steven e Justin Assanti sono due fratelli che hanno fatto la loro prima apparizione nello show nella stagione 5. Arrivati in Texas, Steven Assanti pesava quasi 370 chili e suo fratello gemello Justin è arrivato a pesare 270 chili. (Continua a leggere dopo la foto)</p>
<p>Sebbene i fratelli non possano sopportarsi a vicenda, il padre fa le valigie per viaggiare attraverso il paese in cerca di aiuto, nel disperato tentativo di salvare la vita di entrambi i suoi figli. I fratelli Assanti hanno iniziato a trovare conforto nel cibo dopo un’infanzia traumatica. La loro madre alcolizzata li trascurava e infine li ha abbandonati. Steven e Justin sono diventati i personaggi più importanti della serie a causa del comportamento del fratello maggiore. (Continua a leggere dopo la foto)</p>
<p>Non solo Steven ha continuamente interrotto la dieta del Dr. Now, ma ha anche cercato di manipolare medici e infermieri per alimentare la sua dipendenza da antidolorifici. Dopo una riabilitazione in clinica, sia Steven che Justin sono stati in grado di perdere abbastanza peso da soli per l’intervento bariatrico. Da allora hanno continuato a perdere peso e hanno lavorato duramente per tenere il passo con uno stile di vita sano e in forma. (Continua a leggere dopo la foto)</p>
<p>Steven si è sposato con Stephanie Sanger, è riuscito a mantenere la sua perdita di peso ed è felice di aver trovato l’amore. Justin è molto più attivo sui social, dove tiene i fan aggiornati sui suoi progressi. È tornato nella sua città natale, Cranston, nel Rhode Island.</p>
