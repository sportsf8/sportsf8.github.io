<p>Stuart Whitman, a ruggedly handsome actor who appeared in countless films and television shows over 50 years, earning an Oscar nomination for his role as a convicted child molester in the 1961 movie “The Mark,” died on Monday at his home in Montecito, Calif. He was 92.</p>
<p>His son Scott confirmed the death.</p>
<p>In a career that began in the early 1950s, Mr. Whitman went from bit player to dependable leading man. He was known for his studied portrayals of complex characters, whether heroes or rogues.</p>
<p>Television viewers in the 1960s knew Mr. Whitman best as the brusque, gravel-voiced Marshal Jim Crown on “Cimarron Strip,” a CBS western series set in the 1880s in what would later became the Oklahoma Panhandle. Armed with a .44 caliber Colt revolver, Marshal Crown worked to maintain order among the territory’s homesteaders, Native Americans and brawling cowboys.</p>
<p>“Cimarron Strip” was a weekly 90-minute show, a rarity on network television then and now. While it drew a cult following and favorable reviews, it lasted only one season, 1967-68, before being canceled because of low ratings and high production costs.
