The recently FDA-approved GENOSYL® inhaled nitric oxide may have pulmonary and antiviral benefits in treating pulmonary hypertension and acute infectious diseases associated with the novel coronavirus[1]</p>
<p>GENOSYL® DS facilitates outpatient use of inhaled nitric oxide in the treatment of cardiopulmonary symptoms associated with COVID-19</p>
<p>ATLANTA, March 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; VERO Biotech LLC, an Atlanta, Georgia-based biotechnology company focused on saving lives, alleviating suffering, and improving the health economics of care, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted &ldquo;expanded access emergency use&rdquo; allowing its proprietary inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) delivery system, GENOSYL® DS, to immediately be used for the treatment of cardiopulmonary symptoms associated with COVID-19. GENOSYL (nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation, was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and is the only tankless inhaled nitric oxide device available in the US.</p>
<p>Application of VERO&rsquo;s tankless inhaled nitric oxide system is valuable during a time of crisis when hospital beds and ventilators are in short supply. The ability to have a portable device in either the hospital or home setting enables healthcare providers the flexibility to treat patients with iNO in various settings, and give patients more access to the care they need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this time of a global pandemic and public health crisis, it is critical to explore all potential options for treating both the novel coronavirus and its associated cardiopulmonary conditions,&rdquo; said Brent V. Furse, President and CEO, VERO Biotech. &ldquo;Inhaled nitric oxide may provide important benefits and we at VERO Biotech intend to expedite and expand our research in this critical area. The application of home use of iNO—which was not been logistically viable until the approval of a tankless and portable system—may itself also play a role in limiting current demand for hospital beds and ventilators by patients suffering from symptoms due to COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VERO Biotech is also working with renowned global academic experts in infectious and cardiopulmonary diseases to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of GENOSYL in treating pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19.</p>
<p>GENOSYL is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (&gt;34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents.</p>
<p>GENOSYL is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. (See below for additional Important Safety Information.)</p>
<p>VERO Biotech&rsquo;s GENOSYL Delivery System (DS) is a compact and user-friendly nitric oxide delivery system, that will not only enable hospitals to reduce logistical burden as compared to the cumbersome tank-based systems currently available, but could provide greater patient access to this potentially life-saving drug.</p>
<p>About Inhaled Nitric Oxide</p>
<p>Nitric oxide is a powerful molecule proven to play a critical role in a broad array of biological functions. In the airways, nitric oxide targets the vascular smooth muscle cells that surround the small resistance arteries in the lungs and is used in adult respiratory distress syndrome and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the neonate.</p>
<p>Prior to the approval of the GENOSYL system, the only way to provide iNO was via large, pressurized gas cylinders and complicated delivery systems.</p>
<p>About GENOSYL</p>
<p>Indication</p>
<p>GENOSYL (nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation, is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (&gt;34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents.</p>
<p>Important Safety Information</p>
<p>GENOSYL is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood.</p>
<p>in the treatment of neonates dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. Abrupt discontinuation of GENOSYL (nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation may lead to worsening oxygenation and increasing pulmonary artery pressure.</p>
<p>Methemoglobin levels in the blood increase with the dose of nitric oxide; following discontinuation or reduction of nitric oxide, methemoglobin levels return to baseline over a period of hours.</p>
<p>Methemoglobin, NO2, and PaO2 should be monitored during nitric oxide administration.</p>
<p>In patients with pre-existing left ventricular dysfunction, GENOSYL may increase pulmonary capillary wedge pressure leading to pulmonary edema.</p>
<p>The most common adverse reaction is hypotension.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide donor compounds may have an additive effect with GENOSYL on the risk of developing methemoglobinemia.</p>
<p>GENOSYL must be administered using a calibrated GENOSYL Delivery System. Only validated ventilator systems should be used in conjunction with GENOSYL.</p>
<p>Please visit <a href="http://www.vero-biotech.com">www.vero-biotech.com</a> for the full Prescribing Information for GENOSYL.</p>

<p>INDIAN RIVER COUNTY — Two men are in custody Wednesday afternoon and a third is still on the run after Sheriff’s Office deputies reported gunshots fired outside Pemberly Palms Apartments in the south county area.</p>
<p>A stolen firearm was recovered, according to Sheriff’s Office spokesman Maj. Eric Flowers. Nobody was struck by any of the fired shots.</p>
<p>It appeared no apartments at the 840 5th Ave. complex or any nearby residences were struck by gunfire, Flowers said.</p>

<p>A 911 call was made around 1:20 p.m. Flowers said a man reported three men shot at him. Officers from Vero Beach and Sebastian police departments were on the scene along with Sheriff&rsquo;s Office deputies.</p>
<p>More: PSLPD: Shooting incident leads to three arrests; 2 charged with attempted murder</p>
<p>No arrests have been made, but he said those in custody could be arrested if charges arise after questioning.</p>
<p>Detectives and canines searched back lots and canal areas off Indian River Boulevard while a helicopter circled overhead.</p>
<p>Detectives took crime scene photos of a red Toyota Corolla, which was towed away around 2:30 pm by a Sheriff’s Office tow truck.</p>
<p>The car belongs to the man who reported the shooting, Flowers said.</p>
<p>He said it was too early to say what started the conflict and if anyone involved is a resident of the apartment complex.</p>

<p>Bob Wisneski, a maintenance worker at Pemberly Palms Apartments, spoke with deputies as the area was being cleared.</p>
<p>He said he noticed a heavy police presence was still blocking access to his car.</p>
<p>He attempted to get details from deputies about the incident, but couldn’t gather any information, Wisneski said.</p>
<p>“They were pretty tight-lipped about it,” Wisneski said.</p>

<p>Many stores and pharmacy&rsquo;s like Walgreens Pharmacy in the Rochester area are low on items like hand sanitizer and face masks because of fear about catching the coronavirus. (Photo: Tina MacIntyre-Yee/ Rochester Democrat and Chronicle)</p>
<p>Signage posted outside a Walgreens Pharmacy in Vero Beach indicated that the store was temporarily closed because the pharmacist was sick.</p>
<p>The Walgreens, located at 17th Street and U.S. 1, is trying to find another pharmacist to fill the void as soon as possible, the sign said. But, the store is uncertain when it will open again.</p>
