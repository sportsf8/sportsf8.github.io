<p>CARDIFF legend Peter Whittingham has died at the age of 35 following an accidental fall in a pub.</p>
<p>The Championship club confirmed the former Bluebirds midfielder had died after a police statement earlier in the week that he was in a critical condition in hospital.</p>
<p>4 Peter Whittingham is critical in hospital, say police</p>
<p>4 Peter Whittingham is said to have suffered an accidental fall at a pub</p>
<p>A club statement read: &ldquo;It is with an immeasurable amount of sorrow that we must inform supporters that Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are heartbroken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Peter’s sudden and untimely passing has shaken us to our very foundation. Our love goes out to his wife Amanda, their young son and family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are at the forefront of our thoughts and, on their behalf, we ask for their privacy to be respected at this unfathomably cruel and difficult time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First and foremost, Peter was a family man - and somebody who could light up a room with his sense of humour, warmth and personality. Then, as a professional footballer - as a Bluebird - he excelled with talent, ease, grace and humility. Nobody did it better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loss of Peter will be painfully felt by our city, supporters and indeed all who ever had the pleasure of knowing him. We love you Pete and your memory will eternally stay with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enquiries are continuing into the circumstances of the incident.&rdquo;</p>
