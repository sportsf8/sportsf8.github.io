<p>CARDIFF legend Peter Whittingham has died at the age of 35 following an accidental fall in a pub.</p>
<p>The Championship club confirmed the former Bluebirds midfielder had died after a police statement earlier in the week that he was in a critical condition in hospital.</p>
<p>4 Peter Whittingham is critical in hospital, say police</p>
<p>4 Peter Whittingham is said to have suffered an accidental fall at a pub</p>
<p>A club statement read: &ldquo;It is with an immeasurable amount of sorrow that we must inform supporters that Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are heartbroken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Peter’s sudden and untimely passing has shaken us to our very foundation. Our love goes out to his wife Amanda, their young son and family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are at the forefront of our thoughts and, on their behalf, we ask for their privacy to be respected at this unfathomably cruel and difficult time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First and foremost, Peter was a family man - and somebody who could light up a room with his sense of humour, warmth and personality. Then, as a professional footballer - as a Bluebird - he excelled with talent, ease, grace and humility. Nobody did it better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The loss of Peter will be painfully felt by our city, supporters and indeed all who ever had the pleasure of knowing him. We love you Pete and your memory will eternally stay with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TRAGIC ACCIDENT</p>
<p>On Wednesday, South Wales Police had released a statement detailing an accident that had occurred in Barry after rumours of Whittingham&rsquo;s death on social media users began to circulate.</p>
<p>It read: &ldquo;At around 10pm on March 7, South Wales Police were called to a licensed premises in Barry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A 35-year-old man from Penarth suffered a head injury as a result of a fall and remains at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this stage there is no evidence or suggestion of a criminal act, and it appears the injury was caused by an accidental fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enquiries are continuing into the circumstances of the incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BLUEBIRDS LEGEND</p>
<p>The former playmaker made 413 appearances for Cardiff, scoring 85 goals during a career spanning ten years in the Welsh capital.</p>
<p>He led the Bluebirds to the Premier League for the first time in 2013 and also helped them to the FA Cup final in 2008 and League Cup final in 2012.</p>
<p>He left the club in 2017 for Blackburn Rovers, where he made 20 appearances.</p>
<p>Whittingham’s wife Amanda is currently pregnant.</p>
<p>Peter Whittingham&rsquo;s greatest goals for Cardiff City</p>
<p>4 Whittingham spent the best part of his career at Cardiff</p>
<p>4 The midfielder enjoyed a highly successful playing career</p>
<p>He also played for England&rsquo;s Under-21s 17 times, as well as Aston Villa.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed rumours had claimed the former star ended up in hospital following an incident in the Park pub in Barry on March 7 - the same day as England vs Wales in the Six Nations.</p>
<p>But a police statement claimed that it appeared to have been an accident, with no confirmation over any arrests.
