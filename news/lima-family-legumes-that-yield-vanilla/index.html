<p>When people go plant-based they suddenly become obsessed with where to get their protein. Whether you consider yourself an athlete or you&rsquo;re just trying to slim down, and whether you want to get leaner or build stronger muscles, protein powders can be your secret weapon. But they are not all created equal and with the huge selection of choice, it can be confusing to know what to buy.</p>
<p>First a note about protein sources. Traditionally protein powders are either whey or soy. But now there is an explosion of plant-based protein that includes blended sources from pea protein, hemp, and other clean plant foods.</p>
<p>You might not expect plant-based protein powders to be as effective as whey but that&rsquo;s not the case. Not only do these powders have tons of protein, most of them also have cleaner ingredients. We picked powders with a high ratio of protein to carbs, to make sure that no matter what your goal, you&rsquo;ll get plenty of protein in every sip. For more on how to pick the right protein powder for you, check out The Beet&rsquo;s article on picking the best protein powders by a sports nutritionist. Here we tell you which ones taste great and offer the healthiest mix of benefits.</p>
<p>Getty Images</p>
<p>So you won&rsquo;t have to spend time or money searching for the best tasting plant-based protein powder, The Beet editors taste-tested 9 of the most popular powders. Not only are these expensive to buy &ndash; some of them as much as $60 for a large canister &ndash; but many of them are hard to swallow because of the chalky consistency. So we are only reviewing the ones we liked and would recommend.</p>
<p>We tell you which powders to mix with water, which ones are better when you add them to a smoothie and which are better mixed into your oatmeal. You can even add them o your pancake or muffin batter! All the powders are either soy, hemp, pea or rice-based. To be fair, we made sure the powders were all vanilla flavored to make it a level playing field. But often the chocolate or other flavors are actually tastier &ndash; so it&rsquo;s up to you when purchasing.</p>
<p>The base of Vega is pea protein, brown rice protein, and sacha inchi (a seed eaten like a nut) protein. One serving of Vega has only 80 calories and 15g of protein. Vega&rsquo;s protein powder is a great choice for anyone who struggles to get enough greens in their diet. The proteins are combined with alfalfa powder, spinach powder, broccoli powder, and organic kale powder giving you 2 servings of veggies in one scoop. The taste of this protein was described as &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; whereas others thought it tasted like birthday cake. We recommend adding this into a smoothie, but luckily all you have to add is fruit since Vega has the greens covered. This low-cal powder won&rsquo;t break the bank at $1.20 a scoop.</p>
<p>Nutrition Facts:</p>
<p>Calories: 80</p>

<p>Tom Brady&rsquo;s TB12 pea protein powder consists of simple ingredients with no additives. For anyone who is allergic to soy or nuts, TB12&rsquo;s pea protein-based powder is a great option. It&rsquo;s hard to say no to this powder with 24 grams of protein. Don&rsquo;t hide this powder in a smoothie, mix it with water and you will immediately see a thick consistency resembling a vanilla milkshake. Not only does it look like a milkshake, but it tastes like it too. TB12 recommends drinking this powder up to 20 minutes after a workout for the best recovery. You have to order this powder on the TB12 website since it isn&rsquo;t available in stores or on Amazon. Less than $2 per serving!</p>

<p>PlantFusion is a blend of peas, artichokes, algae, and superfoods. The deep yellow-gold coloring of PlantFusion&rsquo;s protein powder set this brand apart from the rest. Some testers found the flavor wasn&rsquo;t overwhelming, making it a great addition to a smoothie, whereas others felt the powder was sweet. For those of you who aren&rsquo;t a fan of Stevia, buy the natural, no-stevia blend. This protein powder is low in fat, and carbs, making it a great choice for anyone wanting to lose weight while still getting enough protein (21g a serving). PlantFusion&rsquo;s powder has a sweetness not everyone enjoyed since Stevia is an ingredient. $1.20 a scoop, makes this a deal!</p>

<p>Vivo Perform is the most superfood-packed protein powder of this bunch. Athletes will appreciate this protein powder made of pea protein, hemp protein, plant-based BCAA (branched-chain amino acids), reishi mushrooms, acai berries, lucuma fruit powder, maca powder, and turmeric extract. Vivo Perform is $59 on Amazon so go straight to their website for a cheaper price at $51 for the pouch pictured below.</p>
<p>With 25g of protein and complete amino acid profile helps athletes to build, perform, recover, and absorb. If you want a quick protein drink after a workout, use a shaker bottle when mixing or this powder will stick to the sides of the cup. In the mood for a protein-filled breakfast? Add to your oatmeal or smoothie bowl with this recipe.</p>
<p>Nutrition Facts:</p>

<p>Elevate is a pea and hemp protein-based powder that also is made with sweet potato powder. For anyone looking to convert from whey protein powders, Elevate is the plant-based protein for you. This powder is meant to be used in beverages such as smoothies. The thin consistency doesn&rsquo;t mix well with water and becomes chalky. If you aren&rsquo;t in the mood for a protein smoothie, add a scoop to your pancake batter. For a complete recipe check out Elevate&rsquo;s Chocolate Chip Banana Protein Pancakes. This powder is another affordable choice at $1.60 a scoop.</p>

<p>Momentous protein powder is a combination of pea and rice protein concentrate. Testers liked the initial scent of mint and thought it was refreshing. This powder is perfect for anyone who likes sweeter drinks. Momentous powders are NSF International Certified for Sport, which means the product label is 100% accurate and there are no banned substances present in this powder. This is one of the pricier protein powders at $60 a tub but is worth it for athletes looking for a clean and effective post-workout powder. We recommend either mixing with water or adding to a smoothie for a more nutrient-dense drink. The priciest powder of the bunch at $3 per serving.</p>
<p>Nutrition Facts:</p>
<p>Protein: 20g</p>
<p>Calories: 140</p>
<p>Total Fat: 2.5g</p>
<p>Saturated Fat: 2</p>

<p>Dietary Fiber: 4g</p>
<p>Sugars: 2g</p>
<p>Garden of Life is made of pea, buckwheat, amaranth sprout, and brown rice. We didn&rsquo;t love the green color of the powder or the way it smelled but once we mixed it with water, it tasted surprisingly good. Garden of Life is the easiest to mix with water, plan-based milk or in a smoothie. The vanilla flavor isn&rsquo;t overpowering so you can add this to any combination of smoothies and not be overwhelmed by the taste of vanilla. And it&rsquo;s only $1.20 per scoop!</p>
<p>Nutrition Facts:</p>
<p>Protein: 20g</p>
<p>Calories: 100</p>

<p>Tone It Up protein powder is a blend of sunflower seeds and pea protein. The minute we opened the container, everyone loved the smell of this powder. Tone It Up is known to be a great addition to baked goods. The next time you make your protein muffins, add Tone It Up to the mix. We don&rsquo;t suggest adding this powder with just water but instead a smoothie with fruits and veggies.</p>
<p>Nutrition Facts:</p>
<p>Protein: 15g</p>

<ol start="9">
<li>Nuzest Clean Lean Protein</li>
</ol>
<p>The name of this powder says it all. Nuzest is the cleanest protein powder since it is made out of only 3 simple ingredients: Pea protein isolate, natural vanilla flavor, and thaumatin (a low-calorie sweetener). For $45, you are supposed to get 20 servings out of one container, but at a glance that didn&rsquo;t seem accurate. This high protein, low carb powder is perfect to blend with plant-based milk and ice. The consistency is smooth and adds thickness to any protein shake.

<p>Cooking by the calendar allows for a whole new year of stirring up something we hope will be special enough to become yet another family tradition. The new year for me also becomes a gift of leftovers, not those waiting in refrigerator to be warmed up tonight for supper, but instead recipes and requests patiently waiting to be shared in a brand new year of columns and many include exciting recipes for baked beans.</p>
<p>The big deal about baked beans has everything to do with being easy to prepare and something most people truly enjoy. Years ago a baked bean dish was short, simple and delicious. Through the years, as with many other old favorites, modern touches were added, some American, others with ethnic touches.</p>
<p>But first, because I happen to have a lifetime sweet tooth, what better way to begin today’s brand new year than with hot fudge sauce made with baking cocoa as requested by Dorothy Baker and somehow misplaced along the way. There are three more if this isn’t what she’s been so patiently waiting for.</p>
<p>Hot fudge sauce</p>
<p>2 cups sugar</p>
<p>¼ cup baking cocoa</p>
<p>5-ounce can evaporated milk</p>
<p>½ cup butter, cubed</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2019/10/09/Magazine/Images/diningguidefall2019.jpg" alt="img">
No area chef brings me closer to Tokyo than Nobu Yamazaki, whose performance at the six-seat wooden counter on the second floor is the culinary equivalent of a maestro directing an orchestra. Of all the area’s fine-dining venues, this one takes us on the most affordable journey: 10 courses, featuring classical and contemporary ideas, start at $180 a person. My last feast remains etched in my mind. First, a fluffy, one-bite pâté made with monkfish liver and sticky yam. Next, a Kumamoto oyster with banana and anchovy, a startling combination that the palate ultimately green lights. “Not very fresh,” the chef says, handing over slices of tuna the color of tar. His smile signals you’ll become a fan of fish pressed with dried tomato and aged for a couple weeks, resulting in a beefy texture and lovely tang. More old-school is rice bundled in persimmon leaf and hiding luscious cured butterfish. The meal unfolds like a good story, quiet moments followed by dramatic ones. The highlight is when Yamazaki and his co-chef, Masaya Kitayama, set out six black lacquer boxes, each holding the piscine equivalent of jewels, and ask which they can turn into sashimi or sushi. (With luck, the display includes the uncommon white-fleshed, snapper-like golden thread.) Toward the end of the parade comes what looks like a sandwich; in reality, it’s an airy “roll” with the texture of an ice cream cone filled with a treasure chest of indulgences, including black truffle and foie gras. Inspired. And fun. Snagging a reservation, on the other hand, is made challenging by a restrictive list of rules and a restaurant representative with the email charm of Kim Jong-Un. Get over the hump. It gets better — worlds better — once you’re in the hands of the chef.</p>

Afternoon all,</p>
<p>It’s spring, according to the calendar, but so many of spring’s joys feel a bit muted right now, so we keep looking for ways to brighten our days.</p>
<p>Are you missing the sound of the crack of the bat? Features writer Manuel Roig-Franzia sure is, so until the players can get back on the field, he’s assuaging his longing by re-creating a favorite gameday dish: his mother’s “Baseball Chicken.” Manuel will be with us for the chat today.</p>
<p>To add a little sunshine yellow to our lives, we filled the kitchen with the scent of freshly sliced, zested and stewed lemons as we tested recipes from Daniela Galarza’s story on how to make the most of this bright citrus. If you have a bag of lemons and yearn to preserve the flavors for longer than the fresh fruit will last, read her piece here. Daniela will be with us today for the chat.</p>
<p>And, Kari Sonde, offers ideas for snacks for just about any stay-at-home occasion from movie nights to backyard picnics. (And, she gathered a batch of recipes to help us satisfy that dark chocolate craving as well.)</p>
<p>Everyone has had to change their habits to comply with the social distancing directives, including restaurants offering meal kits and oyster farmers selling (and, in some cases, delivering) the bivalves directly to consumers instead of through restaurants and bars. Lisa Elaine Held, who wrote the oyster storyy, will be in the chat today.</p>
<p>That’s because for many businesses and individuals the pandemic is not only a health concern, but a financial one. Leanne Brown, who wrote a cookbook about how to eat on just $4 a day, shared her recipe for individual Potato Leek Pizzas with us and talked with Emily Heil about ways to eat well even on a tight budget.</p>
<p>Joe Yonan’s Weeknight Vegetarian column featured a thrifty recipe, too. It’s for a Pinto Bean Tortilla Salad that gets kicked up a notch by a flavorful vinaigrette.</p>
<p>I pulled together a group of my pantry favorites – including beans and salsa &ndash; to make a comforting corn tortilla layer casserole that can be easy on the wallet, too.</p>
<p>Lead Voraciously writer Becky Krystal took a dive into our recipe archive to find the most popular Voraciously recipes “that lend themselves to flexibility and ingredients that you may already have or that can last in your cabinets or fridge.” They are a tasty bunch.</p>
<p>If your pantry or refrigerator includes half-used jars of pickled vegetables, get ready for an easy, one-skillet dish that Nourish columnist Ellie Krieger calls Antipasto Chicken.</p>
<p>Food writer Cathy Barrow is here this afternoon to talk about a dish she makes that is similar to Indian street food called Aloo Ki Tikka. The crispy cakes are full of vegetables, allowing you to use nearly any mixture of frozen veggies from the freezer.</p>
<p>As you do more pantry-friendly cooking, keep track of Becky’s continued effort to help you make do with what you can find in the grocery store these days. So far, she’s tackled baking substitutions, various egg substitutions and she’s created an overall guide to subs in everyday cooking from dairy to meat.</p>
<p>As far as Tim Carman is concerned, the dalgona is no substitution for a well-made cup of coffee. He tested the trendy concoction and concluded that there is little similarity &ldquo;between this drink and the real brewed thing.&rdquo;

Ice cream is young. For more than a thousand years, our ancestors had to settle for flavored snow — quick to vanish without modern refrigeration, and thus a luxury, reserved for the rich.</p>
<p>Sorbet was accidentally invented in the 16th century, when the Italian scientist Giambattista della Porta tried to freeze wine and wound up with boozy slush. Only in the late 17th century did someone have the grand idea of improving sorbet by using milk, “which first you must cook,” as noted in a recipe by Antonio Latini, the steward of a noble Neapolitan household.</p>
<p>But ice cream has always been part of American history — because our nation, too, is young. Thomas Jefferson wrote out a recipe for it in longhand, demanding “good cream” and a stick of vanilla, and served it encased in pastry to guests when he was president. While the French and Italians refined ice cream as an art, Americans made it the dessert of the people, building labor-saving machines that drove prices down.

<h3 id="the-good-friday-dessert-with-roots-in-the-dominican-republic-that-i-will-not-give-up">&ldquo;The Good Friday dessert with roots in the Dominican Republic that I will not give up&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/styles/open_graph/public/story/images/DSC_0107.jpg?itok=VKnxsnvE" alt="img">
The pot of lima beans, coconut milk, sugar and cinnamon simmering on the stove at my grandfather’s apartment signals two things: that it’s Holy Week, and that we will all sit down to a serving of habas con dulce, a Dominican stewed-bean dessert and one of my family’s favorites.</p>
<p>My grandfather, Adriano Manen Campusano, learned how to make the dish while growing up in the Dominican Republic, learning from his mother. Now, I am eager to learn from him.</p>
<p>We start with the lima beans simmering on the stove and the addition of cinnamon sticks and cloves. He shows me a critical test of the beans&rsquo; softness — their readiness — by placing one on my palm and squeezing it. Next, we add different milks and nutmeg. Soon the sweet smell of cinnamon fills his home.</p>
<p>While we cook, I talk to my grandfather, who I call papí, about the dish. I have known it to encompasses the creativity of impoverished people who, for centuries, have used the fruits of the land to make desserts for holidays, hoping to indulge in the sweetness of life with what was available.</p>
<p>My grandfather simply says: “Habas con dulce represents joy.”</p>
<p>It also reminds him of his mom, my great grandmother. “Eloisa Pozo was a force,” he says. “She cooked so well. You licked your fingers.” She also held on to this particular dish for generations, even as the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in the 1930s forced them to move from Villa Altagracia, a small mountainous town an hour’s drive away from Santo Domingo, to another part of the country and, eventually, New York, with little savings.</p>
<p>Pozo would also mark Holy Week by dressing in white, with a white scarf covering her head and rosary beads around her neck. The large pot of habas con dulce would boil in her backyard for hours over an open flame, which she would fan with a piece of cardboard. My grandfather helped gather the ingredients, picking lima beans and sugarcane in the fields, milking the cows and heading to the market for vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Now he buys his ingredients at the supermarket near his apartment in Brooklyn, the one that sells brands like Goya and La Flor.</p>
<p>In the Dominican Republic, my family would share the dessert with neighbors who, in exchange, gave their food, often a jar of honey or a basket of fruit from their backyards.</p>

<p>Today, though, the dessert is disappearing, overshadowed by other desserts. José Guerrero, a historian at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo, tells me that it is fading partly because of its association with lower-income people. “It’s a dish of the past,” he says</p>
<p>Back at my grandfather’s kitchen, the pot has now been on for five hours. The dessert is now a thick paste, and my relatives rush in to eat, grabbing some crispy cassava bread for dunking. As my grandfather ladles out a serving of habas con dulce, steam hits my face. I tell him that in the Good Fridays to come, I will be the safekeeper of this recipe.</p>
<p>Mama Pozo’s Habas con Dulce</p>
<p>Yield: 8 to 10 servings</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>3 16-ounce bags of lima beans</p>
<p>1 12-ounce can of evaporated milk</p>
<p>1 gallon of whole milk</p>
<p>½ cup (one stick) of unsalted butter</p>
<p>1 cup of granulated sugar</p>
<p>1 tablespoon of ground allspice</p>
<p>2 tablespoons of whole clove</p>
<p>1 tablespoon of vanilla extract</p>
<p>1 tablespoon of salt</p>
<p>1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg</p>
<p>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</p>
<p>4 cinnamon sticks</p>
<p>Preparation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Rinse lima beans under warm water for 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put beans into a large, nonstick pot. Add cold water until ¾ of the pot is full.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook beans over medium heat. Add 4 cinnamon sticks and 1 tablespoon of whole clove.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boil beans for about an hour and a half. Add an additional cup of water if the water is evaporating fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every 30 minutes, remove a bean from the pot to test that they are softening by squeezing one on your palm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the beans are soft, with an interior texture of a paste, add whole milk, evaporated milk and coconut milk. (If the water has not reduced by half, remove a cup of water before adding milks.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir and lower the heat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add allspice, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, additional tablespoon of clove, and salt.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stir again and simmer for 30 minutes on low heat, periodically stirring.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>After 30 minutes, add sugar, vanilla extract and butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simmer for one hour, stirring every 6 to 10 minutes to make sure that the milk, sugar, and beans are not sticking to the bottom of the pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After one hour, taste mixture. You may add more sugar or spices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cook until you can dunk a spoon into the mixture and trace a line across the back of the spoon with your fingertip. If the line remains visible, the mixture is thick enough; if it doesn&rsquo;t, cook a bit longer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the mixture is thick enough, turn off the heat and serve warm. Enjoy with cassava bread.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Even if you’re not a football fan, you know that the big game is on Sunday. If you’re having a crowd over or want to bring a dish to a game-day party, we’ve got you covered with Becky Krystal’s take on popular Hot Buffalo Chicken Dip. She predicts it will disappear soon after it hits the table.</p>
<p>Becky also found a half dozen chili recipes in our Recipe Finder that would make great dishes for Sunday or any chilly day. Kari Sonde gathered other Super Bowl party recipes to round out your game-day menu.</p>
<p>And, to go with those corn chips, Emily Heil, did the heavy lifting to determine which are the best jarred salsas on the grocery shelves.</p>
<p>I love chicken thighs. You love chicken thighs. This super simple recipe with a honey-citrus sauce turns a good thing into a perfect, one-pan weeknight dinner.</p>
<p>Speaking of things everyone loves, Joe Yonan’s Weeknight Vegetarian column takes mac and cheese to the next level. He adds lots of green veggies to give it a nutritional boost. The crunchy almond topping seals the deal.</p>
<p>Becky offers sound advice for seasoning and caring for your cast iron.</p>
<p>Our intrepid colleagues have stayed true to their food resolutions for January 2020. This week, they share the ups and downs of striving to make healthful breakfasts, lunches and dinners, eat more plants and enjoy meals with friends.</p>
<p>Cathy Barrow taught us how to make a delicious breakfast sausage patty out of turkey. It’s got a dollop of crème fraiche, which adds flavorful fat to the mixture. Cathy adds the patty to a breakfast sandwich of scrambled eggs and cheese on an English muffin. We devoured them.</p>
<p>Do you have a picky little eater? JJ Goode, who writes cookbooks with chefs, reveals what it is like to love food, and to slowly realize that his kids would probably prefer a “peanut-butter-and-jelly parent.”</p>
<p>Talk about simple: Ellie Krieger’s pineapple drizzled with a spiced honey is a perfect way to brighten a wintry meal.</p>
<p>Have you been wondering just how effective those dietary supplements are? Tamar Haspel posed the question: “Which dietary supplements actually have well-established benefits?” The answer: It&rsquo;s a short list.
