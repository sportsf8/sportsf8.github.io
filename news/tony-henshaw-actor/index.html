The final episode of The A Word series 3 pays touching tribute to Tony Henshaw but just who was this much-loved crew member?</p>
<p>It has been three years since The A Word last appeared on our screens and it’s safe to say that a lot has changed in that time.</p>
<p>When series 2 aired in 2017, no one could have predicted that series 3 would arrive amidst the worst pandemic in over 100 years and we’d be forced to watch the much-loved drama while in a nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>Well, that’s exactly what has happened but as a result, you could argue that series 3 couldn’t have arrived at a better time.</p>
<p>Not only that, but thanks to BBC iPlayer, all six episodes of the new series are available to watch now.</p>
<p>And for those who have binged their way to the end of series 3, they will have been greeted with a touching tribute as the final set of credits started to roll.</p>

<p>The A Word series 3 on the BBC</p>
<p>Series 3 of The A Word arrived on BBC One on May 5th, 2020.</p>
<p>On top of that, all six episodes in the new series arrived on BBC iPlayer at the same time.</p>
<p>Series 3 offers up the biggest shake up in young Joe Hughes’ life as his parents, Paul and Alison, are in the midst of a split that leaves Joe travelling between Manchester and the Lake District, something that he struggles with due to his autism.</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>The ending of episode 6</p>
<p>Series 3 of The A Word ends in typically charming fashion.</p>
<p>After returning home pregnant from university earlier in the series, Joe’s sister, Rebecca, gives birth after going into labour in the middle of their journey home.</p>
<p>Following the drama of episode 6, the family regroup for a family photo and we end the series with Joe singing along to his music as he walks down a scenic Lake District road.</p>
<p>Just as the credits start to roll, a touching tribute appears in memory of Tony Henshaw but just who was this much-loved figure?</p>

<p>Who was Tony Henshaw?</p>

BBC One’s The A Word has returned to our screens for a third series but what do we know about the actor playing Joe in the series?</p>
<p>The BBC has always had a penchant for creating poignant drama series and in The A Word, BBC One has found itself a real gem.</p>
<p>The series follows the Hughes family as they and their son, Joe, are forced to change their whole outlook after he is diagnosed with autism.</p>
<p>We caught our first glimpse of The A Word on the BBC back in 2016 and a second series followed in 2017.</p>
<p>Now, in 2020, The A Word’s long-awaited third series is here and fans have once again been captivated by the story of Joe Hughes.</p>
<p>But many have been left wondering if the actor who plays Joe also has autism or not.</p>

<p>The A Word series 3 on BBC One</p>
<p>Series 3 of The A Word got underway on May 5th, 2020 on BBC One.</p>
<p>It has been three long years since we last met up with the Hughes family in The A Word and a lot has changed in that time.</p>
<p>Parents Paul and Alison have split up since we last saw them and are living 100 miles apart.</p>
<p>For young Joe, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of five, having his strict routines changed around as he travels between two homes proves to be a tough challenge.</p>
<p>Who is the actor playing Joe?</p>
<p>The actor playing Joe in The A Word is Max Vento.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old actor has been acting since the age of five when, in 2015, he appeared in the short film Empty Spaces.</p>
<p>That set Max Vento up for his first TV appearance in The A Word, series 1 of which began in 2016 and has been followed by two series since.</p>
<p>At such a young age, Max Vento is definitely just starting out in his career but after impressing so much in The A Word, we’re sure it won’t be long before the rising star appears elsewhere.</p>
<p>This content could not be loaded How had Max Vento not won any awards for The A Word? — The Ginger Luke (@llama_bottle0) May 6, 2020</p>
<p>Is Max Vento autistic, like his character?</p>
<p>No, unlike the character Joe Hughes in the series, Max Vento is not autistic according to Entertainment Daily.</p>
<p>However, as viewers of the show can attest, the 10-year-old actor certainly plays the part extremely convincingly and brings so much childish charm to the role.</p>
<p>While Max Vento may not be autistic, like his character, the show has still won a huge amount of praise for its portrayal of the condition and also for including actors with other conditions such as Down’s syndrome.</p>
<p>The six-episode series is set to air weekly on Tuesday evenings until the sixth and final episode arrives on June 9th. As well as that, all six episodes of the new series are available to stream now on BBC iPlayer.</p>

<p>Series 3 of The A Word has proven to be a real treat on BBC One and iPlayer but fans are already asking ‘will there be a series 4?’</p>
<p>Thanks to the troubling times we’re currently living through, we all need some form of distraction to keep ourselves sane and entertained.</p>
<p>As a result, series 3 of The A Word could not have arrived on the BBC at a better time.</p>
<p>The charming drama series returned to BBC One and iPlayer on May 5th and continues the story of Joe Hughes as he is forced to deal with an ever-changing set of circumstances.</p>
<p>However, for those fans who have watched all six new episodes already on BBC iPlayer, attention is already turning towards whether or not the show will return for a fourth series.</p>
<p>The A Word: Series 3 Trailer | BBC Trailers brid 538648 The A Word: Series 3 Trailer | BBC Trailers /static/uploads/2020/04/547438_t_1587579570.jpg 547438 center</p>
<p>The A Word series 3 on the BBC</p>
<p>The first episode of The A Word’s third series arrived on BBC One on May 5th and the entire six-episode series followed suit on BBC iPlayer on the same day.</p>
<p>Series 3 offers up an unwanted shake up for Joe Hughes, who suffers from autism, as his parents have split up and are living 100 miles away from each other, something that doesn’t agree with Joe’s strict routines.</p>
<p>Not only that but Joe’s sister, Rebecca, returns pregnant from university and the family must prepare for an unexpected new arrival.</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>Will there be a series 4 of The A Word?</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unconfirmed whether or not The A Word will return for a fourth series.</p>
<p>This is hardly surprising as only two episodes of the series have aired on BBC One at the time of writing.</p>
<p>For those who have watched their way through series 3 on iPlayer, you’ll know that the final moments of series 3 could work as a final conclusion to the show but there’s still a lot of unexplored potential in the series.</p>
<p>It would undoubtedly be fascinating to keep on following Joe as he continues to grow up and now there’s a new family member among the cast, there’s almost certainly a lot of interest to see how Joe would cope with a newborn baby in the family.</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>Fans certainly want more</p>
<p>The reaction to series 3 of The A Word on social media has been overwhelmingly positive as the charming series has managed to steal our hearts once again.</p>
<p>One fan on Twitter wrote: “binge watched this fantastic show and cast. Please let there be a series 4. Best thing on tv for ages.”</p>
<p>While another added: “Watched all of series 3 of The A Word tonight. Loved every single part of it! Amazing actors and scenery plus the music is fantastic! Please please please let there be a series 4”</p>
<p>And finally, this fan has already identified what they want from a fourth series: “The relationship between Rebecca and Joe is the best in the series and makes me cry every single time they’re on screen together. We need a series 4 for more Rebecca and Joe”</p>
<p>If a fourth series of The A Word is on the cards, it could be some time away yet. Don’t forget there was a three-year gap between series 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Either way, series 3 of The A Word continues on Tuesday evenings on BBC One while the entire series is available to stream now on iPlayer.</p>

<p>It’s back and it’s brilliant, but who plays Joe in The A Word? Fans are once again blown away by the young star’s performance.</p>
<p>We’ve already been invited to immerse ourselves in so much fantastic television this year, but you just can’t beat returning to a fond favourite.</p>
<p>A number of great shows have returned with new seasons recently, but right now, all eyes are on The A Word.</p>
<p>Written and developed by Peter Bowker, it arrived back in 2016 and is actually based on an Israeli series called Yellow Peppers, which first aired in 2010. The remake, of sorts, has gained significant acclaim for the start and there are no signs of diminishing praise as season 3 continues to make its way to fans.</p>
<p>Who plays Joe in The A Word?</p>
<p>In The A Word, the character of Joe is played by Max Vento.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old performer does an absolutely fantastic job, encouraging audiences to question whether he himself has autism.</p>
<p>You may be surprised to hear that he doesn’t, in fact, have autism, despite the very convincing portrayal. He’s simply a phenomenally skilled screen talent.</p>
<p>In his actor profile on Mandy, he writes: “I am a typical little boy who loves drama and acting. I have appeared in Annie and I have also appeared in a commercial for Better Bathrooms…”</p>
<p>Why was Max Vento cast in The A Word?</p>
<p>In an interview with the Mirror, series writer Peter Bowker explained why he cast Max, as there has actually been some backlash for not casting an actor with autism. He weighed in:</p>
<p>“I have always been committed to casting people with disabilities to play characters with disabilities. But it was too big an ask for a six-year-old on the autistic spectrum to imitate a whole range of emotions in keeping with the piece. By definition, they have difficulty processing and imitating.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, he also adds that he didn’t want the character to feel over-dramatised as Joe has less overt symptoms.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the decision makes sense. Considering just how convincing and exceptional the young talent is in the part, we’d say they made the right decision in helping audiences understand autism.</p>

<p>Max Vento: Previous roles</p>
<p>According to IMDb, he has also appeared in two short films.</p>
<p>The first came back in 2015’s Empty Spaces (he played Michael). Directed by Aidey Pugh, it tells the story of a family who clashes with others over a parking space.</p>
<p>Next, we have 2017’s Cotton Wool (Sam), which is about two children who must look after their mother when she suffers a stroke. It’s incredibly impactful stuff, also starring Leanne Best (The Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death).</p>
<p>He’s exceptional in The A Word and we’re sure he’s destined for more great things in the near future.</p>
<p>In other news, The Split deserves to be renewed.

<h3 id="the-famous-people-who-have-died-so-far-in-2020">&ldquo;The famous people who have died so far in 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article17643641.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_celebrities-main.jpg" alt="img">
It is the start of the second month of 2020 but so far this year we have already lost some huge names from the worlds of sport, television, and music.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most shocking was the death of basketball legend Kobe Bryant and his teenage daughter Gianna in a Los Angeles helicopter crash that killed nine people in total.</p>
<p>Last year saw the deaths of stars including It Ain&rsquo;t Half Hot Mum actor Windsor Davies in January, the shocking death of The Prodigy frontman Keith Flint, the sad loss of stalwart Newport MP Paul Flynn, and the sudden passing of television chef Gary Rhodes in November.</p>
<p>We have taken a look back at the the stars we have lost this year already and the lasting memories they have left behind.</p>
<p>January</p>
<p>Derek Acorah</p>
<p>The self-styled spiritual medium, whose real name was Derek Johnson, died right at the beginning of the year aged 69.</p>
<p>It was revealed he had been treated in intensive care following a &ldquo;brief illness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Born in Bootle, Liverpool, in January 1950, he shot to fame on Most Haunted, which ran from 2002 to 2010 and returned in an online edition and on Really TV at various times until 2019. He also went on to present Derek Acorah&rsquo;s Ghost Towns.</p>
<p>Christopher Beeny</p>

<p>The star of Upstairs Downstairs and Last Of The Summer Wine died at the age of 78.</p>
<p>He was best known for playing butler Edward Barnes in TV series Upstairs Downstairs.</p>
<p>The popular series, which aired in the 1970s and was a ratings hit for ITV, told the story of Lord and Lady Bellamy and their upper-crust household at 165 Eaton Place in Belgravia.</p>
<p>He also appeared in In Loving Memory as Billy Henshaw opposite Dame Thora Hird and as Lenny Grove in The Grove Family. He was also a regular guest star on Last Of The Summer Wine until 2009 when he joined the cast.</p>
<p>His screen debut was in The Long Memory in 1953, also opposite Dame Thora, after he trained at the Royal Academy Of Dramatic Art.</p>
<p>He went on to make regular appearance in the theatre including in Stop The World – I Want To Get Off, Oliver!, and Boeing Boeing and he toured the play There&rsquo;s No Place Like A Home with &lsquo;Allo &lsquo;Allo&rsquo;s Gorden Kaye.</p>
<p>Neil Peart</p>

<p>The rock world paid tribute to Rush drummer Neil Peart when he died aged 67 of brain cancer.</p>
<p>Widely considered one of the greatest rock and roll drummers ever, the Canadian musician played with the band for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>Rush was formed in 1968 and is known for hits including The Spirit Of Radio and Tom Sawyer. The power trio also included bassist and singer Geddy Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson.</p>
<p>Derek Fowlds</p>

<p>His family said he died at his home in London after battling a rare form of dementia.</p>
<p>In a statement the actor’s family said: &ldquo;His work with Monty Python, his books, films, television programmes, poems and other work will live on forever, a fitting legacy to a true polymath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The five-time NBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medallist was 41.</p>
<p>Thousands gathered in Los Angeles, where Bryant spent his entire glittering 20-year NBA career, to pay tribute with a vigil outside the Staples Center, home of the shooting guard&rsquo;s LA Lakers team.</p>
<p>A shrine to Bryant – who became an Oscar winner in 2018 for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball, which he wrote and narrated – was set up outside the stadium complete with candles, flowers, and photographs from fans.</p>
<p>Nicholas Parsons</p>
<p>Just a Minute host Nicholas Parsons died aged 96 after a short illness.</p>
<p>He was best known for the show, where panellists have to speak for one minute without hesitation, deviation, or repetition. He first fronted the show on its inception in 1967.</p>
<p>The broadcaster missed a recording of the BBC Radio 4 show for only the second time in more than 50 years last summer due to a bad back.</p>
<p>BBC director general Tony Hall said: &ldquo;Very few people have done so much to entertain audiences over the decades and no-one deserves to be called a broadcasting legend more than Nicholas Parsons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His charm, inventive intellect, and ability to create laughs were unsurpassed. Our thoughts are with his family and all who knew him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>February</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is with tremendous sadness that my brothers and I announce that Kirk Douglas left us today at the age of 103,&rdquo; the 75-year-old said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the world he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years, a humanitarian whose commitment to justice and the causes he believed in set a standard for all of us to aspire to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motor racing great died at the age of 90 following a long illness.</p>
<p>His wife Lady Moss said: &ldquo;It was one lap too many. He just closed his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Moss famously never won the Formula One title, he finished runner-up four times and came third three times in a career during which he won 16 Grands Prix.</p>
<p>His sportsmanship cost him the title in 1958 when he defended the actions of rival Mike Hawthorne following a spin at the Portuguese Grand Prix, sparing Hawthorne a six-point penalty. Hawthorne went on to beat Moss to the title by a single point.</p>
<p>Moss&rsquo; first Grand Prix victory came in the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree as he became the first British driver to win the event.</p>
<p>In an age when racing drivers competed in several different disciplines alongside Formula One, Moss won a total of 212 of the 529 races he entered in his 14-year career, which began in 1948.</p>

<p>Alongside Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, The Goodies TV show attracted millions of viewers in its heyday.</p>
<p>Brooke-Taylor began his acting career at Cambridge University where he was president of the famed Footlights performing arts club.</p>
<p>He toured internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964 before finding wider recognition for his work on BBC Radio with I&rsquo;m Sorry, I&rsquo;ll Read That Again.</p>
<p>Brooke-Taylor moved into TV with At Last The 1948 Show, where he starred alongside John Cleese and Graham Chapman.</p>
<p>But it was as one of The Goodies, alongside Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie, that he found international fame, earning household name status in Australia and New Zealand and attracting millions of viewers in its heyday.</p>
