<p>To mark the release of Human Contact, the debut album by York band The Howl &amp; The Hum, David Nicholson takes a listen and remembers where, for him, it all began</p>
<p>Wednesday night for me is the quiz with Tom Adams in the chair at The Swan in Bishy Road, followed by a swift bike ride to catch the last hour of the open mic night at The Habit in Goodramgate.</p>
<p>And this particular Wednesday five years ago – or maybe it was six, I forget, that’s what a lifetime of late-night gig-going does for the memory – was no different.</p>
<p>A young student from the University of York had dropped by and was given his chance to play by the host, David Ward Maclean. “Hi, I’m Sam Griffiths,” he said, before being almost drowned out by the noise from the bar.</p>
<p>Then he played Videotapes, a song he used to play in his band in his home town of Colchester.</p>
<p>Now, at this point in a film script it usually says, “then the crowd fell silent, they knew they were experiencing something special”. But the Habit’s raucous drinkers didn’t.</p>
<p>The noise from the bar continued, though those regulars nearest to the window seat that passes for the Habit’s stage area started to show an interest in the music from the fresh-faced English Literature student whose clear voice cut through the clamour. Polite applause followed.</p>
<p>Then, a dramatic pause, and a glowering glare from Mr Ward Maclean, and a break that was just long enough to command an uneasy calm. Sam introduced his second song, a cover version of Blondie’s Heart Of Glass, which he reinterpreted in the style of the blues and gospel singer, Reverend Gary Davis.</p>

<p>Who was this kid who had the effrontery to turn that tune, a beautiful, post-punk, pop classic, into an undulating yet wistful ragtime lament? This was the moment when the crowd really did fall silent, we knew we were experiencing something special… and I still get goosebumps just remembering it.</p>
<p>I was with my friend, Sam Rowntree, a shrewd judge of good music; we turned to each other, not quite believing what we were witnessing.</p>
<p>Going to new heights</p>

<p>In the weeks that followed, Sam Griffiths became something of a regular at the Habit and the city’s other open mic nights, notably Boss Caine’s rumbustious Sunday night ‘Busk at Dusk’ and Chris Helme’s excellent Ruby Tuesdays at Sotano’s, the dive bar beneath Kennedy’s in Little Stonegate.</p>
<p>We got to know Sam and his passion for Bob Dylan; indeed, he was working on a dissertation at York Uni, it was on the lyrics of Bob Dylan’s classic break-up album, Blood On The Tracks. It seemed that every musician in York wanted to play alongside him.</p>
<p>He was eager to learn too. David Ward Maclean shared ideas and we introduced Sam to the music of John Prine and Eef Barzelay’s Clem Snide, and one of my heroes, Loudon Wainwright III.</p>
<p>Within a week of sharing Loudon’s first album with him, he was playing the classic, School Days, in the Habit, better than Loudon himself might have played it. I’d never experienced anyone so eager to soak everything up so voraciously.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he teamed up with Kai West, Ben Crosthwaite and Rupert Engledow in the Hyde Family Jam, taking busking in the city to new heights. And when university ended, he stayed on here, officially a Yorkie now.</p>
<p>Hard to categorise</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before he teamed up with versatile bass-player Bradley Blackwell to form a band with guitarist Conor Hirons (formerly with York favourites, The Littlemores). Jonny Hooker, now the main producer at the city’s burgeoning label, Young Thugs, drummed with the band for a while before Jack Williams joined to complete the line-up.</p>
<p>As with all the best original bands, their music was hard to categorise. They jokingly refer to their genre as ‘miserable disco’ but that fails to do justice to intelligent lyrics that stick in the memory, riding on a wave of melodic rock with a dramatic edge to it.</p>
<p>They have been favourably compared to Alt-J, Portishead and Massive Attack. But those comparisons hint only at a fraction of the potential of this band. The lyrical brilliance sets this band in a class of their own, where they might be better compared to Radiohead or Elbow.</p>
<p>They quickly caught the ear of a couple of music industry insiders and, though a record deal soon followed, they resisted rushing to make their first album. They have wisely taken their time with extensive touring and one-off gigs, honing their craft, writing and growing a loyal fanbase.</p>
<p>Along the way, they have been championed by influential broadcasters, including Huw Stephens, Tom Robinson and Annie Mac.</p>
<p>You’ll have gathered that I’m not in a position to give an unbiased opinion of the album here, but you’ll have to take me at my word when I say that Human Contact is a great debut album.</p>
<p>The jury is out as to whether the title is a stroke of prescient brilliance during these socially isolated times… but the 13 tracks showcase The Howl &amp; The Hum’s versatility and lyrical deftness, and live up to the promise of the early singles and videos they have released in the last three years.</p>
<p>Some fans may be surprised by what is not included in this set. If you are even remotely familiar with any of the band’s earlier material that hasn’t made it on to the album, that should give you an idea of the quality on offer.</p>
<p>You can find them on YouTube still, but Godmanchester Chinese Bridge, I Wish I Was A Shark, Portrait I, Murder, and Don’t Shoot The Storm are all excluded so we’ll probably have to wait for TH&amp;TH Greatest Hits Volume 1 a few years from now before they surface again.</p>
<p>Track by track</p>
<p>Here’s a track-by-track flavour of the album.</p>
<p>Love You Like A Gun</p>
<p>Written in the studio, a sparse, unadorned drumbeat kicks things off, overlaid with Sam’s soaring vocal carrying the melody before it bursts into an engaging, near-acapella vocal jousting. An exhilarating opening.</p>
<p>Human Contact</p>
<p>Jack and Bradley’s rhythm section hit a hypnotic groove in this story of yearning to be truly alive. Having seen this on stage, complete with transfixingly jerky performance, I’m reminded of the angular yet warm delivery that Devo used to employ in their compelling stage show.</p>
<p>Hall Of Fame</p>
<p>The lyric imagines a band on their tenth anniversary tour, attempting to recapture their youth and former glories.</p>
<p>‘When the waves go still</p>
<p>Will you be backstage?…</p>
<p>… You tell me I’m holding</p>
<p>My past by the throat</p>
<p>But I saw the photos</p>
<p>You keep in your coat’</p>
<p>Hostages</p>
<p>A contender for one of the best break-up songs. The lyric imagines a hand-over moment, as in the film Bridge of Spies, when a couple split, but they have to return each other’s belongings, as if the items themselves were hostages, each item being emblematic of the broken relationship. A song of rare elegaic beauty.</p>
<p>Murmur</p>
<p>I first heard this slice of brooding menace at Chris Sherrington’s excellent Fulford Arms venue, and it grows stronger with repeated listening. A slow-paced ghostly tale told by someone haunted by their own imagination. A tone-poem for a film yet to be shot.</p>
<p>The Only Boy Racer Left On The Island</p>
<p>While paying their dues on the touring circuit, the band played Orkney. In their cramped tour van they were overtaken by a youngster on the island, as if in a race; fully expecting other boy racers to be following, but all they got was the same boy overtaking them again and again, circling the island alone, endlessly.</p>
<p>Conor’s delicate, understated guitar holds this gem together, while the lyric hints at childhood, masculinity, loss, loneliness, family and belonging. Yet through it all, there is a note of hope that ‘No man gets left behind.’</p>
<p>A simply astonishing track.</p>
<p>Got You On My Side</p>
<p>Deceptively simple idea conveyed with subtle repetition. The speaker can’t quite declare his love, that might come later. But the stepping stone is to acknowledge the value of the relationship:</p>
<p>‘You take me for Jekyll and for Hyde</p>
<p>Baby I’m glad that I got you on my side’</p>
<p>Until I Found A Rose</p>
<p>When a friend of Sam’s found the love of his life, it turned his fortunes around. Fortunately, for the imagery of the song, the significant other was called Rose.</p>
<p>A Hotel Song</p>
<p>First airing for a new song from a poem Sam wrote while on tour, imagining a world-weary entertainer still moving from hotel to hotel, and remembering how, as a born entertainer, ‘You should’ve seen me at seventeen.’ As with all these lyrics, the filmic sense of mood created is almost palpable; this being somewhere between Paris Texas and The Florida Project.</p>
<p>Smoke</p>
<p>Modestly described by Sam as his attempt to recreate a melodic pop song of the type he liked as a 17-year-old. But this is altogether more adult:</p>
<p>‘We’ll quit smoking</p>
<p>After this cigarette</p>
<p>We’ll quit smoking</p>
<p>But I don’t want to yet…</p>
<p>….I think we’re addicted</p>
<p>To more than just the cigarette’</p>
<p>Sweet Fading Silver</p>
<p>There are so many stand-out moments on the album, so it’s hard to single out any one individual track. But this six-and-a-half-minute epic is a strong contender, with the band working seamlessly as a unit, slowly building to a magnificent climax.</p>
<p>It’s a tale of a lost romance, perfectly capturing the emptiness and longing of remembering the moments. A kind of snapshot of a lost past, all symbolised in the memories of what happened in ‘Your Dad’s Fiat Punto in sweet fading silver.’</p>
<p>When the climax comes, we’re urged to ‘Hold on to the past cos the future’ll haunt you’ before fading out, ‘Drunk in the back of your car again.’ A masterpiece.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>And while you’re still reeling from the majesty of Sweet Fading Silver, we’re bumped down to earth with what Sam describes as a ‘kind of murder ballad.’ It’s another cinematic lyric with the singer, who ‘burnt out at 27’, telling someone they should have killed when they had the chance. They’re caught between wanting to let go of someone but not finding the strength to go through with it.</p>
<p>Pigs</p>
<p>This final track is presented almost as a gimmicky afterthought (on the two-disc 33rpm album, this is in the middle of the disc on side D and requires the turntable to be cranked to 45rpm!) But it’s far from an afterthought. It has a real lyrical punch wrapped up in a sweet tune.</p>
<p>Sam says: “The idea to present it like that, at the end of the album, was influenced by LCD Soundsystem. On their album Sound of Silver, they threw in a final end-of-album track, New York I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down. It seemed like one sweet thing, but turned into something else.”</p>
<p>Well, TH&amp;TH succeed. Set against a church organ and a hymn-like delivery, it opens with the sweet-sounding:</p>
<p>‘Such a beautiful day</p>
<p>To sit in the dark</p>
<p>While the world turns away’</p>
<p>But by the end of the song we’re told:</p>
<p>‘Pigs fly in the world</p>
<p>Pigs land the job</p>
<p>Pigs get the girl.’</p>
<p>A clever twist to end a stunning debut.

<h3 id="rock-producer-rupert-hine-who-worked-alongside-tina-turner-the-fixx-and-rush-dies-at-72">&ldquo;Rock Producer Rupert Hine, Who Worked Alongside Tina Turner, The Fixx and Rush, Dies at 72&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/06/Rupert-Hine-1973-london-billboard-1548-1591366789-1024x677.jpg" alt="img">
OBITUARY Rock Producer Rupert Hine, Who Worked Alongside Tina Turner, The Fixx and Rush, Dies at 72</p>
<p>British producer, songwriter and advocate Rupert Hine, who put his stamp on classic albums dating back five decades and who carved out an enduring recording career of his own, has died at the age of 72. The London native&rsquo;s death was confirmed by U.K. songwriters and composers body The Ivors Academy, of which he was a member of the board. &ldquo;His passion, wisdom, inspiration and his immense kindness will be hugely missed,&rdquo; the organization said. His cause of death was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Hine started out in the music business in the mid-1960s as half of folk duo Rupert &amp; David before launching a solo career in the early &rsquo;70s and later stints with the bands Quantum Jump and Spin 1ne 2wo. As a solo artist he cut six albums under his name and three under the alias Thinkman, according to his website.</p>
<p>He also penned tracks for other artists and wrote and produced the soundtrack for the 1985 John Cusack comedy Better Off Dead.</p>
<p>But it was as a producer that Hine made the biggest impact in popular culture. While the 1970s were a busy time for Hine, with titles by Camel, Anthony Phillips (ex-Genesis) and Kevin Ayers (ex-Soft Machine) to his credit, it wasn’t until New Wave engulfed the 1980s that he reached international success by becoming the go-to producer for The Fixx and Howard Jones, two of the genre’s biggest acts. Hine helmed the first four studio albums by The Fixx, including 1983’s Reach the Beach and its top-5 hit &ldquo;One Thing Leads to Another,&rdquo; and the first two albums by Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An extraordinary man and one of my dearest longtime friends, my music mentor and producer, passed away in the early hours of this morning,&rdquo; Jones said on Twitter, adding that he had just spent time with Hine this week.</p>
<p>Hine also had a hand in crafting Tina Turner’s 1984 juggernaut Private Dancer, having produced the single “Better Be Good to Me,” a top-5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 that earned a Grammy Award — for best rock vocal performance, female — in 1985. He also co-wrote and produced “Break Every Rule,” the title track to Turner’s 1986 album, and again collaborated with the rock legend on 1989’s Foreign Affair.</p>
<p>Other production credits from the decade include Stevie Nicks’ The Other Side of the Mirror, as well as albums by the Thompson Twins, Underworld, Saga and Chris De Burgh, among others. He also linked up with progressive rock heroes Rush for a two-album run that included 1989’s Presto and 1991’s Roll the Bones.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Hine worked on albums with Bob Geldof and French artist Éric Serra, as well as releases by actresses Katey Sagal and Milla Jovovich. One of his biggest hits of the decade arrived in 1996, when he produced the self-titled debut album by Duncan Sheik, which included modern rock radio staples &ldquo;Barely Breathing&rdquo; and &ldquo;She Runs Away.&rdquo; The pair teamed up again with 1998’s Humming.</p>
<p>Hine continued his work in the 21st Century, producing albums for Suzanne Vega, Ra, Stuart Davis and others. In 2008 he oversaw the benefit album Songs for Tibet: The Art of Peace, which had contributions from Rush, Vega, Sheik, Sting, Alanis Morissette, Ben Harper and Hine himself, among others. A follow-up compilation, meant to mark the Dalai Lama’s 80th birthday, featured Peter Gabriel, Lorde, Kate Bush, Elbow, Sheik and Howard Jones.</p>
<p>Billboard&rsquo;s The Encyclopedia Of Record Producers — for which he wrote the forward — states that &ldquo;few producers have worked with as wide a stylistic range of gold and platinum-selling artists as Hine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An early adopter of electronic music production techniques, Hine was a founding member of Music Producers Guild, the International MIDI Association and a member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in the US. In 2011 he received an APRS Fellowship Award, and he has sat on the boards of committees for BASCA and the Ivors Academy.</p>
<p>In 2011, Hine launched Auditorius, a joint venture with BMG Rights Management.</p>
<p>Hine is survived by his wife Fay and son Kingsley.</p>

<h3 id="elbows-guy-garvey-joins-fight-to-help-save-liverpools-parr-street-studios-liverpool-cant-lose-this-jewel">&ldquo;Elbow’s Guy Garvey joins fight to help save Liverpool’s Parr Street Studios: “Liverpool can’t lose this jewel”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ydraft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1159273484_ELBOW_2000-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
Elbow’s Guy Garvey has joined a list of new names speaking out to help save Liverpool’s iconic Parr Street Studios.</p>
<p>The recording studio, which has seen the likes of Bjork, Grace Jones, Coldplay, Motorhead, Stereophonics, Blossoms, Justin Bieber and Rihanna record there since its opening in 1991, is under threat from developers who want to turn the area into luxury apartments unless officials step in.</p>
<p>Speaking about the possible closure, Garvey said: “Liverpool can’t lose this jewel. Parr Street has to be preserved. It’s one of the few precious cathedrals to music creation and production left.</p>
<p>“With Ben Hillier, Elbow made our first two records at Parr Street Studios – and those records remain the most original intricate and soulful that we’ve made. We discovered what we do there. It shaped us for the career to follow and was quite literally the time of our lives. The excellent design of the studios is only one element. It welcomed us in to the heart of the great city of Liverpool. A place that feeds the creative soul with its history and culture.</p>
<p>He continued: “Nigel Godrich once compared losing these places and the passed down art of high-end studio production to losing painting or sculpture. These places make music better. Love music. Love Parr Street. Parr Street’s history alone should be enough to protect it. What will be lost to future generations if it closes is incalculable. It’s priceless.”</p>
<p>A group called the ‘Friends of Parr Street Studios’ has now also been set up to help support the venue. The group, which includes many musicians, have submitted a formal application to Liverpool City Council to consider the studios as a “community asset” – a building with cultural importance to both the city and the music economy of the UK.</p>
<p>Others voicing support include The Liverpool City Region Music Board. Made up of 18 local members and observers from across the music industry, the Board was formed to “support and grow the music economy in the Liverpool City Region, and to give music businesses and communities in the Liverpool City Region a stronger voice in local and regional decision making.”</p>
<p>In a statement, they said: “Parr Street Studios is a cherished and vital part of Liverpool’s music eco-system. Beyond that, it is a studio with global recognition and, as such, enhances Liverpool’s reputation as a music city.</p>
<p>“As part of Liverpool’s artistic history and legacy, studios are an essential part of our ecology and crucial to the continuing success and growth of Liverpool’s music sector. Parr Street Studios was purpose built. It is not something that can be replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the internationally recognised brand of Parr Street is something that has taken 25 years to build. This would be destroyed overnight.</p>
<p>“There are many other buildings within the city that have undeniable cultural value and are protected as a result. Parr Street Studios should be recognised with the same importance.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, further support came from Travis‘ Andy Dunlop, The Lightening Seeds’ Ian Broudie, Brian Jonestown Massacre’s Anton Newcombe, Public Image Limited’s Jah Wobble and Echo and the Bunnymen’s Will Sergeant.</p>
<p>Dunlop said: “I’m gutted to hear about the plans for Parr Street Studios…Not only would it be a blow to the Liverpool musical community…but a blow to the UK musical community also, as it is a world class sounding studio. Studios are so much more than just the gear and the flashing lights, they embody a spirit that is engraved into their very soul from the years of great music made there, and Parr Street has one of the best spirits.”</p>
<p>Broudie added: “It’s a shame that a city like Liverpool, with its fabulous musical and artistic heritage, is so quick to throw away the jewels of its culture while they are still creating wonderful treasures and inspiring new generations. Parr Street Studios is another example of this and should be guarded fiercely.”</p>
<p>The studios, along with music venues Studio 2 and Attic, are at risk due to a planning application which has been submitted by Liverpool-based contractor PJ Percival Construction to Liverpool City Council. The application states that the contractors are planning to build a hotel and 114 apartments as part of a six-to-eight-storey development.</p>

<h3 id="elbow-tell-nme-about-different-new-album-giants-of-all-sizes">&ldquo;Elbow tell NME about &lsquo;different&rsquo; new album &lsquo;Giants Of All Sizes&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1159273484_ELBOW_2000.jpg" alt="img">
Elbow have confirmed details of their new album ‘Giants Of All Sizes’, which will be released on October 11.</p>
<p>The band’s eighth album, it follows 2017’s ‘Little Fictions’ which reached No 1 in the UK.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Speaking to NME about the album, singer Guy Garvey said: “A lot about this record is different. We started recording in a new city, in Hamburg, we changed the way we worked and we all decided from the off to let the songs take the lead, without compromising the vision of each tune.”</p>
<p>Garvey continued: “At times, it’s a bleak record, but it has a huge, if bruised, heart. It was a pleasure to make and we are all immensely proud of it.”</p>
<p>First single ‘Dexter &amp; Sinister’ was released last week (August 1), which features Jesca Hoop. Other guests on the album are The Plumedores and South London newcomer Chilli Chilton.</p>
<p>As with ‘Little Fictions’ and its 2014 predecessor ‘The Take Off And Landing Of Everything’, ‘Giants Of All Sizes’ is produced by Elbow keyboardist Craig Potter. All of Elbow’s albums since their third record ‘Leaders Of The Free World’ in 2005 have been produced within the band. The full nine-song tracklisting is below.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>As well as Hamburg, ‘Giants Of All Sizes’ was recorded in Brixton, Vancouver, the band’s own Blueprint Studios in Salford and each member’s own home studios.</p>
<p>Garvey added of the new album: “It’s an angry, old blue lament which finds its salvation in family, friends, the band and new life,” adding the album is “sonically unabashed”.</p>
<p>A statement said the album “lyrically takes in moments of deep personal loss, whilst reflecting its times by confronting head-on the spectres of injustice and division not just in the UK but across the world.”</p>
<p>The tracklisting of Elbow’s new album ‘Giants Of All Sizes’ is:</p>
<p>‘Dexter &amp; Sinister’</p>
<p>‘Seven Veils’</p>
<p>‘Empires’</p>
<p>‘The Delayed 3:15’</p>
<p>‘White Noise White Heat’</p>
<p>‘Doldrums’</p>
<p>‘My Trouble’</p>
<p>‘On Deronda Road’</p>
<p>‘Weightless’

<h3 id="new-bedford-high-seniors-sharing-their-message-with-alive-clothing-line">&ldquo;New Bedford High seniors sharing their message with &lsquo;Alive&rsquo; clothing line&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.southcoasttoday.com/storyimage/NB/20200514/NEWS/200519861/AR/0/AR-200519861.jpg" alt="img">
It sounds a little silly, but this story starts with matching tattoos.</p>
<p>Essiah Marcial was turning 18, and to celebrate he and some friends were getting their first tats.</p>
<p>“I wanted something small and something that meant a lot to me,” said Ethan Medeiros, Marcial’s close friend and now business partner.</p>
<p>Just below the inside of their elbow, at the top of the forearm, Marcial and Medeiros inscribed five letters followed by a full stop: “Alive.”</p>
<p>“It’s something we live by,” said Marcial, whose father, Clodomiro, passed away four years ago from complications of diabetes. “Every day is a gift. Growing up at a young age, I lost a lot and I realized every day is a gift. That’s what we live by. Every day is worth living, no matter how you woke up. The worst day of your life is the best day for someone else.”</p>
<p>That’s how the two 18-year-old New Bedford natives came to name their new apparel business “Alive.”</p>

<p>Medeiros gives credit to Marcial for suggesting they start a clothing line.</p>
<p>“It was a spur-of-the-moment thing,” Marcial said. “You are what you wear. You can tell the life someone lives by what they wear. We thought they would go together — we designed a logo and we sold out.”</p>
<p>The first shirt was simply a plain black T with their paintbrush “Alive” logo in small, white print.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have the money to have something cool,” Marcial said.</p>
<p>Their first order arrived of 30 shirts, but soon they were gone. They followed up with more designs, each time ordering 30 shirts. Each time they sold out even quicker than before.</p>
<p>“We had no idea what we were doing,” Medeiros said. “We just walked in blindly. Finding somewhere to print them was difficult because we didn’t want to spend too much money but we wanted good quality. We found a place and then we started our own website.”</p>
<p>They began printing at 508Tees in Acushnet and as they worked to get their website up, they hand-delivered the first hundred-plus orders using a no-contact system.</p>
<p>“It’s awesome,” Marcial said. “It feels so good. We went into this not knowing a single thing. We just like to see people like it.”</p>
<p>They both contribute designs and sketch them up digitally. They have released more than a half-dozen different shirts, along with hats, backpacks and phone cases. Their most popular design reads “S.O.C.I.A.L. D.I.S.T.A.N.C.I.N.G” in rainbow colors.</p>
<p>That’s one of the shirts they were able to get into the hands of rapper/actor Dave East, whose debut album reached No. 11 on the US Billboard charts in 2019 and who recently portrayed Method Man in the Hulu series Wu-Tang: An American Saga.</p>
<p>Medeiros and Marcial reached out to one of East’s music video directors on Instagram, and he gave East a pair of shirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire. That&rsquo;s dope,” East says in the Instagram video. “Alive, good looking out. Appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>// // // //</p>
<p>Later, East went Live on Instagram wearing the Social Distancing hoodie.</p>
<p>“It’s insane,” Marcial said. “We’re trying not to be starstruck. He said he loved our clothes.”</p>
<p>Alive Clothing is still on the ground floor. Even with the website, Marcial estimated late last week that they had sold about 300 items. Their most recent release, a purple Stay Alive shirt, sold 50 copies in 10 minutes. For a couple of seniors in high school, that’s something.</p>
<p>“We got popular pretty quick in New Bedford, but not as big as we want to be,” Medeiros said. “At New Bedford High we’re well known as having a clothing line. It’s a slower process outside the city, but we’re doing good.”</p>
<p>With the website up and running, Marcial and Medeiros plan to continue the apparel company as they leave for college. Marcial is heading to Bridgewater State to wrestle and major in business, while Medeiros has committed to Tusculum University in Tennessee where he will play football and major in physical education.</p>
<p>“We’ve only been doing this a couple months and it’s insane,” Marcial said, estimating he and Medeiros put in a combined 60 hours a week building the brand. “We have a celebrity wearing our clothing. We’re 18 and starting a business and if our community supports us, we can do great things.”</p>

<h3 id="cannibal-corpse-begin-recording-15th-studio-album">&ldquo;Cannibal Corpse Begin Recording 15th Studio Album&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2020/05/GettyImages-451820150.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
Cannibal Corpse have been hard at work in the studio recording their 15th studio album. Vocalist George ‘Corpsegrinder’ Fisher posted a photo of himself wearing headphones, teasing a new collection of brutality from the death metal legends.</p>
<p>The New York band’s last album was 2017’s Red Before Black, which featured longtime guitarist Pat O’Brien. The guitarist was arrested for burglary and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a law enforcement officer in 2018, and a large amount of firearms was found at his home, including two flamethrowers and a sawed-off shotgun.</p>
<p>In Corpsegrinder’s Instagram post, he tagged Mana Recording Studios along with bassist Alex Webster, drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz, guitarist Rob Barnett and touring guitarist Erik Rutan, who took over for O’Brien after his arrest. One can assume O’Brien isn’t playing on the album, though he’s still officially a member of Cannibal Corpse as he awaits sentencing.</p>
<p>Corpsegrinder kept his message short, writing, “Guess what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;We love him,&rdquo; Corpsegrinder said about O’Brien in 2019. &ldquo;We want him back. But when I saw him in the court with the [suicide] vest, dude, I cried. We wish the best for him and we&rsquo;re just waiting to see. He&rsquo;s got a road ahead of him still with legal issues, and that&rsquo;s out of our hands. We support him 100 percent. We&rsquo;re behind him 100 percent.&rdquo;

On &lsquo;Giants Of All Sizes&rsquo;, Elbow Offers Hope In Political Darkness</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption Peter Neill/Courtesy of the artist Peter Neill/Courtesy of the artist</p>
<p>The Mercury Prize-winning band Elbow has just released its eighth studio album, Giants of All Sizes. It&rsquo;s an exploration of mourning in terms both personal and political, as lead singer and lyricist Guy Garvey grapples with the loss of his father alongside such tragedies as the bombing in the band&rsquo;s hometown of Manchester in 2017 and what Garvey calls the &ldquo;absolute cultural disaster&rdquo; of Brexit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most damaging thing about wedge-issue politics is that people become entrenched in their opinions to the point where they can no longer debate,&rdquo; Garvey says. &ldquo;We all feed ourselves the news we want to hear. So now we have a situation where both halves of the country think the other half [are] not just wrong, but thoroughly bad people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>England leaving the E.U. is the subject of Elbow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Empires,&rdquo; in which Garvey sings, &ldquo;Empires crumble all the time.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not referring to the U.K. so much as the European Union at large.</p>
<p>YouTube</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we leave Brexit and don&rsquo;t suffer for it,&rdquo; Garvey explains, &ldquo;Then Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain will follow. And then the European experiment is over. That would be an empire crumbling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the emotional landscape of Giants of All Sizes, it&rsquo;s not all bleak. Garvey has previously described the record as having a huge-but-bruised heart and agrees that finding joy in simplicity is one of the main themes of the record, especially on &ldquo;Weightless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sing &lsquo;Weightless&rsquo; to my son about my father,&rdquo; Garvey says. &ldquo;That lyric is really simple. I couldn&rsquo;t expand or improve on it, so I just repeat the whole thing. It says, &lsquo;Hey, you look like me / So we look like him / And when the time came / Just as you are / He was weightless in my arms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply mean that it was so easy to love him in the end, where it hadn&rsquo;t always been,&rdquo; Garvey continues. &ldquo;You know, I think most people have a complicated relationship with at least one of their parents. But towards the end, in the tangle and the summing up of the man, he was a great bloke. And [my son&rsquo;s] arrival made dad&rsquo;s passing part of life rather than the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elbow set out to &ldquo;make a dark record full of angst, anger and mourning.&rdquo; At the end of the day, however, Garvey couldn&rsquo;t help but offer a note of hope at the end of it.</p>
<p>Giants of All Sizes is out now. Elbow will kick off its North American tour in January.
