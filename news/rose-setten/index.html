<p>22 Mayıs 2020 Cuma, 11:21</p>
<p>15 yıldır gündüz kuşağı pembe dizisi The Sun also Sets’te (Güneş Bile Batar) oynayan, 12 kez en iyi gündüz dizisi oyuncu adayı olan, 8 kez en iyi gündüz dizisi kadın oyuncu ödülünü kazanan Celeste Talbert (Sally Field) ABD’nin en tatlı kızıdır. Onaltı yaşındayken tek başına New York’a gelen Celeste’in şöhret merdivenlerini çıkması hiçte kolay olmamıştır. Yaşamını pembe dizilere adayan ızdırap kraliçesi Celeste 26 yıldır gösteri dünyasının içindedir. Celeste’in düşmanı, kıskananı çoktur. Çünkü onun herşeyi vardır: şan, şöhret, para, aşk, güzellik, yetenek, hayran kitlesi.</p>
<p>En yakın düşmanı onunla aynı dizide oynayan hırslı yardımcı kadın oyuncu Montana Moorehead’dir (Cathy Moriarty). Yaşı Celeste gibi geçkince olan Montana, rakibesi olarak gördüğü Celeste’i diziden attırmak için türlü komplolar çevirir. Güneş Bile Batar’ın yapımcısı David Barnes (Robert Downey JR), her ne kadar onun tipi olmasa da Montana’yla bir an önce yatmak için onun her dediğini yapar. Ona aşırı bir şehvet ve tutkuyla bağlıdır. Şirketin gündüz programlarının CEO’su Edmund Edwards’ın (Garry Marshall) tek amacı neşeli, eğlenceli ve ucuz bir dizi çekmektir. Edwards’a göre yarışma programları, sosis pişiren kadının reytingleri Güneş Bile Batar’ı geçmiştir.</p>
<p>İzleyiciyi artırmak için yeni bir atılım gereklidir. David, Celeste’in cinayet işlemesini teklif eder. Üstelik Celeste sağır ve dilsiz bir evsizi öldürecektir. Bu öneriye Celeste’in en yakın arkadaşı, sırdaşı, dizinin senaristi Rose Schwartz (Whoopi Goldberg) itiraz eder. Türban giymeyi reddeden, kendini merhum Gloria Swanson gibi hisseden Celeste yapımcı David’e yakınırken evsizi öldüreceğini öğrenince isyan etse de dizinin geleceği için sonunda kabul eder. David aynı zamanda Celeste’in 20 yıl önce setten kovduğu, yoğun bir ilişki yaşadığı Jeffrey Anderson’ı (Kevin Kline) Florida’da yaşlıların yemek yediği bir kulüpte çalıştığını öğrenir. Satıcının Ölümü’nü çatal bıçak, kavga, sesleri içinde oynamaya çalışan Jeffrey’in yanına gidip Güneş Bile Batar’a dönmesini teklif eder. Celeste’ten nefret eden Jeffrey hemen evet der. Böylelikle 1973’te trafik kazasında kafası kopup ölen Ron Randall, diziye yeniden katılacaktır. Kafası bedeninden ayrılan Randall’ın geri dönüşüne senarist Rose zor ikna olur.</p>
<p>Celeste, tam sağır ve dilsiz evsizi öldürürken onun yeğeni Lori Craven (Elisabeth Shue) olduğunu öğrenir. İkinci bir şokuda eski aşkı Jeffrey’in diziye yeniden başladığını öğrenince yaşar. Jeffrey ile Lori’nin öpüşeceklerini tesadüfen öğrenen Celeste iyice çıldırır. Tam öpüşecekken üzerlerine saldırır, Set karışır. CEO Edwards bu karışıklıktan çok hoşlanır, çekimin devam etmesini ister. Herkes Celeste’in Lori’yi kıskandığını düşünür. Oysa ki gerçek bambaşkadır. Setteki herkes gözyaşına boğulurken yapımcı David kendini tutamayıp “Bu dizide yaşam sanatı taklit etmedi, doruğa da ulaştırdı” der.</p>
<p>Herkesin egosu o kadar fazladır ki çekimde aksiyon ve drama doruğa çıkıverir. Senarist Rose ‘Ben neden böyle diyaloglar yazamıyorum’ diye hayıflanır. Herkes kendisini dev aynasında gördüğü için öfke patlaması olur. Gündüz kuşağı pembe dizi melodramasından çok bencil, kendine dönük oyuncuların cinnet geçirmeleri, çılgınlıkları daha dramatiktir.</p>
<p>Promised Land (Vadedilmiş Ülke/1987), Restoration (Restorasyon /1995), A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Bir Yaz Gecesi Rüyası/1999), The Emperor’s Club (İmparatorlar Kulübü/ 2002), The Last Station (Son Veda/ 2009) filmlerinin başarılı yönetmeni Michael Hoffman, Soapdish’te (Sabun Köpüğü) pembe dizi oyuncularının açgözlülükten şehvete, öfkeden yalancılığa, sahtekarlıktan ihanete dek uzanan duygularla hareket etmelerini abartılı, komik, eğlenceli bir anlatımla, akıcı bir tempoyla aktarıyor.</p>
<p>Robert Harling ile Andrew Bergman’ın yazdığı diyaloglar olağanüstü. Ansambl oyuncu kadrosu göz kamaştırıcı: Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Cathy Moriarty, Whoopi Goldberg, Robert Downey Jr, Carrie Fisher, Elisabeth Shue, Teri Hatcher, Kathy Najimy, Garry Marshall.</p>
<p>“Bir komedinin başarılı olması için içinde ciddi bir öykü barındırması şarttır” diyen Michael Hoffman yine bir aile öyküsü anlatıyor. The Women (Kadınlar/1939), Pillow Talk (Yastık Sohbeti/1959), Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (Sinir Krizi Eşiğindeki Kadınlar/1988) filmlerinden esinlenen yönetmen parodi komedi de oyuncularla bol prova yaptıklarını, Kevin Kline ile Robert Downey Jr’ın doğaçlama yeteneklerine hayran kaldığını, finalin doğaçlama olduğunu belirtiyor.</p>
<p>Ünlü yönetmen-oyuncu-senarist John Landis’in en iyi komedi seçtiği Soapdish’i (Sabun Köpüğü) bol bol gülmek, neşeli bir zaman geçirmek, yıldız oyuncu kadrosunun tadını çıkarmak için kesinlikle izleyin.

Fernhurst Choral Society Copyright: other</p>
<p>Spokesman Michael Burnham said: “The concert will open with March of the Toreadors, the prelude to the opera. This is undoubtedly the most well-known melody from Bizet’s Carmen. It has been used in films and commercials for years and its infectious rhythms and rousing melody make it great fun to see and hear performed and an ideal concert opener. It will be followed, as contrast, by the Humming Chorus from Puccini’s Madama Butterfly, a lullaby providing a moment of calm and tranquillity.</p>
<p>“The quirky Petite Messe Solennelle forms the core of the concert.</p>
<p>“Following the Messe, Donizetti’s Chorus of Wedding Guests from Lucia di Lammermoor provides a jubilant foot-tapping celebration of the nuptials. This will be followed by the beautiful (but ultimately fatal) Dido’s Lament and chorus from Dido and Aeneas by Purcell. The concert concludes with the familiar and glorious Brindisi The Drinking Song from La Traviata by Verdi as a merry finale to what will be an enjoyable evening.</p>
<p>“The choir and four fabulous soloists, Jo Appleby, Rose Setten, Pablo Strong and Giles White, will be accompanied on the organ and harmonium by Richard Gowers and pianist George Haynes. Come and hear the delightful melodies of the Messe and our selection of opera choruses and be captivated and enriched by the experience.”

Catherine O&rsquo;Hara, Eugene Levy, Dan Levy and Annie Murphy in Schitt&rsquo;s Creek. (CBC/Pop)</p>
<p>Often television shows outstay their welcome, ending when the storylines are getting stale or ratings have declined. That hasn&rsquo;t been the case for Schitt’s Creek, which is heading into its final season at its most beloved, both critically and commercially. When co-creator and showrunner Dan Levy said the sixth season would also be the last, he couldn&rsquo;t have foreseen that by the end of the year, the Canadian comedy would become a multi-Emmy and SAG nominee. It&rsquo;s rare for awards voters to recognize a series this late in the game, but Schitt’s Creek hasn’t followed the typical path to greatness, nor does it play by the usual fish-out-of-water rules. What has caused this late surge in popularity?</p>
<p>Some of this success can be attributed to the Netflix bump after the series became available on the streaming platform in 2017 (after first debuting in 2015 on CBC in Canada and the US network Pop TV). Comedy shows often take time to find their groove, and Schitt’s Creek was no exception. After losing all their money, the Rose family was forced to move to the small town that patriarch Johnny Rose (Eugene Levy) had bought as a joke. In the beginning, the antics of the formerly rich Rose clan were abrasive, as they longed to be anywhere but Schitt’s Creek. Concerns about material goods, sibling bickering, and a prickly attitude toward the residents of this town could wear thin pretty quickly. But without this initial inability to express love (if it didn’t have a designer label attached to it), the events of the later seasons wouldn&rsquo;t feel earned. The uplifting glow of David (Dan Levy) saying “I love you” to his family at the end of Season 2 is powerful, because this phrase isn&rsquo;t one that comes easily.</p>
<p>Like many viewers, I discovered Schitt’s Creek late in its run, but quickly warmed to the mix of hilarious, heightened antics and anchored emotionality. It&rsquo;s no coincidence that as the Rose family found their place in the small town they previously couldn’t wait to leave, the popularity of the show increased. Growth is an important factor, and each season chipped away at the chic armor worn by each family member. A soothing balm, Schitt’s Creek is a town that leans into kindness: it&rsquo;s a version of the world co-creator Dan Levy (and clearly audiences) would like to experience. Here are the relationships that helped turn what could have been a one-note comedy about spoiled rich people into TV’s warmest hug:</p>
<p>Johnny and Moira Rose</p>
<p>Eugene Levy and Catherine O’Hara are understandably the Schitt’s Creek marquee names and a big draw for new viewers. However, comedy icon status can only get you so far: the show still has to be good. The Moira/Johnny dynamic has been solid from day one, impervious to the most nightmarish of scenarios. They have faced obstacles and conflicts, but at no point has this union been in peril, which is quite unusual for a television marriage. The heightened stress of losing everything could cause any relationship to implode, but even at their lowest ebb, they are loving. And much to the disgust of their children, they are still sexually attracted to each other — another refreshing aspect in this portrayal of a decades-long partnership. Both still have an undeniable fondness for the finer things in life, however, we&rsquo;ve seen they will live anywhere as long as it is with each other.</p>
<p>Alexis and David Rose</p>
<p>“You get murdered first, for once,” Alexis (Annie Murphy) told David in the pilot when the siblings argued about who would get the bed nearest the door. The pair still fire off barbed comments — “Ew, David” has only been uttered a handful of times, but it has endured — messing with each other at any given opportunity, but now it&rsquo;s more playful in tone. Sharing a room for five seasons means it has been impossible to escape the other’s orbit, even with the apartment of a boyfriend at their disposal. Whereas Alexis was ready to flee on rich boyfriend Stavros’ private jet in the first episode (leaving her brother behind in Schitt’s Creek), in Season 5 she worried about what this distance would do to her tight bond with her family. It was a big ask when Alexis told her brother she needed a hug after her breakup with Mutt (Tim Rozin), but since then, these moments have come with less resistance. She endured an awkward lunch with Ted (Dustin Milligan) and his new girlfriend so David could score a new Rose Apothecary vendor, and she talked him out of a relationship spiral when he sent Patrick on a date. The true love story of Fleabag was between siblings, maybe Schitt’s Creek&rsquo;s is too.</p>
<p>David Rose and Patrick Brewer</p>
<p>“He’s a business major that wears straight-legged, mid-range denim. He’s not into me.” David Rose was at his least perceptive in Season 3 when Patrick Brewer (Noah Reid) was first introduced. Heralded as a major moment for this character, David’s business-partner-turned-love-interest broke down the wall around his heart. A string of messy relationships haunted David, his guard was up and trust did not come easy. It hasn’t been a bump-free road for the pair, which included a previously undisclosed ex-fiance making a surprise trip to see Patrick. Rachel’s (Stacey Farber) appearance caused David to spiral before he wore his heart on his leather sweatshirt sleeve, performing a lip-sync to Tina Turner’s “The Best.” Patrick’s acoustic rendition of this song laid down the emotional gauntlet, which each season has tried to best. An “I love you” declaration that invoked Mariah Carey, and a coming out episode which laid the groundwork for a tearful and tender proposal have all been important steps toward David feeling worthy of adoration. Schitt’s Creek is a town free from homophobia, where anyone can love out loud, and this lack of fear has no doubt provided a safe haven for viewers. Not only that, but this celebration of Patrick and David has been a focal point of the final season.</p>
<p>David Rose and Stevie Budd</p>
<p>Before Patrick, David was in a friends-with-benefits arrangement with Stevie (Emily Hampshire) for a hot minute. Since that first season tryst, the relationship has deepened to best friend status. Stevie has always refused to put up with David’s BS, calling him out for his sometimes ridiculous notions while supporting his business and romantic endeavors. David’s previous friendships were toxic and transactional, his appeal was his credit card. With Stevie, this pretense is gone, she is his friend because she wants to be, not because he picks up the tab. The balance of her sardonic wit with his unabashed love of expensive sweaters leads to some highly comedic moments, but it&rsquo;s in their unguarded conversations that this pair truly shines.</p>
<p>Johnny Rose and Stevie Budd</p>
<p>Family is at the heart of Schitt’s Creek, and while Stevie’s parents haven’t made an appearance, her relationship with Johnny is more father-daughter than co-workers. This is no more apparent in last season’s “The Hike,” when Johnny was taken to the hospital after a health scare. Stevie isn&rsquo;t someone who cries easily, but she can’t hide her tears of relief when they find out it was severe heartburn and not a heart attack. Awareness hasn’t always been a Rose family strength, but both Johnny and Moira came through for Stevie when she was at her lowest ebb. After heartbreak, Moira offered her the role of Sally Bowles in the Schitt’s Creek community theater production of Cabaret without knowing if she could sing or dance. Stevie crushed it, and while they haven’t always been present for their own children, Johnny and Moira are making up for lost time, and have gained a surrogate daughter in the process.</p>
<p>Alexis Rose and Ted Mullens</p>
<p>Alexis Rose has been on many death-defying adventures and hooked up with the likes of Adam Levine and Zac Efron along the way. However, it&rsquo;s her romance with Ted that caused great heartache and soul-searching. Boyfriends have always been disposable, but Ted proved different. There is no way this pair would still be together if she had gone through with the misguided Season 1 proposal. Rather, she needed the intense fling with bearded Mutt, as well as time as a single woman. Self-improvement is a buzzword, but no character has grown more than Alexis Rose. She was never malicious, just blissfully unaware in her bubble of privilege. She’s jet-setted around the world, but this town and her relationships with people like Ted and Twyla (Sarah Levy) gave her the benefits of a permanent abode that she had previously not experienced. Planning a six-month trip to the Galapagos Islands with Ted led to a crisis she couldn’t name. It turns out she had never felt homesick before, but several years in Schitt’s Creek will have this effect.</p>
<p>Moira Rose and the Jazzagals</p>
<p>Moira has always had one foot out of the town, however, she hasn’t let her artistic talents or her love of performing go to waste. In the earlier seasons, Jocelyn Schitt (Jennifer Robertson) was positioned as a frenemy of sorts. They went head-to-head for a seat on the council, and Jocelyn’s position as Jazzagal a capella lead was a coveted spot for the former daytime soap star. Moira still vies for the spotlight, but her relationship with Jocelyn and Ronnie (Karen Robinson) has deepened over the seasons. Rather than rivals, they are now collaborators, and despite Moira’s dreams of getting out of Schitt’s Creek, if the time came to leave, she would probably miss her Jazzagals most of all.</p>

Earl Clark passed away at his home outside Choteau MT on Jan 24 surrounded by his children. He was born in Kearney, Nebraska to Kenneth Riley and Lola Fay (Mishler) Clark on May 27, 1937. He was the third of four children: Marvin, Virginia, Earl and Barbara. The family moved to California when Earl was 6 years old, with a short stay in Harbor City of Los Angeles before settling south in Tustin.</p>
<p>Earl met Rosie Harrison at Tustin Grammar School and married on Aug. 8, 1958 after her high school graduation. Three children: Lane, Shelly and Gail followed in the next four years to complete the family. Earl worked a variety of jobs over those years and settled into the carpentry trade working with his father and uncles. He and Rosie loved the outdoors, and raised their children in Orange County, where the whole family grew to love camping, fishing, and raising all sorts of animals and game birds. Spending time with family and friends are some of the kid’s greatest family memories.</p>
<p>In 1973, Earl was inspired to leave California for Oregon, to join a Carpentry business with some of his buddies. He packed up the family and headed out on a road trip with the goal of ending in Oregon. One of the stops heading North, was in Fairfield MT to visit Aunt Ginger and Uncle Jim Gray. Earl and Rosie decided to stay, bought Egger’s Fix-It Shop and reopened as Country Rose Antiques in May of 1973. Earl refinished furniture, making the old look brand new. He was an accomplished finish carpenter and taught his children to never cut corners. “If you’re going to do a job, do it right the first time!”</p>
<p>Earl and Rosie moved from Fairfield in 1991 to Eastham Junction between Fairfield and Choteau, and relocated the store to this location. They spent many years traveling to antique shows, making a network of friends and dealers throughout the Northwest. They were very successful and well liked. Rosie passed away in 2005 and Earl continued to run the store until 2016.</p>
<p>Earl loved stream fishing and fostered in his children and grandchildren love for the mountains, outdoors and camping. He was a member of the Southwest Carpenters Union and the Weapons Collector’s Society of MT.</p>
<p>Earl is survived by his three children; Lane and Sue Clark of Fairfield, Shelly Coe of Newport Beach CA, and Gail and Dado Genger of Augusta. He has eight grandchildren and 14 +1 great grandchildren. His “Sis” Barbara Moore lives in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Earl was preceded in death by his wife Rosie, his parents, brother Marvin and sister Virginia.</p>
<p>Services will be provided by Gorder-Jensen Funeral Home in Choteau at that location on Feb. 8th, at 11:00 am. There will be a gathering at Earl’s house after the service for any that would like to attend.</p>

<p><img src="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/8/F1.medium.gif" alt="img">
Effector functions of immunoglobulin G (IgG) are regulated by the composition of a glycan moiety, thus affecting activity of the immune system. Aberrant glycosylation of IgG has been observed in many diseases, but little is understood about the underlying mechanisms. We performed a genome-wide association study of IgG N-glycosylation (N = 8090) and, using a data-driven network approach, suggested how associated loci form a functional network. We confirmed in vitro that knockdown of IKZF1 decreases the expression of fucosyltransferase FUT8, resulting in increased levels of fucosylated glycans, and suggest that RUNX1 and RUNX3, together with SMARCB1, regulate expression of glycosyltransferase MGAT3. We also show that variants affecting the expression of genes involved in the regulation of glycoenzymes colocalize with variants affecting risk for inflammatory diseases. This study provides new evidence that variation in key transcription factors coupled with regulatory variation in glycogenes modifies IgG glycosylation and has influence on inflammatory diseases.</p>
<p>To address these questions, we performed the largest GWAS of the total IgG N-glycome to date, on 8090 samples from individuals of European ancestry, and more than doubled the number of associated loci. To prioritize genes with a plausible role in IgG glycosylation, we assessed whether variants were located in the coding regions of genes, showed pleiotropy with gene expression in biologically relevant cell types, and assessed enrichment in gene sets from different biological pathways. We explored how these genes are connected in a functional network and confirmed some of the network connections with in vivo functional follow-up. Last, we investigated pleiotropy with other complex traits and diseases by interrogating the overlap of glycosylation associations with susceptibility loci for other phenotypes. Where available, we also assessed whether IgG N-glycosylation, diseases, and gene expression are likely to be controlled by the same underlying causal variant using summary-level Mendelian randomization (SMR). This strategy not only resulted in the discovery of new candidate genes but also suggested how some of these genes could regulate glycosylation enzymes and how they could influence the aberrant glycosylation observed in diseases with an inflammatory signature.</p>
<p>N-linked glycans attached to a protein can be released, and their abundance can be quantified using a range of analytical methods. These measurements represent a set of quantitative traits characterizing the glycome of the studied protein. As with any quantitative trait, the genetic determinants of the glycome can be studied by associating levels of glycans to polymorphic sequence variants measured in large cohorts of individuals [genome-wide association studies (GWAS)]. The first GWAS of the glycome identified associated variants in or near 7 glycosyltransferase genes and in 15 additional loci with no apparent role in protein glycosylation ( 5 , 6 ). The list was recently extended by six additional loci ( 7 , 8 ). However, there is still limited understanding of how these genes are functionally related or what their role is in the genetic regulation of IgG N-glycosylation in health and disease.</p>
<p>Glycans are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus by a complex interplay of glycosyltransferases—enzymes that add monosaccharides to a growing glycan chain—and various other enzymes and transporters involved in synthesis and delivery of donors and substrates needed for chemical reactions ( 4 ). However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which alternative glycosylation is achieved and regulated is very limited.</p>
<p>Glycosylation, a series of reactions that creates complex carbohydrate structures (glycans) attached to a polypeptide backbone, is among the most common and complex posttranslational protein modifications. Highly regulated attachment of different glycans to the same glycosylation site (alternative glycosylation) can greatly contribute to variability in glycoprotein structure and influence function in a way that is analogous to changes in protein sequence ( 1 ). Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is a simple glycoprotein with only one conserved N-glycosylation site per heavy chain and glycans that have no more than two antennae, but even this simple glycosylation has the capacity to generate hundreds of different glycoforms of IgG. It is well established that alternative glycosylation of IgG can act as a molecular switch between different immune response outcomes and thus significantly affect the function of the immune system ( 2 ). Aberrant protein glycosylation has been observed in many physiological states, from aging- and age-related diseases to autoimmune diseases and cancer ( 3 ).</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>Discovery and replication meta-analyses We performed a discovery IgG N-glycosylation GWAS on four cohorts of European descent (N = 8090). Associations of 77 ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) IgG N-glycan traits with HapMap2 (release 22) imputed genetic data were studied. We assumed an additive linear model for each glycan trait, followed by a fixed-effect inverse-variance meta-analysis. Overall, associations in 27 loci reached genome-wide significance [P ≤ 2.4 × 10−9; Bonferroni corrected for 21 independent glycan traits; (6)], and another 6 loci were suggestively significant (2.4 × 10−8 ≤ P &lt; 2.4 × 10−9) (Table 1). Eight of the genome-wide significant loci confirmed previous findings from Lauc et al. (6), 5 confirmed those from Shen et al. (7) (one of which, AZI1, maps to the same locus as the suggestive association near SLC38A10 from Lauc et al.), and 1 confirmed those from Wahl et al. (8) (Fig. 1 and table S1), while 14 loci were not previously associated with IgG glycosylation. Individual associations and Manhattan plots can be found in the online resource available at <a href="https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/">https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/</a>. For 19 of 27 significant loci (9 of 14 previously unassociated), the same single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)–glycan association was replicated in a meta-analysis of four independent European cohorts (N = 2388) with P ≤ 0.05/27 ≈ 1.9 × 10−3. None of the genes in novel loci have a known role in glycosylation. For all loci, the direction of effect estimates obtained for the UPLC data (effect either increasing or decreasing with the same allele) was the same in the discovery and the replication parts of the study (Table 1). Table 1 Loci associated with IgG glycosylation. Each locus is represented by the SNP with the strongest association in the region. Locus, coded by “chromosome: locus start–locus end” (GRCh37); No. of SNPs, maximum number of SNPs independently contributing to trait variation; SNP, variant with the strongest association in the locus; position, position of the SNP on the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) build 37; EA, allele for which effect estimate is reported; OA, other allele; EAF, frequency of the effect allele; R2, sample size weighted average of imputation quality for the SNP with the strongest association in the locus; glycan, glycan associated with the reported SNP; No. of glycans, number of other glycans suggestively or significantly associated with variants in given locus; β, effect estimate for the SNP and glycan with the strongest association in the locus in the discovery; P, P value for the discovery effect estimate; β UPLC repl, effect estimate for the SNP and glycan with the strongest association in the locus in replication; P UPLC repl, P value for the effect estimate in replication. The loci replicated in UPLC replication at P ≤ 0.0019 are in bold. The loci from Lauc et al. (6), Shen et al. (7), and Wahl et al. (8) are in italics. View this table: Fig. 1 Gene prioritization in loci associated with IgG N-glycosylation. The Manhattan plot was created by taking the lowest P value at every genomic position from all 77 GWAS. For simplicity, the plot was trimmed at the equivalent of P = 10−50. The lowest observed P value in this analysis was 4.65 × 10−276 at ST6GAL1. Known loci, loci detected in previous IgG N-glycosylation GWAS; replicated, UPLC replication GWAS. Bottom: Summary of support for prioritization of every gene in the Manhattan plot. DEPICT, genes from enriched gene sets; expression, genes whose expression is pleiotropic with IgG N-glycosylation; CD19, B cells; PB, peripheral blood; coding, genes for which IgG N-glycosylation–associated SNP results in a changed amino acid sequence. To further validate our findings, we analyzed all significantly associated SNPs in a cohort where glycans were measured with liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (LCMS; N = 1842). From the 27 genome-wide significant SNPs, 17 were associated with at least one of the LCMS-measured IgG glycopeptide levels at Bonferroni-corrected P ≤ 3.7 × 10−5. Of these 17, 14 loci were also replicated in the UPLC replication study (table S2). We performed an approximate conditional and joint analysis using GCTA-COJO (genome-wide complex trait conditional and joint analysis) software (9) to investigate secondary associations in the 27 loci. We found evidence of multiple SNPs independently contributing to glycan level variation for four loci. Three of these loci span glycosyltransferase genes, coding for enzymes directly involved in biosynthesis of glycans (4) (table S3). The greatest number of independently associated SNPs (six) was observed for the fucosyltransferase locus, FUT8, followed by three SNPs in the galactosyltransferase locus, B4GALT1, and two SNPs in the sialyltransferase gene, ST6GAL1. Two SNPs in the fourth locus, spanning the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6, are likely to be due to the complexity of this region, where multiple antigen-presenting genes are in close proximity and in high linkage disequilibrium (LD). Using only the marginal effects of top SNPs, we were able to explain up to 20% of the genetic variance (for a single glycan trait). Uncovering additional variants in the conditional analysis resulted in a maximum of 22% variance explained. These maxima were reached for IGP29, the percentage of monosialylation of fucosylated digalactosylated structures without bisecting N-acetylglucosamine, GlcNAc (table S3).</p>
<p>Prioritizing genes associated with IgG N-glycosylation We applied the following strategy to prioritize the most likely functional genes. The Data-driven Expression Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits (DEPICT) framework (10) was used to perform a gene set and tissue/cell type enrichment analysis and to provide additional evidence for gene prioritization. Next, for all candidate genes in every locus, we explored evidence for genes containing SNPs affecting amino acid sequence using the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) (11) and genes whose expression is likely to be regulated by the same underlying variant as N-glycosylation of IgG. For the latter, we applied SMR with heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) (12) on expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from five different immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and two types of T cells) from the CEDAR dataset [N = 350; Momozawa et al. (13)] and peripheral blood from Westra et al. (14) (N = 5311). This test assesses whether the coassociation of two traits to the same region may be due to pleiotropic action of the same variants to both traits or due to the variant being in LD with two independent causal variants, each exhibiting independent effects on each trait. More specifically, a pleiotropic scenario would assume that the same unobserved variant is responsible for the association with both gene expression and glycan levels, while an LD scenario would assume that coassociation is due to two or more underlying variants that are in LD and independently contribute to either gene expression or glycan levels. The DEPICT gene prioritization tool provided evidence of prioritization for 18 genes in 14 loci at false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05 and another 3 genes at FDR &lt;0.2 (Supplementary Note, Appendix Table 9). In four genes, associated variants were predicted to result in a potentially deleterious amino acid change, and in five genes, probably benign amino acid changes. SMR/HEIDI indicated that IgG N-glycosylation–associated variants in 9 loci had pleiotropic effects on expression of 13 genes in different tissues, including B cells (4 genes in 3 loci), the cell lineage responsible for IgG synthesis. For 11 loci, we did not find any additional evidence to prioritize target genes and report the gene closest to the strongest association in the region (Fig. 1 and the Supplementary Note; <a href="https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/)">https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/)</a>. To obtain insights into the biological pathways that these genes are involved in, we performed FUMA’s GENE2FUNC (15) for Gene Ontology (GO) and DEPICT for gene set enrichment analyses. In total, our prioritized genes were significantly enriched in 75 different GO gene sets. These gene sets reflect three higher-level biological processes: glycosylation (23 gene sets), immune system processes (22 gene sets), and transcription (7 gene sets) (table S4). DEPICT tests for enrichment in preconstructed gene sets that are based on information from protein-protein interactions (PPIs), molecular and biochemical pathways, gene coexpression, and gene sets based on mouse gene knockout studies. No gene sets were enriched at FDR &lt;0.05, but 397 gene sets were enriched at FDR &lt;0.2. These gene sets are connected to various processes involved in immunity, B cell life cycle, and antibody production and quantity (table S5).</p>
<p>Functional network of loci associated with IgG N-glycosylation Next, we investigated how genes in associated loci are functionally connected with each other. We assume that two loci with a similar glycome-wide effect (effect of the top SNP in the locus on all glycan traits) are likely to have a similar role in the regulation of glycosylation and may be a part of the same biological pathway. Our assumption is based on the following. We analyze the glycosylation of a single protein (IgG) and determine 77 different glycan traits. These traits arise as a result of the activity of different enzymes in the glycosylation biosynthesis pathway. It can be expected that changing the rate of a specific reaction would lead to specific changes of glycan profile, regardless of the specific mechanism (e.g., alteration in substrate availability, lower activity of enzyme as a result of a mutation changing its structure, a regulatory variation changing the level of expression of a gene encoding relevant enzyme), leading to the rate change. For example, it can be expected that a regulatory variant that is associated with expression levels of glycosyltransferase gene MGAT3 [mannosyl (β-1,4-)-glycoprotein β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase] will have an influence on all glycan traits that contain bisecting GlcNAc. This could be a variant changing the structure of this acetylglucosaminyltransferase, a regulatory variant in the promoter of the MGAT3 gene, a variant disrupting an enhancer of MGAT3, or it could be a regulatory variant that changes expression of a transcription factor (TF) binding to the enhancer of MGAT3. Either way, the rate of reaction controlled by the product of MGAT3 would change, leading to a similar effect on all glycan traits that contain bisecting GlcNAc. To create specific hypotheses regarding the regulatory functions of our loci, we defined the glycome-wide effect of an SNP as a vector of effects [in the form of z scores, where z score = β/se(β)] of the given SNP on each of the glycans. As can be seen in fig. S1, some loci have notably similar effects on all glycan traits. We therefore constructed a functional network by computing Spearman pairwise correlations of glycome-wide effects of all 27 SNPs that tag each locus. Given that the direction of the GWAS estimates depends on the allele used as a reference, the sign of correlation is not informative in this analysis. Therefore, we report absolute values of correlation coefficients. Although nodes in this network represent effects of top SNPs, we marked nodes by using the names of candidate genes in each locus, and we used these names to denote loci throughout the text. Below, we focus our discussion only on clusters that contain glycosyltransferases (MGAT3, FUT8, B4GALT1, and ST6GAL1), because these enzymes catalyze the transfer of monosaccharides to a growing glycan chain and therefore have a known and well-established role in the biosynthesis of glycans. As outlined above, we hypothesize that any locus with a similar glycome-wide effect to a glycosyltransferase locus is likely to either regulate the expression levels of the enzyme or modulate its activity through other indirect effects. To validate the functional network, we applied both computational and experimental approaches. We first pruned the correlation network for significant correlations [P ≤ 0.05/(27 × 26)/2 ≈ 1.4 × 10−4] and performed permutation analysis with 100,000 random SNPs. We also compared our network with the STRING human PPI database (16). The strongest overall correlation, a Spearman’s ρ of 0.97, was observed between IgG–N-glycome–wide effects of the top SNP in the MGAT3 locus and the top SNP in the SMARCB1-DELR3-CHCHD10-VPREB3 locus (Fig. 2A). None of the randomly selected SNPs exhibited such a strong correlation with these two loci in the permutation analysis (Table 2 and table S6). Recent work by Sharapov et al. (17) on genetics of the total plasma proteome N-glycosylation, of which IgG is a major part, suggested that the likely candidate gene is DERL3. DERL3 encodes a protein involved in endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation for misfolded luminal glycoproteins. Data provided in this study shift the balance of evidence toward the SMARCB1, as it is unlikely that modulation of glycoprotein degradation would result in effects similar to those observed when perturbing MGAT3. Fig. 2 Functional network of loci associated with IgG N-glycosylation. Correlation estimates are computed on the basis of squared pairwise Spearman’s correlation of SNP effects. The loci are denoted with names of genes that were prioritized in regions tagged by the given lead SNP. (A) Functional network of loci associated with IgG N-glycosylation. In this network, each node represents a lead SNP in the locus, and each edge represents the squared correlation of glycome-wide effects of the two nodes. Only significant correlations after multiple testing correction (P ≤ 1.4 × 10−4) are shown. The thickness and intensity of edges depend on variation in one locus explained by the effect estimates in the second locus. Round-edged rectangular nodes denote genes that are, according to GO, involved in glycosylation; purple-edged nodes denote genes involved in immune system processes; green nodes denote loci containing genes involved in transcription regulation; orange nodes denote glycosyltransferases; and blue rectangles indicate diseases pleiotropic with IgG glycans in the given locus (Table 3). (B) Hierarchical clustering of pairwise Spearman’s locus-effect correlations. Table 2 In silico evidence for edges from functional network of IgG N-glycosylation loci. Permutation analysis was used to assess the distribution of glycome-wide SNP effect pairwise correlations and the STRING PPI database (16) to search for biological validation of observed links. All reported correlations are statistically significant after Bonferroni correction. Corr, Spearman’s correlation coefficient of z scores of SNP1 and z scores of SNP2; quant, quantile of distribution at which the given ρ2 was observed in permutation analysis; STRING score, probability that the link exists obtained by combining evidence from different sources. SNPs that were replicated in UPLC replication are in bold. View this table: The second strongest association, a Spearman’s ρ of 0.94, was between lead SNPs in TFs RUNX3 and RUNX1 loci. This link was validated in the permutation analysis and observed in the STRING PPI network. RUNX3 and RUNX1 loci were also strongly correlated with both the MGAT3 and SMARCB1-DELR3-CHCHD10-VPREB3 loci (Table 2). A proxy for the top SNP in the MGAT3 locus, SNP rs8137426 (LD R2 = 1 with rs5750830), is located in a region bound by TF RUNX3, although not directly within its binding motif (fig. S2A). In our SMR/HEIDI analysis, we found evidence of the same association having a pleiotropic effect on both MGAT3 expression in CD19+ B cells and IGP40, a glycan trait related with bisecting GlcNAc (<a href="https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/)">https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/)</a>. This suggests that the associated SNP could influence binding of TFs (RUNX1 or RUNX3), which, together with the chromatin remodeling protein SMARCB1, regulate expression of MGAT3, resulting in an increased incidence of bisecting GlcNAc in all fucosylated disialylated structures of IgG (IGP40; Table 1). The FUT8 locus had the strongest glycome-wide association with the ORMDL3-GSDMB-IKZF3-ZPBP2 and IKZF1 loci (ρ = 0.71 and 0.62). The latter two loci also show highly similar glycome-wide effects with each other (ρ = 0.78) and were observed as interacting in the STRING PPI network (Table 2 and table S7). Two remaining galactosyltransferases had the strongest correlations with loci where the underlying hypothesis of regulation is less straightforward. The most strongly correlated loci with the galactosyltransferase B4GALT1 locus were SPINK4 and HIVEP2 (ρ = 0.8 and 0.71). Top SNPs from the NXPE1-NXPE4 and ELL2 loci had the most similar glycome-wide effects to the top SNP from the sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 locus (ρ = 0.77 and 0.58). Full results of the permutation analysis and STRING PPI are available at the online resource (<a href="https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/)">https://shiny.igmm.ed.ac.uk/igg_glycans_gwas/)</a>. Last, we assessed whether there is evidence of a subnetwork of genes regulating each specific glycosyltransferase by performing hierarchical clustering on the glycome-wide SNP effect correlation matrix. We observed three clusters: the cluster with MGAT3, the cluster with FUT8, and the cluster with B4GALT1 and ST6GAL1. Several loci containing genes coding for TFs cluster together with the MGAT3 locus, suggesting a complex regulatory network for this glycosyltransferase gene (and/or for the factors regulating this gene, i.e., RUNX1 is repressed by RUNX3) (Fig. 2B). To further explore this possibility, we analyzed whether IgG glycosylation–associated SNPs were predicted to disrupt binding sites of TFs encoded by genes from this network more often than by chance. To assess the influence of glycosylation SNPs on binding of TFs from our network (IKZF1, IKZF3, RUNX1, RUNX3, IRF1, SMARCB1, and TBX21), we used Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (18). Briefly, if an associated SNP maps to the conserved position in the TF-binding motif and its effect allele is different than the conserved allele at that position, the SNP will be predicted to strongly affect binding of the TF. Alternatively, the allele can also completely disrupt or create the binding motif, resulting in a loss of a known or introduction of a new TF-binding site. In four loci spanning the glycosyltransferase genes, the associated SNPs resulted in either introduction or disruption of binding sites for TFs RUNX1, RUNX3, IKZF1, SMARCB1, TBX21, and IRF1. We observed the same disruption/introduction of TF-binding sites for all these TFs too and therefore confirmed some well-known regulation feedback loops between TFs RUNX1 and RUNX3 and IKZF1 and IKZF3 (table S8) (19, 20). To assess whether these TF-binding site alterations are specific for associated SNPs, we compared the frequency of TF-binding alterations of associated and nonassociated SNPs. In seven glycosylation loci, the associated SNPs were at least two times more likely to affect binding of TF than nonassociated SNPs from the same region. The highest difference in the number of SNPs affecting the TF-binding site was observed for FUT8, MGAT3, and loci coding for TFs that are members of their cluster. Associated SNPs from the FUT8 and MGAT3 loci have a significant effect on binding of TF from our network, while nonassociated SNPs from their proximity have no effect on binding (table S9). In summary, we not only found TFs associated with IgG glycosylation but also showed that glycosylation-associated SNPs can potentially alter their binding in other glycosylation-associated loci. These results not only reinforce some of the links suggested in our network but also confirm some known feedback loops between different TFs involved in B cell differentiation and biology (e.g., interactions of IKZF1 and IKZF3 and RUNX1 and RUNX3) (19, 20).</p>
<p>Experimental validation of the functional links between IKZF1 and FUT8 Our network-based approach allowed us to show that variants in or near IKZF1 and IKZF3 share glycome-wide similarities with the top SNP in the FUT8 locus. We hypothesized that the TFs IKZF1 and IKZF3 may regulate the expression of FUT8. We further observed notable pleiotropy between variants in the IKZF3-ORMDL3-GSDMB-ZPBP2 locus with inflammatory conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (Fig. 2). We therefore aimed to disrupt this node of our network in our cellular model. Microarray and RNA sequencing data from the lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) used in this study showed that IKZF1 was more highly expressed than IKZF3. Because these genes are known to regulate one another, we decided to target IKZF1. To investigate the potential link between IKZF1 and FUT8, we identified IKZF1-binding sites on chromosome 14 near FUT8 in the LCL GM12878 Encode chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data. We performed ChIP followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm IKZF1 binding at one of these sites in an IgG-secreting human B cell–derived LCL, MATAT6 (Fig. 3A). We then investigated the role of IKZF1 in the regulation of FUT8 by conducting stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated knockdown of IKZF1 using shRNA in MATAT6 cells. This resulted in depletion of the IKZF1 transcript and protein (Fig. 3, B and C). Knockdown of IKZF1 was accompanied by a significant down-regulation of IKZF3 (Fig. 3D) and a 3.5-fold up-regulation in the expression of FUT8 (t test, P = 0.04; Fig. 3E), corroborating a link between IKZF1 and FUT8 and highlighting the dynamic relationships between TFs in B cells. Next, we looked at changes in the glycosylation of secreted IgG in cells with depleted IKZF1 at two different time points and observed a small but significant (P = 0.02; table S10) increase in fucosylation (Fig. 3F) resulting from IKZF1 knockdown. While this change is small, the low SE of triplicate measurements and independent replication of the experiment (second time point) demonstrate its robustness (table S10). In addition, one must consider that most of the glycans are fucosylated and that further fucosylation might be limited by specificities of glycosyltransferases involved in the process—the addition of bisecting GlcNAc to a growing glycan chain by MGAT3 inhibits fucosylation of these glycans (21). This change also results in a 20% decrease (from 5 to 4%) in afucosylated glycans [glycoforms activating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)]. These data are consistent with decreased expression of IKZF1 resulting in increased FUT8 expression and, thus, increased IgG fucosylation. Hence, although there is no in silico evidence that the lead SNP in the FUT8 locus overlaps with a predicted IKZF1-binding motif, and there is no evidence for the associated SNP being a FUT8 eQTL, we show that SNPs that are in LD with the lead FUT8 SNP can alter binding of IKZF1 (table S8). Furthermore, this TF can bind to regulatory regions of FUT8 and may act cooperatively with additional factors to modify its expression. To explore this further, we used publicly available Hi-C profiling performed at 1-kb resolution in the LCL GM12878. These data indicate that SNPs in the FUT8 locus lie in the same chromosomal topologically associating domain as the transcription start site of FUT8 (fig. S2B). CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) plays a crucial role in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the genome, and disruption of CTCF binding by SNPs in LD with rs4400971 may modify the interactions formed between enhancer and promoter regions of FUT8 to affect expression of the glycosyltransferase enzyme (for details, see Supplementary Note).

You know what’s really, really great?</p>
<p>The Doo Dah Parade.</p>
<p>This is not news you can use. You already know the Doo Dah Parade is great. And I knew it, too. If not present at the Chromo’s bar creation story in 1978, in young Old Pasadena, I was there for the second incarnation, which I believe was also in 1978.</p>
<p>Never on Sunday, see, is the Rose Parade’s motto, so Peter Apanel and pals schemed up a parade that would take advantage of the audience already gathered along Colorado Boulevard in those halcyon, or chaotic, days when I believe sidewalk camping in folding chairs was allowed slightly earlier than today.</p>

<p>That was Sunday, Jan. 1, and the crowds were waiting for Jan. 2 and the cold sunrise stepping-off of Pasadena’s original parade, so why not give them a show in the meantime?</p>
<p>The Tournament of Roses was not amused. A truce has been reached, down the decades.</p>
<p>The Doo Dah would be more beer-oriented than coffee-friendly, not requiring crack-of-dawn rising after late-night carousing. Its entries would not be from the Shriners, unless, well, they were making fun of the Shriners. It’s not that the Shriners don’t do a world of good. It’s that the times were ripe for parody.</p>
<p>Easy for us to say, in hindsight. But somebody had to make that parody happen. Not easy starting a parade. Just because Snotty Scotty and the Hankies, the Lawn Mower Drill Team, the Briefcase Drill Team, General Hershey Bar, the Bastard Sons of Lee Marvin and Claude Rains &amp; the 20-Man Memorial Invisible Man Marching Drill Team seem inevitable now doesn’t mean they were then. Not easy keeping it all going for 42 incarnations. Right, the numbers don’t add up. That’s because the second Doo Dah was in December of the same year as the first. It’s occasional, see. Just don’t let it ever stop.</p>
<p>The reason Doo Dah does still step off is entirely the Light Bringer Project, which is Paddy Hurley and Tom Coston. Parade gods from throughout the cosmos bless them for their cultural energy. Their move of the festivities to Lamanda Park in East Pas was logistical genius: easier parking, several fine dive bars. But I hadn’t been able to go in a decade because an annual camping/surfing trip was always the same Sunday. This year, the dates diverged.</p>
<p>I walked down from Walnut and when I hit the crowd I remembered the key thing: Everyone at Doo Dah is smiling and laughing because everything in Doo Dah is funny. The United States Space Force vehicle was a beat-up old station wagon with a donations box on the side. The Bond girl was riding in an open Morris Minor as her Bond car. The pretty woman with rainbow-colored hair leading a rainbow-colored horse was wearing an Hecho en Pasadena T-shirt. The Church of the SubGenius offered “Eternal salvation or triple your money back.”</p>
<p>There is some organization: Head-setted Paddy was directing traffic in the intersection of Vinedo and Colorado, and laughing. Earlier, my wife, who brought her Urban Sketchers L.A. group, had asked Tom if she could look at a parade lineup: “Oh, no, we tried that once, and gave up.” Yes, there are wranglers who make sure that, say, a musical group is not next to another musical group. But mild chaos still rules.</p>
<p>It’s a lovely parade.</p>
<p>Wednesday at random:</p>
<p>OK, can’t fault the Pasadena school board for not reading the civic room quickly. Last week’s action to nix the proposed $850 million construction bond its members were set to propose was the fastest turnaround in American political history … Turns out there are some graffiti issues with my formerly favored Plexiglass solution for an unclimbable fence to make the Colorado Street Bridge safer. But the steel-mesh fence proposed by Donald MacDonald Architects, with several iterations of it under commission review in Pasadena, is not bad at all, doesn’t change the overall character of the historic structure and will save lots of lives. … There’s an Instagram poll going around to Pasadena voters paid for by one of the mayoral candidates — and not saying by who. You choose three of 20 biggest issues. No. 3 is “unchecked development.” The perception of too much new construction is the No. 1 talker in single-family neighborhoods heading into the March election. But is that really the case, city-wide?</p>
