<p>Monaco have announced long-serving goalkeeper Danijel Subasic will leave the club at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old former Croatia international has made 292 appearances for Monaco since signing from Hajduk Split in 2012.</p>
<p>Subasic, whose contract expires on June 30, won Ligue 2 and Ligue 1 in the principality, while he was part of the side that reached the Champions League semi-finals in the 2016-17 season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate Danijel for his exceptional career with AS Monaco,&rdquo; said president Dmitry Rybolovlev.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came at the beginning of the project when we were still in the second division and has taken up many challenges over the years to contribute to the great achievements of the team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a great player who has demonstrated all his sporting qualities and great strength of character here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to thank him for his loyalty and for everything he has done here. Danijel will always be welcome at AS Monaco.&rdquo;

<p>Monaco&rsquo;s House of Grimaldi came to power in the 13th century but the family were catapulted into global fame in 1956 when ruler Prince Rainier III married Oscar-winning actress Grace Kelly.</p>
<p>The couple had three children – Caroline, Albert and Stephanie – before Princess Grace tragically died in a car accident in 1982 when she was just 52 years old.</p>
<p>Her death sparked claims that the family had been struck once more by the ancient “curse of the Grimaldis”.</p>
<p>(Image: AFP/Getty Images)</p>
<p>According to a 13th Century legend, a Flemish woman raped by a Grimaldi took revenge by pronouncing that &ldquo;never will a Grimaldi find true happiness in marriage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since then the family have experienced scandal, heartache and tragedy.</p>
<p>Grace Kelly&rsquo;s car crash</p>
<p>She was one of the most famous starlets in Hollywood history.</p>
<p>Her marriage to Prince Rainier III helped cement Monaco&rsquo;s glamorous reputation amongst the well-to-do.</p>
<p>But she tragically died in a car crash in 1982, following a stroke whilst driving with her teenage daughter Stephanie, on a winding road to the train station.</p>
<p>(Image: DPA/PA Images)</p>
<p>Dr. Jean Chatelain, chief surgeon at the hospital where she was treated, said the Hollywood starlet may have survived the stroke whilst at home.</p>
<p>He told the New York Times: &ldquo;It was an incident which, if it occurred at home—well, she might have sat down and perhaps felt better soon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been relatively benign, but you can&rsquo;t say for sure. It&rsquo;s conjecture. In other circumstances, of course, things could have evolved in a different manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Caroline&rsquo;s husband killed in speedboat crash</p>
<p>The royal is the eldest of the three.</p>
<p>After her mother&rsquo;s tragic death, she stepped up as the de facto first lady of Monaco.</p>
<p>Princess Caroline went to study philosophy, psychology and biology at the Sorbonne in Paris.</p>
<p>In France, she fell in love with Parisian banker Philippe Junot but the pair later divorced on the grounds they had produced no children.</p>
<p>And she had three children - Andrea, Pierre and Charlotte - with her second husband Stefano Casiraghi.</p>
<p>He later tragically died in a powerboat crash off the Monaco coast in 1990.</p>
<p>(Image: Reuters)</p>
<p>She later married Prince Ernst August of Hanover in 1999, and the pair had a daughter.</p>
<p>Monaco&rsquo;s Wild Child: Princess Stephanie</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caroline&rsquo;s youngest sibling Stephanie suffered greatly after being in the car with her mother when she sadly died.</p>
<p>She was hounded after her death after incorrect reports suggested that she had been behind the wheel at the time of the crash.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Dubbed the wild child of the family, she has led an exciting and adventurous life.</p>
<p>In 1991, she fell in love with her bodyguard Daniel Ducruet, and they had two children together</p>
<p>But the marriage was left in tatters when Mr Ducruet was was caught cavorting with a woman who had previously won the title Miss Topless Belgium.</p>
<p>She had a third child in 1998 with former palace security guard Jean Raymond Gottlieb, who is understood to have been head of security at the Palais Princier.</p>
<p>Although Camille shares Gottlieb&rsquo;s surname, his name is reportedly not on her birth certificate and Stephanie has never publicly confirmed his identity.</p>
<p>However Camille named him as her father in a birthday post on Instagram in 2017.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Princess started a relationship with married elephant trainer Franco Knie and moved herself and her three children into his circus caravan.</p>
<p>But the affair reportedly didn&rsquo;t last and in 2002, she returned to Monaco.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)</p>
<p>A year later in a whirlwind romance, the Princess married Adans Lopez Peres, who had worked in Knie&rsquo;s circus but the couple divorced in 2004.</p>
<p>Prince Albert of Monaco&rsquo;s two love children</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ruling Prince Albert&rsquo;s marriage to South African swimmer Charlene Wittstock was threatened by rumours of discontent.</p>
<p>The palace was forced to deny rumours that Wittstock tried to leave town on a one-way flight to South Africa over allegations of a third love child.</p>
<p>Albert himself admitted in 2005 that he had an illegitimate child with a flight attendant from Togo.</p>
<p>(Image: REUTERS)</p>
<p>He also has a daughter Jazmin with Tamara Rotola, a US estate agent.</p>
<p>The former Olympian gave an interview four months after the wedding - strongly denying the claims.</p>
<p>“Why would he go through all this effort to have our most intimate … dearest friends come join us, for us to be reluctant?” asks the South African former Olympic swimmer.</p>
<p>At the time Prince Albert, 62, said: “My family have long been the subject of rumours born out of jealousy.”</p>
<p>In December 2014, the couple welcomed twins, Jacques Honoré Rainier who will become Prince of Monaco after his father&rsquo;s death, and Gabriella Thérèse Marie, Countess of Carladès.

<h3 id="online--onsite-what-do-to-in-monaco-in-june">&ldquo;Online &amp; Onsite: What do to in Monaco in June?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.monaco-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/screenshot-2020-06-07-at-21.51.56.png" alt="img">
This week saw the reopening of museums, bars and restaurants across the Principality, with casinos and cinemas soon following suit. There has been no shortage of visitors to our favourite haunts over the past few days, ushering in a new, tentative phase of post-lockdown.</p>
<p>So, what is there to do in Monaco this June? Although it will not mirror the usual event-packed calendar of the typical year, there are still moments to be enjoyed that for so long have been experienced from the comfort of your sofa.</p>
<p>For those who are still unable to venture outside as freely as the rest of us, cultural institutions around Monaco have not forgotten the success of their virtual programmes, which will continue for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Below is a list of our top picks for virtual and real activities this month.</p>
<p>REAL</p>
<p>Nouveau Musée National de Monaco</p>
<p>From Tuesday June 2nd to Sunday August 30th 2020, the Nouveau Musée National de Monaco at Villa Paloma is hosting a spectacular exhibit from João Maria Gusmão, showcasing work from the painter Eugène Frey. It is not his painted works, however, that we are invited to appreciate in this exhibition.</p>
<p>Frey (1864 – 1942) invented the technique of light set projections on the stage of Monte-Carlo Opera. It is a technique employing light, sound and moving photos to project stunning images onto the stage. Gusmão reinterprets the method of these dynamic light sets to bring an intensely visual show.</p>
<p>The NMNM resides across two locations. Villa Sauber remains closed until further notice.</p>
<p>Visit Nouveau Musée National de Monaco</p>
<p>Oceanographic Museum of Monaco</p>
<p>How could we not include the Principality’s favourite? Safety measures abound, the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco has reopened its doors to welcome visitors once again. The crown jewel of Monaco, it is an opportunity to discover all things ocean.</p>
<p>This June, the museum is encouraging visits to come and experience marine life and the worlds’ oceans through its campaign #VivonsLOcean. Through a specially designed web application, you can show your support after you visit the museum by taking a selfie and sharing it to social media.</p>
<p>Visit the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco</p>
<p>Monaco Cathedral</p>
<p>One of the most impressive buildings in Monaco – an impressive feat given the urbanised landscape of the Principality – is the Cathedral perched on top of the Rock, alongside the other remarkable architecture such as the Palais de Justice and the Prince’s Palace itself. After many months of closed service, the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate has once again opened for visitors to experience the interior in all its glory.</p>
<p>Visit Monaco Cathedral</p>
<p>Opera Gallery</p>
<p>Opera Gallery, boasting twelve locations around the world, is a world-leading group of art galleries which represents and deals in modern and contemporary works. Their sites in Paris, Geneva, Dubai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Miami are now open to the public, as well as our own gallery here in the Principality.</p>
<p>Previous exhibitions have included Pierre Soulages, Andy Denzler and the yearly edition of the Monaco Masters show.</p>
<p>Visit Opera Gallery</p>
<p>Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology</p>
<p>This Friday, the Principality’s only anthropology institute is reopening but with a twist. Whereas their interactive programmes during lockdown got the whole family involved in discovering the ancient wonders of the Rock, now they propose that visitors suggest what they want to see in the museum, in order to tailor the exhibitions to what the public wants to uncover.</p>
<p>Visit the Museum of Prehistoric Anthropology</p>
<p>VIRTUAL</p>
<p>Monaco Artist’s Forum</p>
<p>Usually organised at the beginning of June at the Rainier III Auditorium, this much-awaited event will allow you to see Monaco’s resident artists showcase their work in a virtual exhibition. From Friday June 5th at 11 am, to Friday July 3rd 2020, roughly 80 artists, amateurs or professionals, can present their paintings, sculptures and photography.</p>
<p>This 5th edition will allow the public to vote online for their favourite work. The winner will be announced on June 13th.</p>
<p>Visit the 5th Monaco Artist’s Forum</p>
<p>Oceanographic Museum of Monaco</p>
<p>From June 6th, the museum will inaugurate its second annual “Fête du musée”, a digital programme of month-long celebrations marking World Ocean Day for those who cannot visit their site.</p>
<p>Children can access a series of interactive games, quizzes and pet “adoption” scheme, as well as lessons in writing for journalism run by Monaco Matin. The Monaco 360 virtual tour of the museum is still up and running for those who are unable to visit the museum.</p>
<p>Participate in the “Fête du musée”</p>
<p>Monaco’s media library</p>
<p>A life-line for many bored families and culture connoisseurs during lockdown, the Mediathèque continues to offer its home-delivery and takeaway service for books and films. If you have no clue what you want to watch or read, the team across the Mediathèque’s establishments will help you discover something new by hand-picking some options to suit your cultural tastes.</p>
<p>To receive your book selection, visit Monaco’s Médiathèque</p>
<p>artmonte-carlo</p>
<p>Beginning last month, organisers of artmonte-carlo have digitalised the vast majority of works that would have featured in its 5th annual edition at the Grimaldi Forum. The catalogue, still available online, is a beautiful display of works to pore over, with the information of artists, galleries and auction houses added alongside to encourage dialogue on these pieces between art fans, collectors and artists alike.</p>
<p>Download your catalogue for free</p>
<p>Monte-Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra at home (#OPMCathome)</p>
<p>For the music lovers amongst us, the Philharmonic Orchestra of Monte Carlo is providing short clips showcasing individual orchestra members playing an array of classical compositions. At the two to three-minute mark, these quick-fire recitals are for both the classical music aficionado as well as the complete novice wanting to dip their toe in the waters.</p>
<p>Discover all of Orchestra’s videos</p>
<p>Estimates currently believe that 13% of all cultural institutions worldwide will not reopen now we have left lockdown. Now it is more important than ever to support Monaco’s thriving cultural scene and support local creatives.

<h3 id="monaco-opening-its-luxurious-doors-to-instagram-stars">&ldquo;Monaco: Opening its luxurious doors to Instagram stars&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B7D8/production/_112746074_thumbnailv3.png" alt="img">
Video</p>
<p>Monaco is the second smallest country in the world and linked to glamour ever since Hollywood star Grace Kelly became the Princess of Monaco in 1956.</p>
<p>Today the state boasts that one in three of its residents is a millionaire and is known for its discretion and privacy.</p>
<p>But Monaco has now opened its doors wide open for the younger jet-set Instagram generation, by hosting the Monaco Influencer Awards.</p>
<p>You can watch the three-part series &lsquo;Inside Monaco: Playground of the Rich&rsquo; starting Monday 8 June at 21:00, on BBC Two. It will be available to watch on iPlayer soon after broadcast.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.monaco-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/milos-prelevic-rfxxwy7nl04-unsplash.jpg" alt="img">
On June 5th, the Rock celebrated World Environment Day. This year, the Principality was joined by 14 other countries in the bid to governments worldwide to protect the environment.</p>
<p>“It is important to focus the attention of as many people as possible on this biodiversity that we all too often ignore,” declared Marie-Pierre Gramaglia, Minister of Public Works, the Environment and Urban Development. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List for Threatened Species, more than 31,000 species are considered endangered out of 116,000 studied.</p>
<p>Preserving at least 30% of the Earth and ocean</p>
<p>This new engagement reinforces the Principality’s action in favour of biodiversity conservation. As well as monitoring programmes for marine and land-based fauna and flora, the Prince’s Government is also working on the implementation of a National Biodiversity Strategy (SNB) for Horizon 2030. The objective is to reinforce nature’s place in the urban environment, improve quality of life and adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>On this day, the Principality joined the High Ambition Coalition’s call to action, an intergovernmental group which defends protecting at least 30% of the Earth’s land and oceans by 2030. “This pandemic brings powerful, unprecedented proof that nature and man share the same destiny and are far more closely linked than many of us have realised,” assured Laurent Anselmi, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, who represents Monaco in this coalition.

Home of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, the Principality of Monaco has been one of the world’s leading sports venues for decades. Here’s why.</p>
<p>An intimately entwined relationship with no sign of stopping in sight, Monaco has always been synonymous with sport on the Rock. As the epicentre of a handful of the world’s biggest sporting events, the Principality is a true model of urban planning when it comes to its facilities.</p>
<p>Despite its small surface area, little over 2 km2, Monaco is home to the Stade Louis II, the heart and soul of the territory, which homes an unsuspected number of disciplines. The water sports centre, sports hall, dojo, fencing and boxing hall all quietly sit below the stadium’s pitch which itself has seen some of the most prestigious teams in Europe challenge the Rock’s very own AS Monaco. Many world athletics stars have crossed its hallowed track, thanks to the Herculis Meeting which takes place every summer. The formidable showcase of Monaco’s architecture, way ahead of its time, was built in 1985, reflecting Monaco’s love of sport.</p>
<p>If Louis II has not satisfied your sporting appetite, the streets of the Principality often transform into a life-size playground. The whole Rock lights up with a thousand lights throughout the year as sporting events follow one another in the Principality, from the Formula 1 Grand Prix, Jumping International and Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters at the Country Club. A country of champions, Monaco is home to many sportsmen and women, some of whom, in addition to having written their own history on the Rock, reside all year round on the Mediterranean shores.</p>
<p>Sport in Monaco: a family affair</p>
<p>As a stronghold of world sport, Monaco hosts the SPORTEL Awards, a conference which brings together decision-makers from the media and sporting industries. Playing a pivotal role in significant sport advances worldwide, Monaco has the unwavering support of the HSH Prince Albert II. After all, it is the result of the passionate sportspeople of the Princely Family that makes Monaco’s roots in it so strong.</p>
<p>Jack Kelly, the Sovereign’s maternal grandfather and father of Grace Kelly, was an Olympic rowing champion at the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games. President of the Monegasque Olympic Committee, which brings together twenty federations and prepares athletes to compete for the Olympic Games, Prince Albert II continually strives to make Monaco a sporting stronghold. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, the son of Prince Rainier III took part in five Olympic Winter Games on the bobsleigh team (Calgary 1988, Albertville 1992, Lillehammer 1994, Nagano 1998 and Salt Lake City 2002).</p>
<p>More recently, Princess Charlene of Monaco, the Prince’s wife and ex-swimmer became involved by putting forward an official car to take part in the forthcoming virtual 24 Hours of Le Mans (June 13-14th), a unique endurance race involving professional drivers and Esport specialists. The team is composed of Francesco Castellacci, Felipe Masa, Giancarlo Fisichella and Tony Mella.</p>
<p>“Being starter of the 87th 24 Hours of Le Mans was an unforgettable moment, and I am grateful to the Automobile Club de l’Ouest for offering me the opportunity to experience it,” said Princess Charlene. “This year we forge more ties between Monaco and Le Mans, both well-known for motorsport, with the #54 Strong Together team that will be racing under the banner of my foundation and the flag of the Principality.” It is set to be yet another way of positioning Monaco centre on the worldwide sporting stage.</p>
<p>Physical education at the heart of the national curriculum</p>
<p>The Prince’s Government has put in place a policy focused on three primary objectives: the development of sport in schools, the promotion of mass sport and the encouragement of competitive sport. To meet the first point, the Government has included physical education and swimming lessons in the timetable, which are taught from a young age by specialised teachers. School buildings are equipped with sports facilities for more conventional sports, both group and individual. With nearly a hundred sports associations, many of which receive state funding, young Monegasques can practise a multitude of disciplines.</p>
<p>Secondary school pupils benefit from a large number of hours of training due to many classes offered at flexible hours. In line with the status of high-level Olympic sportsman, which was introduced to encourage the participation of national sportspeople in significant events such as the Olympic Games, sport is encouraged in all areas of life in Monaco. Through the Monegasque Olympic Committee, national athletes can benefit from assistance in their Olympic training.
