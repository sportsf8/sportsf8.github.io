<p>Earlier this month, Emmerdale began the first British soap to resume filming after production was halted amid the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>And star Danny Miller has opened up about what it&rsquo;s like to film socially-distanced scenes amid the special lockdown episodes for the ITV soap, saying that at times it had been &lsquo;difficult&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking on Wednesday&rsquo;s Lorraine, the actor, 29, who plays Aaron Dingle also described himself and co-star Jeff Hordley (Cain Dingle) as &lsquo;guinea pigs&rsquo; after being the first cast members to begin filming the unique episodes.</p>
<p>Chat: Danny Miller has opened up about what it&rsquo;s like to film socially-distanced Emmerdale scenes amid the special lockdown episodes for the ITV soap, saying that at times it had been &lsquo;difficult&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last month it was revealed that Emmerdale&rsquo;s production team had recorded six new episodes using a pared back crew at the show&rsquo;s studios in Leeds, with stories focused on characters in lockdown.</p>
<p>ITV confirmed that social distancing measures and safety protocols were put into place and strictly adhered to by the team, with the episodes being recorded over a two-week period.</p>
<p>One of the episodes include a two-hander between Cain and nephew Aaron, with Cain struggling over his feelings for estranged wife Moira, while Aaron becomes angered after his uncle hides a letter by his imprisoned husband Robert Sugden.</p>
<p>Guinea pigs: Speaking on Wednesday&rsquo;s Lorraine, the actor, 29, who plays Aaron Dingle also described himself and co-star Jeff Hordley (Cain Dingle) as &lsquo;guinea pigs&rsquo; after being the first cast members to begin filming the unique episodes</p>
<p>Discussing the filming and how it differs from their usual work, Danny explained: &lsquo;The distance obviously is different. We’re having to abide by rules and stay 2 metres apart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe it or not, it’s a lot more difficult for us to just do the everyday work because on top of that we’re in charge of cleaning and looking after our own props. The distance thing between television is kind of unsaid realise because you don’t realise how close you get to the director when you show them your scripts and suddenly you’re there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So there was people who was put in place to kind of be there and ensure that we didn’t get carried away and suddenly face to face. It was difficult, a lot different obviously.</p>
<p>Changes: Discussing the filming and how it differs from their usual work, Danny explained: &lsquo;The distance obviously is different. We’re having to abide by rules and stay 2 metres apart</p>
<p>Difficult: &lsquo;Believe it or not, it’s a lot more difficult for us to just do the everyday work because on top of that we’re in charge of cleaning and looking after our own props&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the star opened up on making sure they adhered to the rules while filming, telling Lorraine Kelly: &lsquo;Jeff and I were used as guinea pigs if you like. We were very nervous to do this anyway. Not only do you have to keep yourself safe by keeping your distance but make sure you have to make sure you’re keeping everyone else safe too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, with both Cain and Aaron having been forced to confront their feelings over their other halves, Danny praised the ITV soap for highlighting the importance of men opening up about their feelings,</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;The whole lockdown experience and what we’re going through is encouraging us all to do that. I think Emmerdale are very good at picking out the topical stories and kind of creating them into the norm.</p>
<p>Filming: Meanwhile, the star opened up on making sure they adhered to the rules while filming, telling Lorraine Kelly: &lsquo;Jeff and I were used as guinea pigs if you like</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cain and Aaron are two characters in Emmerdale who stereotypically in this world that we live in wouldn’t want top talk to each other, and are two alpha males – beer and fighting an all that kind of talk that they do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He continued: &lsquo;But when it comes to the aspect of talking, it’s completely different. Aaron is a lot more acceptable and receptive of talking about his feelings whereas Cain isn’t. And myself suffering with anxiety and depression, it’s amazing how a) I was very pleased to be part of it and b) that Emmerdale were tipping their hat to mental health.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jeff Hordley who plays Cain Dingle also appeared on Loose Women on Wednesday, where he also discussed the lockdown episodes.</p>
<p>Speaking to the panel, he said: &lsquo;What’s great about this episode is that they have this journey to go on. Our episode was a well-crafted episode and was a joy for Danny and I to work on.</p>
<p>Praise: &lsquo;The whole lockdown experience and what we’re going through is encouraging us all to do that. I think Emmerdale are very good at picking out the topical stories and kind of creating them into the norm&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Again in these times, it’s about trying to find positives and negatives. Because of these restrictions of these episodes, it’s less event based stuff, so there’s no car crashes or things like that. It’s going back to the ‘kitchen sink’ drama which is what people love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The star also joked that he almost forgot how to act after months away from filming due to lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;Even when you go on holiday, you come back and you’re a little bit rusty. I felt particularly rusty, felt like I was really ‘acting’ which was first few scenes. But then it’s like riding a bike, you don’t forget it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Previously speaking about the lockdown episodes, Executive producer Jane Hudson said: &lsquo;Lockdown has created an opportunity for us to focus on what is important in our lives.</p>
<p>Chat: Meanwhile, Jeff Hordley who plays Cain Dingle also appeared on Loose Women on Wednesday, where he also discussed the lockdown episodes</p>
<p>Back at it: &lsquo;Even when you go on holiday, you come back and you’re a little bit rusty. I felt particularly rusty, felt like I was really ‘acting’ which was first few scenes&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we first discussed commissioning these episodes back in March the writers instantly rose to the challenge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seven weeks into lockdown and the scripts have an added poignancy and meaning. The response from everyone at Emmerdale to filming these episodes has been fantastic and we&rsquo;re really grateful for their support.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While John Whiston - Managing Director of Continuing Drama for ITV Studios and Head of ITV in the North - added: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s brilliant that Jane and the team at Emmerdale have risen to the challenge of getting these episodes shot using the new protocols for filming drama while observing the government&rsquo;s social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s back: Emmerdale became the first British soap to resume filming with a &lsquo;phased return&rsquo; starting with six new episodes featuring characters in lockdown</p>
<p>Directed by Ian Bevitt, the six new episodes focus on Cain and Aaron (Jeff Hordley and Danny Miller), Chas and Paddy (Lucy Pargeter and Dominic Brunt), Sam and Lydia (James Hooton and Karen Blick), Marlon, Al and Ellis (Mark Charnock, Michael Wildman and Aaron Anthony), Mandy and Vinny (Lisa Riley and Bradley Johnson), and Jimmy and Nicola (Nick Miles and Nicola Wheeler).</p>
<p>ITV teased the episodes will see &lsquo;resentments and past feuds resurface, old wounds further exposed, relationships scrutinised, with doubts and insecurities laid bare&rsquo;, with a hint of romance.</p>
<p>Emmerdale airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7pm on ITV.

<p>Emmerdale actor Danny Miller has opened up on being in lockdown with his sister’s family.</p>
<p>The soap star, who plays Aaron Dingle on the ITV soap, recently wowed fans with a photograph of himself looking after his nieces and nephews on Instagram.</p>
<p>Danny is currently staying in lockdown with his girlfriend Steph Jones, as well as his sister Lucy Stratton and her three children.</p>
<p>The soap star’s snap shows him laying on a bed while feeding a bottle to his youngest nephew, Teddy, as his other nephew and niece sit next to him on the bed, while his pet Cavapoo named Gini is nestled in the middle.</p>

<p>As he posted the photo on his Instagram page he wrote in the caption: “Danny Day Care. Got dis #lockdown malarkey #lockeddown,” followed by a baby and dog emoji.</p>
<p>But, Danny has since revealed the photo is not as peaceful as it seems.</p>
<p>During a chat with Lorraine Kelly via video link on her show on the morning of Wednesday 10 June, Danny admitted: “I mean the picture paints a scene of calm, but really that was post a really big argument when every one was tired and everyone needed a little sleep.</p>
<p>“So, that picture was taken, obviously as these pictures are, at the nicest of times shall we say. There was a lot of screaming beforehand.</p>
<p>“But, my nieces and nephews and my sister has kind of been on lockdown a lot with me here so I’ve been on hand to help out with the kids and stuff, which has been great but also kind of refreshing when you close your bedroom door.”</p>
<p>It comes after Danny recently opened up about his mental health in lockdown and praised his girlfriend Steph for her support.</p>
<p>As he posted a selfie of him and Step with their adorable pet dog he opened up about his struggles in the caption.</p>
<p>Danny wrote: “I couldn’t have got through #lockdown without these two little belters! I can sit and pose on a bed and pretend to know what I’m doing in #DannyDayCare as much as I want you to see.</p>
<p>“Truth is @stephjones1710 is the secret behind this black mirror of mine. She deserves the credit, entirely.</p>
<p>“We all show off our best moments on socials, never do we share the worst moments. But this girl has shared and carried some of the lowest points of my life over the last few months.”</p>
<p>He added: “A bloody good partner, daughter, sister, auntie but most importantly a true friend. A light at the end of a very dark tunnel for me.</p>
<p>“All that thrown into a big bowl of love and appreciation, mixed in with a beautiful #CAVAPOO in little #GINI has played a huge part in ms overcoming those dark moments!”</p>
<p>Danny revealed: “Anxiety and depression grabs you and shakes you no matter who you are or what walk of life. And I hope you read this post (and yes you may cringe) and see the bigger picture. Talk to someone.</p>
<p>“And allow someone to love you and love them in return. And then, like me, hopefully, you too can see a genuine path to welcoming and dealing with the horrible, invisible illness that is #anxiety and #depression.</p>
<p>“I hope you find that partner and that friend. Like me. And if you’re still reading this.. You’re doing great and I’m glad you exist”.

<h3 id="why-emmerdales-danny-miller-is-now-doing-the-washing-up-on-set">&ldquo;Why Emmerdale’s Danny Miller is now doing the washing up on set!&rdquo;</h3>

New filming rules have got the Emmerdale cast doing all sorts…</p>
<p>So Emmerdale has started filming again, albeit in a new normal.</p>
<p>The soap’s bosses have recently revealed the lengths they are going to stick to new health and safety guidelines in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Talking of the rules, in a recent press conference, producer Jane Hudson joked about Emmerdale star Danny Miller, who plays Aaron Dingle.</p>
<p>“Danny Miller has had to wash up saucepans in a scene – it’s the most he’s touched saucepans, like ever!”</p>
<p>Describing the on set behaviour of the pared-down cast and crew as a ‘game of Twister’, Jane also revealed how they’re maintaining the two-metre social distancing rule:</p>
<p>“We have our famous 2 metre pole and we physically bring it out on the set and hold it between actors and the crew. We have two metre distanced dots across every set and you stand on your dot.”</p>
<p>Speaking of the special lockdown episodes they have been filming – which are set to air from next week – Jane continued: “I hope you will be amazed how little you notice that they are two metres apart. There are some clever camera tricks involved.</p>
<p>“There will be little moments where you might expect a hug and they don’t but I’ve been on set the whole time and the end result amazed me.”</p>
<p>The three-week chunk of newly filmed episodes will feature some of Emmerdale’s best-loved characters such as Chas and Paddy (Lucy Pargeter and Dominic Brunt), Cain and Aaron Dingle (Jeff Hordley and Danny Miller) and Mandy Dingle and Vinny (Lisa Riley and Bradley Johnson). But these ‘specials’ will only loosely tie in to current storylines.</p>
<p>“It’s a snapshot of characters in lockdown but they do pick up in places of what was going on the show before hand,” explained producer Laura Shaw. “Each episode reveals a new bit of information or a secret that will feed into future storylines.”</p>
<p>Said producer Kate Brooks: “We hope the audience will be very positive to see these familiar characters going through what we all are going through albeit in a soap like fashion. To see them just doing day to day instead of big storylines, and to discover new things about each other.”</p>
<p>The first of the lockdown episodes airs on Monday 8 June at 7pm and stars Sam and Lydia Dingle, with the second going out on Wednesday 10th June at 7pm with Cain and Aaron Dingle.</p>
<p>Emmerdale continues on ITV.

<p>Emmerdale actor Danny Miller has revealed how he has found returning to filming, as one of the first UK soap stars to be back on set.</p>
<p>The ITV soap has filmed special lockdown episodes, with the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>After reducing the amount of episodes it aired per week, as filming was halted in March, ITV feared the soap would have to go off air.</p>
<p>But by reducing transmission again to two episodes a week and filming new lockdown content, the soap will be staying on air.</p>
<p>A few cast members returned recently to the studio to film the new scenes, while having to follow strict distancing measures.</p>
<p>Danny has returned as character Aaron Dingle, for a special episode with on-screen uncle Cain Dingle.</p>
<p>Speaking about the episode before it airs, Danny revealed it was &ldquo;daunting&rdquo; to return but that he was &ldquo;honoured&rdquo; to be asked to film one of the episodes.</p>
<p>While he didn&rsquo;t struggle with the scripts, he confessed there wasn&rsquo;t much time for him or co-star Jeff Hordley to rehearse the scenes in the studio.</p>
<p>(Image: Twitter)</p>
<p>He explained: &ldquo;I often find that I work best under pressure, when I have to just throw it all in the pot and go for it.</p>
<p>So this was an exciting, and yes, a slightly daunting challenge. But the writer, Adam Sales, has been with the show since I first started, he was a runner initially and one of my favourites with that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he knows the characters and their stories as well as anyone and it really tells in the fluency and pitch of the story arc within the episode. It is great as nothing appears forced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s easy to read and learn and that helps massively. And we don’t fill empty moments with dialogue. I enjoy scripts that are left to breathe. And this is certainly one of those scripts. Well done Adam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny added: &ldquo;We had a day&rsquo;s rehearsal. This was in the studio with the director and producer. So we could read through and bring up any queries or issues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Jeff and I spent an hour FaceTiming each other to run through the episode a little bit more so we were fully prepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then straight onto shoot day. This shows how quickly Emmerdale and ITV can turn round a gritty piece of continuing drama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So this episode was quite a different process. Because not only did we have all the usual bits to remember, lines, positions, cues etc but also making sure health and safety was included and prioritised. Quite rightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emmerdale airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 7pm on ITV.

Emmerdale actor Danny Miller has opened up about filming a special lockdown episode opposite Cain Dingle&rsquo;s Jeff Hordley.</p>
<p>Danny portrays Aaron Dingle in the soap, but on June 10, he&rsquo;ll be holed up with Cain in a fascinating encounter that&rsquo;s going to show two previously reserved men sharing their emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I felt honoured that Jeff and I were trusted with an episode telling the story of being in lockdown together,&rdquo; revealed Danny. &ldquo;As a man, I can say first-hand how difficult it is to talk in general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the lockdown and the scary reality of the virus being thrown in there, it makes it 10 times harder to offload and share feelings. It&rsquo;s no longer general, it&rsquo;s a pandemic. And everyone has worries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The star went on to admit he was &ldquo;glad&rdquo; the show&rsquo;s writing team took a pair of Emmerdale&rsquo;s less forthcoming characters and put them in this situation together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brain tends to tell you to keep your own problems to yourself more than ever, so as not to add to anyone else&rsquo;s worries,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad the producers and writers took two of Emmerdale&rsquo;s characters who like to portray &lsquo;two men who don&rsquo;t like opening up&rsquo; to address how easy it can be when that burden is lifted by having a simple conversation with one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Discussing the dialogue-heavy scenes, Danny said he &ldquo;works best under pressure, when I have to just throw it all in the pot and go for it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>ITV</p>
<p>Danny also namechecked Emmerdale writer Adam Sales for his understanding of the characters and their personal stories, &ldquo;and it really tells in the fluency and pitch of the story arc within the episode&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a day&rsquo;s rehearsal,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;This was in the studio with the director and producer. So we could read through and bring up any queries or issues.

Former JLL executive Jorg Mast and LaPaul Partners president Chris Paul are joining Colliers International. The seasoned local property executives will help lead a new team focused on investment-grade multifamily and mixed-use properties in Texas and the surrounding region.</p>
<p>“The addition of Jorg and Chris will be a great benefit to our growing capital markets team and our clients,” said Steve Everbach, Colliers International President, Central Region | U.S. Brokerage.</p>
<p>Prior to joining Colliers, Mast spent the last six years at JLL, focusing exclusively on investment sales of institutional multifamily properties. Danny Miller, who was also previously at JLL, will accompany him to Colliers as a senior associate. Before JLL, Danny held positions at Newmark Knight Frank and HFF.</p>
<p>“Colliers’ recent acquisition of Dougherty Mortgage (now Colliers Mortgage) will enable us to directly originate loans from Fannie Mae and HUD,” said Mast. “This will allow us to function as true advisors to our clients, providing them with acquisition and disposition services, originating mortgage debt, and arranging JV equity and structured financing.”</p>
<p>Paul was previously the founder and President of LaPaul Partners, a Dallas-based boutique commercial real estate advisory firm.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 years, LaPaul Partners has specialized in the sale and financing of institutional-grade multifamily properties in Texas and throughout the southern U.S.</p>
<p>“I am excited to help create this new, full-service multifamily platform for Colliers’ Central Region. Rarely, do you find this type of entrepreneurial opportunity at such a large, global company,” said Chris. “Jorg and I look forward to seeing what we can achieve together.”</p>
<p>Other recent personnel moves in the commercial real estate industry include:</p>
<p>Mohr Capital has promoted Susan Cheng to executive vice president and chief operating officer while Rodrigo Godoi is now managing director of investments. Cheng will oversee business operations, manage the accounting and finance functions, and work closely with the company’s investment team. Cheng joined Mohr Capital as COO in 2018 and previously held several roles in the real estate and financial sectors with positions at Ernst &amp; Young and other notable firms.</p>
<p>Godoi began working with Mohr Capital in 2015 and manages acquisitions for office and industrial properties. Since obtaining a master’s degree from Cornell University, he has held various positions and has been able to perfect the ins and outs of the acquisitions process.</p>
<p>Paladin Partners has hired two new executives; Brent Bosworth as vice president and Ross Farance as vice president of space optimization. In his new role, Bosworth will be responsible for business development and servicing of clients locally and nationally.</p>
<p>Farance has spent the last decade in the material handling industry, focusing on the delivery of material handling equipment and space-saving solutions for large corporations nationally. He will be tasked with the consulting of clients to analyze tacking and space optimization within Paladin’s warehouse footprints. Before being hired by Paladin, Farance spent 11 years with Malin as a sales associate.</p>
<p>Brown and Caldwell, an environmental engineering and construction firm, appointed Adam Evans as vice president and area leader for its Texas business. Evans has 17 years of knowledge in the water and wastewater sector.</p>
<p>In his new role, Evans will be responsible for operations management, business development, driving new client growth, and expanding the firm’s presence to meet market and customer needs. Evans will oversee projects involving the construction of municipal water, wastewater, and stormwater. Before Evans’ new position, the business veteran spent nine years with CDM Smith as DFW regional manager and client services manager and six years with HDR Engineering as a project manager and engineer.
