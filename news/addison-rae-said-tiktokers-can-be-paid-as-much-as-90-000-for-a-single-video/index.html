<p>TikTok star Addison Rae shocked David Dobrik and Jason Nash with how much you can earn from one post on the platform.</p>
<p>Rae appeared on the podcast &ldquo;VIEWS with David Dobrik and Jason Nash&rdquo; to discuss how to make money on TikTok.</p>
<p>She said the most she&rsquo;s heard someone has made from a single TikTok is $90,000.</p>
<p>Madison Beer and Dobrik then revealed how much they&rsquo;ve known people to earn on Instagram and YouTube — upwards of $250,000 and $500,000 respectively.</p>

<p>Addison Easterling, better known as Addison Rae, appeared on David Dobrik and Jason Nash&rsquo;s podcast &ldquo;VIEWS&rdquo; this week to talk all things TikTok. Dobrik asked her how much a TikTok star can make from one post alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One TikTok, that I&rsquo;m aware of &hellip;&rdquo; she began, before the others started to guess. In the end, she said she&rsquo;d heard of one star on the platform being paid $90,000 for one sponsored video.</p>
<p>Dobrik said it&rsquo;s a misconception that people get paid per post on TikTok.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only when it&rsquo;s branded that you make money,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Madison Beer, who was also on the podcast, said TikTok is still relatively new so brands are still working it out. On a platform like Instagram, she said, stars are often paid upwards of $250,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instagram is insane,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;People get paid like a million dollars for a story, some people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dobrik then revealed how much he&rsquo;s known one video make on YouTube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like $500,000 for an integration on YouTube,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For like a 20-30 second plug, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>

Addison Rae apologises to Charli D&rsquo;Amelio after liking old &ldquo;shady&rdquo; comments</p>
<p>By Katie Louise Smith</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know that I&rsquo;ve loved and supported Charli since the day I met her. I think Charli deserves everything she&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TikTok star Addison Rae has apologised to friend and former Hype House collaborator Charli D&rsquo;Amelio after fans noticed that she had previously liked &ldquo;shady&rdquo; comments about the 16-year-old star in her comments section.</p>
<p>The whole thing started when fans recently clocked some old comments about Charli – including one that said &ldquo;she&rsquo;s verified and you&rsquo;re not something&rsquo;s wrong there&rdquo; – that had been liked by Addison. It turns out that these comments were actually from way back in November, before Addison even knew Charli, before she met her and before they joined the Hype House.</p>

<p>The screenshots soon went viral and later caught the attention of Charli and her sister Dixie, the latter of whom is one of Addison&rsquo;s closest friends.</p>

<p>Fans believed that the two sisters were subtly responding to Addison&rsquo;s &ldquo;likes&rdquo; with subtweets and TikToks of their own. Dixie even posted a series of tweets, saying: &ldquo;the jealousy OH MY GOD,&rdquo; and &ldquo;charli deserves better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also wrote: &ldquo;last thing im gonna say, i love my friends but my family comes first and i will not apologize for sticking up for my sister. i have love for everyone i am just very frustrated rn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Later, Addison took to Instagram explain why she had liked the comments on her page in a heartfelt statement, and also reiterated that she has spoken and apologised to Charli about the whole thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gonna talk about it before it&rsquo;s on here. yes, I did like comments saying &lsquo;she deserves the hype&rsquo; and &lsquo;whys charli verified and you aren&rsquo;t&rsquo; in november,&rdquo; wrote Addison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know her and hadn&rsquo;t met her. THIS IS NO EXCUSE&hellip; BUT i will say, i had just gotta out of an extremely toxic and mentally abusive relationship that my heart to shreds. I was fully depressed and hated myself. I thought I was worthless without him after 5 years of being together. I searched for compliments and love from others because I couldn&rsquo;t love myself without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued: &ldquo;I do know that i&rsquo;ve loved and supported Charli since the day I met her. I think Charli deserves everything she&rsquo;s done &amp; I know she genuinely loves doing this and loves her supporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I already told her that she doesn&rsquo;t need to forgive me, but I will say I was insanely desperate for love at the point in my life and that was what I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the drama, it looks like everyone has thankfully moved on and are still good friends.</p>
<p>A few days later, Addison and Dixie posted photos of each other on their socials, and responded to the speculation surrounding their friendship by posting a TikTok poking fun at a headline on Snapchat&rsquo;s Discover page.</p>
<p>TikTok Queen Charli also appeared to have remained unbothered throughout the entire thing.

Could Addison Rae be joining the Vlog Squad? That’s what fans think, as more rumors about the TikTok star’s swap from the Hype House to David Dobrik’s crew start popping up.</p>
<p>Addison Rae is one of TikTok ⁠— and the internet’s ⁠— biggest stars. She has 46.3 million followers on the viral social media platform, 20 million on Instagram, and over two million on YouTube and Twitter.</p>
<p>She’s currently part of one of TikTok’s biggest collectives, the Hype House. However, allegiances could be changing, with a possible move to the Vlog Squad being teed up.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Rae has been connected to the Dobrik-led collective numerous times before. These latest rumors might be the most solid yet though.</p>
<p>Zane Hijazi made a comment on Instagram about Rae’s “status” within the Vlog Squad, saying that “she’s still in the audition process.”</p>
<p>Read more: Hype House cuts ties with Darianka amid bullying allegations</p>
<p>Whether this was tongue-in-cheek or not, it has got fans from all sides of the spectrum reeling. Some are looking forward to perhaps more Rae and Dobrik action on the regular, while others don’t want to see her leave the Hype House.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Rae has also spent some time collaborating with Dobrik recently. She appeared on his Views podcast to talk about how much money TikTok creators are making, and also has made a couple of YouTube vlog cameos.</p>
<p>It also comes after dating rumors between the two were shut down over time. Back in April, the TikTok duo were all the rage ⁠— as a couple ⁠— but that has seemingly fizzled out after the pair consistently denied it.</p>
<p>Read more: Addison Rae stuns Dobrik with how much money TikTok stars make</p>
<p>Rae hasn’t officially left the Hype House ⁠— the rival collective to the Vlog Squad ⁠— but rumors of her exit have circulated for months. Rae was penned to leave the house after the D’Amelio sisters bailed in April, but nothing has happened since.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>All these signs and more have been pointing towards Addison’s potential jump from the House to the Squad. However, nothing is set in stone yet.</p>
<p>If the move does end up happening though, it would be a big scalp for the Vlog Squad. Rae’s huge social reach is a big asset to have, and it could only lead to more hilarious collabs between her and Dobrik which fans love.

TikTok star Addison Rae is one of the most followed users on the popular social media app. Since the 19-year-old joined the platform in 2019, she’s amassed more than 46 million TikTok followers and has become known for her dance videos. Addison Rae sat down for the latest episode of Genius' Between The Lines to break down some of the songs that have taken off on TikTok.</p>
<p>Addison Rae discussed lyrics from songs like The Kid LAROI’s “Addison Rae,” Megan Thee Stallion and Beyonce’s “Savage (Remix),” and Lil Mosey’s “Blueberry Faygo.”</p>
<p>Addison said that there’s no doubt that TikTok has been able to influence the music industry. So far we’ve seen songs like “Toosie Slide,” “Say So,” and “The Box” gain traction on the app and then become huge chart climbers.</p>
<p>“Not only does it really bring songs to the top of the charts, but obviously artists are really enjoying being on the app and bringing their music to the platform, and I think there’s no better way to do that than incorporate the app into their music,” she said.</p>

<p>Thomas Petrou loves nothing more than covering his friend&rsquo;s belongings with photos of their ex and current baes. Just a few weeks after he covered Chase Hudson&rsquo;s room with pictures of Charli D&rsquo;Amelio, Thomas pulled the prank once again, this time on Addison Rae.</p>
<p>With Bryce Hall&rsquo;s help, Thomas covered Addison&rsquo;s new Jeep with photos of Addison and Bryce. Of course, they needed a lot of pics to get the job done, so Thomas printed 750 copies of an iconic Braddison photo.</p>

<p>When the job was finished, Bryce seemed very pleased with the results. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m going to start crying,&rdquo; he said when he saw the car. He also warned, &ldquo;If Addison takes this off, no more Braddison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Addison was a very good sport about the whole thing and posed for pics after the reveal of the car. She even seemed to like the pictures, commenting,&ldquo;Not too mad about it&rdquo; on Bryce&rsquo;s Instagram.</p>

<p>This comes as rumors of a Braddison reconciliation continue to heat up. There is a lot of evidence that Bryce and Addison are back together, and this more recent incident definitely helps to prove that point. Last week, though, Addison was quick to shut down people when they started calling Bryce &ldquo;her man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s unclear exactly what&rsquo;s going on between the two TikTok stars right now, but let&rsquo;s just say I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if Addison saved one of those pics for herself&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="addison-rae-easterling-slays-in-sizzling-poolside-bikini-spread">&ldquo;Addison Rae Easterling Slays In Sizzling Poolside Bikini Spread&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Addison-Rae.jpg" alt="img">
TikTok star and model Addison Rae Easterling has been the subject of some controversy of late, having issued an apology after fans discovered she had liked past comments throwing shade at friend and fellow social media maven Charli D’Amelio, as reported by People. In spite of the drama, she has continued to sizzle on Instagram, posting a two-pic slideshow update on June 18.</p>
<p>In the caption that accompanied the pictorial, Addison threw up a “new hair who this.” And while her meme knowledge is clearly on-point, her 20.2 million followers may have been just as impressed by her bikini-clad body as depicted in a series of poolside snapshots.</p>
<p>The slideshow began with a medium-wide shot of Addison as she held her bikini top up against her bust; its straps left dangling before her. The white garment, which was emblazoned with splashes of blue, green, yellow and red, barely managed to cover her perky assets as a result. Addison leaned against the tiled wall of an elevated pool as the picture was taken with the brunt of her weight seemingly resting upon her right arm as her body angled toward the pool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, her straight, dark hair was parted down the middle and flowed back over her shoulders as she peered into the camera’s lens with a half-smile upon her face.</p>
<p>In the second photo, Addison struck a similar pose and the camera remain fixed in the same position. This time, however, she had contorted her body slightly forward, providing a sideview angle on her body and further accentuating her sinuous figure. As the picture was snapped, Addison’s eyes were closed and her pink-hued lips were parted slightly.</p>
<p>Addison’s IG fans were ignited by the offering, double-tapping the update to the tune of 2.5 million likes in just a few hours; one of which came from her former Hype House cohort Abby Rao. They further expressed their approval by adding nearly 30,000 comments as well.</p>
<p>“Dude ur perfect,” wrote one fan of Addison’s bikini body.</p>
<p>“You literally can look good in everything! HOW?” wondered a second admirer.</p>
<p>“This is the best thing you have ever posted,” opined another fan.</p>
<p>“Be my wife,” pleaded one smitten commenter.</p>
<p>As shared by The Inquisitr on June 16, the 19-year-old Lafayette, Louisiana product similarly showed off her curvy frame with a slideshow update in which she posed on the beach while sporting blue jeans and a tiny bikini top. That post also generated a significant response on IG, garnering more than 4 million likes.
