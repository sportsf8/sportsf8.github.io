<p>ACROSTIC — I assume that I’m not alone in feeling shellshocked by today’s puzzle, like finding out that the bus driver you say hello to every morning is actually a Formula One driver when she is called upon to cut off a fleeing vehicle on the highway. One minute you’re settling in for your pleasant regular commute, the next you’re holding on for dear life trying to make sense of the situation.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that I really, really struggled to solve this puzzle, and once it was done, did I have that head slap moment when I realized how simple it all was? No, I did not — and I work with typography. If you cruised through it, I salute you.</p>
<p>The passage is from a recent book by Cecelia Watson, “Semicolon,” concerning that particular punctuation mark. The excerpt specifically handles several typographical treatments of this dot + comma confection, fittingly, because the mark itself was invented, during the Renaissance, by Pietro Bembo. Bembo was a poet and literary theorist, but he’s probably best remembered as the creator of the “Bembo” typeface. (Watson describes the Bembo semicolon as having “its comma-half tensely coiled, tail thorn-sharp beneath the perfect orb thrown high above it.”)</p>
<p>We have to solve three more evocative metaphors for the semicolon, each in a different font family — Garamond, Palatino and(new to me) Didot. Maybe this was hard for me because I correctly deduced the appearance of a cobra in the excerpt and decided that a “semicolon” might be some type of snake; I didn’t realize that the topic was actually punctuation until it was pretty much solved.

54D: Much like the clue for SATAN, this was an odd one, unless you’re used to dogs on the table like ODIE, Garfield’s fall guy (meaning, the guy Garfield would kick off the table).</p>
<p>Today’s Theme</p>
<p>There are seven theme entries today, all running across, at 22, 33, 49, 68, 86, 105 and 116, that all adhere to a strict rule (that gets pretty esoteric by the final clue). I really struggled to explain the requirement plainly, so I’m especially grateful for the constructor for his notes this week. Without them, the finer point of the theme was somewhat lost on me — I knew to be impressed, on completion, but I couldn’t put my finger on why.</p>
<p>For the sake of suspense, and also to be true to my own solve, let’s start at the topmost entry. It isn’t a very difficult one, and I imagine that many of us first stumbled on the trick today right here. Assuming that you know what baked alaska is (and also the admiring moniker of many annelids), this clue kind of solves itself: a “Cruise that specializes in baked alaska, e.g.?” is a SHIP OF THE DESSERT. There are two apparent alterations here, an added letter “S” (to the common expression “ship of the desert”), and a shift in emphasis from DES-ert to des-SERT, should you choose to pronounce these expressions aloud. So now we have two angles to go on for the rest of the solve.</p>
<p>Moving down to 33A, “Like ambitious scientists?” we find an entry that adheres to the second rule of emphasis, but instead of adding a letter, we have to do a nano-anagram of “noble” to NOBEL, as in NOBEL MINDED. So now things are seemingly getting more flexible or, perhaps, we’re down to the one requirement of emphasis.</p>
<p>If we rely on that one requirement, then we can start having fun with guesses. A couple of the remaining entries rewarded this, at least. I saw the “high kicks” in the clue at 68A and I confess that I thought of the cancan for a minute before “lab studies” led to “rocket science,” which led to ITS NOT ROCKETTE SCIENCE. The other one that was kind of doable was THE MORALE OF THE STORY, which followed that original “add a letter” notion.</p>
<p>The last three entries were the toughest, for me at least, and required somewhat more complex relettering to get the puns. 86A, “the summary of an easy negotiation?”, wasn’t easy to figure out:

<h3 id="sympathy-for-the-semicolon">&ldquo;Sympathy for the Semicolon&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d24de44fc4ecf0008de8572/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Norris-Semicolon-Social.jpg" alt="img">
Among my fellow punctuation nerds, I have a reputation as someone who has no use for semicolons. I don’t hate semicolons; I hate writing about semicolons. Fortunately, now I don’t have to, because Cecelia Watson, a self-identified “punctuation theorist” who teaches at Bard College, has written a whole book about them: “Semicolon: The Past, Present, and Future of a Misunderstood Mark.”</p>
<p>At first, I thought Watson was doing with the semicolon what Simon Griffin did with the apostrophe in “Fucking Apostrophes” (2015). Both are slim volumes about an element of language that gives people endless grief. But whereas Griffin, an adman, provides straightforward rules, albeit with a bushel of exceptions (and a running joke: every use of the word “apostrophe” is preceded by a profanity), Watson, a historian and philosopher of science and a teacher of writing and the humanities—in other words, a Renaissance woman—gives us a deceptively playful-looking book that turns out to be a scholarly treatise on a sophisticated device that has contributed eloquence and mystery to Western civilization.</p>
<p>The semicolon itself was a Renaissance invention. It first appeared in 1494, in a book published in Venice by Aldus Manutius. “De Aetna,” Watson explains, was “an essay, written in dialogue form,” about climbing Mt. Etna. Its author, Pietro Bembo, is best known today not for his book but for the typeface, designed by Francesco Griffo, in which the first semicolon was displayed: Bembo. The mark was a hybrid between a comma and a colon, and its purpose was to prolong a pause or create a more distinct separation between parts of a sentence. In her delightful history, Watson brings the Bembo semicolon alive, describing “its comma-half tensely coiled, tail thorn-sharp beneath the perfect orb thrown high above it.” Designers, she explains, have since given the mark a “relaxed and fuzzy” look (Poliphilus), rendered it “aggressive” (Garamond), and otherwise adapted it for the modern age: “Palatino’s is a thin flapper in a big hat slouched against the wall at a party.”</p>
<p>The problem with the semicolon is not how it looks but what it does and how that has changed over time. In the old days, punctuation simply indicated a pause. Comma, colon: semicolon; period. Eventually, grammarians and copy editors came along and made themselves indispensable by punctuating (“pointing”) a writer’s prose “to delineate clauses properly, such that punctuation served syntax.” That is, commas, semicolons, and colons were plugged into a sentence in order to highlight, subordinate, or otherwise conduct its elements, connecting them syntactically. One of the rules is that, unless you are composing a list, a semicolon is supposed to be followed by a complete clause, capable of standing on its own. The semicolon can take the place of a conjunction, like “and” or “but,” but it should not be used in addition to it. This is what got circled in red in my attempts at scholarly criticism in graduate school. Sentence length has something to do with it—a long, complex sentence may benefit from a clarifying semicolon—but if a sentence scans without a semicolon it’s best to leave it alone.</p>
<p>Watson has been keeping an eye out for effective semicolons for years. She calculates that there are four-thousand-odd semicolons in “Moby-Dick,” or “one for every 52 words.” Clumsy as nineteenth-century punctuation may seem to a modern reader, Melville’s semicolons, she writes, act like “sturdy little nails,” holding his wide-ranging narrative together. She is delighted with the “springy little semicolons” of Irvine Welsh in “Trainspotting” (“The sweat wis lashing oafay Sick Boy; he wis trembling”) and she has a special fondness for the rare semicolon in Raymond Chandler, whose hardboiled private detective, Philip Marlowe, is not given to periodic sentences. In “The Big Sleep,” for instance, Marlowe describes his room: “In it was everything that was mine, that had any association for me, any past, anything that took the place of a family. Not much; a few books, pictures, radio, chessmen, old letters, stuff like that.” In Watson’s perception, that choice of a semicolon after “Not much” creates a reflective silence. “The semicolon reads as Marlowe having to stop to think.”</p>
<p>A sentence from Wittgenstein contains a “fantastically vague semicolon”: “Der Philosoph behandelt eine Frage; wie eine Krankheit.” (“The philosopher treats a question; like an illness.”) This has been translated by G. E. M. Anscombe thus: “The philosopher’s treatment of a question is like the treatment of an illness.” But, in removing what Erich Heller, an expert in German philosophy, calls a “profound” semicolon, one that “marks a frontier between a thought and a triviality,” the translator has reduced a deep thought to a bland one. Watson writes, sounding like the “punctuation therapist” she sometimes plays, “Ambiguity can be useful and productive, and it can make some room for new ideas.”</p>
<p>Watson is especially thought-provoking on the topic of semicolons and the law, where ambiguity can lead to trouble. In Massachusetts, a semicolon that should have been a comma would have prevented hotels from selling liquor after 11 P.M.; it had the effect of making people buy a lot of drinks before last call. Worse, in a New Jersey murder trial in 1927, sloppy punctuation caused one of the defendants, Salvatore Rannelli, to be sentenced to life imprisonment while the other, Salvatore Merra, was sentenced to death—for the same crime. Legal cases are often built on precedent, and a judgment based on flawed punctuation sets a bad precedent, which can perpetuate injustice.</p>
<p>The semicolon’s two main detractors, the antiheroes of Watson’s book, are Donald Barthelme and Kurt Vonnegut, with Chandler complaining about a proofreader at The Atlantic (one Margaret Mutch) and Mark Twain weighing in on the ignorance of proofreaders in general. Barthelme found the semicolon “ugly as a tick on a dog’s belly.” Vonnegut wrote that semicolons are “transvestite hermaphrodites representing absolutely nothing,” a statement that makes me feel only more sympathy for the semicolon. What’s wrong with hermaphrodites?</p>
<p>Henry James, who would have been my choice for Master of the Semicolon, turns out to have been famous during his lifetime for his use of dashes. Watson writes that the dash “cutting a path” through any page of James is “an arm outstretched as a barrier to keep one thought from tumbling into the next.” She has unearthed an interview, from 1915, that James gave to a reporter for the Times, in which the Master (who did not do interviews, and on this occasion insisted that the reporter note “his punctuation as well as his words”) remarked that dashes “strike both the familiar and the empathic note . . . with a felicity beyond either the comma or the semicolon; although indeed a fine sense of the semicolon, like any sort of sense at all for the pluperfect tense and the subjunctive mood . . . seems anything but common.” Watson observes, “We live in the Era of the Dash”—which is probably just as well.</p>
<p>Both the dash and the semicolon are put to brilliant use in a page-and-a-half-long sentence from “Letter from Birmingham Jail,” which Watson quotes in full. In it, Martin Luther King, Jr., details the miseries of a black man, a victim of injustice, who is asked to wait patiently for change. King piles up clause after clause, each describing a more harrowing, frustrating event than the last, and each lofted by the semicolon that concludes the one before: “when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading ‘white’ and ‘colored’; . . . when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of ‘nobodiness.’ ” The litany rises to a crescendo delivered with a dash: “—then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait.” Watson concludes that “this is mimesis at its finest”; the semicolons hold the prose “in suspension,” and the reader in suspense, waiting, along with King, for justice. Of course, King’s letter is about much more than punctuation, but here is an instance in which the semicolon did its small part for civil rights.

Along that remarkably short route, Duncan won the whole Invite 13 times and scored 41 runners-up, in virtually every type of contest, most notably in a string of classic song parodies, and was Loser of the Year in 2018. And I’m more than thrilled to see that he’s still dashing along with full 25-entry submissions week after Loser week. Today, check out his interpretation of the dots in the window of Cartoon A — unique among the entries this week — as a collection of dog noses, intent on sniffing the woman’s T-Bone Perfume.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Since that “Meet the Parentheses” Q&amp;A in the Conversational, Duncan’s become a fixture in the Loser Community as well, with a demeanor and vocal delivery so deadpan, so utterly without affect, that you’d think he was, oh, a federal lawyer dealing in banking regulation, rather than the person who penned a holiday ditty about Stormy Daniels called “Mistress Time Is Here.” Not to mention a member of an improv team called Breakup Wok.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit from that earlier Convo with Duncan, along with some updates, including some of his own favorite ink from those first 500 blots.</p>
<p>MEET THE PARENTHESES: (DUNCAN STEVENS, VIENNA, VA.) [from February 2016]</p>
<p>Age: Evidently not old enough to know better. [Mid-forties.]</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Official Loser Anagram (aka Granola Smear): Unscented Vans. Though I’m also partial to Nuns Dent Caves and Nuns, Vets Dance.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>What brought me to the Invite: I had been enjoying the Invite ever since I moved to D.C. and started subscribing to the Post in 2000, but I would glance at the contest, think “hey, I should enter,” and almost never get around to it. But last summer I said to myself, “Self, this is lame. You like wordplay. There’s a lively wordplay contest in your paper every week. You have no excuse.” So I started sending in entries more or less every week, and I found that a lot of contests that I had never thought to try — like neologisms or snarky notes to “glassbowls” — were a lot of fun once I put some effort into them.</p>
<p>What’s an example of something that confirms your Loserosity? &hellip; I also sometimes spoof hymns for my church choir: “Jesus Christ is risen today/Man, that guy won’t go away.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And now from 2020 &hellip;</p>
<p>So how do you get all that ink week after week? Do you write the maximum of 25 entries for each contest? I write more than 25 most weeks — sometimes a lot more — and then choose the ones I like best from there, with advice from my long-suffering wife. It’s usually painful to leave a bunch on the cutting room floor, but I’ve found that the first 25 entries I think of aren’t always going to be my best. If Entries 100 and 101 give me a chuckle, it was worth writing Entries 26-99.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Then what do you do with the rest? I share them on Losernet (the online listserv for Invite entrants), mine them for leftover contests, and reread every so often to amuse myself.</p>
<p>So how do you go about writing all those song parodies?</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>I usually try to think of subjects (particularly subjects in the news) with sounds that are similar to titles or repeated phrases in well-known songs, and build around them. For a recent contest I wrote a “Hey Jude” parody about Greta Thunberg, ending each verse with “Greta” instead of “better.” That’s going to help a reader figure out how the parody matches the song, since there’s no audio. I also try hard to match the parody’s rhythm with the original; the reader shouldn’t have to think, “Now how does this line fit?”</p>
<p>What do you do when not Inviting?</p>
<p>Lots of things! As was the case in the last interview, I’m still a federal lawyer and still have two kids, now 10 and 7, and still play ultimate Frisbee, dabble in improv comedy, and keep busy in various roles at church. I’ve lately gotten more active in OEDILF, the Omnificent English Dictionary in Limerick Form, which the Invite uses every August for a contest as it steadily progresses through the alphabet. I always submit my entries to OEDILF after the contest is over, and also offer suggestions to other writers in the website’s workshopping process.</p>

<p>Any notable experiences with people who saw your name in the Invite?</p>
<p>I recently wrote a parody about gerrymandering (see below) and got a nice note from the head of One Virginia, an anti-gerrymandering organization, thanking me for raising awareness of the issue! Other Invite hey-aren’t-yous have included federal lawyers at the FDIC and at other agencies, fellow churchgoers, elementary school friends I hadn’t heard from in 30-plus years, and at least one teacher at my daughter’s school.</p>
<p>Do your kids think you’re famous? Don’t think so! If I could only start hanging around with Cookie Monster or Captain Underpants …</p>

<p>And another milestone in Loserdom! Last week, as Duncan reached his 500th blot of ink, Jesse Frankovich broke a record I thought would never fall: He got 180 blots of ink in a single “Loser year” (roughly March to March), finally passing Brendan Beary’s mark in the mid-2000s, back before there was an entry limit and before I could judge the entries without knowing who’d written them. And this week, Jesse’s at 181; and according to Keeper of the Stats Elden Carnahan, there’s one more week to go in Year 27.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And we’d better order a Hall of Fame key card for &hellip;</p>
<p>Frank Osen has 490 blots as of last week, according to the standings. Plus another one today. Oy!</p>
<p>Next week: A Meet the Parentheses with Longtime Loser Steve Honley as he passes the 100-ink mark. If you’re a regular Loser and would like to introduce yourself to Greater Loserdom, drop me a line.</p>
<p>The Staake deck: Results of Week 1368</p>
<p>I’m certain that most of this week’s interpretations of the four Bob Staake cartoons from Week 1368 would never have been thought of by Bob himself. The spots outside the window in Cartoon A? King Kong’s boxers, a Purple-People Eater, the Dalmatian of hell, a pack of dog noses, and big blots of non-Invite ink. Not to mention fodder for a nice pun on “periods.”</p>
<p>That last one worked perfectly for Sam Mertens, who, still in his superb rookie year, gets his third Invite win and his 47th (and 48th) ink. And a previous Rookie of the Year, Danielle Nowlin, is a runner-up this week, along with Jeff Contompasis’s congressional pun, “High on the Hill was the Lonely Voteherd” — the favorite of my Style Invitational Devotees co-admin Alex Blackwood, and similar jokes about “the Last Pillar of Democracy” by Stephen Dudzik and Ellen Ryan.</p>
<p>What Doug Dug: Ace Copy Editor Doug Norwood agreed with my choice of Sam’s Picture A entry. He also singled out Jack McCombs’s King Kong boxers, Kevin Dopart’s “Invisible Man” allusion for the empty basket in Picture B, Bruce Niedt’s “lostling,” Jonathan Jensen’s HOV lane, and Steve Smith’s allusion to the recent cowardly censorship by the National Archives.</p>
<p>We lucked out on the print page this week! The cartoon captions will appear on a page with color in this Sunday’s Arts &amp; Style section. Otherwise, First Offender Kathleen Delano’s joke about the Purple-People Eater wouldn’t have made much sense to a reader looking at a gray-faced woman in Cartoon A.</p>
<p>Pithy please: This week&rsquo;s Balliol rhymes</p>
<p>I expect all you Loserbards to be conducting all your conversations, yelling at your kids, etc., in the meter ba-DUM ba-DUM ba-DUM ba-DUM, once you start working on the Week 1372 “Balliol rhymes.” And iamb quite optimistic that you’ll come up with a variety of zingy verses, especially because you get to double the length if you like. The original Oxford undergraduates who published their “Masque of Balliol” — is that where “sophomoric” comes from? — replaced the vowels in their targets’ names with hyphens in mock-disguise; I’d consider the same joke except that perhaps not all of the names would be clear enough, and also just that, eh, not all that funny. It’s easy enough for me to go one way or the other at the last minute.</p>
