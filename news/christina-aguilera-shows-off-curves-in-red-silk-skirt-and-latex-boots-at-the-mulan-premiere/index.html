CHRISTINA Aguilera looked incredible as she showed off her curves in a red silk skirt at the Mulan premiere in Hollywood.

The 39-year-old - who belts out two songs for the Disney live-action remake - finished off her sizzling outfit with red latex boots as she stormed the red carpet on Monday.

The Dirrty singer also rocked a silky fuchsia blouse and wore her blonde hair swept up into a sleek topknot.

She shared several snaps of her outfit from the night on Instagram, writing: "@mulan mood. serving for all you warriors out there."

Christina also made time to greet fans at the bash, sharing a clip of herself signing autographs with the caption: "Love you guys."

It was a momentous occasion for the Burlesque actress, who sang the iconic tune Reflection for the original Mulan when she was just 17.

She auditioned for the song by recording herself singing Mariah Carey in the bathroom and released the belter in 1998.

Talking about the process in a 1999 Entertainment Weekly interview, Xtina said: “My manager gives me a random phone call out of the clear blue one day while I’m just hanging out in my hometown of Pittsburgh.

"He’s like, ‘Can you belt the high E above middle C?'"

The singer went on: "And now this is known as the note that changed my life, because basically I had to prove that I could belt this note - like, full-on belt it - by Fed-Exing out, overnight, a karaoke tape of [singing over] Whitney Houston‘s I Want to Run to You, which has that note, just like Reflection."

Christina - who dazzled with her New Year's Eve performance last year - performs a new version of Reflection in the remake.

She also sings Loyal Brave True, a track written from the perspective of the heroine reflecting on her journey from a young girl to a warrior.

It seems the Candyman singer's kids are loving her return to Mulan just as much as she is.

Christina recently shared a sweet clip of her five-year-old daughter Summer meeting the Disney princess Mulan at Disney California Adventure Park.

She wrote: "Fun family weekend at @disneyland.”

Christina was also joined by fiancé Matthew Rutler and her 12-year-old son Max, who she shares with ex Jordan Bratman.
