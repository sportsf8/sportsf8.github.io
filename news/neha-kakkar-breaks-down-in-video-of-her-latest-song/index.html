<p>Bhushan Kumar, head honcho of T-Series, is proud of her achievements. “‘Jinke liye’ is starkly different from what we have seen Neha sing in the last few months.

<p>“Jaani, who has delivered many hits with us in the past, is also terrific with the lines and the composition. He is going to surprise people with his acting debut. B Praak’s music, as always is outstanding.”</p>
