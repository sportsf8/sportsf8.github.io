<h1>Belarus&#39; president dismisses coronavirus risk, encourages citizens to drink vodka and visit saunas</h1>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106468331-1585658391106gettyimages-1125050830.jpeg?v=1585658731" alt="img">
As countries around the world effectively shut down in order to tackle the spread of the coronavirus, the president of Belarus has urged citizens to drink vodka, go to saunas and return to work.</p>
<p>A global health crisis has prompted governments worldwide to impose draconian measures on the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>The restrictions range from so-called lockdowns and school closures to strict regulations on social distancing and public gatherings.</p>
<p>Yet, in the eastern European country of Belarus, borders remain open and the country&rsquo;s authoritarian leader remains unmoved by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>President Alexander Lukashenko has refused to implement a lockdown in the country of roughly 9.5 million people, reportedly suggesting that others have done so as an act of &ldquo;frenzy and psychosis,&rdquo; according to Sky News.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, more than 801,000 cases of the coronavirus have been recorded worldwide, with 38,743 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>In Belarus — a country that borders Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Ukraine — 152 people have contracted COVID-19 infections, with no deaths.

<p><img src="https://media.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2276/files/2020/03/5e81f74f023d166bdf5d2ca3jpeg.jpg" alt="img">
With foreign sports networks having little to show and few other options for sports betting, Lukashenko says the pandemic is a perfect opportunity to put the country’s soccer league on display.</p>
<p>“I look at Russia and some people there are winning a lot on bets, because beforehand they didn’t really know our teams,” Lukashenko said. “Someone’s losing, someone’s winning. It’s all useful.”</p>
<p>Fans entering the stadiums in Belarus are given antiseptic hand gel and some have their temperatures monitored by medics. Few wear masks because they’re not considered necessary for open-air events, Belarus soccer federation spokesman Alexander Aleinik said.</p>
<p>Belarus doesn’t publish daily figures on the spread of the virus. On Friday, the last day for which statistics are available, the country recorded 94 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with no deaths.</p>
<p>The Belarusian league isn’t usually an international attraction. Crowds this season barely average 1,200 and UEFA ranks it the continent’s 25th strongest, just below Norway, Israel and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>But Russian TV has given its games prominent slots on state sports channels and betting firms around Western Europe are streaming them for customers.</p>
<p>British fans on social media have picked teams to follow and thrown themselves into a new fandom, elevating obscure players to hero status and berating coaches for supposedly negative tactics.</p>
<p>There isn’t much competition, with betting sites offering little more than Nicaraguan soccer, Tajikistan basketball and Russian table tennis as rivals.</p>
<p>Sergei Melnikov is one of those hoping to make an impression on the mostly empty global sports stage. He is the director of the Isloch club, which beat Smolevichi 1-0 on Sunday to keep pace with the leaders on points.</p>
<p>“The whole world is watching our soccer right now,” Melnikov said. “That means we have to show the best that we’ve got.”</p>
