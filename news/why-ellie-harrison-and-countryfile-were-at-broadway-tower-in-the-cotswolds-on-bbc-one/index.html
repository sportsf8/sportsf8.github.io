<p>One of the Cotswolds&rsquo; most unusual sights featured on the BBC’s Countryfile programme on Sunday.</p>
<p>The episode, Weird and Wonderful, visited Broadway Tower, just across the Gloucestershire border in Worcestershire.</p>
<p>Presenter Ellie Harrison, who lives in the Cotswolds and is the president of Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, was at the tower which is described by Countryfile as &ldquo;summing up British eccentricity.”</p>
<p>The ecologist, a former Sir William Romney pupil who studied A-levels at Cirencester College, was recently a guest presenter on Springwatch.</p>
<p>On the live programme, Ellie and host Chris Packham had a friendly on-air disagreement about the smell of grass snakes (she hates the smell, he loves it for nostalgic reasons)</p>
<p>Broadway Tower, off the A44 at Fish Hill, was completed in 1798 and was the vision of landscape designer Lancelot ‘Capability&rsquo; Brown.</p>
<p>It was completed for George William, 6th earl of Coventry, with the help of architect James Wyatt, for Lady Coventry, and is set on a pre-medieval trading route and beacon hill.</p>
<p>Tonight&rsquo;s programme also featured some footage from the archives, including presenter Anita Rani meeting a farmer growing a crop of chairs.</p>
<p>Below is Gloucestershire Live’s history writer Robin Brooks&rsquo; take on the tower</p>
<p>(Image: GLOUCESTERSHIRE MEDIA)</p>
<p>This 65ft tall frippery stands on top of Fish Hill and can be reached by turning off the A44 a mile or so out of Broadway.</p>
<p>Imposing in scale and plainly designed by someone who enjoyed fairy tales as a child, this substantial folly was built in the 18th century by the 6th Earl of Coventry to try and alleviate his new bride’s homesickness.</p>
<p>Her family lived at Croom Court near Upton on Severn and she had the idea that it might be possible to see her former home from the top of Fish Hill.</p>
<p>To test the point, a beacon was lit and sure enough Mummy and Daddy in Croom Court could see their daughter’s bonfire.</p>
<p>(Image: Tark)</p>
<p>In an effort to please her, the earl had Broadway Tower built so that whenever home pangs tugged at Mrs Coventry’s heart she could climb to the top of the folly and weep towards Worcester.</p>
<p>After extensive renovations in 1827 Broadway Tower was converted into a residence and a number of notable people lived in it.</p>
<p>William Morris designer, poet, painter and social reformer spent long holidays there, as did fellow Pre-Raphaelites Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rosetti. No doubt they found the view from the top, which overlooks 13 counties, an inspiration.</p>
<p>Countryfile was on at 7pm on BBC One on Sunday and will be available on iPlayer afterwards

<h3 id="vancouver-city-council-approves-contentious-broadway-tower">&ldquo;Vancouver City Council approves contentious Broadway tower&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://canada.constructconnect.com/app/uploads/2020/07/MAIN-broadway-corridor-2WEB.jpg" alt="img">
Vancouver City Council has given the go-ahead to what will be the one of the tallest towers on the Broadway corridor, but the project has faced stiff local opposition.</p>
<p>A proposal from IBI Group, filed on behalf of Jameson Development Group, for a 28-storey tower at 2538 Birch St. on the corner of Birch and Broadway was approved by council on July 21 as part of its Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Program (MIRHPP). The building will have 200 market rental units and 58 affordable units.</p>
<p>“Expanding affordable housing opportunities close to transit and jobs with zero displacement of existing residents is a huge win for residents. These types of homes are critical to keeping more middle-income households, including our nurses, firefighters, bus drivers and teachers, housed within the city,” said Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart.</p>
<p>Neighbourhood opposition to the project mounted throughout the approval process by groups such as the Coalition of Vancouver Neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>“There’s a whole number of things that affect this building, and amongst them it’s in the Broadway plan area, and that plan is under development as we’re speaking. This possibly would have a serious effect on that plan and would set a precedent,” coalition spokesperson Larry Benge said in an interview with the Journal of Commerce before council approved the development.</p>
<p>“It will end up as one of two things. It’s a ‘pig in space’ in that it’s a big singular entity along Broadway or it’s a precedent-setting height and massing that strongly influences the Broadway plan,” he said.</p>
<p>In March 2019 the City of Vancouver launched a two-year planning and engagement process to create a comprehensive plan for the area of Broadway between Clark Drive and Vine Street.</p>
<p>A memorandum from the July 21 council meeting said the rental vacancy rate is low both in the Broadway area and across the city.</p>
<p>“To alleviate this low vacancy rate, building more rental supply is necessary,” it stated.</p>
<p>“The project also demonstrates our commitment to ensure housing is used as homes first by prioritizing market and below-market rental housing that meets local needs, recognizing the majority of households in Vancouver rent,” a City of Vancouver release stated.</p>
<p>Benge said he is wary that the building’s presence will have the opposite effect and raise rental rates in the area.</p>
<p>“This development will raise land values around it where there are three or four-storey affordable rental units. It’s a trade off if you supply median rental units to this building, what is the side effect or collateral of this building being built?” he asked.</p>
<p>“And when the developer provides units, what do they lose balanced against what they’re gaining with 12 additional floors?”</p>
<p>Vancouver City Council public hearings held on July 9, 10 and July 14 cited 542 pieces of correspondence in support of the project and 417 in opposition, including one petition with 685 signatures, an electronic petition and a petition with 45 signatures.</p>
<p>The development was originally approved in 2018 as a 17-storey mixed-use tower on the site of a former Denny’s family restaurant with 153 secured market rental units.</p>
<p>The proposal changed to 28 storeys after the city made changes to the MIRHPP program allowing developers to apply with taller buildings if approximately 20 per cent of units are set at below-market rates.

<p>Some unexpected shuffling Tuesday afternoon meant Vancouver council did not make a highly anticipated decision on a controversial 28-storey rental tower as expected, instead punting it to next week.</p>
<p>The proposed tower for the corner of West Broadway and Birch has been in the works, in various iterations, for years. So, in the grand scheme of things, an extra week of delay might not be a huge deal. But the way this delay came about has not helped the growing perception among some citizens and businesspeople that this council is struggling to conduct its business efficiently.</p>
<p>We apologize, but this video has failed to load.</p>

<p>Some of this can, perhaps, be attributed to technical difficulties around the city moving all its business to “virtual meetings” since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down regular operations.</p>
<p>But this rezoning wasn’t just any vote — it’s probably one of the biggest decisions this council has faced, so the delay is bound to raise questions about what it says about how the city handles important housing matters during a housing crisis.

<p>Vancouver’s mayor says an experimental rental-incentive program that led this week to one of the city’s most controversial public hearings – and a razor-thin approval for a 28-storey rental tower – should be made permanent because council and the public have demonstrated steady support for the idea.</p>
<p>“This is showing that this should be a permanent fixture now. [What we’ve approved so far] shows they can fit into all neighbourhoods,” Mayor Kennedy Stewart said Wednesday, the day after the decision. It is the ninth project approved under the pilot program and, said the mayor, the one that showed where the limits of council’s willingness to approve were.</p>
<p>The mayor made his optimistic assessment in spite of several turbulent weeks and a vote that came close to failing for the project on Broadway near Granville, which will be one of the stations for a new subway line that is just starting construction.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>The decision has added even more fuel to fierce arguments about whether the new building will set off a brush fire of gentrification or save low-cost apartments in the area.</p>
<p>The project, proposed by a long-time local development family, the Pappajohns, is one of 20 buildings that are part of a pilot project that the previous Vision Vancouver council created as it looked for ways to produce at least some apartments guaranteed to have below-market rental rates.</p>
<p>Developers were invited to pitch ideas for how to achieve lower rents, starting at $950 for studio apartments, for 20 per cent of the building’s floor space. New studios in Vancouver typically rent for $1,700 a month and up, and even older ones are considerably more than $950.</p>
<p>All of the development solutions involved more density on their sites.</p>
<p>The Pappajohn site, which had already received approval for 17 floors of straight market-rate apartments, became a flash point because of how tall it was – 14 floors higher than the tallest of eight other projects already approved in the special pilot. With that extra density, the developer promised 58 apartments out of 258 would be rented at the below-market rates.</p>
<p>Residents in the area, which is next to the city’s biggest medical precinct and the busy Broadway commercial corridor, worried the building would kick off a wave of higher rents in their relatively low-cost area.</p>
<p>Both independent councillor Rebecca Bligh and COPE’s Jean Swanson said they had heard recently that, for every one affordable apartment being built locally, three older low-cost apartments are being lost.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>The tower “will create more pressure for higher rents elsewhere,” said Ms. Swanson, adding that’s what happened to the Downtown Eastside after the Woodwards project – a combination of subsidized and market housing – was built.</p>
<p>But those supporting the project said the new supply would actually help prevent local tenants from being evicted, because the additional apartments would give people more options than just bidding up existing units in the popular area.</p>
<p>University of British Columbia geography professor Elvin Wyly, who specializes in studying gentrification, said a single project such as the Broadway tower is not going to halt or spur gentrification on its own. He said the whole region is gentrifying relentlessly because of the enormous pressure for land and housing that has become a feature of the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>Proposed 28-storey rental tower along Vancouver’s Broadway Corridor faces tough local opposition</p>
<p>Pandemic squeezes public input on development</p>
<p>For another housing expert, the debate took an especially baffling turn.</p>
<p>It was Jill Atkey’s information about the loss of affordable-housing units – 34,000 units at $750 or less disappeared in the province from 2011 to 2016 – that Ms. Swanson and Ms. Bligh cited as their reason for opposing the project.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>But Ms. Atkey, the executive director of the BC Non-Profit Housing Association, said she is an advocate of new supply where there is no displacement – which this project, on the site of a former Denny’s restaurant, provided.</p>
<p>“This one building isn’t going to solve the rental crisis,” she said. “There has to be redevelopment, but it has to be redevelopment with affordability in mind.” The Broadway tower has that, she said.</p>

Chocolate box villages, thatched cottages rolling hills… and celebs in residence aplenty. What’s not to love? Team Stella round up the cream of the Cotswolds crop.</p>
<p>The Fish Hotel, Broadway, Worcestershire</p>
<p>Best for… A back-to-nature hideaway</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the stuff of childhood dreams: the chance to spend a night in a treehouse, but with all the mod-cons. These two-bedroom treehouses, part of the 400-acre Farncombe Estate, are nestled in a woodland area, wrapped around huge oak trees with their own private rope bridges (dogs are allowed in one of the cabins). It&rsquo;s a magical and unique experience; from the craftsmanship of the cabins (there&rsquo;s underfloor heating, a minibar and coffee machine) to the magical twinkling fairy lights that come to life around the outdoor decking at dusk. The whole vibe is cosy and relaxed and manages to keep everyone happy – our three-year-old daughter regularly asks if we&rsquo;re going back to the treehouse.</p>
<p>Stella loves: The outdoor wooden baths – it’s bliss to sit in the steaming water while looking up through the trees –before a mad dash back indoors in the fabulous cosy dressing gowns.</p>
<p>Out and about: A 30-minute walk away is Broadway Tower – the highest point in the Cotswolds and worth a visit, especially on a clear day. And, having ventured all this way, it would be rude not to visit Bicester Village or Daylesford Farm shop on your way home.</p>
<p>Treehouse from £370 a night, b&amp;b (sleeps up to four); thefishhotel.co.uk</p>
<p>Read the full review: The Fish Hotel</p>
<p>Each of The Fish&rsquo;s three treehouses offers a bedroom suite area, a bunk bedded room and a conventional bathroom as well as an expansive deck with outdoor twin tubs</p>
<p>Ivy Cottage, Long Compton, Warwickshire</p>
<p>Best for… a traditional home-from-home</p>
<p>Nestled on a long, winding road in the pretty village of Long Compton, this postcard-perfect two-bedroom cottage is a cosy home-from-home. It mixes old Cotswolds charm – there&rsquo;s local honey-coloured brickwork, a wood burner fireplace and powder blue front door – with luxurious touches, including a huge two-person shower. Four-legged friends are welcome (for a fee) and will love the open fields a short walk from the cottage and the jar of doggie biscuits that await them. Guests are greeted with a chilled bottle of cremant and the well stocked kitchen also includes a welcome pack of fresh local bread and eggs. There&rsquo;s also a barbecue in the pretty, cottage-style garden.</p>
<p>Stella loves: The deep copper bath in the corner of the master bedroom. Perfect for sinking into after a long dog walk.</p>
<p>Out and about: The Red Lion Inn is a cosy, dog-friendly pub half a mile up the road from the cottage (all open fires and exposed Cotswolds stone walls) and serves delicious food. It also has a huge pub garden. Just up the road is Chipping Norton: for a romantic dinner in, try Wild Thyme restaurant – it is still closed post-lockdown but it offers very special take-home dinners (£30 for three courses). If you have young children, head to Cotswolds Wildlife Park &amp; Gardens, home to giraffes, camels and lions; it has reopened but with limited ticket sales so book ahead.</p>
<p>From £190 a night (sleeps four, three-night stay minimum); call 0208 740 3097 or visit sandandstoneescapes.com</p>
<p>Ivy Cottage mixes pure Cotswolds charm with generous dashes of luxury</p>
<p>Minster Mill, Minster Lovell, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>Best for… a riverside bolthole</p>
<p>This recently refurbished hotel, built with traditional honey-coloured Cotswold stone, is set in 65 acres of idyllic grounds. It’s worth visiting for the gardens alone, especially the lush wildflower meadows. Inside, there are 38 rooms decorated in contemporary Scandi-style with mid-century-modern furnishings, bare-filament bulbs, Grohe waterfall taps and L’Occitane bathroom products. Every detail has been thought of, down to the fresh milk and Nespresso milk frother in the minibar, for that early-morning cappuccino. Wake early for a game of tennis on the hotel courts to work up an appetite for breakfast – or table tennis if you’re feeling less energetic – then explore the surrounding countryside by bike (hire one from the hotel) or make the most of the hotel’s mile of private fishing banks.</p>
<p>Stella loves: The turn-down service, which includes putting a late-night mix on the radio, to make your room is a haven of tranquility.</p>
<p>Out and about: The hotel is a five-minute walk from the picturesque 15th-century ruins of manor house, Minster Lovell Hall. Oxford is 15 miles away: explore the university’s dreaming spires or visit the collection at the Ashmolean when it reopens. Or, if you want to indulge in a Downton Abbey fantasy, Highclere Castle is worth the hour’s drive - the castle tour has been adapted to allow suitable distancing and the tearoom is open for takeaways.</p>
<p>Rooms from £180 a night, b&amp;b; call 01993 774441 or visit minstermill.co.uk</p>
<p>Read the full review: Minster Mill</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a Scandi-cool vibe to Minster Mill&rsquo;s 38 accommodations</p>
<p>The Swan Inn, Ascott-under-Wychwood, nr Chipping Norton</p>
<p>Best for… A cosy inn</p>
<p>How many pubs-with-rooms also come with a sommelier? Not many, but then everything takes a surprising turn in this attractive former coaching inn. Beyond the warren of low-beamed, log fire-heated snugs that make up the pub, things open up into a charming dining room, with bright wallpaper and punk-ish oil paintings. The menu is a fish-lover&rsquo;s paradise - whole Cornish plaice with marsh samphire and buttered shrimps, smoked haddock Monte Carlo - but Sunday lunch is a local institution, too: not least the garlic-studded lamb, thyme-roast pots and a dripping Yorkie. The pub is also open for drinks too but with table service only, not bar service, when this issue went to press (check the website for the latest Covid-19 updates). Upstairs the eight rooms are snazzy quirkiness a-go-go, with 70s wicker lampshades and upcycled furniture. Ask for room five, which has a deep-sink king-size bed and inviting bathtub with full-sized 100 Acres products.</p>
<p>Stella loves: The incredible drinks offering at breakfast – from healthy chilled juices in vintage bottles to divine Bloody Marys.</p>
<p>Out and about: We barely left the pretty chocolate box village – there’s a green and a lovely village shop that sells preserves and has its own bakery. While you&rsquo;re in the area, stop off at Blenheim Palace, Winston Churchill&rsquo;s birthplace, which has seasonally decorated State Rooms, magnificently manicured gardens and is only a 20-minute taxi ride away – it has reopened since lockdown but be sure to book in advance.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5658388.1595394121!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/broadway-rezone.jpg" alt="img">
Vancouver city council has approved a 28-storey rental apartment tower that is set to be the tallest building on West Broadway.</p>
<p>Council voted 6-5 Tuesday in favour of the development on Broadway and Birch Street, which will stand 86 metres — or 282 feet — tall.</p>
<p>The lot, which formerly housed a Denny&rsquo;s restaurant, sold for $26 million in 2016 to the Jameson Development Corp.</p>
<p>In 2018, council approved a 17-storey mixed-use tower on the site with 153 secured market rental units.</p>
<p>The city then made changes to its moderate income rental housing pilot program, which allows developers to apply for taller buildings if about 20 per cent of units are set at below-market rates.</p>
<p>In this case, the city says it would mean 200 market rental units and 58 affordable units, with average starting rents at $950 for a studio and $2,000 for a three-bedroom unit.</p>
<p>Proponents argued the project would deliver much-needed affordable housing in the area.</p>
<p>The empty lot, which formerly housed a Denny&rsquo;s restaurant, sold for $26 million in 2016 to the Jameson Development Corp. (Ben Nelms/CBC)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I was elected because the status quo wasn&rsquo;t working,&rdquo; said Mayor Kennedy Stewart, whose 10-year housing strategy calls for 20,000 new rental units, 4,000 of which fall below market rates.</p>
<p>Critics argued that a building so tall would set a bad precedent for the Broadway Corridor Plan and increase market rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in too many neighbourhoods where one tall building goes in, the rents &hellip; are high, and there&rsquo;s a huge pressure on all the rents in the neighbourhood to go up,&rdquo; said Coun. Jean Swanson, who voted against the project.</p>
<p>Coun. Michael Wiebe argued the units were too small and not geared toward people earning less than $50,000.</p>
<p>Coun. Sarah Kirby-Yung, who voted in favour, said she had to balance concerns about the project with the need for affordable housing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Local input is incredibly important. But it&rsquo;s also coming from the luxury of people who have the opportunity to be housed already in this neighbourhood,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really difficult to live in the city now with moderate incomes.&rdquo;
