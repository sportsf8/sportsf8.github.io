Actress Raven-Symone is a married woman.</p>
<p>The That’s So Raven star exchanged vows with Miranda Pearman-Maday in an intimate ceremony this week, and took to Instagram on Thursday to share the news, and a few photos, with fans.</p>
<p>She first teased the announcement with a close-up snap of a glass of rose Champagne, and captioned it: “So something happened this week, that has changed my life FOR THE BETTER!”</p>
<p>“I got married to a woman who understands me from trigger to joy, from breakfast to midnight snack, from stage to home,” the 34 year old revealed beside a follow-up snap of the happy couple on its wedding day. “I love you Mrs. Pearman-Maday! Let’s tear this world a new a–hole!!! I’s married NOW (sic).”</p>
<p>“Thank you to all those who helped and for those who understand why it was small during this time,” she added of the backyard bash.</p>
<p>Pearman-Maday also gave her social media followers an insight into the newlyweds’ big day, posting some pictures on her Instagram Story timeline, including one of the couple posing next to a few guests wearing face masks, and another of the brides taking a mirror selfie.</p>
<p>Raven ‘came out’ as a lesbian in 2016, but has largely kept her personal life private.

Following the announcement on the end of her reality show, Very Cavallari, in May and splitting from her husband, Jay Cutler after 10 years together, Kristin Cavallari is moving on &amp; OUT!</p>
<p>Sources have said that Kristin has moved into a new house and is enjoying decorating her new digs. This also comes after ~wild~ rumours that her ex was having an affair with her ex-bestie, Kelly Henderson. Messy!</p>
<p>Kristin is said to have splashed out on a $5 million estate in Nashville&hellip;what we&rsquo;d do to have $5 million in our savings! Ugh.</p>
<p>Kristin and Jay are apparently doing this rotating house situation, where their kids will live in the same house and the parents will rotate in &amp; out every week to help co-parent.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t wait to see what Kristin does next in her new chapter!</p>

June 18 (UPI) &ndash; Raven-Symoné is a married woman.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old actress and singer married her fiancée, Miranda Maday, at an intimate wedding Wednesday.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Raven-Symoné, whose last name is Pearman, shared the news Thursday on Instagram alongside photos from her wedding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got married to a woman who understands me from trigger to joy, from breakfast to midnight snack, from stage to home. I love you Mrs. Pearman-Maday!&rdquo; the star wrote. &ldquo;I&rsquo;s married NOW.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you to all those who helped and for those who understand why it was small during this time,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Maday posted more photos on her own account, including a picture of herself and Raven-Symoné kissing and photos with their guests.</p>
<p>Raven-Symoné came out on Twitter in 2013 while celebrating the nationwide legalization of gay marriage. She said in an interview with Variety in 2019 that she&rsquo;s &ldquo;very happy&rdquo; to be out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it was a selfish thing for me to keep my secret to myself for as long as I did, I am very happy that I&rsquo;m out, if only to help someone else feel comfortable,&rdquo; the actress said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about that one person who you&rsquo;ll never see or meet who watches the show and feels that confidence to just say, &lsquo;Hey, guess what? I&rsquo;m gay. And if you can&rsquo;t accept me, it&rsquo;s okay, because I see Raven pushing through,'&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Raven-Symoné is known for starring on The Cosby Show and the Disney Channel series That&rsquo;s So Raven. She also co-hosted the talk show The View.
