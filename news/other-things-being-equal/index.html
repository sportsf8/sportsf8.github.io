<p>The congestion of the Ethereum network led to an increase in the average gas price in May. The gas price has risen to about 30 to 40 Gwei.</p>
<p>Developers and parts of the Ethereum community are calling for an increase in the gas limit or block size.</p>
<p>The congestion of the Ethereum network continues to be a problem. During May, congestion brought an increase in the price of gas. Analyst Ceteris Paribus reported that Gas prices on the Ethereum network have quadrupled since the end of April. The average gas price has varied between 30 and 40 Gwei in this period. In comparison, the price of Gas in times of stress previously recorded has been between 10 and 15 Gwei.</p>
<p>According to Etherscan, the average gas price during May was at 30 Gwei, but it almost reached 50 Gwei at the end of the month, as can be seen in the graph below. Nevertheless, the value is still far from the 85 Gwei that Gas reached during March.</p>
<p>The congestion in the network is caused by an increase in on-chain activity as a consequence of the use of the stablecoin Tether. According to a DappRadar report, Tether and a number of “high-risk” dapps are causing a blockchain spam effect and are the main gas consumers. Tether alone consumes an average of 39.8 Gwei in the last 30 days and has accounted for 10,000 ETH, worth $2 million.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the congestion and high gas prices have started to affect dapps that require low tariffs to operate. The above-mentioned report reveals that the activity in the Ethereum games has plummeted by 83% in the last 30 days, as can be seen in the following graph.</p>
<p>Raising the Ethereum Gas limit, is it feasible?</p>
<p>For the reasons mentioned above, the community and some Ethereum developers have requested an increase in the gas limit or block size. 1inch.exchange took a survey on their Twitter account to ask the Ethereum community if the block size should be increased to reduce gas costs.</p>
<p>Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin responded to the survey and said the proposed minimum increase of 25M is unrealistic. Buterin said an increase of 12 to 15M would be better, as the current gas limit is 10 million. However, even an increase of that size, which is relatively low, is a concern for some developers. The co-creator of Ethereum presented an alternative solution:</p>
<p>Alternatively press to reduce gas costs of specific operations (e.g. cost of base tx -&gt; 14000, change of storage SSTORE -&gt; 4000). This way you can get ~20% capacity increase without forcing any of the things we know are DoS risks.</p>
<p>Other members of the community proposed as a solution to wait for the implementation of the Ethereum 2.0 that i supposed improve the scalability and performance of the network. However, the coordinator of Eth2, Danny Ryan, recently gave an update on the progress of the requirements to launch phase 0 and stated that there is still a stretch of road that will be difficult to travel. Despite this, it is expected that phase 0 of the Ethereum 2.0 will be launched at some point this year.</p>

One of the hardest things about running startups is you’re never sure who to listen to.</p>
<p>Your board members own big stakes in the company, but that doesn’t automatically align them with you. Your late-stage investors want low multiples on big numbers. Your early-stage investors want big multiples on small numbers. And they have their own specific needs driven by their funds and their partnerships. Your rank-and-file employees own relatively small stakes which, ceteris paribus, should make them want you to swing for the fences — but, in these days of decade-to-liquidity, you may have employees so jaded on equity compensation that they’d just like to keep their well-paying jobs.</p>
<p>Your executive team wants to hit their targets, earn their bonuses, and maybe some of them are deeply motivated by winning in the market, but maybe not. With a 0.5% to 1% share, a $500M exit can mean a $2.5M to $5.0M pop. Maybe some would prefer to take the early exit, upgrade the house in Menlo Park, and go do it again somewhere else, as opposed to riding it out for the long term.</p>
<p>The idea that giving everyone some equity is a good one, but as I wrote nearly 10 years ago, it’s quaint to think that doing so aligns everyone.</p>
<p>So, if you can’t really look inside the company, what then? Well, if you’re like many, you look outside. You might read books, subscribe to blogs, or listen to podcasts. You might seek out advisors or create an advisory board.</p>
<p>In all such cases, you’ll be taking advice from business people who have gone before you, have had anywhere from some to considerable success, and interested in sharing their learnings with others. You know, people like me [1].</p>
<p>Look, I’m not going to argue that getting advice from successful people is a bad idea — it certainly seems preferable to the alternative — but I am going to point out a few caveats, most of which aren’t obvious in my estimation:</p>
<p>Successful people don’t actually know what made them successful. They know what they did. They know it worked. They have hunches and beliefs. Causality, not so much. Some of them can be quick to forget that, so you shouldn’t be [2]. There was no control group. If Marc Benioff carried a rabbit’s foot, would you?</p>
<p>Too many successful people are rinse/repeat [3]. I’m frankly surprised by how many successful people are chomping at the bit to do exactly what worked for them at their last company with total disregard for whether it applies to yours. Beware these folks. Interview question: so could you tell me about a situation where you wouldn’t do that? It’s not foolproof because most will catch the hint, so this is really something you need to listen for before asking. Do they diagnose-then-prescribe or prescribe without diagnosing?</p>
<p>Their situation was likely different from yours. In fact, in the land of disruption, as Kelly Wright points out in this podcast, it almost certainly was. Are you creating a new category without competition? Are you in an over-funded next-big-thing category? Are you competing against a big company transitioning product lines? Are you trying to get people to buy something they don’t believe they need or pick among alternatives when they know they do? Are you disrupting technology, business model, or both? Are you filling a need that is in the midst of being created the rise of another category?</p>
<p>Should you listen to these people? I think yes [4]. But try to find ones who have seen both success and failure, seen success in many situations not just one, and who are thoughtful about the specific situation a company is in, and approach both advising and their own prior success with humility.</p>
<h1 id="heading">#</h1>
<p>[1] I am advising and/or have advised over 20 startups.</p>
<p>[2] One of my favorite quotes of this ilk is from now-deceased Harvard marketing professor, Theodore Levitt: Nothing in business is so remarkable as the conflicting variety of success formulas offered by its numerous practitioners and professors. And if, in the case of practitioners they’re not exactly “formulas,” they are explanations of “how we did it” implying with firm control over any fleeting tendencies toward modesty that “that’s how you ought to do it.” Practitioners filled with pride and money turn themselves into prescriptive philosophers, filled mostly with hot air.</p>
<p>[3] By the way, “I made $1B doing it this way” is one of the more difficult arguments you’re probably wise not to take on.</p>
<p>[4] As my kids said years ago, “duh.”</p>

<h3 id="crisis-conundrum-to-spend-or-not-to-spend">&ldquo;Crisis Conundrum: To spend or not to spend&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/06/1-37.jpg" alt="img">
This removes the fears, if any, about the consequences of larger fiscal intervention towards income support than the 0.8% of GDP considered so far.</p>
<p>The arrival of GDP data for the last quarter and year is the latest confirmation—if more proof was needed—that the government modelling its policy responses to the Covid-19 economic shock by drawing parallels with 2008 is grossly misplaced. In any case, a rating downgrade has just happened. This removes the fears, if any, about the consequences of larger fiscal intervention towards income support than the 0.8% of GDP considered so far. In overlooking the need for near-term demand support, and sole deployment of guaranteed credit lines, loans, and structural reforms as the main policy sustenance, the government is committing a serious error. The latter won’t work when demand and its outlook are as dire as these are. To use the virus analogy, there is not much point in making rehabilitation arrangements when desperately required oxygen is not provided to a patient on ventilator support. There is danger that the patient, suffering much co-morbidity with an unprecedented disease, may not come out of the ICU. The government should reexamine and adapt its policy strategy.</p>
<p>The Rs 20-trillion package is largely regarded inadequate in dealing with large-scale income losses inflicted upon the bottommost households by the lockdown. A key reason for the controlled spending, as the finance minister reportedly explained, was to avoid instability, drawing lessons from the 2008 crisis. This mindfulness to evade the pitfalls of large spending and the alternate focus upon guaranteed loan support for the weakest businesses (MSMEs) is appreciated by some. A few have argued this ensures prudent evaluation, preserves debt accumulation, while some others interpreted the spending restraint intends to retain policy space for later use when this may be needed.</p>
<p>Lost amidst this are present realities: That 2020 is not 2008, and that both the years as well as crises are poles apart. There are outstanding differences in the shock characteristics and context—non-trivial and critical for designing policy actions. If policy responses are set only upon the past, fail to diagnose a ‘new’ disease and overlook existing co-morbidities, such narrow sight can be hurtful.</p>
<p>2008 was a financial crisis. Recessions triggered by financial shocks are deep and long-lasting,with a long recovery, compared to real recessions—because liquidity problems disrupt credit intermediation, impacting investment and, eventually, growth. If financial sector weaknesses persist, structural damages follow with permanent loss of output. Policy responses in 2008 acted accordingly, in India and worldwide.</p>
<p>The 2020 recession is deliberately-induced due to epidemic policy. It is characterised by a sudden but extended freeze of the real economy, resulting cash flow pressures upon firms and households from suspended operations, sharp drops in employment and earnings, and overall spending. Rise in bankruptcies and unemployment have the potential to inflict permanent balance sheet damages, raising the risk of real economy problems feeding back to the financial sector via debt defaults and submerging it in crisis too. In addition, the Covid-19 shock is drawn-out with high, enduring uncertainties in many aspects, including non-economic.</p>
<p>Context is critical for policy formulation because a policymaker can only start from where things are, i.e., present conditions. Last Friday’s data that showed FY20 GDP growth decelerating to 4.2% marked the continuation of a downward drift for three successive years. These data barely capture any ‘lockdown’ impacts; the production shock from virus’ disruptions to supplies is concentrated into the last quarter alone.</p>
<p>Besides this well-known aggregate backdrop, 2020 has far more co-morbidities. One, the financial system is extremely vulnerable: Banks, public and private, are in worse health with gross NPAs at 9.3% (2.4% in 2008), lesser capitalised, loss-making; a large private bank failed this February. Blocked intermediation meant several years of credit starvation; bank credit almost ground to a halt last year as raised risk-aversion impacted the real economy. Non-banks are equally fragile, or rather more. Fast-paced lending fed credit-starved businesses, but stretched balance sheets, with eventual illiquidity and insolvencies; several large entities have failed since September 2018. Fear and lack of confidence pervades the financial system. No such issues existed when the crisis struck in 2008.</p>
<p>On the real side, corporate health is much weaker—profit shares in GDP range 3-4% in past six years, a steep fall from 7.8% in 2008. MSMEs, the main focus of current support, already bear high levels of stressed assets; the precise quality is unknown as most are under regulatory reprieve for nearly two years, perhaps restructured. Households, the bastion of private consumer demand, are overleveraged too; an inclusive measure assesses the stock of household debt at about 31.3% of GDP, with rapid increase in past 5-6 years and falling income growth in last three. Unsurprisingly, net household financial surplus shares in GDP in 2020 are half the 2008 level! Finally, the strained public balances are too well known for further mention, except to underline that provisional government accounts’ data on Friday showed the fiscal gap 0.8 points larger at 4.6% of GDP! In conjunction with public debt stock in excess of 70% in relation to aggregate output, India is in a full-blown fiscal crisis. Moody’s has recognised this.</p>
<p>2008 was heralded by several years of above-9% GDP growth from all sources, robust fiscal position (central deficit was 2.54% of GDP, 2007-08), amongst other things. Ceteris paribus does not hold for 2020 because high indebtedness, weak balance sheets, credit starvation, slowing investment and growth describe it differently. The government should squarely recognise the 2020 crisis is superimposed upon an existing growth crisis of structural proportions. It can’t act as if it were 2008. Even when remembering the last chapter from history, policies have to respond accordingly.</p>
<p>Failing to spend now, when 60% of aggregate demand is alarmingly damaged from loss of jobs, livelihoods and pay-cuts of the low-paid and younger white collar workers, professionals, daily-wage earners, and so on is a glaring lapse; many of these have high spending propensities. Then, there is the pandemic-induced depression in demand due to voluntary restraints, prevalence of milder containment measures throughout its duration. It is clear the economy will operate below-capacity for longer than one year, layered above the existing or pre-Covid slack. This makes the demand outlook grimmer, uncertain.</p>
<p>Many point to medium-term growth improvements from structural innovations. That is distant. The economy will languish in the interval because consumer demand will remain depressed, investment won’t grow and recovery will be slow. If recovery slows down, then the present shock could become structural, enmesh the real and financial sectors.</p>
<p>In such a setting, adequate and direct income support is desperately required. Flickers of demand give firms a reason to stay alive, encourage them to avail those credit lines. Debt-laden businesses are unlikely to contract further debt when repayment prospects remain uncertain; they might shut shop instead—there are reports of MSMEs closures. Even large, unlocking factories are opting to wait for demand before increasing production as per early reports.</p>
<p>What exactly is the time or condition the government is holding firepower for is difficult to understand. That makes it seem that all rehabilitation arrangements are made and tonic-spending will be given once the patient recovers. But, the fiscal oxygen required to get off ventilator support and out of the ICU is not being given! Give that oxygen, and hopefully, the tonic will be a self-sustaining, upward spiral that follows.</p>

<p>Speaking in Parliament, Mr Chan said that while there is no telling how supply chains will eventually be configured, it is likely that countries will look to source more goods from its regional neighbours to ensure &ldquo;greater resilience against future supply disruptions&rdquo;. He said this move to a more regional supply chain was already under way before the pandemic struck, thanks in part to brewing global trade tensions.</p>
<p>And while the shift would have a short-term impact on Singapore and the global economy, he said there will be opportunities in the new environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While some concern amid this flux is understandable, we should not despair. Such shifts are not a zero-sum game,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Even as countries like the US and Japan diversify their production from China, so too are Chinese companies going international and moving more production to South-east Asia. This will present new opportunities for regional economies like ours, which will in turn deepen the economic links between South-east Asia and these countries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Our posture, therefore, must be to foster greater regional integration and global interdependence rather than to try and maximise domestic production, which may not be the most efficient nor sustainable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MTI had earlier on Tuesday downgraded Singapore&rsquo;s GDP forecast for the year. It projected the economy would shrink between 7 per cent and 4 per cent this year, revising an initial prediction of a contraction between 4 per and 1 per cent.</p>
<p>Mr Chan was responding to questions from Mr Desmond Choo (Tampines GRC), who had asked about how changes in supply chains would impact Singapore, as well as how the Government was helping companies and workers prepare.</p>
<p>The Trade and Industry Minister noted that Singapore was also well-placed to tap some of the opportunities that emerge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many more companies and many more countries are now beginning to appreciate the need to balance efficiency with resilience. When they look at resilience, then they are looking at not just the lowest cost competitor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are also looking for places where they can put their operations, where their intellectual property can be protected, their talent can come together and perform production design and services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So these are all opportunities that play to Singapore&rsquo;s strength as a trusted hub, as a safe harbour for talent and intellectual property,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>On actions the Government is taking, Mr Chan said it is continuing to boost connectivity to the region and upholding Singapore&rsquo;s status as a financial and logistical hub. For example, it is working with other Asean countries to ensure the continued supply of essential goods, and is committed to signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement this year. The RCEP is set to be the world&rsquo;s largest trade pact and involves all 10 Asean nations as well as Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.</p>
<p>The Government is also helping local firms tap research and development capabilities, such as leveraging digital platforms to grow their international reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have also introduced enhanced training and reskilling programmes to prepare our workers and companies such that they can capitalise on the upswing when the economy recovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Responding to Mr Choo&rsquo;s follow-up question on the impact of the pandemic on longer-term investments like the Tuas mega port, Mr Chan said he is optimistic Singapore will continue to play a significant role in the regional and global logistics chain.</p>

<p>Related Story Supply chains not all to blame</p>
<p>He said the drop in port volume in recent weeks is due to short-term forces, such as the global fall in demand from lockdowns in various countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From a longer-term perspective, ceteris paribus, all else being equal, if the demand remains at the same level, a more regional supply chain network actually can work to Singapore&rsquo;s advantage because we are a trade hub and a trade port,&rdquo; said Mr Chan.

<h3 id="ethereum-will-absorb-all-value-of-the-crypto-market--makerdao-founder">&ldquo;Ethereum will absorb all value of the crypto market – MakerDAO founder&rdquo;</h3>

Ethereum will absorb all value of the crypto market – MakerDAO founder</p>
<p>MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen predicts that the demand for tokens and services from the DeFi sector will absorb all the market value into Ethereum.</p>
<p>The costs for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain have quadrupled since the end of April.</p>
<p>MakerDAO’s founder, Rune Christensen, tweeted a prediction about the future of the Ethereum blockchain and made his prediction referring to the deposit of a high amount of Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) in the MakerDAO protocol to issue 4 million DAI, the stablecoin of the protocol.</p>
<p>Christensen expressed great optimism about the future of the DeFi sector and about the Ethereum blockchain. The founder of MakerDAO believes that the DeFi sector will eventually become a kind of vacuum that will move all the value of the crypto market to this platform. Christensen said:</p>
<p>4 million Dai was just minted with WBTC in a single transaction. This really showcases the latent demand for non-ETH assets, and it’s the beginning of a broader trend of DeFi acting as an economic vacuum that will eventually attract almost all value to the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Andrew Keys, managing partner of Digital Asset Risk Management Advisors, shared a similar view. In a publication for ConsenSys, Keys stated that the “infinite” use cases of Ethereum are a market opportunity worth about $80 trillion:</p>
<p>We will be able to trustlesstly and digitally represent fiat, gold, software licenses, equity, debt, derivatives, loyalty points, reputation ratings, and much much more that we can’t even conceive of yet.</p>
<p>Although Christensen’s post became viral, especially in the Ethereum community, it should be noted that the DeFi sector suffered severe blows in 2020. After a series of million-dollar thefts and protocol failures, the DeFi sector underwent a crisis of user trust. In the long run, this could be an obstacle to achieving Christian’s prediction.</p>
<p>Transaction costs on the Ethereum network quadruple</p>
<p>In addition, the Ethereum blockchain is facing a problem of congestion and high transaction fees. According to the analyst Ceteris Paribus, the gas prices and, therefore, tariffs to send a transaction in Ethereum’s network have increased by 4 times its value since the end of April to 41 Gwei.</p>
<p>In contrast, Ceteris Paribus stated that the cost of Gas in a period of high stress normally moves between 10 and 15 Gwei. This increase represents a danger for the operation of certain protocols that depend on a stable price of transaction fees.</p>
<p>Gas prices on Ethereum have been skyrocketing over the past month. Average gas price is now 41 Gwei, up 4x since end of April. It uses oscillates between 10-15 outside of high periods of stress (i.e. Black Thursday). pic.twitter.com/RJmdquQNdC — Ceteris Paribus (@ceterispar1bus) May 15, 2020</p>

<h3 id="how-to-fix-the-fixed-income-portion-of-the-portfolio">&ldquo;How To Fix The Fixed Income Portion Of The Portfolio&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.outlookindia.com/outlookmoney/public/uploads/article/gallery/e1c91bf8a25730293084a49ffb65f159.jpg" alt="img">
Mutual funds, as a credible form of investment option, have gained currency over the last few years. Awareness about the performance, composition, benefits amongst other aspects of various equity and hybrid schemes has increased significantly over time. Sebi, as a regulator, has taken multiple steps to simplify the investment categorisation and the industry body AMFI has helped spread the concept of mutual funds through easy to understand the promotional campaign.</p>
<p>Mutual funds as a legal vehicle also provide a tax arbitrage to investors in debt since investments held through mutual funds for three years qualify as long term capital gains. However, debt investing is still less understood than equities and a spate of recent credit events have compelled the investors to take a closer look at their fixed-income allocations.</p>
<p>Debt investments or fixed-income investments are inherently less risky than equity investments through the behaviour of the fixed income asset class in the past eighteen months is contrary to popular belief. Most investors are accustomed to investing in bank fixed deposits, wherein they know upfront what rate of interest or return they are likely to receive on their investment. It is easy to comprehend. In case of investments in debt mutual funds, investors tend to rely on portfolio yield, which is an indication of likely return, ceteris paribus, and past returns, which may not be the right indicator of future returns. While debt funds invest in securities or bonds, which offer mostly fixed coupons or interest payments, the prices of the securities fluctuate, altering the investment return over the holding period of the investor. The price of the bond may fluctuate due to changes in interest rate levels in the economy, or the credit profile of the issuer. Bond markets can become illiquid at times as well, which leads to lower prices for bonds in general. Investors should be aware that if things do not change much during their investment horizon, the bond fund will give them returns close to their portfolio yield adjusted for expenses. But as things seldom remain the same, the realised return is higher or lower than the portfolio yield.</p>
<p>The world of fixed income investing has been rocked in the recent past due to several credit events, which have led to significant write-downs in the fund values. While there have been cases of credit defaults in a mutual fund over the years, the size of defaults was relatively small and it did not materially impact many schemes or investors. The recent bouts of markdowns have exposed the underlying lack of liquidity in lower-rated bond markets and have forced investors to relook at their fixed-income investments. Investors have learned much to their chagrin that while the portfolio yield may have captured the credit risk in the fund, the yield did not give any sense on the liquidity of the underlying portfolio. Hence, when a fund faced large redemptions, the fund stopped accepting fresh subscriptions or redemptions leading to client investments becoming illiquid. Based on this experience, it is likely that investors will shun credit risk or high yield funds which are unfortunate since any developed market requires a liquid high yield market where investors can assess and then participate in high yield trades. The regulator must look at this aspect closely since any failure to address the ground level issues may lead to a polarised market with few issuers hogging all the liquidity.</p>
<p>Fixed income investments can generate hefty returns, at least periodically, if one can play the duration right. When the economy is undergoing a slowdown, and inflation is not high, any central banker will try to reduce the level of interest rates, increase the quantum of money in the system, incentivise banks to lend to the real economy by lowering the alternative rates of deployment. Under these circumstances, bonds tend to appreciate, and the capital gains add to the portfolio yield, resulting in handsome returns. When equity funds are not performing well, making fixed-income duration funds a natural hedge for any portfolio. The flip side is that if because of a rating downgrade or an unbridled fiscal expansion, rates rise instead of falling, fixed income portfolios could deliver returns lower than the portfolio yield. However, one’s money is not at the risk of getting indefinitely locked out as there is no risk of illiquidity.</p>
<p>A good investment advisor with a good head on their shoulders, some common sense, and track record should be able to:</p>
<p>a) Identify the different risks associated with debt schemes</p>
<p>b) Assess the risk profile of the client correctly</p>
<p>c) Identify the better-managed fund managers and schemes, and</p>
<p>d) Avoid obvious mistakes.</p>
<p>While there are many moving parts to a fixed income portfolio, a competent advisor is usually able to separate the grain from the chaff. The fixed income portion of the portfolio should add stability to the overall returns, and not end up as a source of anxiety and concern.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-unique-addresses-surpasses-100-million-investors-are-holding-more-eth-than-btc-now">&ldquo;Ethereum Unique Addresses Surpasses 100 Million, Investors Are Holding More ETH than BTC Now&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ethereum-2-Security-Audit-by-Least-Authority-Reveals-Two-Major-Shortcomings.jpg" alt="img">
For the past three months, Ethereum has been enjoying an uptrend. Since falling to $100 in March, the second-largest cryptocurrency has been rising up, currently trading at $241.15.</p>
<p>In comparison to Bitcoin’s about 32% YTD gains, Ether recorded more than double the greens at 85%.</p>
<p>Besides the gains, the total number of addresses holding ETH at 39.96 million now surpasses those holding bitcoin at 30.1 million, as per IntoTheBlock.</p>
<p>This growth is seen as Ethereum makes strides towards launching Ethereum 2.0 which is evident from the number of wallets holding more than 32 ETH, the threshold to stake, which has been increasing over the last year.</p>
<p>The number of unique Ethereum addresses, the cumulative addresses has now jumped past 100 million, as per Etherscan.</p>
<p>Since late February, about 100k new addresses have been recorded on Ethereum Network. But on June 5th, 2020 251,713 new addresses were created, still lower than the highest ever recorded on January 4, 2018, at 355,726 new addresses.</p>
<p>While the unique addresses indicate the number of existing crypto wallets, the number of active addresses represents the unique sending and receiving addresses that carry out transactions on a certain day.</p>
<p>As per Bitinfocharts, Ethereum active addresses that have been on a decline since June 2019, started trending up in late January 2020 and are now reaching above 500k.</p>
<p>Moreover, the number of long-term Ethereum holders has increased to their highest level ever. As of June 3rd, 22.39 million addresses have been holding 61.22 million ETH for over a year now. This is an increase of 76% since last year.</p>
<p>Another Ethereum network fundamental on the rise is its hash rate which has increased by 26.8% since the beginning of the year and is currently at its highest level in over seven months.</p>
<p>In part, this growth is the result of USDT, which is transferring more value on the Ethereum network than Ether (ETH) itself.</p>
<p>But the most explosive growth is seen in the price of ETHE, the Ethereum Trust of Grayscale Investments. ETHE is currently trading at a premium of over 750% to Ether price.</p>
<p>“ETHE isn&rsquo;t even funny anymore,” said analyst Ceteris Paribus. “I just feel bad for all the people that have no idea how rekt they&rsquo;re going to get.”</p>
<p>“Makes you think that the SEC should approve Bitcoin and digital assets ETFs to allow daily creations/redemptions at NAV thereby protecting investors and market integrity. Looks like they don’t care about their tax-money-funded core mission and market integrity at all,” said Gabor Gurbacs of digital asset strategist/ at VanEck about this crazy premium the retailers are paying.
