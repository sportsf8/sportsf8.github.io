<p>The soft heartbreak number also features music composer and lyricist Jaani alongside Neha in the video.</p>
<p>The song&rsquo;s video presents Neha and Jaani as a married couple, whose lives go through tumultuous times because of a situation.</p>
<p>To do justice to her part, Neha had gone completely quiet on the set while filming it. The singer had to mentally prepare herself and tap into her inner vulnerabilities and emotions. There was a scene where Neha was required to break down during the shoot of the video and the singer actually broke down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to tap into some of my own experiences to do justice to the scene where I break down,&rdquo; said Neha.</p>
<p>Unlike Neha, who has shot several music videos in the past, this is a first for Jaani.</p>
