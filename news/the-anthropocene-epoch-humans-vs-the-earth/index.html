<p>Thanks to greenhouse gas emissions, the percentage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere grew by 2.87 parts per million (ppm), increasing from an average of 407.05 ppm on Jan. 1, 2018, to 409.92 on Jan. 1, 2019, according to readings at NOAA&rsquo;s atmospheric observatory at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. What&rsquo;s worse is three of the four highest annual increases have occurred in the past four years.</p>
<p>These readings also indicate a sharp increase from what the levels were even 60 years ago. The World Meteorological Organization says Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere hasn&rsquo;t seen such a high concentration of the gas in 3 to 5 million years.</p>
<p>Harmful emissions are just one of the environmental concerns that today&rsquo;s leaders must confront. Trash accumulation is another. Since the 1950s, humans have generated about 9 billion tons (8.3 metric tons) of plastic and dumped most of it in landfills. Plus, Homo sapiens are overpopulating like crazy. As our numbers skyrocket, loads of other species find themselves on the decline. You and I are now witnessing one of the biggest mass extinction events of all time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a geologic force in and of ourselves,&rdquo; says Donald Prothero, a paleontologist, geologist and bestselling author.</p>
<p>Mankind&rsquo;s overall impact on planet Earth has been so dramatic that some scientists think a change to the geologic time scale is in order. According to them, we should reclassify the (very) recent past as a new unit in time — defined by humanity&rsquo;s long-lasting marks on the world&rsquo;s climate, geology and biological makeup.</p>
<p>This proposed unit has a name: The Anthropocene epoch, or age of humans.</p>
<p>The Geologic Time Scale</p>
<p>Earth is about 4.54 billion years old. Geologists have split its history into large blocs of time called eons, which are further subdivided into eras. Those in turn are made up of smaller units called periods. Finally, the little divisions within a period are known as epochs.</p>
<p>So right now, we&rsquo;re living in the Quaternary period of the Cenozoic era, which is part of the Phanerozoic eon. But the question is, what&rsquo;s the current epoch?</p>
<p>Well, therein lies the debate. Earth&rsquo;s most recent ice age ended 11,700 years ago. That point in time is recognized as the end of the Pleistocene epoch, which began just less than 2.6 million years ago, and the dawn of the Holocene epoch.</p>
<p>The dividing lines between epochs correspond with important moments in Earth&rsquo;s history — like abrupt changes in the climate. Evidence for these events is typically found within the layers — or strata — of rock on our planet. (Ice core samples may also contain clues.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowadays, epochs are defined by a section of rock that has distinctive boundaries at the top and bottom,&rdquo; Prothero says. He adds that specific epochs are also sometimes characterized by the presence or absence of &ldquo;key fossils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end of the last ice age marked the beginning of the Holocene and established its lower boundary. It&rsquo;s traditionally been thought that this particular epoch is still going on today.</p>
<p>But in 2000, Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen helped popularize an alternative viewpoint. That year, he and biologist Eugene F. Stoermer argued that recent human activities had pushed the world out of the Holocene and into a new epoch. Decades earlier, Stoermer had coined the term &ldquo;Anthropocene&rdquo; — derived from the Greek word for &ldquo;human&rdquo; — as a possible name for this hypothetical new unit of geologic time.</p>
<p>It stuck.</p>
<p>&quot; &quot; Trash and waste from humans ends up polluting the oceans, and impacts wildlife, like these seal pups who are entangled in fishing line. Images copyright of Jamie Lamb - elusive-images.co.uk/Getty Images</p>
<p>Our Rocky Legacy</p>
<p>The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) is the body that standardizes the Geologic Time Scale. It has yet to recognize the Anthropocene as an official epoch, although the topic has been discussed. As of this writing, the ICS maintains that the Holocene is still ongoing.</p>
<p>But maybe scientists will feel differently someday. Prothero&rsquo;s heard it argued that geologists living in the far-off future — perhaps even tens of millions of years from now — &ldquo;could tell when humans were here because we&rsquo;ve left so many traces in the rocks; chemical traces as well as actual physical objects like trash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seawater absorbs about one-fourth of our CO2 emissions. This has led to widespread ocean acidification, which will doubtless leave telltale limestones behind. Dissolved carbonates in the sediment are going to be another one of our calling cards. Future paleontologists may also notice the sudden disappearance of a great many species from the fossil record.</p>
<p>We would also expect as-yet unborn researchers to discover the radiometric signatures of nuclear weaponry. All around the world, plutonium 239 — which is uncommon in nature — was embedded in sediments that lay exposed to the air during the nuclear tests of the 1950s.</p>
<p>Drawing the Line</p>
<p>That brings us to a bone of contention about the Anthropocene. If it really is a legitimate geological epoch, what moment in history should we recognize as its starting point?</p>
<p>The possibilities are legion. One argument is that the Anthropocene began in the 1940s with the first atomic weapons detonations, like the famous Trinity Nuclear Test of 1945, occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Others have wanted to push [the lower boundary date] all the way back to when humans really started transforming the planet at the beginning of civilization and agriculture, at least 10 or 11,000 years ago,&rdquo; Prothero tells us. Another option might be to define the Anthropocene as everything that&rsquo;s happened since the Industrial Revolution kicked off.</p>
<p>But now the 34-member Anthropocene Working Group thinks they have the exact date in mind. The panel voted in May 2019 to submit a formal proposal for the new epoch by 2021 to the International Commission on Stratigraphy. Before their submission, they plan to identify a definitive geologic marker. The group actually has 10 sites in mind, including a cave in northern Italy, coral in the Great Barrier Reef and a lake in China.</p>
<p>Regardless, if the geological community ever officially splits up the Holocene and rebrands these past few decades, centuries or millennia as the Anthropocene, a potential benefit might be the gesture&rsquo;s symbolic value. Crutzen and many others hope it&rsquo;d send a powerful message to governments and private citizens alike. As Prothero puts it, &ldquo;When you use that term, everyone else then realizes that geologists are making a statement about what we&rsquo;ve done to the planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.</p>
<p>NOW THAT&rsquo;S INTERESTING The Cenozoic era is popularly known as &quot; The Age of Mammals &quot; because it began in the wake of the mass extinction that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Mammals then stepped in to take over the vacant niches that the dinos and other extinct reptiles left behind.</p>

<p>Unless you are given to chronic anxiety or suffer from nihilistic despair, you probably haven’t spent much time contemplating the bottom of the ocean. Many people imagine the seabed to be a vast expanse of sand, but it’s a jagged and dynamic landscape with as much variation as any place onshore. Mountains surge from underwater plains, canyons slice miles deep, hot springs billow through fissures in rock, and streams of heavy brine ooze down hillsides, pooling into undersea lakes. To hear more feature stories, see our full list or get the Audm iPhone app. These peaks and valleys are laced with most of the same minerals found on land. Scientists have documented their deposits since at least 1868, when a dredging ship pulled a chunk of iron ore from the seabed north of Russia. Five years later, another ship found similar nuggets at the bottom of the Atlantic, and two years after that, it discovered a field of the same objects in the Pacific. For more than a century, oceanographers continued to identify new minerals on the seafloor—copper, nickel, silver, platinum, gold, and even gemstones—while mining companies searched for a practical way to dig them up.</p>
<p>Today, many of the largest mineral corporations in the world have launched underwater mining programs. On the west coast of Africa, the De Beers Group is using a fleet of specialized ships to drag machinery across the seabed in search of diamonds. In 2018, those ships extracted 1.4 million carats from the coastal waters of Namibia; in 2019, De Beers commissioned a new ship that will scrape the bottom twice as quickly as any other vessel. Another company, Nautilus Minerals, is working in the territorial waters of Papua New Guinea to shatter a field of underwater hot springs lined with precious metals, while Japan and South Korea have embarked on national projects to exploit their own offshore deposits. But the biggest prize for mining companies will be access to international waters, which cover more than half of the global seafloor and contain more valuable minerals than all the continents combined. Regulations for ocean mining have never been formally established. The United Nations has given that task to an obscure organization known as the International Seabed Authority, which is housed in a pair of drab gray office buildings at the edge of Kingston Harbour, in Jamaica. Unlike most UN bodies, the ISA receives little oversight. It is classified as “autonomous” and falls under the direction of its own secretary general, who convenes his own general assembly once a year, at the ISA headquarters. For about a week, delegates from 168 member states pour into Kingston from around the world, gathering at a broad semicircle of desks in the auditorium of the Jamaica Conference Centre. Their assignment is not to prevent mining on the seafloor but to mitigate its damage—selecting locations where extraction will be permitted, issuing licenses to mining companies, and drafting the technical and environmental standards of an underwater Mining Code.</p>
<p>Writing the code has been difficult. ISA members have struggled to agree on a regulatory framework. While they debate the minutiae of waste disposal and ecological preservation, the ISA has granted “exploratory” permits around the world. Some 30 mineral contractors already hold licenses to work in sweeping regions of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. One site, about 2,300 miles east of Florida, contains the largest system of underwater hot springs ever discovered, a ghostly landscape of towering white spires that scientists call the “Lost City.” Another extends across 4,500 miles of the Pacific, or roughly a fifth of the circumference of the planet. The companies with permits to explore these regions have raised breathtaking sums of venture capital. They have designed and built experimental vehicles, lowered them to the bottom, and begun testing methods of dredging and extraction while they wait for the ISA to complete the Mining Code and open the floodgates to commercial extraction. Mining companies want access to the seabed beneath international waters, which contain more valuable minerals than all the continents combined. At full capacity, these companies expect to dredge thousands of square miles a year. Their collection vehicles will creep across the bottom in systematic rows, scraping through the top five inches of the ocean floor. Ships above will draw thousands of pounds of sediment through a hose to the surface, remove the metallic objects, known as polymetallic nodules, and then flush the rest back into the water. Some of that slurry will contain toxins such as mercury and lead, which could poison the surrounding ocean for hundreds of miles. The rest will drift in the current until it settles in nearby ecosystems. An early study by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences predicted that each mining ship will release about 2 million cubic feet of discharge every day, enough to fill a freight train that is 16 miles long. The authors called this “a conservative estimate,” since other projections had been three times as high. By any measure, they concluded, “a very large area will be blanketed by sediment to such an extent that many animals will not be able to cope with the impact and whole communities will be severely affected by the loss of individuals and species.”</p>
<p>At the ISA meeting in 2019, delegates gathered to review a draft of the code. Officials hoped the document would be ratified for implementation in 2020. I flew down to observe the proceedings on a balmy morning and found the conference center teeming with delegates. A staff member ushered me through a maze of corridors to meet the secretary general, Michael Lodge, a lean British man in his 50s with cropped hair and a genial smile. He waved me toward a pair of armchairs beside a bank of windows overlooking the harbor, and we sat down to discuss the Mining Code, what it will permit and prohibit, and why the United Nations is preparing to mobilize the largest mining operation in the history of the world. Until recently, marine biologists paid little attention to the deep sea. They believed its craggy knolls and bluffs were essentially barren. The traditional model of life on Earth relies on photosynthesis: plants on land and in shallow water harness sunlight to grow biomass, which is devoured by creatures small and large, up the food chain to Sunday dinner. By this account, every animal on the planet would depend on plants to capture solar energy. Since plants disappear a few hundred feet below sea level, and everything goes dark a little farther down, there was no reason to expect a thriving ecosystem in the deep. Maybe a light snow of organic debris would trickle from the surface, but it would be enough to sustain only a few wayward aquatic drifters.</p>
<p>That theory capsized in 1977, when a pair of oceanographers began poking around the Pacific in a submersible vehicle. While exploring a range of underwater mountains near the Galápagos Islands, they spotted a hydrothermal vent about 8,000 feet deep. No one had ever seen an underwater hot spring before, though geologists suspected they might exist. As the oceanographers drew close to the vent, they made an even more startling discovery: A large congregation of animals was camped around the vent opening. These were not the feeble scavengers that one expected so far down. They were giant clams, purple octopuses, white crabs, and 10-foot tube worms, whose food chain began not with plants but with organic chemicals floating in the warm vent water. For biologists, this was more than curious. It shook the foundation of their field. If a complex ecosystem could emerge in a landscape devoid of plants, evolution must be more than a heliological affair. Life could appear in perfect darkness, in blistering heat and a broth of noxious compounds—an environment that would extinguish every known creature on Earth. “That was the discovery event,” an evolutionary biologist named Timothy Shank told me. “It changed our view about the boundaries of life. Now we know that the methane lakes on one of Jupiter’s moons are probably laden with species, and there is no doubt life on other planetary bodies.”</p>
<p>Shank was 12 years old that winter, a bookish kid in North Carolina. The early romance of the space age was already beginning to fade, but the discovery of life near hydrothermal vents would inspire a blossoming of oceanography that captured his imagination. As he completed a degree in marine biology, then a doctorate in ecology and evolution, he consumed reports from scientists around the world who found new vents brimming with unknown species. They appeared far below the surface—the deepest known vent is about three miles down—while another geologic feature, known as a “cold seep,” gives rise to life in chemical pools even deeper on the seafloor. No one knew how far down the vents and seeps might be found, but Shank decided to focus his research on the deepest waters of the Earth. Scientists divide the ocean into five layers of depth. Closest to the surface is the “sunlight zone,” where plants thrive; then comes the “twilight zone,” where darkness falls; next is the “midnight zone,” where some creatures generate their own light; and then there’s a frozen flatland known simply as “the abyss.” Oceanographers have visited these layers in submersible vehicles for half a century, but the final layer is difficult to reach. It is known as the “hadal zone,” in reference to Hades, the ancient Greek god of the underworld, and it includes any water that is at least 6,000 meters below the surface—or, in a more Vernian formulation, that is 20,000 feet under the sea. Because the hadal zone is so deep, it is usually associated with ocean trenches, but several deepwater plains have sections that cross into hadal depth.</p>
<p>Deepwater plains are also home to the polymetallic nodules that explorers first discovered a century and a half ago. Mineral companies believe that nodules will be easier to mine than other seabed deposits. To remove the metal from a hydrothermal vent or an underwater mountain, they will have to shatter rock in a manner similar to land-based extraction. Nodules are isolated chunks of rocks on the seabed that typically range from the size of a golf ball to that of a grapefruit, so they can be lifted from the sediment with relative ease. Nodules also contain a distinct combination of minerals. While vents and ridges are flecked with precious metal, such as silver and gold, the primary metals in nodules are copper, manganese, nickel, and cobalt—crucial materials in modern batteries. As iPhones and laptops and electric vehicles spike demand for those metals, many people believe that nodules are the best way to migrate from fossil fuels to battery power. The ISA has issued more mining licenses for nodules than for any other seabed deposit. Most of these licenses authorize contractors to exploit a single deepwater plain. Known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ, it extends across 1.7 million square miles between Hawaii and Mexico—wider than the continental United States. When the Mining Code is approved, more than a dozen companies will accelerate their explorations in the CCZ to industrial-scale extraction. Their ships and robots will use vacuum hoses to suck nodules and sediment from the seafloor, extracting the metal and dumping the rest into the water. How many ecosystems will be covered by that sediment is impossible to predict. Ocean currents fluctuate regularly in speed and direction, so identical plumes of slurry will travel different distances, in different directions, on different days. The impact of a sediment plume also depends on how it is released. Slurry that is dumped near the surface will drift farther than slurry pumped back to the bottom. The circulating draft of the Mining Code does not specify a depth of discharge. The ISA has adopted an estimate that sediment dumped near the surface will travel no more than 62 miles from the point of release, but many experts believe the slurry could travel farther. A recent survey of academic research compiled by Greenpeace concluded that mining waste “could travel hundreds or even thousands of kilometers.”</p>
<p>Like many deepwater plains, the CCZ has sections that lie at hadal depth. Its eastern boundary is marked by a hadal trench. No one knows whether mining sediment will drift into the hadal zone. As the director of a hadal-research program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in Massachusetts, Timothy Shank has been studying the deep sea for almost 30 years. In 2014, he led an international mission to complete the first systematic study of the hadal ecosystem—but even Shank has no idea how mining could affect the hadal zone, because he still has no idea what it contains. If you want a sense of how little we know about the deep ocean, how difficult it is to study, and what’s at stake when industry leaps before science, Shank’s research is a good place to start. I first met Shank about seven years ago, when he was organizing the international mission to survey the hadal zone. He had put together a three-year plan to visit every ocean trench: sending a robotic vehicle to explore their features, record every contour of topography, and collect specimens from each. The idea was either dazzling or delusional; I wasn’t sure which. Scientists have enough trouble measuring the seabed in shallower waters. They have used ropes and chains and acoustic instruments to record depth for more than a century, yet 85 percent of the global seabed remains unmapped—and the hadal is far more difficult to map than other regions, since it’s nearly impossible to see.</p>
<p>If it strikes you as peculiar that modern vehicles cannot penetrate the deepest ocean, take a moment to imagine what it means to navigate six or seven miles below the surface. Every 33 feet of depth exerts as much pressure as the atmosphere of the Earth, so when you are just 66 feet down, you are under three times as much pressure as a person on land, and when you are 300 feet down, you’re subjected to 10 atmospheres of pressure. Tube worms living beside hydrothermal vents near the Galápagos are compressed by about 250 atmospheres, and mining vehicles in the CCZ have to endure twice as much—but they are still just half as far down as the deepest trenches. Building a vehicle to function at 36,000 feet, under 2 million pounds of pressure per square foot, is a task of interstellar-type engineering. It’s a good deal more rigorous than, say, bolting together a rover to skitter across Mars. Picture the schematic of an iPhone case that can be smashed with a sledgehammer more or less constantly, from every angle at once, without a trace of damage, and you’re in the ballpark—or just consider the fact that more people have walked on the moon than have reached the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest place on Earth. Read: Deep dive on the life and times of ocean rovers The first two people descended in 1960, using a contraption owned by the U.S. Navy. It seized and shuddered on the descent. Its window cracked as the pressure mounted, and it landed with so much force that it kicked up a cloud of silt that obscured the view for the entire 20 minutes the pair remained on the bottom. Half a century passed before the film director James Cameron repeated their journey, in 2012. Unlike the swaggering billionaire Richard Branson, who was planning to dive the Mariana in a cartoonish vehicle shaped like a fighter jet, Cameron is well versed in ocean science and engineering. He was closely involved in the design of his submarine, and sacrificed stylistic flourishes for genuine innovations, including a new type of foam that maintains buoyancy at full ocean depth. Even so, his vessel lurched and bucked on the way down. He finally managed to land, and spent a couple of hours collecting sediment samples before he noticed that hydraulic fluid was leaking onto the window. The vehicle’s mechanical arm began to fail, and all of the thrusters on its right side went out—so he returned to the surface early, canceled his plan for additional dives, and donated the broken sub to Woods Hole.</p>
<p>The most recent descent of the Mariana Trench was completed last spring by a private-equity investor named Victor Vescovo, who spent $48 million on a submarine that was even more sophisticated than Cameron’s. Vescovo was on a personal quest to reach the bottom of the five deepest trenches in the world, a project he called “Five Deeps.” He was able to complete the project, making multiple dives of the Mariana—but if his achievement represents a leap forward in hadal exploration, it also serves as a reminder of how impenetrable the trenches remain: a region that can be visited only by the most committed multimillionaire, Hollywood celebrity, or special military program, and only in isolated dives to specific locations that reveal little about the rest of the hadal environment. That environment is composed of 33 trenches and 13 shallower formations called troughs. Its total geographic area is about two-thirds the size of Australia. It is the least examined ecosystem of its size on Earth.</p>
<p>Without a vehicle to explore the hadal zone, scientists have been forced to use primitive methods. The most common technique has scarcely changed in more than a century: Expedition ships chug across hundreds of miles to reach a precise location, then lower a trap, wait a few hours, and reel it up to see what’s inside. The limitations of this approach are self-evident, if not comic. It’s like dangling a birdcage out the door of an airplane crossing Africa at 36,000 feet, and then trying to divine, from the mangled bodies of insects, what sort of animals roam the savanna. All of which is to say that Shank’s plan to explore every trench in the world was somewhere between audacious and absurd, but he had assembled a team of the world’s leading experts, secured ship time for extensive missions, and spent 10 years supervising the design of the most advanced robotic vehicle ever developed for deepwater navigation. Called Nereus, after a mythological sea god, it could dive alone—charting a course amid rocky cliffs, measuring their contours with a doppler scanner, recording video with high-definition cameras, and collecting samples—or it could be linked to the deck of a ship with fiber-optic cable, allowing Shank to monitor its movement on a computer in the ship’s control room, boosting the thrusters to steer this way and that, piercing the darkness with its headlamps, and maneuvering a mechanical claw to gather samples in the deep.</p>
<p>I reached out to Shank in 2013, a few months before the expedition began. I wanted to write about the project, and he agreed to let me join him on a later leg. When his ship departed, in the spring of 2014, I followed online as it pursued a course to the Kermadec Trench, in the Pacific, and Shank began sending Nereus on a series of dives. On the first, it descended to 6,000 meters, a modest target on the boundary of the hadal zone. On the second, Shank pushed it to 7,000 meters; on the third to 8,000; and on the fourth to 9,000. He knew that diving to 10,000 meters would be a crucial threshold. It is the last full kilometer of depth on Earth: No trench is believed to be deeper than 11,000 meters. To commemorate this final increment and the successful beginning of his project, he attached a pair of silver bracelets to the frame of Nereus, planning to give them to his daughters when he returned home. Then he dropped the robot in the water and retreated to the control room to monitor its movements. On-screen, blue water gave way to darkness as Nereus descended, its headlamps illuminating specks of debris suspended in the water. It was 10 meters shy of the 10,000-meter mark when suddenly the screen went dark. There was an audible gasp in the control room, but no one panicked. Losing the video feed on a dive was relatively common. Maybe the fiber-optic tether had snapped, or the software had hit a glitch. Whatever it was, Nereus had been programmed to respond with emergency measures. It could back out of a jam, shed expendable weight, guide itself to the surface, and send a homing beacon to help Shank’s team retrieve it.</p>
<p>As the minutes ticked by, Shank waited for those measures to activate, but none did. “There’s no sound, no implosion, no chime,” he told me afterward. “Just … black.” He paced the deck through the night, staring across the Stygian void for signs of Nereus. The following day he finally saw debris surface, and as he watched it rise, he felt his project sinking. Ten years of planning, a $14 million robot, and an international team of experts—it had all collapsed under the crushing pressure of hadal depths. “I think we’ll be looking at hundreds or thousands of species we haven’t seen before, and some of them are going to be huge.” “I’m not over it yet,” he told me two years later. We were standing on the deck of another ship, 100 miles off the coast of Massachusetts, where Shank was preparing to launch a new robot. The vehicle was no replacement for Nereus. It was a rectilinear hunk of metal and plastic, about five feet high, three feet wide, and nine feet long. Red on top, with a silvery bottom and three fans mounted at the rear, it could have been mistaken for a child’s backyard spaceship. Shank had no illusion that it was capable of hadal exploration. Since the loss of Nereus, there was no vehicle on Earth that could navigate the deepest trenches—Cameron’s was no longer in service, Branson’s didn’t work, and Vescovo’s hadn’t yet been built. Read: Goodbye forever, beloved deep-sea robot</p>
<p>Shank’s new robot did have a few impressive features. Its navigational system was even more advanced than the one in Nereus, and he hoped it would be able to maneuver in a trenchlike environment with even greater precision—but its body was not designed to withstand hadal pressure. In fact, it had never descended more than a few dozen feet below the surface, and Shank knew that it would take years to build something that could survive at the bottom of a trench. What had seemed, just two years earlier, like the beginning of a new era in hadal science was developing a quixotic aspect, and, at 50, Shank could not help wondering if it was madness to spend another decade of his life on a dream that seemed to be drifting further from his reach. But he was driven by a lifelong intuition that he still couldn’t shake. Shank believes that access to the trenches will reveal one of the greatest discoveries in history: a secret ecosystem bursting with creatures that have been cloistered for eternity in the deep. “I would be shocked if there aren’t vents and seeps in the trenches,” he told me as we bobbed on the water that day in 2016. “They’ll be there, and they will be teeming with life. I think we’ll be looking at hundreds or thousands of species we haven’t seen before, and some of them are going to be huge.” He pictured the hadal as an alien world that followed its own evolutionary course, the unimaginable pressure creating a menagerie of inconceivable beasts. “My time is running out to find them,” he said. “Maybe my legacy will be to push things forward so that somebody else can. We have a third of our ocean that we still can’t explore. It’s embarrassing. It’s pathetic.”</p>
<p>While scientists struggle to reach the deep ocean, human impact has already gotten there. Most of us are familiar with the menu of damages to coastal water: overfishing, oil spills, and pollution, to name a few. What can be lost in the discussion of these issues is how they reverberate far beneath. Take fishing. The relentless pursuit of cod in the early 20th century decimated its population from Newfoundland to New England, sending hungry shoppers in search of other options. As shallow-water fish such as haddock, grouper, and sturgeon joined the cod’s decline, commercial fleets around the world pushed into deeper water. Until the 1970s, the slimehead fish lived in relative obscurity, patrolling the slopes of underwater mountains in water up to 6,000 feet deep. Then a consortium of fishermen pushed the Food and Drug Administration to change its name, and the craze for “orange roughy” began—only to fade again in the early 2000s, when the fish was on a path toward extinction itself. Environmental damage from oil production is also migrating into deeper water. Disturbing photographs of oil-drenched beaches have captured public attention since at least 1989, when the Exxon Valdez tanker crashed into a reef and leaked 11 million gallons into an Alaskan sound. It would remain the largest spill in U.S. water until 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon explosion spewed 210 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico. But a recent study revealed that the release of chemicals to disperse the spill was twice as toxic as the oil to animals living 3,000 feet below the surface.</p>
<p>Maybe the greatest alarm in recent years has followed the discovery of plastic floating in the ocean. Scientists estimate that 17 billion pounds of polymer are flushed into the ocean each year, and substantially more of it collects on the bottom than on the surface. Just as a bottle that falls from a picnic table will roll downhill to a gulch, trash on the seafloor gradually makes its way toward deepwater plains and hadal trenches. After his expedition to the trenches, Victor Vescovo returned with the news that garbage had beaten him there. He found a plastic bag at the bottom of one trench, a beverage can in another, and when he reached the deepest point in the Mariana, he watched an object with a large S on the side float past his window. Trash of all sorts is collecting in the hadal—Spam tins, Budweiser cans, rubber gloves, even a mannequin head. Scientists are just beginning to understand the impact of trash on aquatic life. Fish and seabirds that mistake grocery bags for prey will glut their stomachs with debris that their digestive system can’t expel. When a young whale drifted ashore and died in the Philippines in 2019, an autopsy revealed that its belly was packed with 88 pounds of plastic bags, nylon rope, and netting. Two weeks later, another whale beached in Sardinia, its stomach crammed with 48 pounds of plastic dishes and tubing. Certain types of coral like to eat plastic more than food. They will gorge themselves like a kid on Twinkies instead of eating what they need to survive. Microbes that flourish on plastic have ballooned in number, replacing other species as their population explodes in a polymer ocean.</p>
<p>Read: A troubling discovery in the deepest ocean trenches If it seems trivial to worry about the population statistics of bacteria in the ocean, you may be interested to know that ocean microbes are essential to human and planetary health. About a third of the carbon dioxide generated on land is absorbed by underwater organisms, including one species that was just discovered in the CCZ in 2018. The researchers who found that bacterium have no idea how it removes carbon from the environment, but their findings show that it may account for up to 10 percent of the volume that is sequestered by oceans every year. Many of the things we do know about ocean microbes, we know thanks to Craig Venter, the genetic scientist most famous for starting a small company in the 1990s to compete with the Human Genome Project. The two-year race between his company and the international collaboration generated endless headlines and culminated in a joint announcement at the White House to declare a tie. But Venter’s interest wasn’t limited to human DNA. He wanted to learn the language of genetics in order to create synthetic microbes with practical features. After his work on the human genome, he spent two years sailing around the world, lowering bottles into the ocean to collect bacteria and viruses from the water. By the time he returned, he had discovered hundreds of thousands of new species, and his lab in Maryland proceeded to sequence their DNA—identifying more than 60 million unique genes, which is about 2,500 times the number in humans. Then he and his team began to scour those genes for properties they could use to make custom bugs.</p>
<p>Venter now lives in a hypermodern house on a bluff in Southern California. Chatting one evening on the sofa beside the door to his walk-in humidor and wine cellar, he described how saltwater microbes could help solve the most urgent problems of modern life. One of the bacteria he pulled from the ocean consumes carbon and excretes methane. Venter would like to integrate its genes into organisms designed to live in smokestacks and recycle emissions. “They could scrub the plant’s CO2 and convert it to methane that can be burned as fuel in the same plant,” he said. Venter was also studying bacteria that could be useful in medicine. Microbes produce a variety of antibiotic compounds, which they deploy as weapons against their rivals. Many of those compounds can also be used to kill the pathogens that infect humans. Nearly all of the antibiotic drugs on the market were initially derived from microorganisms, but they are losing efficacy as pathogens evolve to resist them. “We have new drugs in development,” Matt McCarthy, an infectious-disease specialist at Weill Cornell Medical College, told me, “but most of them are slight variations on the ones we already had. The problem with that is, they’re easy for bacteria to resist, because they’re similar to something bacteria have developed resistance to in the past. What we need is an arsenal of new compounds.” Venter pointed out that ocean microbes produce radically different compounds from those on land. “There are more than a million microbes per milliliter of seawater,” he said, “so the chance of finding new antibiotics in the marine environment is high.” McCarthy agreed. “The next great drug may be hidden somewhere deep in the water,” he said. “We need to get to the deep-sea organisms, because they’re making compounds that we’ve never seen before. We may find drugs that could be used to treat gout, or rheumatoid arthritis, or all kinds of other conditions.”</p>
<p>Marine biologists have never conducted a comprehensive survey of microbes in the hadal trenches. The conventional tools of water sampling cannot function at extreme depth, and engineers are just beginning to develop tools that can. Microbial studies of the deepwater plains are slightly further along—and scientists have recently discovered that the CCZ is unusually flush with life. “It’s one of the most biodiverse areas that we’ve ever sampled on the abyssal plains,” a University of Hawaii oceanographer named Jeff Drazen told me. Most of those microbes, he said, live on the very same nodules that miners are planning to extract. “When you lift them off the seafloor, you’re removing a habitat that took 10 million years to grow.” Whether or not those microbes can be found in other parts of the ocean is unknown. “A lot of the less mobile organisms,” Drazen said, “may not be anywhere else.” Drazen is an academic ecologist; Venter is not. Venter has been accused of trying to privatize the human genome, and many of his critics believe his effort to create new organisms is akin to playing God. He clearly doesn’t have an aversion to profit-driven science, and he’s not afraid to mess with nature—yet when I asked him about the prospect of mining in deep water, he flared with alarm. “We should be very careful about mining in the ocean,” he said. “These companies should be doing rigorous microbial surveys before they do anything else. We only know a fraction of the microbes down there, and it’s a terrible idea to screw with them before we know what they are and what they do.”</p>
<p>Mining executives insist that their work in the ocean is misunderstood. Some adopt a swaggering bravado and portray the industry as a romantic frontier adventure. As the manager of exploration at Nautilus Minerals, John Parianos, told me recently, “This is about every man and his dog filled with the excitement of the moon landing. It’s like Scott going to the South Pole, or the British expeditions who got entombed by ice.”</p>
<p>Nautilus occupies a curious place in the mining industry. It is one of the oldest companies at work on the seafloor, but also the most precarious. Although it has a permit from the government of Papua New Guinea to extract metal from offshore vents, many people on the nearby island of New Ireland oppose the project, which will destroy part of their marine habitat. Local and international activists have whipped up negative publicity, driving investors away and sending the company into financial ruin. Nautilus stock once traded for $4.45. It is now less than a penny per share. Parianos acknowledged that Nautilus was in crisis, but he dismissed the criticism as naive. Seabed minerals are no different from any other natural resource, he said, and the use of natural resources is fundamental to human progress. “Look around you: Everything that’s not grown is mined,” he told me. “That’s why they called it the Stone Age—because it’s when they started mining! And mining is what made our lives better than what they had before the Stone Age.” Parianos emphasized that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which created the International Seabed Authority, promised “to ensure effective protection for the marine environment” from the effects of mining. “It’s not like the Law of the Sea says: Go out and ravage the marine environment,” he said. “But it also doesn’t say that you can only explore the ocean for science, and not to make money.”</p>
<p>The CEO of a company called DeepGreen spoke in loftier terms. DeepGreen is both a product of Nautilus Minerals and a reaction to it. The company was founded in 2011 by David Heydon, who had founded Nautilus a decade earlier, and its leadership is full of former Nautilus executives and investors. As a group, they have sought to position DeepGreen as a company whose primary interest in mining the ocean is saving the planet. They have produced a series of lavish brochures to explain the need for a new source of battery metals, and Gerard Barron, the CEO, speaks with animated fervor about the virtues of nodule extraction. Is there any way to calculate the value of a landscape we know virtually nothing about? His case for seabed mining is straightforward. Barron believes that the world will not survive if we continue burning fossil fuels, and the transition to other forms of power will require a massive increase in battery production. He points to electric cars: the batteries for a single vehicle require 187 pounds of copper, 123 pounds of nickel, and 15 pounds each of manganese and cobalt. On a planet with 1 billion cars, the conversion to electric vehicles would require several times more metal than all existing land-based supplies—and harvesting that metal from existing sources already takes a human toll. Most of the world’s cobalt, for example, is mined in the southeastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where tens of thousands of young children work in labor camps, inhaling clouds of toxic dust during shifts up to 24 hours long. Terrestrial mines for nickel and copper have their own litany of environmental harms. Because the ISA is required to allocate some of the profits from seabed mining to developing countries, the industry will provide nations that rely on conventional mining with revenue that doesn’t inflict damage on their landscapes and people.

Each January, we produce our highlights of the previous science and technology auction year. The aim is to offer insight for technologically-well-informed people into the remarkable artefacts of science, technology and science fiction that come to market each year, and on the investment potential of these items.</p>
<p>Curating this listing is the best job of the year, a labour of love of science and technology that seeks to record the incredible objects thrown up by ever-increasing educational levels and awareness of our rich scientific heritage. Objects that once went into landfill are now finding their way to the auction block, and onwards to a global audience that does appreciate them.</p>
<p>This year we’ve included science fiction artefacts sold at auction, significantly increasing the size of the market, and substantially increasing the fascination at what we bought in 2019.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most telling of sci-fi artefacts in 2019 was the $1.152 million sale of Darth Vader’s mask and helmet from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. Recent sales of sci-fi movie memorabilia suggest the trend has yet to fully play out, and science fiction memorabilia is definitely on the rise.</p>
<p>So too are scientific manuscripts and artefacts – the market in 2019 was much stronger than in previous years.</p>
<p>Please note that all prices are listed in USD, and those which sold in a foreign currency have been converted to USD at the prevailing exchange rates on the day of sale. Links to all auction descriptions, online digital copies of the documents and high resolution images are included in the article.</p>
<p>$906 | Karel Capek. R.U.R. London: 1923</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions Description</p>
<p>Dallas | August 14, 2019</p>
<p>Science fiction was a genre on the rise in the 1920s, and the 1920 science fiction play “R.U.R” by the Czech writer Karel Čapek premiered on January 25, 1921. R.U.R. stands for Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti and the English translation &ldquo;Rossum&rsquo;s Universal Robots&rdquo; introduced the word &ldquo;robot&rdquo; to the English language and a new concept to science fiction and subsequently, reality.</p>
<p>The Robots described in Čapek&rsquo;s play are not robots in the popularly understood sense of an automaton. They are not mechanical devices, but rather artificial biological organisms that resemble more modern conceptions of man-made life forms, such as the Replicants in Blade Runner, the &ldquo;hosts&rdquo; in the Westworld TV series and the humanoid Cylons in the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica, but in Čapek&rsquo;s time there was no conception of modern genetic engineering.</p>
<p>Sold on August 14, 2019, this small book might be one of the true bargains of the entire year at that price. When the word “robot” celebrates its 100th birthday a year from now, it will be one of the few known copies of the original book. 101 years from now, our bet is that it will be worth a fortune, because robots will be ubiquitous by then.</p>
<p>$921 | Original front cover artwork from 2000 AD #1037 (1997) - Slaine vs Cyth</p>
<p>Excalibur Auction Description</p>
<p>London | September 6, 2019</p>
<p>Original artwork for magazines has soared in value in recent times, and some of the most memorable magazine covers of our youth are now fetching considerable sums at auction. This signed 2000 AD cover illustration by artist Dermot Power, featuring the characters SLAINE &amp; CYTH may offer reliving memories as an artwork, or a sound investment … or both.</p>
<p>$1,250 | The first appearance of Buck Rogers (1928)</p>
<p>Potter &amp; Potter Auction Description</p>
<p>Chicago | July 28, 2019</p>
<p>The space opera hero Buck Rogers made his first appearance in Amazing Stories , a science fiction magazine, in August, 1928, when he featured in a story entitled “Armageddon 2419 A.D.” by Philip Francis Nowlan . Buck went on to stardom, at first in a syndicated newspaper comic strip (1929) then a radio program in 1932 and finally a television series. The popularity of the Buck Rogers comic strip meant rival newspaper comic strip syndicates had to produce their own space operas, with the best-known being Flash Gordon who appeared in newspapers from 1934 onwards.</p>
<p>Amazing Stories was a quality magazine from the very beginning, giving many now famous sci-fi writers getting their big break.</p>
<p>$1,657 | Air Escape Plan, Hiroshima Atomic Mission Autograph diagram</p>

<p>$1,791 | Space Shuttle EMU Suit Boot</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | October 17, 2019</p>
<p>What the well-heeled astronaut was using 40 years ago. This right boot assembly for the Space Shuttle Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) was manufactured in July, 1983, and was previously on display at The Spaceflight America Museum and Science Center in Prince Frederick, Maryland.</p>
<p>$1,920 | Brick Bradford No. 6.</p>
<p>Potter &amp; Potter Auction Description</p>
<p>Chicago | February 3, 2019</p>
<p>Sci-fi comic strip character Brick Bradford was one of the many competitors for Buck Rogers, and was popularized by King Features Syndicate which syndicated Brick into newspapers across the world, from 1933 to 1987. Brick had his own comic book with original stories for a short period, of which this lot is one example. Columbia Pictures also produced a 15-chapter serial film in 1947.</p>
<p>$1,935 | Space Shuttle Speed Brake/Thrust Control</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | October 17, 2019</p>
<p>This Speed Brake/Thrust Control unit was manufactured by Honeywell for use in the Space Shuttle program, most likely for the Enterprise, based on the date of manufacture – November, 1975. Bearing in mind that space exploration is still in its infancy, this inexpensive artefact might well be worth a lot of money a few generations from now, making it a long-term family heirloom.</p>
<p>$2,069 | Sally Ride Signed Book and Photograph</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | June 20, 2019</p>
<p>Astronaut Sally Ride became the first American woman in space in 1983, and the third woman in space overall, after USSR cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova (1963) and Svetlana Savitskaya (1982). Ride is still the youngest American astronaut to have travelled to space. After flying twice on the Orbiter Challenger, she left NASA in 1987. This signed photograph is inscribed, &ldquo;&lsquo;Boldly go!&rsquo; Best wishes, Sally K. Ride&rdquo; and the accompanying book is a second edition hardcover copy of Voyager: An Adventure to the Edge of the Solar System, published by Sally Ride Science in 2005, and signed by Ride.</p>
<p>$2,125 | Newsweek October 14, 1968 From The Armstrong Family Collection</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | November 16, 2019</p>
<p>With the moon landing of July 1969 still nine months away, the public was counting down to the historic moment and the most prominent magazines were narrating the preparations to the world. This copy of NewsWeek dated October 14, 1968 needs little explanation, being direct from the Armstrong Family Collection.</p>
<p>$2,318 | Gemini Rocketdyne SE-6 RCS Thruster</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | October 17, 2019</p>
<p>An uncommon and desirable piece of NASA rocket hardware, this SE-6 Thruster was manufactured by Rocketdyne for the Gemini Space Capsule. Each Gemini capsule had 16 such thrusters in the nose for maneuvering and control of the spacecraft’s attitude during re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p>The thrusters were famously utilized during the Gemini 8 re-entry when the capsule began to spin dangerously out of control. Staying calm under pressure, Neil Armstrong fired the RCS thrusters to regain stability.</p>
<p>$2,500 | Motorolla Dynatac 8000X</p>
<p>E-Bay Auction Description</p>
<p>December 21, 2019 | Online</p>
<p>The Motorolla DynaTAC became the first commercially available cell phone on September 21, 1983. The rest is history, with two-thirds of the planet’s inhabitants now carrying a cell phone. The DynaTAC specifications are worth considering in retrospect – it took 10 hours to charge, offered just 30 minutes of talk time, could save just 30 phone numbers and cost $4000 in 1983. In 2083, what will a perfect example of the world’s first cell phone be worth – certainly a lot more than the $2500 they’re selling for now.</p>
<p>$2,756 | Space Cover Collection</p>

<p>$3,126 | A letter from sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | February 6, 2019</p>
<p>A two-page signed letter by one of the most influential science fiction writers of all-time. Philip Dick published 44 novels and around 120 short stories, almost all of them in the sci-fi genre. Dick&rsquo;s works have been produced as movies many times, including Blade Runner (1982), Total Recall (in 1990 and again in 2012), Minority Report (2002), A Scanner Darkly (2006), and The Adjustment Bureau (2011). The novel The Man in the High Castle (1962) was made into a multi-season television series by Amazon in 2015</p>
<p>$3,174 | The extinct survivor</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | May 24, 2019</p>
<p>Though now extinct, the trilobite was one of Planet Earth&rsquo;s great survivors, first appearing in the fossil record 520 million years ago before finally falling prey to the Permian extinction after nearly 300 million successful years. Trilobites were so common and diverse that they are often used by geologists and paleontologists to date the rock formations in which they are found.</p>
<p>This 11-inch fossil specimen of Acadoparadoxides briareus was found in Morocco and dates from the mid-Cambrian (509-497 million years ago) period, measuring 15 x 24 x 2 ½ inches (38 x 61 x 6.5cm).</p>
<p>$3,720 | Metropolis (UFA, 1927) Lobby Card</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | July 28, 2019</p>
<p>The most valuable movie poster in history was produced for the epic 1927 silent movie classic Metropolis, the story of a dystopian future set in the year 2000 and one of the first feature films to in the science fiction genre. As posters for the movie are rare and expensive, and the movie holds a special place in the genre, any artefact is expensive, as can be seen from the price fetched by this lobby card - $3,720!</p>
<p>The Metropolis poster sold for $690,000 at a Reel Galleries auction in November, 2005. German artist Heinz Schulz-Neudamm (1899-1969) created the poster, the novel and screenplay were written by Thea Von Harbou (1888-1954), and the film was directed by Thea&rsquo;s husband, Fritz Lang (1890-1976). You can watch the trailer for the remastered original movie here.</p>
<p>$3,875 | A first edition copy of ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ (1968) by Arthur C. Clarke</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | August 14, 2019</p>
<p>This first edition, first printing of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a rare beast in more ways than one. It is based on a screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, and is hence a novelization of the treatment that would also become Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s 1968 film of the same name, and one of the most important science fiction films of all time.</p>
<p>$4,050 | Elementorum geometricorum libri XV (circa 300 B.C) by Euclides</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description Digital Copy Online</p>
<p>London | July 9, 2019</p>
<p>Readers will recognize some of the diagrams in this book from the textbooks of their youth.</p>
<p>Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria wrote Elementorum geometricorum libri XV around 300 BC, and it has remained the primary textbook for teaching mathematics in general and geometry in particular, until the early 20th century. Hence Euclid&rsquo;s Elements is unquestionably the most influential textbook ever written.</p>
<p>It is the only writing of classical antiquity to have a continuous history of textbook use from the pre-Christian era to the twentieth century. It was originally written by Euclid in Alexandria, Ptolemaic Egypt c. 300 BC, translated from the Arabic text 900 years ago by Adelard of Bath, edited 800 years ago by Campanus of Novara, and first printed in Venice on May 25, 1482. It was hence one of the very earliest mathematical works to be printed after the invention of the printing press and has been estimated to be second only to the Bible in the number of editions published since the first printing in 1482.</p>
<p>Last year Christie’s sold a first edition of this work, printed in Venice in May, 1482 for £284,750 ($376,905), making it the second most expensive copy ever sold, behind only another first edition sold by Sotheby&rsquo;s in 2001 for $511,750.</p>
<p>$4,813 | Sikhote-Alin Iron Meteorite Whole Individual</p>
<p>Christian Meza</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | June 12, 2019</p>
<p>This meteorite originates from the largest recorded meteorite fall in history, on February 12, 1947, over the Sikhote-Alin Mountains in Siberia, Russia. The Sikhote-Alin iron meteorite features a remnant black fusion crust caused by extreme heat during meteorite&rsquo;s flight, as well as abundant and delicate flowlines caused when part of the meteorite&rsquo;s surface became molten. Meteorites offer a fine investment as demand will continue to rise much faster than supply does.</p>

<p>Team Breker Auction Description</p>
<p>Köln | October 12, 2019</p>
<p>The availability of seemingly any technological marvel imaginable these days belies the progress of recent times. Patented just 200 years ago this year, and produced commercially from 1851 until 1915, the Thomas Arithmomètre was the world’s first first digital mechanical calculator strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Given its 200 year anniversary, the Arithmomètre might get a bit more attention from mainstream media this year. Given there were only 1000 ever made, and far fewer survive, this technological milestone commands a relatively modest price.</p>
<p>$5,378 | Lamson Pencil Sharpener 1885</p>
<p>Auction Team Breker/Auction Team Breker</p>
<p>Team Breker Auction Description</p>
<p>Köln | October 12, 2019</p>
<p>The humble pencil was once a “killer app.” Prior to the pencil, writing was done with pen and ink. The simplicity and convenience of the pencil, in conjunction with a rubber eraser, made it a must have tool for recording any outdoor endeavor. Mass-production of pencils was not achieved until the 1800s, and the grandiose Lamson pencil sharpener of 130 years ago suggests the respect in which it was held as a tool of commerce. In working environments where a sharp pencil was paramount, this was cutting edge efficiency.</p>

<p>$5,470 | Valeri Polyakov&rsquo;s Sokol KV Spacesuit Gloves</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | October 17, 2019</p>
<p>This pair of space-flown 1980 cosmonaut Sokol-KV2 Rescue Suit gloves would be worth $5000 without their extraordinary provenance. These were the gloves used by Soviet/Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov during his stay aboard the Mir Space Station which began on January 8, 1994 and lasted until March 22, 1995 – a grand total of 437 days, 17 hours and 58 minutes, the longest any human has been continuously in space. Before becoming a career cosmonaut, Polyakov was a medical doctor, and volunteered for long stays in space to study the effects of weightlessness on the human body. Polyakov is by far the most experienced space traveller in history, with a total 678 days in space.</p>
<p>$5,500 | six-inch Megalodon tooth</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | May 24, 2019</p>
<p>The Megalodon (Carcharocles megalodon) is an extinct species of shark that lived until 5 million years ago.</p>
<p>Its ancestry is subject to considerable debate, with current thought suggesting it diverged from the Great White Shark family during the early Cretaceous Period.</p>
<p>It is the largest carnivorous fish species known, and is thought to have grown to lengths approaching that of the contemporary Blue Whale.</p>
<p>The megalodon was hence one of the largest, most powerful and most fearsome predators to have ever lived. Scientists have calculated that megalodon jaws could exert a bite force of up to 180,000 newtons (40,000 lbf), with teeth designed for grabbing prey and crushing bone. This megalodon tooth is six inches long, and was found in the Hawthorn Formation in South Carolina.</p>
<p>A full Megalodon jaw went to auction a few years back at Bonhams, presented in fully open pose just as its prey would have seen as it closed in for the kill – the open jaw measured 8 feet high and 9.5 feet wide, and the largest tooth in the jaw (pictured above) was 7 inches, so this six-inch tooth that sold for $5,500 would not be out of place in this jaw, which is big enough to swallow a Cadillac Escalade without it touching the sides. Look closely at the bottom of the picture and you’ll see a packet of cigarettes.</p>
<p>$5,814 | Marconi Type 31C Crystal Receiver, c. 1910</p>
<p>Auction Team Breker/Auction Team Breker</p>
<p>Team Breker Auction Description</p>
<p>Köln | May 18, 2019</p>
<p>This was a landmark device in its day, being part of Marconi’s astonishing new technology that could send messages ship-to-ship for the first time. Marconi had promoted the idea of wireless to the public long before he had a commercially viable technology. When RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic in 1912, there were 1500 lost souls but most significant at the time were the 724 who survived because nearby ships could be called. The Titanic tragedy was ironically Marconi’s most significant moment, and it would have been receivers such as this that revealed the message from across the water. The above image shows the receiver from two different angles.</p>
<p>$5,850 | Soviet SA-6 SAM Missile</p>
<p>Brightwells Auction Description</p>
<p>Herefordshire | March 6, 2019</p>
<p>This 2K12 Kub mobile surface-to-air missile made it to market when scramjet rocket engineer, Professor Alexander Roudakov sold off his collection.</p>
<p>Designed designed by the Soviets during the latter half of the Cold War to protect ground forces from air attack, the 5.9 meter long rocket carries 59 kg of High Explosive and travels at Mach 1.75 (1,345 mph) in pursuit of its airborn prey.</p>
<p>Typically launched from a tracked vehicle (pictured but not part of the sale), some 10,000 such 2K 12 Kub missiles were produced, alongside around 500 launch vehicles, becoming one of the most widely used SAM systems in the world, deployed by Soviet, Warsaw Pact and many other armed forces.</p>
<p>This missile has been rendered inert, so it’s only for show, though a Zil Rocket Launcher was sold in 2018 that would have been quite suitable for launching this missile.</p>
<p>The SAM did not sell, but $5,850 would have secured this wonderful keepsake, complete with its aptly named traveling &ldquo;sarcophagus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>$6,993 | Marie Curie appeals for funding</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | June 12, 2019</p>
<p>Marie Curie is one of science’s greatest names. Marie and her husband Pierre received the 1903 Nobel Prize for Physics for discovering two new elements, polonium and radium. Marie Curie then won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry in her own right. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the Nobel prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two different scientific fields.</p>
<p>During World War I, the relentlessly active scientist invented a mobile x-ray unit and trained 150 women to operate it, becoming famous all over again.</p>
<p>This signed letter, on Faculte des Sciences de Paris letterhead, is dated July 26, 1919 and requests enlarging the Institut du Radium. The institute was beginning to research the use of radiation as a cancer treatment.</p>

<p>$8,395 | Space Shuttle Liquid Cooled and Ventilation Garment (LCVG)</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | October 17, 2019</p>
<p>When astronauts &ldquo;space walk&rdquo; (known as extra-vehicular activity - EVA), they need to wear a liquid cooled garment in order to maintain core body temperature. The Liquid Cooled and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) accomplishes this task by circulating cool water through a network of flexible tubes in direct contact with the astronaut&rsquo;s skin. The water draws heat away from the body, resulting in a lower core temperature. The water then returns to the primary life support system (PLSS), where it is cooled in a heat exchanger before being recirculated.</p>

<p>The internet may yet prove to be most significant invention in history, and this is the paper, written by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn, that gave us TCP/IP. This paper represents the first publication of the work which underpins the internet. Perhaps not in the next century, but say 500 years from now, this paper might have the same significance as documenting the invention of the wheel.</p>

<p>Apollo 13 was supposed to be NASA&rsquo;s third moon-landing mission but it didn’t turn out that way. This &ldquo;Orbital Science Chart D&rdquo; flight chart dated 11 April 1970, was carried on the Apollo 13 mission. Folded to 12 x 7.5 inches, it comprises multiple large map plates taped together in a loop. This long, continuous chart was taped and folded so that it could be flipped like a book for use in orbit.

This lunar chart was for use by Command Module Pilot Jack Swigert circling the moon…This chart was from my personal collection of space artifacts and has been in my possession since the mission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>$13,000 | Albert Einstein&rsquo;s childhood toy</p>
<p>Kestenbaum Auction Description</p>
<p>New York | June 20, 2019</p>
<p>Albert Einstein has perhaps the world’s finest personal and professional reputation. Time Magazine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Person of the Century&rdquo; is a most unlikely superstar. The following is the introduction to that most famous of the many awards won by Einstein: He was the embodiment of pure intellect, the bumbling professor with the German accent, a comic cliche in a thousand films. Instantly recognizable, like Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;s Little Tramp, Albert Einstein&rsquo;s shaggy-haired visage was as familiar to ordinary people as to the matrons who fluttered about him in salons from Berlin to Hollywood. Yet he was unfathomably profound — the genius among geniuses who discovered, merely by thinking about it, that the universe was not as it seemed.</p>
<p>Over the last few years it seems that his every possession has been across the auction block, with his violin fetching $516,000, his Pocket Watch fetching $352,054, his old and worn leather jacket fetching $145,974, his childhood building blocks fetching $82,564, his billiard briar pipe fetching $67,665 and there are many other examples of correspondence and postcards fetching more than $100,000. By comparison, this toy is a veritable bargain.</p>
<p>We will never again see the likes of Einstein, and the known universe of his possessions now appears to have been exhausted. The consignor of this lot was also the consignor of the jacket and pipe.</p>

<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | July 29, 2019</p>
<p>H.G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds between 1895 and 1897, with the landmark science fiction novel first published as a serialisation in 1897 by Pearson&rsquo;s Magazine in the UK and by Cosmopolitan magazine in the US. The War of the Worlds is one of the earliest stories to detail a conflict between mankind and an extra-terrestrial race and has famously been adapted for film, television and radio countless times since. The first film adaptation was the 1953 Paramount movie for which this poster was created. Unfortunately for poster collectors, much of the imagery used on the original release posters did not depict the Martian warships as seen on this poster, so it is a rarity in more ways than one.</p>

<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | July 9, 2019</p>
<p>Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus AD.100 - AD.170) was a Greek mathematician and astronomer who lived in the city of Alexandria in the Roman province of Egypt. This book was originally written in Greek, but with the advent of the printing press, this book became the first published Latin translation made from the original Greek text of Ptolemy&rsquo;s most important astronomical and mathematical work.</p>
<p>A prior Latin translation had been published in Venice in 1515, but that text had been translated into Arabic and thence to Latin.</p>
<p>This text is incredibly important because it was the primary source for all sophisticated astronomy from the time of writing until the work of Tycho Brahe and Kepler in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries – a time span of nearly fifteen hundred years. Instruments mentioned or described include the equatorial armillary, the plinth, the meridional armillary, the triquestrum and the armillary astrolabon.</p>

<p>It was very large, and typically measured 3 to 3.8 meters (9.8 to 12.5 ft) from head to tail, with an estimated weight of around 1,800–2,700 kg (4,000–6,000 lb).</p>
<p>The rather large and forward facing horn of the Woolly Rhinoceros have at various times caused some interesting conclusions to be drawn when skeletal remains have been found. A partial skeleton find in 1333 saw it pronounced to be the remains of a dragon, and a whole skeleton was found in 1663 which were declared to be the remains of a unicorn.</p>
<p>Regardless of which story you’d like to believe, this 37.8 inch (96 cm) Woolly Rhinoceros horn is incredibly impressive to look at, and thanks to being made of matted hair rather than bone, intact horns are rare in the fossil record.</p>

<p>$22,000 | Nikolai Budarin’s Omega X-33 Watch</p>
<p>RR Auction Description</p>
<p>Boston | October 17, 2019</p>
<p>Omega has had a long relationship with NASA, beginning with Walter Schirra’s personal Omega Speedmaster ref. CK 2998 being the first Omega in space on the Sigma 7 mission of the 1962 Mercury Programme.</p>
<p>Since then, the best known product of the relationship was the Speedmaster &ldquo;Moon Watch&rdquo; worn during the first American spacewalk of the Gemini 4 mission, and becoming the first wristwatch worn on the moon during the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
<p>The relationship continued when Omega developed the Speedmaster Professional X-33 using Commander Tom Stafford (Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, Apollo 10, and Project Gemini) as the head of the development team, taking input from many very credible sources such as the Blue Angels and Thunderbirds.</p>
<p>The watch was officially launched in 1998 through a live satellite presentation aboard the Russian Mir space station, and at Houston’s Mission Control. Not surprisingly, the X-33 has been the choice of many professionals working in hostile environments ever since.</p>
<p>In 2016, Christie’s sold the Speedmaster X-33 worn by Russian cosmonaut Sergei Zalyotin on missions to the Mir and International Space Stations, fetching $20,000.</p>
<p>This almost identical watch was worn by Nikolai Buderin and topped the results of several X-33 watches sold by Remarkable Rarities Auctions in October.</p>
<p>$22,500 | History of Manned Spaceflight Book containing Hundreds of Signatures</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | November 16, 2019</p>
<p>This is quite an amazing assemblage of aerospace autographs, based around a First edition, Hardbound, 544 page copy of History of Manned Spaceflight by David H. Baker, but clearly the work of an avid collector who carried the book all over the United States to have it signed by any relevant celebrity in the field of aerospace. The book has been signed by countless astronauts, cosmonauts, scientists, Star Wars &amp; Star Trek Actors and quite possibly more. The full identity of all of the people who have signed this book has not been catalogued, but it appears to have the signature of nearly every American astronaut and notables such as Dr. Stephen Hawking (thumbprint), Brian Jones &amp; Bertrand Piccard, Chuck Yeager, Paul MacCready and more. There’s a game to be had trying to recognise who all the signatures belong to on the auction description hi-res page reproductions.</p>
<p>$23,600 | John Deere Sample Plow</p>
<p>In 1837, Illinois blacksmith John Deere designed a plow specifically for the sandy soil of the eastern United States. Word spread, and in 1839 he sold 10 plows. By 1842 he was selling 100 plows a year, and 1000 a year was surpassed inside another four years as the company grew nationally thanks to fine products and appropriate marketing … such as this salesman’s sample from the 1850s.</p>
<p>At just 24 x 15 x 11.5 inches, this miniature plow was used to explain the technological advantages of the John Deere plow. These days, the company is global, but it all began with a single plow. Accordingly, this is an artefact of the great American success story, a fundamental testimony to the fact that there’s always a better way, and a technological “killer app” work of art! Great value at this price.</p>
<p>$24,576 | Stormtrooper&rsquo; helmet from ‘Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens’</p>
<p>Profiles in History Auction Description</p>
<p>December 19, 2019 | Los Angeles</p>
<p>Proof that it is still possible to buy a genuine screen-worn Stormtrooper helmet from a Star Wars movie without having to sell the children. This particular stormtrooper helmet was purposefully distressed for use in Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens made in 2015.</p>
<p>After so many movies, the production standards of the later Stormtrooper helmets is much higher and they are now a more modern, much sturdier version of the iconic Stormtrooper helmets that were vacuum formed plastic in the beginning. Those helmets do however, sell for 10 times the price of this helmet, so think of it as buying into a market that will ultimately see these modern helmets sell for the same price. Follow history … you can’t go wrong.</p>
<p>$26,250 | Fulgurite from the Sahara Desert, Egypt</p>

<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | September 28, 2019</p>
<p>When lightning strikes Planet Earth, upwards of 100 million volts are rapidly discharged into the ground, melting it and causing “fulgurites.” Named from the Latin fulgur, meaning lightning, fulgurites come in many shapes, but due to their crystalline structure, they are usually too delicate to survive being dug up. This fulgurite from the Sahara desert in Egypt, is incredibly large and hence rare – some 18 inches of lightning&rsquo;s lasting legacy.</p>

<p>$27,368 | MANUSCRIPT autograph by Albert Einstein -The field equations in first approximation, circa 1930</p>
<p>Aguttes Auction Description</p>
<p>Paris | November 18, 2019</p>
<p>This is a 4 ½ page unpublished chapter of one of Einstein’s scientific studies, complete with relevant calculations and equations. These unpublished pages relate to the theory of distant parallelism. They probably come from Einstein&rsquo;s previous research on possible field equations in space with a Riemannian metric and a compatibility of distant parallelism, and therefore constitute an important key for the development of Einstein&rsquo;s thought on this subject.</p>

<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | February 23, 2019</p>
<p>The combination of Wally Wood and Will Eisner produced this strip, dated May 27, 1952. In the waning days of Will Eisner&rsquo;s classic detective strip “The Spirit”, he took the unusual step of sending the character to the Moon. Rather than attempt the art duties himself, Eisner hired the best possible replacement in Wally Wood, whose then recent sci-fi art for EC&rsquo;s Weird Science and Weird Fantasy was unsurpassed. Eisner prepared a sample drawing of the Moon as a guide for Wood, basing it on a telescopic photo of the craters in close detail. Amazingly, this sample piece not only survived, but is included as part of this lot, as is the torn-out photo from Life magazine that Eisner&rsquo;s art was based on.</p>

<p>This original screen-used matte painting by Syd Dutton depicts the capital of the Klingon homeworld of Qo&rsquo;NoS as seen in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, &ldquo;Sins of the Father.&rdquo; The painting is large (96&rdquo; X 48&rdquo;) and centers on the iconic Great Hall surrounded by sprawling, spired Klingon architecture. To add an extra effect to the piece&rsquo;s already spectacularly rendered lighting, the painting was created with a series of holes drilled into the illustration for backlighting, as well as a plexiglass cutout window inside the Great Hall, which would have live-action footage spliced into the scene.</p>
<p>$31,292 | ‘De architectura libri dece’ (1st century BCE) by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio</p>
<p>UK-PhotoFreelance15</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | December 11, 2019</p>
<p>Written 2000 years ago by Roman architect and military engineer Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, De architectura (On Architecture in English, but published as Ten Books on Architecture) is the oldest surviving treatise on architecture and certainly the most influential book ever written on the subject. Included within the 10 books is a clear understanding of how advanced the Romans were in areas such as town planning and civil engineering, water supply and aqueducts, geometry, astronomy and the construction of machines as diverse as siege engines, water mills, drainage machines, hoists and pneumatic devices.</p>
<p>The book was reproduced repeatedly with commentary once the printing press was invented 1500 years after it was written, and Italian Renaissance architects such as Alberti, Bramante, Michelangelo, Vignola, Palladio and many others were influenced by it. Even the White House owes much to Marcus Vitruvius Pollio.</p>
<p>$31,663 | ‘On finite and infinite dimensions’ by Stephen Hawking</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>Online | May 23, 2019</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking first met the American physicist Charles W. Misner during the latter&rsquo;s 1966-67 visit to Cambridge. The two became close, and Hawking visited Misner at his own institution, the University of Maryland, at the end of 1967. Hawking&rsquo;s work on singularity theorems, which he first published in his 1965 doctoral thesis, overlapped with the research Misner was undertaking on geodesical incompleteness, a notion at the centre of the concepts Hawking was developing with Roger Penrose. Here, Hawking seemingly refers to a proof that another of their colleagues in the field, Stanley Deser, would publish the following year in The Physical Review Letters, in a paper entitled &ldquo;Positive-Definiteness of Gravitational Field Energy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Köln | November 9, 2019</p>
<p>The early training/test bombs for the culmination of the Manhattan Project with the 1945 atom-bombing missions were designed to be the same shape, size, and weight of the atomic bombs (&ldquo;Little Boy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fat Man&rdquo;). These bombs were called &ldquo;pumpkins&rdquo; and were used at Wendover Air Field for the initial bombing training/practice by the B-29s modified to carry the bombs, and to test fuses for the bombs.</p>
<p>The pumpkin bombs were 300 x 100 x 120 cm, and weighed 310 kg, (the trolley weighed 60 kg), exactly the same shape, size and weight as the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and Nagasaki, on August 9, 1945.</p>
<p>Now this is only a replica, and not one of the originals. Watch for parts of the original Little Boy atomic bomb later on this list.</p>

<p>Often referred to as the first obtainable map to name America,</p>
<p>Peter Apian&rsquo;s 1520 World Map was believed to be the first map to use the name America, and the first to use the truncated cordiform (heart shaped) projection. That was until 1901, when the sole surviving example of Waldseemuller&rsquo;s 12-sheet 1507 map of the World, was discovered.</p>
<p>Waldseemuller’s map is now recognized as the true source of Apian&rsquo;s map. Waldseemuller’s map was famously purchased by the Library of Congress in 2001 for $10,000,000.</p>
<p>$32,500 | Fossil Snake. Unidentified Boa. Eocene</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | September 28, 2019</p>
<p>Fossil snakes are extremely rare in the fossil record due to their light weight and delicate bone structures, particularly in the remarkable condition of this specimen. 50 million years ago, a large lake covered with what is now the mining pit at Messel, Germany, the source of this specimen. The lake would regularly release poisonous gas, asphyxiating nearby creatures. At the bottom of the lake was a thick layer of oil shale which covered over the Eocene animals, preserving them intact across the millennia. Because of the oil rich sediments, an extraordinary degree of preservation exists from this sight, preserving, in some cases, even the soft tissue, skin and fur of these animals.</p>

<p>$40,000 | ‘Opticks’ by Sir Isaac Newton</p>
<p>M40004-1_1 004 Courtesy of Swann Auction Galler</p>
<p>Swann Galleries Auction Description</p>
<p>New York | October 24, 2019</p>
<p>Isaac Newton was just 24 years old when he began working on improving the optics of telescopes, recognizing that the generation of the spectrum is related to the physical properties of light and not those of the prism. He then demonstrated his theory by recomposing the white light though a second prism, and making the first important scientific advance of his time. By the age of 30, he managed to suppress the chromatic aberration in telescopes and revealed his findings at the Royal Society, which published his lecture in its Philosophical Transactions.</p>
<p>Therein began one of the nastiest quarrels between great men in the history of science, when his work on the properties of light was criticized by Robert Hooke. So averse to criticism was Newton, that he did not publish this book until Hooke had died, despite much of the original thought it contained being decades old.</p>
<p>Opticks analyzes the fundamental nature of light by means of the refraction of light with prisms and lenses, the diffraction of light by closely spaced sheets of glass, and the behavior of color mixtures with spectral lights or pigment powders. It is considered one of the great works of science in history.</p>
<p>Opticks was significant in many other ways too, one being that it was first published in English rather than in the Latin traditionally used by European philosophers up to that time. With Britain&rsquo;s growing confidence and world influence, and in particular the Royal Society, the English language was overtaking Latin and becoming the language of science and business. Nonetheless, Newton did follow traditional protocol, publishing a Latin translation two years later in 1706.</p>
<p>Finally, Newton&rsquo;s work on pure mathematics was virtually hidden from all but his personal correspondents for many decades, and then a great international debate began with both Newton and Willhelm Gottfried Leibniz claiming the prize of having invented calculus. Mathematics is the language of the gods and it was not until we had calculus, which enabled us to explore the science of things that change, that science was able to move forward at the frenetic pace it has since THIS BOOK.</p>
<p>This final addition to Opticks, a tract on the quadrature of curves (integration) and another on the classification of the cubic curves, is one of Newton&rsquo;s many attempts to assert his priority over Leibniz. The two &ldquo;Treatises of the Species and Magnitude of Curvilinear Figures&rdquo; included at the end of the text of Opticks are Newton&rsquo;s first published mathematical papers and were intended to assert his priority over Leibniz in the discovery of the calculus. His Cambridge lectures, delivered from about 1673 to 1683, were published in 1707. It would be fair to say that both of these great men came up with calculus independently, as did the Persians five hundred years before them, and the Greeks went very close 2000 years before them, too. Our view of scientific history is largely Eurocentric and it is very sad that the scientific breakthroughs of the Chinese civilization are so poorly recognized, as we will only fully understand our heritage when it is properly documented.</p>

<p>Sotheby&rsquo;s Auction Description Digital Copy Online</p>
<p>London | May 14, 2019</p>
<p>This atlas is one of the most important 18th-century atlases of the Americas, offering the most comprehensive, detailed and accurate survey of the American colonies at the beginning of the revolution. According to Ristow, this atlas &ldquo;as a major cartographic reference work it was, very likely, consulted by American, English, and French civilian administrators and military officers during the Revolution&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jefferys&rsquo; position as Geographer to the King gave him unparalleled access to the latest surveys of the American colonies. From about 1750 onwards he published what were recognized as being the some of the most accurate maps of their time, a number of them used for official purposes.</p>
<p>After Jefferys&rsquo; death in November 1771, his business passed to Robert Sayer and John Bennett, who, in 1775, issued all Jefferys&rsquo; separately-issued maps in atlas form under the umbrella title The American Atlas.</p>

<p>$44,437 | 11-inch Elephant Bird egg</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | May 24, 2019</p>
<p>As far as we know, the largest bird of all time was the now-extinct elephant bird (Aepyornis maximus). The flightless animal stood over 10 feet (3 m) tall and was native to Madagascar. Elephant birds died out as a species approximately 500 to 1,000 years ago, the prevailing theory being that humans reduced their habitat and/or over-hunted them.</p>
<p>The Elephant Bird was thought to be the giant flying beast known as the Roc (or Ruhk) in the tales of Sinbad and accounts of Marco Polo&rsquo;s voyages. This complete egg is 11 inches tall, and 8 inches in diameter (28 x 20 x 20cm).</p>

<p>$48,000 | The hoverboard from ‘Back to the Future II’ (1989)</p>
<p>Profiles in History Auction Description</p>
<p>December 19, 2019 | Los Angeles</p>
<p>In the 1989 movie Back to the Future II, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) travelled into the future to October 21st, 2015 and rode a hoverboard; a skateboard without wheels that hovers above the ground. From the date of the release of the movie (November 22, 1989), the Hoverboard has been number #1 on the Christmas stocking list of children everywhere.</p>
<p>Despite technology still trying to catch up to the 30-year prophecy of the movie, numerous companies have attempted to market a hoverboard since then, with several getting remarkably close.</p>
<p>Movie fans grow up though, and when they have earned enough discretionary income to afford the real thing (albeit a movie prop), prices of movie memorabilia are bound to rise.</p>
<p>Many hoverboard props from the movie have been sold over the years, as there are many props made for movies as second, third and fourth back-up, just as there have with movie cars.</p>
<p>The best price ever achieved by a Hoverboard from Back to the Future II was $102,000, achieved by Profiles in History in 2018.</p>

<p>UK-PhotoFreelance3</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | December 11, 2019</p>
<p>The Great Fire of London burned from September 2 to September 6, 1666, destroying 13,200 houses, 87 churches, including St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral – roughly 70,000 of the city’s 80,000 inhabitants were homeless.</p>

Entitled, &ldquo;Rebuilding after the Great Fire: Robert Hooke the Surveyor to the City of London&rdquo;, the manuscript is accompanied by a very rare first edition, first issue of Hollar’s post-Great Fire map of London.</p>
<p>Robert Hooke was a polymath and contemporary rival to Isaac Newton. He gave us microscopy, Hooke&rsquo;s Law, was the first to use the word &ldquo;cell&rdquo;, invented the watch balance spring some 15 years before Christiaan Huygens, invented the iris diaphragm in cameras and also invented the universal joint now commonly used in motor vehicles.</p>

<p>$52,630 | ‘Principes d’optique et d’astronomie’ (1745) autograph manuscript by Émilie du Châtelet</p>
<p>Sotheby&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>Paris | November 18, 2019</p>
<p>Émilie du Châtelet (1706 – 1749) is one of history&rsquo;s most accomplished, controversial and intriguing female scientists. Her work was instrumental in gaining Isaac Newton&rsquo;s theories widespread acceptance in Europe. Not only did she translate (into French) and revise Newton&rsquo;s most significant work, but based on the theories of Newton and Liebniz regarding the conservation of momentum, she proposed the law of conservation of energy, a staple of high school physics to this day.</p>
<p>Du Châtelet’s &ldquo;Exposition abregée du sisteme du monde selon les principes de Mr Neuton&rdquo; is one of the most valuable scientific manuscripts of all-time, having fetched €961,000 (US$1,240,805) at a Christie&rsquo;s (Paris) auction in October, 2012.</p>
<p>$56,562 | ‘Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche intorno a due nuove scienze’ (1638) by Galileo</p>
<p>Sotheby&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>Digital Copy Online</p>
<p>London | November 19, 2019</p>
<p>Translating as &ldquo;Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences&rdquo;, this book was Galileo’s last and is regarded by many as the world&rsquo;s first Physics textbook.</p>
<p>The book is written in a style similar to Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo (Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems), in which three men (Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati) discuss the subject, with Simplicio representing Galileo&rsquo;s early beliefs, Sagredo representing his middle period beliefs, and Salviati his ideas at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Copies of this book vary dramatically in price, but in general terms, this is one of the cheapest first editions for some time. The record price for this book was achieved in 2017 by Pierre Berge and Associates when the dedication copy was sold in Paris for €727,919 (US$791,190), making it one of the most valuable scientific documents of all-time.</p>
<p>The full story of the publication of this book is worth reading, as the Roman Inquisition had banned the publication of Galileo&rsquo;s works in 1632 due to Dialogo, which proposed the heliocentric theory. Galileo wrote the book under house arrest, and gave a handwritten copy of the work to the Ambassador of France to the Holy See, who passed it onwards so that it could be published by Elsevier in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>That Ambassador became the dedicatee of the work, and this is the deluxe copy sent to François de Noailles, Comte d ' Ayen (1584-1645), for his role in this landmark publication. The dedication can be read in English here, and it explains the difficulties faced by Galileo in detail.</p>
<p>$57,600 | The Invisible Man (Universal, 1933) Lobby Card</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions Description</p>
<p>Dallas | November 24, 2019</p>
<p>So rare are the posters for Universal Pictures 1933 movie adaptation of H.G. Wells’ famous book The Invisible Man that this 11” x 14” lobby card fetched an astonishing price. Lobby cards from the movie are equally rare, and despite being the major platform for movie poster and lobby card sales, this was only the second lobby card for the movie that had ever been offered by Heritage Auctions.</p>
<p>The movie proved to be Universal studio&rsquo;s most successful horror film since Frankenstein, and hence went on to spawn a sequel with Vincent Price in The Invisible Man Returns and was then reprised in comedic films such as The Invisible Woman and Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man.</p>

<p>Profiles in History Auction Description</p>
<p>December 19, 2019 | Los Angeles</p>
<p>The much-loved Taunton was first seen in the opening sequences of Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back when Luke Skywalker and Han Solo are seen riding them on the icy plains of Planet Hoth. Tauntauns are a species of snow lizard that have been domesticated by the Rebel Alliance, and this remarkable screen-used animatronic Tauntaun face was used to enable it to become particularly lifelike. Though estimated to sell for between $50,000 and $70,000, this exquisite example of George Lucas’ movie expertise and animatronics failed to meet reserve and was passed in.</p>

<p>Arader Galleries Auction Description</p>
<p>New York | November 17, 2019</p>
<p>At first glance, this would seem a remarkable price for an incomplete copy of John Gould’s The Monograph of the Trogonidae. This lot comprises just parts II and III of the original three parts, bound as one volume.</p>
<p>The books were however, a present from John Gould to John James Audubon, and have been in the Audubon family for much of their existence. Audubon’s ownership inscription signature is dated &ldquo;March 21st 1836. London&rdquo;.</p>

<p>$78,000 | Frankenstein (Universal, 1931) Lobby Card</p>
<p>Heritage Auctions/HA.com</p>
<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | November 24, 2019</p>
<p>Mary Shelley is a most unlikely author of the sci-fi/horror classic Frankenstein. The daughter of two political philosophers, and the wife of poet Percy B Shelley, the story took root when she travelled to Germany in 1815 and visited Frankenstein’s castle along with her husband and friends Lord Byron and John William Polidori. An impromptu story-telling competition between the travelers saw Mary Shelley’s story ultimately became the classic Frankenstein.</p>
<p>Just how things unfolded in that first telling is unclear, but Polidori is credited by some as the creator of the vampire genre of fantasy fiction for his short story &ldquo;The Vampyre&rdquo; (1819), the first published modern vampire story.</p>
<p>Some people believe that Frankenstein should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character “makes a deliberate decision” and “turns to modern experiments in the laboratory&rdquo; to achieve fantastic results.</p>
<p>After the success of the movie Dracula in February 1931, Universal Studios’ Carl Laemmle was convinced that the horror genre would not only succeed, but also bring fame and fortune to his studio. Fresh from his debut as Count Dracula, Bella Lugosi initially agreed to take on the lead role, but declined when he found the character had no lines.</p>
<p>The movie’s director, James Whale, spotted Boris Karloff at the studio and immediately named him as the director&rsquo;s preferred candidate for the part. The actor&rsquo;s tall and gaunt appearance was exactly what Whale envisioned for the legendary man-made creature. The image used on this lobby card is from the test shots before filming, and Frankenstein’s look is identical to the film other than the prominent bolts on the forehead.</p>

<p>$81,250 | Einstein explains quantum entanglement with a three-page &ldquo;simple thought experiment&rdquo; in an autograph letter to Paul Epstein</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>New York | June 12, 2019</p>
<p>“I myself first came upon the argument starting from a simple thought experiment. I think it will be best for us if I walk you through it…”.</p>
<p>With the aid of two diagrams involving a mirrored box, a screen, and an axis, Einstein presents the entire experiment as he first envisioned it. “Thus I incline to the opinion that the wave function does not (completely) describe what is real, but only a to us empirically accessible maximal knowledge regarding that which really exists,” he concludes here. “This is what I mean when I advance the view that quantum mechanics gives an incomplete description of the real state of affairs… I do not believe that this will prove to be the correct path for the long run”. It was not until 2016 that Einstein would be proven wrong.</p>

<p>$86,100 | Tin Litho Battery Operated Machine Man Robot</p>
<p>Morphy Auction Description</p>
<p>Denver, PA | March 29, 2019</p>
<p>Robbie the robot in the 1956 movie Forbidden Planet had a profound influence on our perception of robots, and remains one of the iconic science fiction robots of all-time.</p>
<p>When Robby went to auction in 2017 he fetched $5,375,000, becoming the second most expensive movie prop in history, next to Marilyn Monroe’s “Seven Year Itch” dress.</p>
<p>Thanks to Robby, robots were very topical in the 1950s and top-of-mind for sci-fi enthusiasts, and many robot toys were produced which are now fetching substantial amounts at auction.</p>
<p>Much has been written about the affinity of the Japanese culture with robots, and it is hence not surprising that the Japanese would make the most sought-after vintage toy robot.</p>
<p>Japanese toy producer Masudaya produced a range of five 15-inch tall robots in the late 1950s and early 1960s known as the Gang of Five. The fifth member of the series, known as Machine Man was produced in very limited quantities, and today, just four are known to still exist with their original boxes and around 14 in total. In 1996, a Machine Man identical to this lot sold for $74,000 at a Sotheby’s auction, and another Gang of Five toy robot, known as Target Robot, sold for $52,900 at a Morphy auction in 2010.</p>
<p>Hence this near perfect specimen of Machine Man which had a single owner since new, and came with its original box in mint condition, set a new world record for a toy robot in March.</p>

<p>Swann Galleries Auction Description</p>
<p>New York | June 6, 2019</p>
<p>The engraved decorative map of Southern Africa has a rather lengthy title meaning “Depiction of the coastal strips of Manicongo, Angola, Monomotapa, Natal, Zofala, Mozambique, the Abyssinians etc., together with the shallows and sandbanks along them. And also of the big island that is usually called Saint Laurentius or Madagascar that is counted among the very largest islands of the entire Orient&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What makes this particular map extra special is that this was the first map published in the Netherlands for areas outside of Europe, and formed the basis upon which Dutch seafarers quickly built upon in their travels to Asia. The decoration of the map is worth a look in high resolution.</p>
<p>$87,500 | American oak book cabinet from the personal library of Edward S. Curtis, built to hold the volumes and supplemental folios of ‘The North American Indian’</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>New York | October 2, 2019</p>
<p>Edward Sheriff Curtis (1868 –1952) was an American photographer and ethnologist who set out to record traditional Native American cultures. He published The North American Indian between 1907 and 1930 and the entire body of work grew to breathtaking size and scope, comprising twenty volumes of narrative text, with each volume accompanied by a portfolio of large photogravure plates.</p>
<p>This oak wood cabinet was sold as a line item by Stickley Brothers, Grand Rapids, Michigan, and was advertised as &ldquo;a book and folio cabinet to hold the volumes and supplemental folios of The North American Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This particular cabinet was gifted to Curtis by the writer Marah Ellis Ryan. She and Curtis were both ardent supporters of causes for indigenous peoples of the Americas and had become close friends. Curtis supplied the illustrations for one of her books, (New York &amp; Toronto, 1909). Shortly before Ryan’s death in 1934, she gifted both this cabinet and a set of The North American Indian to the photographer.</p>
<p>$87,500 | The Moon Conquerors, Science Wonder Quarterly cover, Winter 1930</p>
<p>Heritage Auction Description</p>
<p>Dallas | August 14, 2019</p>
<p>One of many magazines for sci-fi enthusiasts in the 1930s, the quarterly issues of Science Wonder Quarterly were eagerly awaited. This gorgeous cover illustration from the winter 1930 issue is the work of sci-fi illustration pioneer Frank R. Paul, entitled, &ldquo;The Moon Conquerors.&rdquo; Published during the Great Depression, space travel appeared a long way into the future, and a moon landing was still truly in the realms of sci-fi. As things transpired, the first human-made object touched the moon inside 30 years and humans stood on the moon within 40 years.</p>
<p>$88,373 | ‘Histoire générale des insectes de Surinam et de toute l&rsquo;Europe’ (1771) by Maria Sybilla Merian and Daniel Rabel</p>
<p>Sotheby&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | November 12, 2019</p>
<p>German-born naturalist and scientific illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian (1647 – 1717) is one of four female scientists who regularly appear in our annual scientific auction year highlights. All four (the others were Émilie du Châtelet, Ada Lovelace and Marie Curie, and all are included this year) overcame seemingly insurmountable gender-bias obstacles of their era to make an immense contribution to science.</p>
<p>Merian worked in watercolors, for example, because oil paints were only available to men. Indeed, Merian was not at first recognized for her work, having been &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; for her contributions to botany and zoology several centuries after her death and she is now regarded as one of history&rsquo;s greatest female scientists. She was the first published woman naturalist, but died a pauper. Peter the Great of Russia was the first to recognize Merian&rsquo;s work and he purchased many of her watercolors which now reside in the Kunstkamera Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography in St Petersburg</p>
<p>In 1699, Merian travelled to the Dutch colony of Suriname in South America to observe and illustrate new species of insects, becoming arguably the first person in history to undertake an epic journey solely for scientific purposes. Her five-year expedition was cut short after two years when she contracted malaria, but the resultant publication of Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium upon her return to Amsterdam became a foundation for the science of entomology.</p>

<p>ASTP crew were not provisioned to conduct an EVA so one of two sets of gas connectors (for intake and exhaust) were removed with patches sewn over the holes.</p>
<p>$88,823 | ‘A Map Of The British And French Dominions In North America&rsquo; by John Mitchell</p>
<p>Sotheby&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>London | May 14, 2019</p>
<p>A first edition, second issue, this large (1980 x 1420mm) engraved wall-map is regarded by many authorities as the most important map in the history of American cartography. Another 20 editions of this map appeared between 1755 and 1781, and it became the basis for territorial boundaries drawn in the treaties concluding the French and Indian War and the American Revolution.</p>
<p>Geographically, it incorporated knowledge derived from the analysis of reports, journals, and maps available in the files of the British Board for Trade and Plantations. Its numerous legends and notes on Indians, settlements, and trails still provide a valuable source for historical and ethnological study.</p>

<p>$93,750 | &ldquo;In other words, God tirelessly plays dice under laws which he has himself prescribed&rdquo; (c. 1945): autograph letter by Albert Einstein</p>
<p>Christie&rsquo;s Auction Description</p>
<p>New York | June 12, 2019</p>
<p>Einstein and others had argued in the EPR [Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen] paradox that an objective physical reality could be elucidated more precisely than Heisenberg allowed, unless information were being transmitted from one particle to another faster than the speed of light – what Einstein would later describe as “spooky action at a distance.”</p>
<p>Today, this principle is better known as quantum entanglement, the basis for so-called quantum computing. Here, it is described as &ldquo;spatio-temporal effect at a distance&rdquo; (&ldquo;raumzeitliche Fernwirkung&rdquo;) — “which my gut feeling resists due to its implausible character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this letter, in response to Epstein’s own paper on the EPR problem in the June issue of American Journal of Physics, Einstein writes to clarify why exactly he sees quantum mechanics as an &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; theory.</p>

<p>$100,075 | The red “arming” plug and green “safety” plug from the First Atomic Bomb dropped on Japan (1945)</p>
<p>Bonhams Auction Description</p>
<p>Online | December 12, 2019</p>
<p>These plugs are the green safety plug and a red arming plug for the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945, AKA L-11, AKA “Little Boy.”</p>
<p>Three sets of these plugs are known to exist: this set, a set held by the Naval Museum in Washington D.C., and a set which went to auction at Butterfields auctions in San Francisco in 2002, selling for $167,000. Accordingly, these plugs came at a discount price, though it is uncertain which of the three extant green plugs was removed from the bomb moments before it was dropped, and the red plug which replaced it went down with the bomb. Hence this red plug is definitely a “spare.”</p>
<p>The plugs came via Morris R. Jeppson, the weapons test officer aboard the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress aircraft which dropped the bomb.</p>
<p>The 9000-pound Little Boy had an explosive yield equal to 20 000 tons of TNT, and is believed to have killed more than 140,000 people - there are several other artefacts of the bomb in this scientific auction year highlights of 2019 article. Jeppson gave the plugs to Edward Doll, the head of the fusing team on the bomb, the day after the flight. Jeppson kept one set which was the set sold in 2002.</p>

<h3 id="pakistans-slice-of-the-moon">&ldquo;Pakistan’s slice of the moon&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dawn.com/large/2019/07/5d3b73dd031fc.jpg" alt="img">
MONDAY’S launch of the Chandrayaan-2 water-finding moon mission is a significant demonstration of India’s scientific and engineering capacity. It puts India firmly within a select group of countries prowling the solar system for commercial, strategic, and scientific reasons. Pakistanis naturally want to know where they stand in science — of which space exploration is just a small part — and why. What gave India this enormous lead over Pakistan?</p>
<p>It is natural that India’s Hindutva government should boast Chandrayaan-2 as its own achievement and claim continuation with imagined glories from Vedic times. But rightfully the credit goes elsewhere. Just imagine if history could be wound back by 70-80 years and prime-minister Jawaharlal Nehru was replaced by Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>Instead of astronomy, today’s India would be pursuing astrology. Its university departments would have many ganitagayons but few mathematicians, an army of rishis would outnumber physicists. The cure for cancer would be sought in yoga while floods and earthquakes would somehow be linked to cow slaughter. Instead of devising Chandrayaan, Indian scientists would be searching for the fictitious Vimana of Ravana.</p>
<p>Aiming for a culture of science will serve Pakistan better than trying to match India’s new moon shot.</p>
<p>The atheistic Nehru brought to India an acceptance of European modernity. For this Hindutva hates him even more than it hates India’s Muslims and Christians. Still, his insistence on ‘scientific temper’ — a singularly odd phrase invented while he was still in prison — made India nurture science. Earlier, vigorous reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1772-1833) had shown the path. As long as Nehru stood tall no rishi, yogi, or army general could head a science institution</p>
<p>Will Pakistan also get a slice of the moon? That depends upon the quality of our scientists and if a culture of science develops. Of course, Pakistan never had a Nehru. A further setback happened in the Ziaul Haq days when Sir Syed Ahmad Khan’s modernism had its remaining flesh eaten off by Allama Iqbal’s shaheen. As if to compensate the loss of appetite for science, buildings for half-a-dozen science institutions were erected along Islamabad’s Constitution Avenue. They could be closed down today and no one would notice. Today’s situation for science — every kind except agriculture and biotechnology — is dire.</p>
<p>The official website of the National Space Agency of Pakistan (Suparco) is silent on space exploration plans. Born a year before its Indian counterpart ISRO, Suparco lists its earliest achievement as the periodic launches of US-supplied weather monitoring Rehbar rockets between 1962 and 1972. The most recent activity listed is of July 9, 2018, when China launched two remote sensing satellites for Pakistan to monitor progress on CPEC. One of the two “was indigenously designed and solely developed by Suparco, and is primarily aimed at remote sensing”.</p>
<p>As a space-filler this pathetic website speaks in hushed terms about the Hatf and Shaheen-III missile programmes but falls short of saying what Suparco’s role was, if any. The last four chairmen of Suparco, together with their educational qualifications, are listed as Maj Gen. Raza Husain (2001-2010, BSc), Maj Gen. Ahmed Bilal Husain (2010-2016, MSc), Maj Gen. Qaiser Anees Khurram (2016-2018, BSc), and Maj Gen. Amer Nadeem (2018-present, BSc).</p>
<p>National achievements in space science being so lean, where should bright young Pakistani science buffs be pointed towards? Every day they read of some great achievement — spacecraft landing on asteroids, new planets being discovered, black holes colliding in distant galaxies, etc. But Pakistan’s three most celebrated scientists have precious little to offer. Let’s call them X, Y, Z.</p>
<p>X appears to have lost his earlier passion for bombs and missiles and these days is mostly concerned with finding religious cure to cancer as well as advising women on how to deal with menopause problems. Y is (or was?) under a NAB investigation because he spent Rs4.69 billion gasifying Thar coal but failed to produce a single watt of electricity. He may be in much hotter water once the Reko Diq investigation gets going and his role in the Tethyan Copper affair is revealed. Mishandling Reko Diq currently threatens Pakistan with a mind boggling $5.9bn fine. Z has clawed his way back to power but cannot explain why billions spent upon his institute have not produced a single useful pharmaceutical product.</p>
<p>Lacking guidance from knowledgeable elders, a few of Pakistan’s most gifted kids have found their own way. I have been astonished and thrilled to meet some. Aged 12-18, like hungry animals, they have gorged themselves on distance learning materials offered by Stanford, MIT, Coursera, etc. They seem to owe nothing to their environment, teachers, and even their parents. Some are village bumpkins, others are English-speaking urbanites. Natural genius propels them. But how far?</p>
<p>It’s good that such talent is achieving some recognition. Fawad Chaudhry, the newly appointed minister of science and technology, told me that he plans to start 1500 STEM schools for exceptional students. One hopes that the right students will be selected and that by some miracle good teachers can be found. Chaudhry should realise that the chance of failure will be one hundred per cent if students are graded by ratta-promoting local examination boards. Duffers must never be allowed to judge geniuses; alternatives must be explored.</p>
<p>More encouraging news: Pakistani doctors in the US are fabulously rich but are not known to spend their money wisely or well. That may be changing. Last month, at the annual meeting in Florida, the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America (APPNA) put out an appeal to create an institute that would identify and support young people with exceptional math/physics talent. Let’s hope that that pans out.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s chance of a moon shot — unless on the back of a Chinese rocket — will stay zero for a long time. There is no reason to cry about this. Much more important problems need to be addressed. Solving them needs a strong scientific base at every step. Creating this base calls for developing scientific attitudes and dumping non-scientific ones. Symbolically this amounts to putting Sir Syed ahead of Allama Iqbal as a national icon. Impossible? Maybe. But, as they say, you can’t make an omelet without breaking an egg.</p>

<h3 id="the-last-of-the-great-explorers">&ldquo;The last of the great explorers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/styles/il_manual_crop_16_9/public/201910_FT_DIV_06-RT-WEB-HEADER-VICTOR-V2.jpg" alt="img">
Six months later, I boarded the Pressure Drop in Tonga, in the South Pacific. By then the expedition had already completed four of the five deeps. They had overcome icebergs and roaring seas to dive the South Sandwich Trench in the Southern Ocean. In April the Limiting Factor became the first manned vessel to explore the Java Trench in the Indian Ocean, 7,192 metres down. (The Indonesian government refused to grant a dive permit, so the ship turned off its tracking beacons, went dark and dived anyway.) In May, Vescovo had beaten James Cameron’s all-time depth record, reaching 10,928 metres in the Pacific’s Challenger Deep.</p>
<p>In the submarine hangar the Triton crew were working on the Limiting Factor. Suspended in its steel cradle, the submersible looked like a spacecraft, every line designed for efficient vertical travel. The outer flotation hull was scratched and dented, scars from more than two-dozen dives. “This thing takes more abuse than the space shuttle,” said Kelvin McGee, the sub’s stout, irrepressible operations manager, patting the side proudly.</p>
<p>Another engineer, drenched in oil, was repairing the robotic arm. “You can’t step into Walmart and buy those parts,” said Lahey. “Everything has to be made, designed, tested.” The titanium for the crew compartment was 9cm thick, he explained, milled to a 99.933% perfect sphere to evenly distribute pressure. The tolerances were so fine that the forge in LA had to develop a new manufacturing method. Any less could risk structural weakness and a fatal implosion.</p>
<p>When Vescovo first contacted Triton in 2015, he just wanted something basic: “a vehicle that could get to the bottom and back up”. Lahey convinced him to add a second seat and the robotic arm which, though it increased the price considerably, would make the sub an asset for deep-ocean science by enabling researchers to collect geological and biological samples from the trench floor. It would also make the sub more attractive to eventual buyers once the expedition was over. “This is not a one-shot craft,” Lahey told me. “It wasn’t intended to do Victor’s hero dives” – as several of the crew sarcastically called them – “and then be retired to a museum.”</p>
<p>Scrambled or fried? An egg-yolk jellyfish at 300 metres</p>
<p>Lahey has spent his life in the water: first as a commercial diver, then as a sub pilot, finally as an engineer. He has seen manned submarines fall out of favour in oceanography, with the rise of underwater drones. But for Lahey, drones offer a superficial experience of ocean life. “Imagine doing your bird-watching through a drone,” he said dismissively. Being in a submarine, floating over a reef, he said, “changes you. It’s quiet, it’s peaceful. There’s beautiful colours, it’s teeming with life. It really is sublime.”</p>
<p>There was a hum of motors. The arm was working again. “That’s fucking beautiful! An extra ration of rum for you this evening,” Lahey said.</p>
<p>The engineer smiled. “Oh, I’m drinking a bottle tonight!”</p>
<p>By then the expedition had become a tight-knit operation. The crew had bonded over months at sea (“One great big dysfunctional family!” Lahey joked) and at mealtimes they would tell war stories: memorable dives, previous expeditions, near misses. Vescovo talked about Everest or his tours in the navy reserves. At times it seemed as though he saw those as his true career, and investment as the hobby.</p>
<p>Each dive began in the same way: Vescovo would wake before dawn, don his blue flight suit, pack his usual lunch – a tuna sandwich, a Coke and crisps – and climb down the narrow chute into the cockpit, before launching into the darkness. Descent and ascent took up to four hours each way. There was no toilet, only a bottle (“or as we pilots like to call them, ‘range extenders’”). To stave off boredom between communications checks, Vescovo watched films or history documentaries on his phone. But once at depth he barely had time to appreciate his surroundings. “When you’re at the bottom, a minute feels like ten seconds. When you’re on the way up, a minute feels like 20 minutes,” he said.</p>
<p>He no longer worried about his own safety. “It’s a titanium sphere that’s bolted together. It would take God himself to try and crack that thing,” Vescovo said. “The most dangerous thing would be if there is some major collision and pieces of the foam sheared off. Then all of a sudden, I’m negatively buoyant and I can’t get back up. But the possibility is just so remote.”</p>
<p>After each dive Jamieson fell into a routine: empty the landers’ traps, photograph and measure each specimen – “length it, weight it, sex it” – and take white-tissue samples, before freezing them. Deep-sea crustaceans have evolved for Hadal depths and pressures, so “on the surface, they’re basically cooking”.</p>
<p>The Hadal Zone makes up less than 1% of the ocean by area, but, viewed in cross-section, it accounts for almost half the depth. “And it gets ignored,” Jamieson said. Maps decorated the walls of his office, a narrow room just off mission control. On a shelf lay two rubber ducks, from his son back home in Scotland. He showed me some videos from the deeps. The footage was full of life: in Java, thousands of tiny translucent sea cucumbers grazed in the sand like cattle. Fish swarmed the landers’ bait traps. “Other than tropical lagoons, where else do you see such abundance?” Jamieson marvelled.</p>
<p>With the expedition approaching its final leg, the emotional highs of the early accomplishments had faded and left a slight sense of regret. The Challenger dives had made headlines worldwide. But it wasn’t their achievements that had caught the world’s imagination. Instead, every headline was about the revelation that Vescovo had filmed a plastic bag at the bottom. Vescovo and the crew were livid. It wasn’t even true. Vescovo had filmed something plastic in the Java Trench – they don’t know what it was – and a press release had mixed it up with Mariana Trench. Soon the mistake echoed around the world. “That fucking plastic bag,” said Jamieson. “It wasn’t even the right trench!”</p>
<p>Four deeps completed, and the Limiting Factor had also failed to collect any sediment or water samples, in part because of Vescovo’s insistence on diving solo. Although the arm had been replaced after Puerto Rico, it was too difficult for one person to operate it and also pilot the sub. The plan had been to follow each solo attempt with a two-person science dive, but several of these had been scrapped due to the submarine’s early technical challenges. In the Southern Ocean Vescovo had accidentally turned the cameras off, resulting in no footage at all. “Half the science is already dead,” Jamieson said, irritated. For him, every “hero dive” was a missed opportunity. “There’s no actual scientific basis for [them] at all,” Jamieson said.</p>
<p>The Tonga Trench is the second-deepest on the planet but it had never been explored in detail. Vescovo hoped it might prove to be even deeper than the Mariana Trench. If so, it would be a historic discovery. As we sailed over the trench, the sonar scanned the seabed, building up a detailed picture of the chasm below. While engineers tinkered with the sub, Vescovo mostly worked alone in his cabin.</p>
<p>In his office the expedition’s leader, Rob McCallum, watched the weather charts intently. A low-pressure system was mustering off New Zealand, threatening the dive. “It could get a little sporty,” he said. A veteran of countless dive expeditions, McCallum was used to managing wealthy clients. “It’s my job to be brutally honest,” he explained. The job required tact, and patience. “I’m on a crusade against ego. Ego gets people in trouble.”</p>
<p>Open wide A common fangtooth, which lives at depths of up to 5,000 metres</p>
<p>That evening McCallum gathered the crew in mission control. The map of the trench illuminated two large monitors. Sonar readings had dashed Vescovo’s hopes for the all-time record: the bottom was shallower than the Challenger Deep by less than 100 metres. Nonetheless, Vescovo would dive the deepest point. Then, weather allowing, the plan was to dive to a spectacular cliff face accompanied by Stewart, the expedition’s geologist. It was to be Stewart’s first dive, making her the first woman to travel to the Hadal Zone. The weather, however, threatened to end the trip early. “If we do just one dive, it will be the dual dive,” Vescovo said, to some surprise. But the next day, with the low-pressure front dithering to the south, he decided to go ahead solo.</p>
<p>The launch went smoothly. But after about an hour on the bottom, Vescovo reported to the surface that the Limiting Factor’s battery levels were unusually low. A few minutes later Lahey received a text message over the communicator: Vescovo’s systems were shutting down. Frustrated, he aborted the dive. Later, it would emerge that water had broken into one of the sub’s junction boxes, shorting a circuit and melting a hole in the side. Though Vescovo was safe inside the cockpit, the damage was extensive (“The deepest submarine fire ever!” Vescovo joked). Repairs would take days. The second dive was cancelled.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Stewart disappeared to her cabin, clearly devastated. Vescovo seemed to regret the outcome. “I feel bad for her, though it is what it is.” There would be other chances, he said. And a sub fire at depth could have been far worse. “It’s an expedition,” Vescovo said. McCallum nodded. “Not a cruise.”</p>
<p>Later, in a quiet moment, I asked Vescovo why he insisted on diving solo. “It’s just how I am. I can’t answer it any more than that. I really can’t,” he said. “I like climbing alone, I like flying alone. I like doing things by myself, I guess, because it’s a more intense experience. On the other side I’d know it was me that was responsible for it and I took care of things. I put myself in that position with no reliance on anyone else.”</p>
<p>Despite setbacks, the expedition had still made significant contributions to ocean science. Jamieson had catalogued several possible new species of amphipods, at least one new species of snailfish and a mysterious stalked ascidian – a gelatinous cloud-like creature with a long tail – that seemed to fly like a kite in the current. After the Java and Mariana records, he’d accompanied Vescovo on science dives, finally visiting the undersea realm he’d studied for a decade. (It was, he said with typical understatement, “fucking awesome”.)</p>
<p>The sonar team had produced the first detailed maps of several trenches, which Vescovo pledged to share with the Seabed 2030 project, an international effort to map the sea floor. “First people to do Java, San Cristobal, Santa Cruz, Tonga. Even if we do one dive, at least we’ve got something to go on. It does have an extraordinarily high value to it,” Jamieson said. “It’s just a shame,” he added, that they hadn’t done more. Ultimately, Vescovo planned to sell the submarine and the Pressure Drop to a scientific body.</p>
<p>For Lahey and McCallum, the legacy of the expedition wasn’t the records but the Limiting Factor itself. “Victor, he’s a peak bagger. For him, it’s about ‘I got there first, I got there fastest.’ We don’t belittle that, [but] you know, I couldn’t give a shit,” McCallum told me. “The thing that’s important to me is that this is the first time in history that humankind has had a vehicle that can go to any place in the ocean. What it means is that there is now nothing in the ocean that cannot be revisited and recovered.”</p>
<p>In August, the Limiting Factor was scheduled to dive the Molloy Deep, the last of the Five Deeps, in the only ocean it hadn’t yet explored: the Arctic. Afterwards, the ship would sail to London for a congratulatory ceremony at the Royal Geographic Society. There the crew would disperse: Jamieson and Stewart to write up their discoveries, the Triton contingent to work on commercial submarines, McCallum to his next client. Vescovo was already thinking about another adventure.</p>
<p>Those who make history often find that returning to normality takes the greatest toll. Buzz Aldrin talked of “the melancholy of all things done”. Vescovo claimed not to be interested in fame. “I’m not on Facebook, not on Instagram, not into social media. I don’t understand why people are,” he said. He seemed to crave a less transient form of recognition. The site of Vescovo’s dive in the Southern Ocean was previously unmapped, and, in keeping with oceanographic tradition, Vescovo hoped to name it the Factorian Deep, after his submarine – finally putting his achievement on the maps that he’d loved as a boy.</p>
<p>“I was raised Episcopalian, but I’m probably more Zen Buddhist,” he told me. The ship’s mess, which Vescovo had decorated with old film posters – “Submarine”, “20,000 Leagues under the Sea” – was deserted. The ship rocked quietly. “I know that everything is impermanent. I know immortality isn’t celebrity and so therefore I do not seek it. Instead, I seek what I can hold, which is the experience of doing all these things. I desire to live intensely.”</p>
<p>Vescovo, who has lost both parents and an older sister, thinks about mortality a lot. “So many people in this world, they don’t know it, but they’re half asleep. They’re seeking to be comfortable. That’s not enough. I want to be awake. I’m not here very long, and I’m going to die one day, and I don’t want to go through it looking back and going ‘Gosh, I was asleep this whole time.’ I guarantee, you’re in a submarine at 10,000 metres, circuit-breakers going off behind your head, you’re awake. Or flying a helicopter and you do your first autorotation with no power, you are bloody awake. When you’re climbing Everest in the storm, and it is cold, and you’re passing dead bodies and still going up, you are awake.”</p>
<p>There was one last frontier he had yet to visit: space. “There’s Branson, there’s Bezos, and there’s Musk. They’re all close,” he said. Vescovo is far less wealthy than Bezos or Musk. If he does go, it will be in one of their ships, as a paying customer. The next age of discovery will not play out under the flags of nations but the logos of tech billionaires.</p>
<p>“These guys have a ton more money than I do. What I never get is: why didn’t they do it themselves? If I was Musk I would be the first guy in that freakin’ rocket,” he said, excitedly. “I guess they don’t even see themselves as the pilot. I couldn’t see any other way.”•
