<p>Saturday (July 4), Minister Louis Farrakhan used the 4th of July holiday to give his long-awaited speech titled “The Criterion.” In his three-hour address, the 87-year-old leader of The Nation Of Islam spoke on the most pressing affairs that have taken place over the last few months — amely Coronavirus, the onslaught of racism and police brutality in America, and the death of one of his disciples Abdul Hafeez Muhammad.</p>
<p>Throughout his speech, Minister Farrakhan paid tribute to Nation Of Islam leaders who came before him. He also addressed his detractors who have long accused him of being racist and anti-Semitic. Furthermore, he called for President Trump and other world leaders to atone for their sins or else feel an even harsher wrath in the months to come. Farrakhan even warned that this will be his last speech in a long time, but that America is currently experiencing a long overdue reckoning that God has designed to be a purge of wickedness and tyranny.</p>
<p>Check out the key takeaways from Minister Farrakhan’s speech “The Criterion” address below.</p>
<ol>
<li>The passing of Abdul Hafeez Muhammad</li>
</ol>
<p>The Nation of Islam’s Student Minister recently passed away from Coronavirus, which affected Minister Farrakhan, and inspired this message from God. “He is considered to Islam a martyr,” says the leader said.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The dissatisfaction of the world</li>
</ol>
<p>Minister Farrakhan thinks dissatisfaction on earth has reached a fever pitch. “Everywhere you look, 100% of people are dissatisfied,” he proclaimed. “There must be 100% change…There’s a burden the earth is carrying that it must be relieved from. The earth is burdened by the wicked living on a planet that was made for the righteous.”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The USA was never for us</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite what’s in the Declaration of Independence, Farrakhan said America has never been a country by, for, and of the people. “This is a country that was never made with a woman in mind, therefore they had to suffer before voting,” he said. “This country was never made for the slave because they only fashioned us a ⅗ of a human. This country wasn’t made for poor people. It was made for white people of privilege, of scholarship, and who felt they were masters of God’s earth. But, no lesser being deserves that privilege. How did we become lesser beings?”</p>
<p>The minister added that Thomas Jefferson wrote beautiful words in the Declaration of Independence, but his heart wasn’t there to fulfill it. “You can’t say all men are created equal and hold another nation enslaved,” continued Farrakhan. “So, the dog whistle in Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ [really means] ‘Make America White Again.’ That’s why white nationalists are fleeing to his call. The question we have to ask is, ‘Are you a hypocrite, America?’ If you didn’t mean for the black, poor, and woman to enjoy full rights of citizenship, what did you mean?” The leader also warned the powers that be, “You can’t pacify us with a smooth, crooked tongue. We know you. We’ve lived with you over 465 years.”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Farrakhan defends his legacy</li>
</ol>
<p>During his speech, Farrakhan revealed the symbolism behind the white carpet he walked in on, while other public figures tend to walk on red ones. “It’s because in the 65 years of his studentship under Elijah Muhammad, he claimed, “I’ve never shed the blood of another human being to get where I am today.” Though he has been accused of hate, Farrakhan asserted he has none for anyone. “I represent a God that came with the power to save,” he said.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Coronavirus isn’t over, it’s just beginning</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve only seen the tip of the Coronavirus iceberg, stated Farrakhan: “All of us have witnessed the effects of Coronavirus, which is once again beginning to spike in the U.S.” The leader then warned of Trump and his scientists working toward a cure that “they will not conquer this virus.” He maintained that COVID-19 is a “pestilence” sent from God to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquities (willful sin). Even the most well meaning of us must accept this punishment, as “none of us are without sin.” Farrakhan believes that Trump wants to put a swift end to the virus, so life can return back to normal. But, he added that “we’ll never see what was again. That is over.”</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>A message for Black people working for white institutions</li>
</ol>
<p>Throughout his speech, Farrakhan said white people have a heritage of tyranny. “White people, wherever you found them, are the same way they’ve always been by nature. Wherever they are in relationship to people of color, they dominate with tyranny. Even if it’s a suggestion, they can’t handle Black intelligence. So, in order to hold onto your job, you have to hide your growth. Once you let them know your intelligence, they’ll move you out,” he said.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Farrakhan addresses accusations of anti-semitism:</li>
</ol>
<p>The Nation Of Islam leader addressed longstanding claims that he dislikes Jewish people. “They tell lies to make you think I am a bigot or anti-semite, so that you won’t listen to what I’m saying. So far they’ve been pretty successful,” he said in his address. “Now I have to bring up the thing I’m doing that makes me so hated. Members of the Jewish community were given the Torah by Moses. 300 years from the birth of Jesus, the civilization of Moses was broken. A man named Nimrod and Jewish scholars wrote a word called the [Talmud]. They made that word in their minds and in their believers minds greater than God’s word.” Farrakhan also recalled Jewish comedian Chelsea Handler being slammed by the Jewish community for posting a video of his. He said it was not the Jews, but “imposters” who came down on her. He thanked Handler for posting his teachings, and encouraged her to pursue more truth. “Go back and listen to more of Farrakhan and get to know me,” he said. “Not from the mouths of your lying imposter brothers, but from the God within.” Farrakhan concluded, “If you really think I hate the Jewish people, you don’t know me at all. [I’ve never] uttered the words of death to the Jewish people.”</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Farrakhan recalls being poisoned</li>
</ol>
<p>The minister recalled that years ago, news outlets inaccurately reported that he was dead after he’d been poisoned with radiated seeds. “Those who had poisoned me didn’t think I would make it.” he said, while thanking Allah for keeping him alive. “I should be dead by what they gave me, but successfully I toured the earth. [I’ve been to] five continents. Here I stand.” He also alluded that his health is in good standing, saying, “Death isn’t in the cards for me just yet.”</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Black people should not readily accept future Coronavirus vaccines</li>
</ol>
<p>Farrakhan warned Black and Brown people not to get the Coronavirus vaccination when it becomes available, as America has a track record being untrustworthy in regards to our health. “I say to my brothers and sisters in Africa&hellip;if they come up with a vaccine, be careful,” he told the audience. “Do not take their medications. We need to call a meeting of our skilled virologists, epidemiologists, and students of biology and chemistry. We need to give ourselves something better. There are 14 therapies we can treat it with. The virus is a pestilence from Heaven. The only way to stop it is going to heaven.” He also added that there’s a larger agenda at play to lessen the population. “They’re plotting to give 7 billion 500 million people a vaccination. Dr. Fauci, Bill [and Melinda] Gates, you want to depopulate the earth. What the hell gives you that right?” the leader questioned. To those who think they’ll die without the vaccine, Farrakhan declared, “You’re sure to die now. They [just] want a quicker death.”</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>The end of a tyrannical era</li>
</ol>
<p>Farrakhan addressed not only President Trump, but also Chinese president Xi Jinping that the days of tyranny are over. “People are rising against all tyrants. So be careful Mr. Xi,” he said. “You may have a presidency for life in China, but you aren’t the master of life. I represent [God] the master of life.” Farrakhan stated that if both leaders want to end the virus, they must recall their sins.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Farrakhan admits that he asked God to make Florida the epicenter of Coronavirus</li>
</ol>
<p>The Nation of Islam leader said, just as he prayed, Florida is becoming the epicenter of Coronavirus. He asked for this to take place because the state stands in the way of our access to Cuban doctors, who have already helped Wuhan, China recover from the pandemic. “Don’t we need something that Cuba has? Yet we have an embargo on Cuba,” He declared. “We want our Cuban doctors to look after us. We don’t trust you [America doctors.].”</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Farrakhan addresses accusations of racism</li>
</ol>
<p>Farrakhan says he isn’t a bigot, rather a lifelong activist for the advancement of Black people. He affirmed, “The same way a person dedicates their life to the violist, [I am a racist in that] I’ve dedicated my life to Black people first and foremost. I have a solid record of love for Black people.”</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Police brutality and George Floyd</li>
</ol>
<p>Farrakhan addressed the officers who killed George Floyd and the system that allowed it to happen. “[They knocked on his window] over a so-called counterfeit money,” he said. “Well, you make the drugs, guns and counterfeit dollars. So, if there’s any counterfeit money in the hood, you put it there as a trap for us.” Farrakhan also told our nation’s mayors and governors to “stop your police from going to Israel to learn how to kill better. Your days of killing us without consequence are over!”</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Defense of the American flag</li>
</ol>
<p>Farrakhan urged us not to disrespect the American flag, even though we’ve caught “pure hell” under it because we’re coming out of it with great substance.

<h3 id="what-is-fox-soul-tv-and-is-it-broadcasting-a-july-4th-speech-by-louis-farrakhan">&ldquo;What Is Fox Soul TV? And Is It Broadcasting a July 4th Speech by Louis Farrakhan?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.haarets.co.il/image/fetch/x_0,y_61,w_2200,h_1278,c_crop/q_auto,h_698,w_1200,c_fill,f_auto/fl_lossy.any_format.preserve_transparency.progressive:none/https://www.haaretz.co.il/polopoly_fs/1.7220573!/image/3691917060.jpg" alt="img">
On Thursday, a Twitter account representing a network called Fox Soul TV announced that it would be broadcasting a speech by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on July 4.</p>
<p>Farrakhan is a longtime, vehement anti-Semite.</p>
<p>The Fox Soul tweet was circulated over the weekend, then denounced by several public figures on Monday, including CNN anchor Jake Tapper.</p>
<p>Nation of Islam leader @LouisFarrakhan is a vile, antisemitic bigot. His message of hate has no place on our nation&rsquo;s airwaves.</p>
<p>We are pleased that @FOXSOULTV has done the right thing and removed him from their programming schedule.https://t.co/CnKW58hrDg — American Jewish Committee (@AJCGlobal) June 29, 2020 pic.twitter.com/jIgjYsqk0h — foxsoultv (@foxsoultv) June 29, 2020</p>
<p>“Farrakhan is a vile anti-LGBTQ anti-Semitic misogynist,” Tapper tweeted.</p>
<p>By Monday afternoon, the Fox Soul tweet was deleted. Later in the day, Fox Soul announced in another tweet that it would not be airing the Farrakhan speech and instead would broadcast a program featuring speeches from Black leaders throughout American history. It did not say anything further about the programming change.</p>
<p>Through it all, many who followed the story wondered: What is Fox Soul?</p>
<p>It’s a streaming TV channel launched earlier this year by 20th Century Fox focused on reaching Black Americans. It airs new programs every evening and has approximately 41,000 followers on Facebook, 70,000 on Instagram and fewer than 2,000 on Twitter.</p>
<p>“The programs aim to celebrate Black culture and deal with real topics that impact the everyday lives of the Black community through frank and insightful dialogue with local and national influencers,” according to the network’s tweet Monday.</p>
<p>Farrakhan has been discussed at least one other time this month on the channel. During a June 2 panel, R&amp;B singer-songwriter Syleena Johnson called him “one of the most prolific and prominent leaders in my life.”</p>
<p>“To me, I hope that Minister Farrakhan is able to make an impact because in my eyes, this is my personal experience, he has been the only one who has organized black men and has promoted black men in such a singular way,” Johnson said. “He has focused on us much like Malcolm X. We need a Minister Farrakhan right now.”</p>
<p>Farrakhan, who has led the Nation of Islam, a Black Muslim group, since 1977, has a long history of anti-Semitic comments. He has praised Adolf Hitler, repeated longtime stereotypes about Jewish control and manipulation, referred to Jews as “termites” and repeatedly denounced what he calls the “Synagogue of Satan.” He was banned from Facebook last year for his hate speech and was un-verified on Twitter, where he has tweeted only once since 2019.</p>
<p>The Nation of Islam will be livestreaming his speech on its website. According to the preview video, the speech appears to focus on the historical sins of the United States in killing Native Americans and enslaving Black people, and the “unraveling of this great nation.”</p>
<p>The cover image for the video, a photo illustration, shows Farrakhan in front of two groups of people. One of them is of three world leaders: President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister.

<p><img src="https://chicagocrusader.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/07/MINISTER-JULY-4.jpg" alt="img">
The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam will deliver a major message July 4 concerning the current state of affairs in America, the world, the coronavirus global pandemic and other critical subjects.</p>
<p>Minister Farrakhan’s message, “The Criterion,” will be delivered on Independence Day, which also marks the 90th anniversary of the existence of the Nation of Islam in America. It will be his first public address since February.</p>
<p>His critical guidance and divine warning are of particular importance for President Trump, international leaders and the leaders of global faith communities. The world has entered a final period of divine reckoning, and a coming famine, said Minister Farrakhan.</p>
<p>“The judgment is not approaching; it is present,” he warned. His message, Saturday, July 4, will be available at <a href="http://www.noi.org">www.noi.org</a> and Final Call Radio via <a href="http://www.finalcall.com">www.finalcall.com</a>. The message will air at 11 a.m. EDT, 10 a.m. CDT, 8 a.m. PDT, and at 16:00 Greenwich Mean Time for the United Kingdom, Europe and international audiences.</p>
<p>“This message will not just be for Muslims; it is not just for Christians; it is not just for Jews, it is for every inhabitant of this planet,” said Minister Farrakhan.</p>
<p>“I say to you with deep humility from the 25th Surah of the Qur’an: ‘Blessed is He Who sent down the Discrimination upon His servant that he might be a warner to the nations,’ ” the Minister added. The 25th Surah or Chapter of the Holy Qur’an is titled, “Al-Furqan” or “The Discrimination/The Criterion,” meaning to discern or distinguish truth from falsehood.</p>
<p>This is not an ordinary time, Covid-19 is not an ordinary virus and we will not get out of this easily, he cautioned. The country is divided, and people are angry, the Minister noted. God Himself is upset, Minister Farrakhan said.</p>
<p>On July 4, 1930, Master Fard Muhammad—the teacher of the Hon. Elijah Muhammad, patriarch of the Nation of Islam—made himself known in North America. He fulfills prophecy and, as the Hon. Elijah Muhammad taught, represents the coming of God in Person, the Great Mahdi of the Muslims and the long-awaited Messiah of the Christians.

Ice Cube is having some issues with journalists, including CNN’s Jake Tapper for calling Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan an anti-Semite, and the rapper called them out on social media.</p>
<p>On Monday, Tapper tweeted that “Farrakhan is a vile anti-LGBTQ anti-Semitic misogynist. Why is a Fox channel airing his propaganda?”</p>
<p>The Jewish anchor’s post was in response to the announcement that Fox Soul TV would be broadcasting a speech by Farrakhan on July 4. The channel has since canceled the broadcast.</p>

<p>In response, Ice Cube tweeted the same day, “Watch your mouth Jake.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Wednesday, he posted an image of a cease-and-desist order against journalists Charles Nash of Mediaite and Marlow Stern of the Daily Beast for publishing “outrageously false unverified, and disparaging allegations regarding Ice Cube,” whose given name is O’Shea Jackson. Above the letter he wrote “Don’t play with me. This is just phase one.”</p>
<p>The letter sent from a Los Angeles law firm specifically refers to “the ridiculous, false accusation that Ice Cube ordered his ‘entourage to beat up a rabbi,’ was sued for it, and that he is anti-Semitic.”</p>
<p>Last month, the Daily Beast published an article by Stern titled “Ice Cube’s long, disturbing history of anti-Semitism.” In an article published Monday on the Mediaite website, Nash repeated the claims, citing the Daily Beast article.</p>

<p>“The idea that Ice Cube is anti-Semitic is laughable, as anyone who knows the man can attest,” the lawyer letter says. “Ice Cube has no biases against any race, creed, color, ethnicity, religion or gender. His tolerance for all peoples is exactly why he was invited to be the emcee at the national tribute dinner of the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Museum of Tolerance in April 2017.”</p>
<p>Also in June, Ice Cube tweeted a mural some have called anti-Semitic, and days later tweeted images associated with multiple conspiracy theories against Jews, including that they control the world.
