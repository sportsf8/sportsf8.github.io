<p>A Tennessee woman and her beloved pitbull were reunited Sunday morning in Philadelphia after being separated for four years.</p>
<p>Jodi Chamlee says she lost her dog, Gucci, while she was moving with her husband and daughter from Georgia to Tennessee. A loud noise startled at a rest stop startled Gucci and she ran away.</p>
<p>After searching through rescues, Chamlee says she tracked down the facility that found Gucci but they had already shipped her to New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I searched through hundreds and thousands of pictures a day,&rdquo; Chamlee said.</p>

<p>The search for Gucci continued for years, until this week when Marvin and Jessica Graaf with the Philly Bully Team pulled her from euthanization.</p>
<p>Gucci, now 15-years-old, required immediate medical care for bad skin, walking issues, and a distended stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sucker for old dogs, so I said &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s pick this one up and get it to the hospital&rsquo;,&rdquo; Graff said.</p>
<p>ACT Philly connected the Graafs with Chamlee, who was able to identify and discuss specific markings on Gucci that confirmed she was the owner. Chamlee also kept all of Gucci&rsquo;s medical records.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously at first I was like &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no way&rsquo;,&rdquo; Marvin Graaf said.</p>
<p>While Gucci will require medical attention and is a senior dog, the Chamlees dropped everything and drove up to Philadelphia in the middle of a pandemic to be reunited with their long lost friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The family is finally back together, it has not been the same,&rdquo; Chamlee said.</p>

<h3 id="rupauls-drag-race-recap-pitbull-said-gay-rights-except-for-sherry">&ldquo;‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Recap: Pitbull Said “Gay Rights, Except For Sherry!”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://junkee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-17-at-12.38.31-pm.png" alt="img">
Any of the top three could take it - and they all deserve it too.</p>
<p>Despite everything — COVID-19, Sherry Pie, Rock M. Sakura going home second — RuPaul’s Drag Race S12 has been such a delight.</p>
<p>Wholesome, too. While it might not make for the most entertaining Untuckeds, these queens have (Brita and Aiden aside) been wholly supportive of each other throughout the competition.</p>
<p>In S6, Bianca Del Rio didn’t have an issue with helping a queen because, well, she was leagues above everyone: here, the queens have, for the most part, felt so distinct from one another that that competitive edge hasn’t really come out. It really has been RuPaul’s Best Friends Race.</p>
<p>We couldn’t blame you for giving up on Untucked, but this week’s is worth a watch: the lovefest is a testament to the cast’s self-assuredness. While a feud makes for good TV, there’s something to be said for how incredibly supportive the S12 queens have been of one other (for the most part). Competing with yourself makes a lot of sense — as RuPaul says this episode, “know yourself and bring it to every challenge” is really Drag Race‘s mantra, alongside “you’re born naked…”, “frack city frack city” and “no trans girls!”</p>
<p>With [redacted’s] disqualification, the top three — Gigi, Jaida, Crystal — have all brought themselves to the show, though despite Gigi’s four challenge wins, it almost feels like it’s down to Jaida or Crystal.</p>
<p>Related &lsquo;RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race&rsquo; Recap: Selfish Sherry Steals The Show, And Dermatologists Hate Her!</p>
<p>After coming out of the gates strong, Gigi has struggled in the latter half of S12 — maybe more in the public eye than the show, as viewers seemed to sour on her. We get it: to throw out a RuPaul neologism, she hasn’t really had that vulnerable moment to endear her to the audience.</p>
<p>Back at S12’s first episode, I wrote that Gigi was almost a “little too clean”, and as weeks have gone on, it’s clear that Sasha Belle passed over that code she cracked. Gigi’s been very prepared for Drag Race, down to her (quite funny, at first) robotic characters and even facial expressions on the runway: it’s excellence, for the most part, but not much of it has felt very spontaneous.</p>
<p>In the second half, we’ve seen that falter, as she repeated ideas or characters that previously worked — but hey, she was literally 21 when they filmed this, an age where most people (me) repeat the same two anecdotes again and again in hopes people like them.</p>
<p>Gigi is an amazing queen, and this week’s challenge win puts her “track record” (each season seems to use a different expression for challenge wins) on par with Shea Coulée and Sharon Needles, the only other queens who have won four maxis in a regular season. The fact she can feel a little ‘inauthentic’ (kind of a ridiculous term for a drag queen, but RuPaul’s bullshit pop-psychology has fracked through my skull) is a sign of her skill to come — and if she won, she’d only flourish off the show into a favourite, like other young winners Aquaria and Violet.</p>
<p>But it just wouldn’t be that exciting, would it? Crystal would be: after S11 was essentially 14 episodes of Yvie Oddly saying “in case you haven’t noticed, I’m weird“, Crystal doesn’t overplay her oddness. She just delivers it — in terms of the show, at least, there’s a freshness to what she does, which is impressive for a S12 queen.</p>
<p>Week by week, it’s impossible to know what she’s going to plate up: and, since the Madonna Rusical, it’s been a delight to watch.</p>
<p>Then there’s Jaida, who is just as polished as Gigi, but has a distinct presence. We haven’t really had many ‘pageant’ queens win the show (Bebe? Chad? Trinity?), but Jaida is the real deal.</p>
<p>For some reason, the show hasn’t highlighted this, but Jaida’s made every single outfit she’s worn (bar the tulle runway). The excellence and poise hasn’t gained her the same rabid fanbase as Gigi, but it should have.</p>
<p>She’s been silly, sexy, dumb, absurd and completely glamorous week in, week out — once again, we have a talented POC ‘pageant’ girl enter the end of the competition a little overlooked. A’Keria and Asia before her were also all of the above, but are relatively forgotten in the fan base’s memory in favour of white fashion queens.</p>
<p>Take the mirror conversation from this week, where Jackie says she thought Gigi was a “campy costume” queen on first impressions. Gigi acts jokingly indignant but later describes herself as “pure camp” on the runway. And she’s not wrong. Her looks are a pastiche of pop culture — Heathers, Scooby-Doo and this week, Never Been Kissed — presented with a high fashion air, but they’re pretty cartoony.</p>
<p>The costume critique never lands her way, though, because of her body type and persona — we trust her with these looks and references where we wouldn’t a POC queen, or someone less svelte. It doesn’t take away from Gigi to point it out: it’s more that the whole idea of a ‘costumey’ look is vague and besides the point (they’re drag queens…), and has become something of a cover-all to complain against ‘something’ we don’t like about a queen.</p>
<p>We’re pretty far into this recap, and I haven’t even mentioned the episode. There’s a reason: it was, as the final challenges often are, pretty boring.</p>
<p>Do You Like Doggy Chow? I Love Doggy Chow</p>
<p>This week’s challenge is based around RuPaul’s Drag Race Live, which launched January in Las Vegas, and features the likes of Yvie, Vanjie, Shannel, Aquaria, Coco Montrese and Asia O’Hara. This isn’t merely a product placement or a song remix: this is full-scale product cross-integration, even down to the showgirls mini-challenge.</p>
<p>It also kind of sucks. On their Race Chaser podcast, Willam has said the show’s ‘storyline’ songs are a real drag — and that’s what we get this episode. There’s something to be said about transforming the genuine growth and traumas of the queens into some generic musical about The Power Of Drag. It’s all very clinical.</p>
<p>Still, the queens did it really well. Really, really well: if the writing wasn’t on the wall for Jackie, it would’ve been hard to tell who was heading home. They each recorded a rap, sung, and learnt choreo from Jamal Sims, and there’s not a single queen who doesn’t stress out at some point.</p>
<p>Jackie and Crystal end up in the bottom this week for no real reason: Crystal does seem a little low energy in the challenge, but the judges don’t bring it up. Before they perform, the queens enjoy a cocktail from Mickey’s Hollywood, and exemplify the strange, chaotic energy of drinking with friends over Zoom.</p>
<p>Then Mr. 305/Mr. Worldwide said gay rights on the floor, and Crystal and Jackie didn’t disobey. While Pitbull’s music triggers memories of being 18 and going to the Sydney’s worst clubs and pretending it’s fun, I’ve been so nostalgic for any night out that I’ve found myself singing ‘On The Floor’ ever since.</p>
<p>Crystal stays, if not mostly because it was Jackie’s third time lipsyncing. She definitely held her own, but Jackie’s proven to be a surprising lip-sync assassin. To be fair, there is something very nerdy about memorising all the words to a Pitbull song — it’s exactly what someone would do to prove they’re cool.</p>
<p>And then, the most glorious moment of all-time: RuPaul saying congratulations to the top four, then asking if we were Team Crystal, Team Gigi or Team Jaida. I gasped.</p>
<p>We finally have confirmation that the next two episodes will be filmed online. The reunion could be fun, though it seems unlikely they’ll address Sherry in any substantial way, which is a shame — it’d be nice, almost, to hear these queens be candid about their disappointment and frustration.</p>
<p>But the lip-sync finale? Given what queens have been offering up from their homes, it could be amazing. Hopefully no-one tries to jump off a car like Laganja, or we might witness the one and only time ‘death drop’ is actually the right term.</p>
<p>RuPaul’s Drag Race is streaming on Stan, with new episodes dropping each Saturday 1pm. All Stars 5 and Canada will also be on Stan as they air, starting June 5 and July 3, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="college-signings-farrells-x-c-track--field-teams-sending-8-off-to-the-next-level">&ldquo;College signings: Farrell’s X-C, Track &amp; Field teams sending 8 off to the next level&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.silive.com/resizer/vozspnghbihw5zjTdBPugMK6FXE=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/NHW2HJYJ5FGB3ENG24JH6KG44E.jpg" alt="img">
Monsignor Farrell’s Cross Country and Track &amp; Field teams enjoyed strong seasons during the 2019-20 school year and, not surprisingly, a number of the competitors that helped make the Lions successful have decided to continue their careers on the college level.</p>
<p>The Lions, in fact, won the Staten Island championship; place third in the CHSAA Sectional championship and second in the CHSAA Intersectional championship in Cross Country last fall. The Oakwood school followed up those finishes with a second-place finish in the Island championship and third-place finish in the CHSAA Sectional championship during the Indoor Track &amp; Field season.</p>
<p>Seven of Farrell’s eight student-athletes that have decided to compete collegiately are going to Division 1 schools in the fall. Four, in fact, are going to the same college.</p>
<p>Six of the eight college-bound athletes competed on both the X-C and Track &amp; Field teams at Farrell while the other two took part on just the Track &amp; Field team (one runner, one field competitor).</p>
<p>This is the 10th edition of College Signings this school year.</p>
<p>SILive.com will once again share the good news in the following report.</p>
<p>And, once again, we have a number of past signings in recent months at the bottom. Give another look at them as well, if you wish.</p>
<p>Monsignor Farrell senior Anthony Bentivegna was Staten Island&rsquo;s Indoor champion in the 3,200-meter run this season. (Staten Island Advance/Jason Paderon)</p>
<p>Anthony Bentivegna, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Bentivegna signed a National Letter of Intent to attend Wagner College on a partial athletic/partial academic scholarship.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old was instrumental in Farrell’s success in both Cross Country and Track &amp; Field over the course of his three-year varsity career and is expected to make an impact the next four years with the Division 1 Seahawks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to stay close to home,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Bentivegna. &ldquo;I really like Wagner. I liked the guys on the team and got to speak to coach (Joe Stasi), who thinks I would be helpful in Cross Country and as a distance runner (in track).&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bentivegna résumé speaks for itself. He was CHSAA city champion and Staten Island Indoor champion in the 3,200-meter run (two miles) and runner-up in the Catholic state X-C championships. In addition, the Staten Island X-C first-team All Star was also a medalist at the state X-C Federation meet.</p>
<p>His personal bests in X-C include a 12:49 on the 2.5-mile course at Van Cortlandt Park and 15:53 on the traditional 5K course. On the track, his bests includes a 9:35 in the 3,200 and a 4:31 in the mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach (Stasi) said he puts the best seven (varsity 7) on the line in cross country,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Bentivegna. &ldquo;I’m definitely hoping to (crack the top 7) right away and I’m planning to continue training hard over the summer. I think I can step up to the challenge and build into the (new) type of training and adapt to the college level quickly.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wagner is coming off back-to-back NEC Cross Country and Indoor titles and Bentivegna believes the stiff competition will make him better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have some good runners,&rsquo;&rsquo; the Oakwood resident said. &ldquo;And I like the idea of training with people that are better than me, it’s only going to help me.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bentivegna is planning to major in Education with a focus on mathematics. He also received Division 1 interest from Marist and Manhattan.</p>

<p>Mike Brannick, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Brannick signed a National Letter of Intent to attend Wagner College on a partial athletic/partial Academic scholarship.</p>
<p>The two-year varsity competitor, who was primarily a middle distance runner in track, said he applied for Wagner late, but things fell into place with the Division 1 Seahawks rather quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was actually one of the last places I applied to, but once i did I heard from them in 3-4 days and then I spoke to coach (Joe) Stasi and it all happened qucikly,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the 18-year-old, who learned a lot about the Grymes Hill school during virtual meetings on Zoom. &ldquo;Competing at the Division 1 level is a lot on your plate, but running holds a special place in my life. I continue to try and get better every day and I’m happy I can do it for another four years with (three) guys I’m graduating from Farrell with.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Brannick’s personal bests in Cross Country include a time of 14:10 at Van Cortlandt Park’s 2.5-mile course and 17:00 (Island championships) on the traditional 5K course. In addition, he turned in personal bests of 2:05 in the 800 and 4:49 in the mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I signed the Letter of Intent, coach Stasi got in touch with me right away and said he’s looking forward to working with me,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the Annadale resident. &ldquo;He thinks I can be a component that can add to the team’s success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(In addition competing on the track team), I’m planning on running cross country as a freshman, then i’ll reevaluate with (coach Stasi) afterwards to see what’s best for me.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Brannick, who is undecided on a major, said he also received interest from DeSales, Pace, Sacred Heart and the College of Staten Island.</p>

<p>Mike Ciuffo, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Ciuffo is planning to continue his running career at Mount St. Mary College in Newburgh, N.Y., in the fall.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old, who competed on both Farrell’s Cross Country and Track &amp; Field teams, will do the same with the Division 3 Knights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really liked the school &ndash; I felt comfortable there,&rsquo;&rsquo; Ciuffo said. &ldquo;It was the best fit for me and I have a good feeling about going there.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The two-year varsity competitor had personal best times of 14:57 on Van Cortlandt Park’s 2.5-mile course and 18:26 on the 5K course. In addition, the middle distance runner clocked personal bests of 1:30 (600 meters), 2:09 (800) and 5:10 (mile).</p>
<p>Ciuffo, whose brother John is a sophomore on the Lions’ track team, said he submitted his times to MSM coach Fred Callo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He’s excited to have me on the team,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the Huguenot resident. &ldquo;He’s working on a workout plan for me for the summer and in the meantime, I’ve been going on long runs with my brother to get ready.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ciuffo, who is planning on majoring in Biology with an eye toward pre-med, also received interest from Virginia Wesleyan.</p>

<p>Mario Montuori, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Montuori will continue his running career on the next level after he signed a National Letter of Intent to attend Sacred Heart University on a partial academic scholarship.</p>
<p>The Westerleigh resident was a three-year varsity competitor on both the Lions’ Cross Country and Track &amp; Field teams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m really happy about joining a Division 1 program,&rsquo;&rsquo; Montuori said. &ldquo;I like Sacred Heart a lot. I talked to the coach (Christian Morrison) after making my official visit and it all worked out.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Montuori, who was instrumental during the Lions’ 9th place X-C finish at the Eastern States championships, was a second-team Staten Island All Star last fall. In addition, he registered personal best times of 4:36 in the mile and 2:05 in the 800-meters race.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old said he’s planning to go full throttle as he prepares for the collegiate level in both sports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to (Morrison) about training (at that level) to see what it’s like,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said. &ldquo;I’m going to keep working hard and stay motivated to get better &ndash; pretty much the same thing I did at Farrell.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Montuori, who is planning to major in Computer Science, also received interest from Wagner College.</p>

<p>Dean Niosi, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Niosi will continue his track career on the next level after signing a National Letter of Intent to attend Manhattan College on a partial athletic/partial academic scholarship.</p>
<p>The Eltingville resident, a top-notch sprinter who competed on varsity the last three seasons, said things came to fruition with the Division 1 Jaspers after signing up on a recruiting website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Manhattan) saw the potential I have and reached out to me,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Niosi. &ldquo;I looked into what they have academically and athletically and decided it was the best opportunity for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m very excited. When I entered high school I never thought I’d come out a Division 1 (competitor),&rsquo;&rsquo; he added. &ldquo;All my hard work has paid off and I’m looking forward to proving myself more in college.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Niosi’s superb year included being an Indoor medalist in both the 55 and 300-meter run at both the Staten Island and CHSAA Sectional championships. In addition, he was a part of the Spring Medley Relay team that qualified for the Indoor Nationals.</p>
<p>Among his best times were 6.67 in the 55 and 22.9 in the 200.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old Niosi said Track &amp; Field coach Kerri Gallagher believes a tweak in his technique will make him better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One little thing at the start that can help me get to the next level,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said, noting he’s been working on speed in his backyard and swimming pool. &ldquo;If I take care of the little things, everything will take care of itself.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Niosi, who is planning to major in Mechanical Engineering, also received interest from Binghamton and LaFayette.</p>
<p>Monsignor Farrell&rsquo;s Chris Paxis was Staten Island&rsquo;s cross country champion last fall. (Staten Island Advance/Jason Paderon)</p>
<p>Chris Paxis, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Paxis brings an extensive résumé to the next level after signing a National Letter of Intent to attend Marist College on a partial athletic/partial academic scholarship.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old was an integral part of Farrell’s cross country and track teams and is expected to be the same with the Division 1 Red Foxes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went up (to Poughkeepsie) to check it out and really liked it,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Paxis, who is primarily a middle-distance runner on Farrell’s track team. &ldquo;I met the team. They’re very competitive and it just worked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’ve been grinding for four years and it’s great to be going to a Division 1 school,&rsquo;&rsquo; he added. &ldquo;The hard work has definitely paid off.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Paxis, a Staten Island Cross Country first-team All Star, is not only the reigning Island X-C champion, but also a state Indoor meet qualifier. He also qualified for the Indoor Nationals as a member of Farrell’s Sprint Medley Relay.</p>
<p>His personal best at Van Cortlandt Park’s 2.5-mile course is 13:06 and the middle distance specialist also recorded personal bests of 1:57 in the 800-meter run and 4:24 in the mile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Coach Pete Colaizzo) told me I can make an impact right away and that they’d love to have me,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the Richmond resident. &ldquo;It felt good to hear that. To be a freshman and for (Colaizzo) to think I’ll be able to compete against some guys that are 3-4 years older than me right away was nice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I have a lot of work ahead of me,&rsquo;&rsquo; the three-year varsity competitor added. &ldquo;The training program is lot different (than high school). It’s definitely harder, but I think I’m ready for the challenge.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Paxis, who is planning to major in Accounting, also received Division 1 interest from Bucknell, Lehigh, Manhattan and Binghamton.</p>
<p>Monsignor Farrell senior Paul Siconolfi was the Indoor champion in the mile last season. (Staten Island Advance/Jason Paderon)</p>
<p>Paul Siconolfi, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Siconolfi is another Lion that will be competing on the Division 1 level in Cross Country and track as he signed a National Letter of Intent to attend Wagner College on a three-quarters athletic/academic scholarship.</p>
<p>The three-year varsity runner said things started to come to fruition concerning Wagner after long-time Seahawks coach Joe Stasi saw him win the mile in the Staten Island Indoor championships earlier this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I established a relationship with coach, toured the campus and signed two weeks ago,&rsquo;&rsquo; the Westerleigh resident said. &ldquo;(Stasi) said I’d definitely be a big part of the team. They’re graduating a lot of seniors and he thinks I can help the guys returning from their back-to-back (Northeast Conference) championships in both Cross Country and Indoors.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Staten Island X-C first-team All Star registered personal bests of 13:23 on Van Cortlandt Park’s 2.5-mile course and 16:17 on the traditional 5K course. Siconolfi’s personal best times on the track include a 4:35 in the mile and 2:03 in the 800.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old said he’s looking forward to seeing where he stands on the longer 8K and 10K courses on the collegiate level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s going to be a big difference distance wise and I know I’m going to have to change my mindset,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Siconolfi, noting he also has the option of remaining a middle-distance runner or moving up in track. &ldquo;But I’m really excited. I only started running in the beginning of high school and I don’t think I’ve reached my ceiling yet.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Siconolfi, who is planning to major in Business, also received Division 1 interest from Hofstra, Fairfield and Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>Monsignor Farrell senior Anthony Zopich was the Catholic state, CHSAA city and Staten Island Indoor Long Jump champion this season. (Staten Island Advance/Jason Paderon)</p>
<p>Anthony Zopich, Monsignor Farrell</p>
<p>Zopich, a dominant long jumper, signed a National Letter of Intent to attend Wagner College on a full athletic scholarship.</p>
<p>The Oakwood resident admitted to not considering Wagner when he started looking at schools, but when head coach Joe Stasi asked him to visit Grymes Hill, he suddenly had a change of heart for the Division 1 Seahawks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked it a lot during my visit &ndash; more than I thought I would,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Zopich, who toured Wagner in November. &ldquo;I’ve lived on Staten Island my whole life and after seeing it, it was nothing like I thought it would be like. It was completely different (in a good way).</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as competing for a Division 1 school, I always wanted to do that when I was younger, but in basketball,&rsquo;&rsquo; laughed the 6-foot-1 Zopich. &ldquo;It’s anspecial thing (to compete on the Division 1 level) and I’m especially happy to be doing it in track &amp; field. I’m very happy.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Zopich has been exceptional in both the long jump and triple jump, both of which he started competing in as a freshman at Farrell. The four-year varsity competitor is the Catholic state, CHSAA Sectional and Staten Island Indoor champion in the long jump. In addition, he was 6th overall in the state Federation meet and also qualified for the Nationals in the long jump.</p>
<p>His personal best was 22-7 in the long jump and 42-11 in the triple jump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coach (Stasi) liked the way I consistently improved over the course of my four years, especially in the long jump,&rsquo;&rsquo; the 18-year-old said. &ldquo;And I really improved this season. All of the hard work I’ve put in is paying off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I’ll continue to improve competing at a Division 1 facility and I’m ready to (make an impact) right away.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Zopich, who is undecided on a major, also received interest from Hamilton, Scranton and Muhlenberg.</p>

<h3 id="hughes-names-assistant-derrell-black-as-next-boys-basketball-coach-were-gonna-give-it-our-all">&ldquo;Hughes names assistant Derrell Black as next boys basketball coach: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re gonna give it our all&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/06/01/PCIN/d648b474-02d6-441d-a23b-5d8591c06ff5-Derrell_Black_Hughes.jpeg?crop=770,434,x0,y50&amp;width=1600&amp;height=800&amp;fit=bounds" alt="img">
CLOSE</p>
<p>Hughes High School ushered in a new era of Big Red basketball Monday morning when the school announced the hiring of Derrell Black as its next head boys basketball coach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a blessing to be the head basketball coach at Hughes. I&rsquo;ve spent my whole life here,&rdquo; Black told The Enquirer. &ldquo;I never really imagined myself being a head coach, but once I got into the game I fell in love with it. I just really had a passion for it and now I&rsquo;m ready to let it blossom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Black graduated from Hughes in 2009 and played briefly at Trine University in Agnola, Indiana before returning to the University of Cincinnati.</p>
<p>He started his coaching career at Hughes at the junior high level with current Purcell Marian head girls basketball coach Jamar Mosley. After one year, he joined the varsity program as an assistant and was also the head coach of the Hughes freshman team for four years and the junior varsity club for two. In 2017, he helped Hughes capture a CMAC freshman championship and led the junior varsity squad to a pair of winning seasons.</p>
<p>Black will replace Bryan Wyant, who took the head coaching position at Princeton High School in April. Black had high praise for Wyant for his help on and off the court over the last decade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been probably the biggest mentor I&rsquo;ve had in my adult life. He was the coach when I was a senior. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t one of the top basketball players, but I know he pushed me academically to get my degree and go to UC or wherever I could go to get an education,&rdquo; Black said. &ldquo;When I finished my degree, he welcomed me back with open arms and ever since then he&rsquo;s been a role-model to me and has showed me how it&rsquo;s supposed to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wyant spent 12 seasons as the Hughes head coach, compiling a 157-128 record. Hughes went through a renaissance in the last four seasons under Wyant, a period where the Big Red won 80% of their games (82-20), captured three conference titles (two outright) and reached a regional championship game. In that span, Wyant was named the Cincinnati Metro Athletic Conference coach of the year three times and Division II district coach of the year twice.</p>

<p>Black was there for all of it and will use that experience in his new role at the helm of the program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He (Wyant) showed me how a program was supposed to be built from the bottom to the top and how you should stick with somebody even when it&rsquo;s rocky at first,&rdquo; Black said. &ldquo;He was a great mentor and role-model to me and it&rsquo;s an honor to be in a position to keep this ship sailing in the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Black&rsquo;s final two seasons as a player at Hughes in 2008 and 2009, the Big Red finished a combined 19-28. He said he never would have thought the program would reach these new heights, but credits the sustained success to Wyant and people buying into the team&rsquo;s philosophy and strategy, specifically on offense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest issues when we first started implementing our offense was that people thought it was too slow,&rdquo; Black explained. &ldquo;Once they saw that it produced wins and you could still score at a high level running a half-court style offense, they all bought in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only has that offense generated a lot of points (70.1 per game over the last four seasons), but it&rsquo;s produced some of the city&rsquo;s premier players. Three of the last four CMAC athletes of the year have hailed from Clifton Avenue.</p>
<p>Black credits that to a sizable coaching staff that allows more individualized sessions without burning out the team as a whole. He plans to build his staff in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Camron McKenzie, last year&rsquo;s CMAC player of the year, is the key returner to a team that finished 20-6 and made a district championship game appearance. McKenzie averaged 23.8 points and 8.1 rebounds per game as a junior last season with seven double-doubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Camron McKenzie is looking to improve his resume and go down as one of the best players in Hughes history,&rdquo; Black said of his starting guard.</p>
<p>Hughes graduated eight seniors from last year&rsquo;s roster, but Black hopes to see production out of the pieces from last year&rsquo;s junior varsity team that started four freshmen and finished second in the league behind Western Hills. Black also spoke highly of guard Jaesean Martin, who averaged double figures as a sophomore in 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he (Martin) is ready to have a breakout junior season,&rdquo; Black said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t get a lot of the notoriety or the headlines, but he is an absolute workhorse, a pitbull defensively and one of the most talented players on the team.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whomever is on the floor for Hughes, Black is excited to be in the fold as a first-year head coach in arguably the city&rsquo;s toughest conference. Last year, he was an assistant scouting against the league&rsquo;s top talents like Woodward&rsquo;s Paul McMillan IV, Taft&rsquo;s Rayvon Griffith and Aiken&rsquo;s Jakada Stone. Now, he&rsquo;ll be attached to the win-loss record as he looks to keep Hughes near the CMAC&rsquo;s summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that I need to make sure I&rsquo;m on top of my game because every night you play in the CMAC you&rsquo;re playing against one of the top players in the state and there are some great coaching minds,&rdquo; Black said. &ldquo;You really have to do your homework. You can&rsquo;t go out there on Friday night and lay a dud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gonna be a challenge, it&rsquo;s gonna be a battle, but we&rsquo;re gonna give it our all.

<h3 id="pitbull-predicts-carvalho-will-be-champion-but-not-while-hes-on-the-throne">&ldquo;Pitbull predicts Carvalho will be champion, but not while he&rsquo;s on the throne&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Ffansided.com%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F09%2FMG_0426.jpg" alt="img">
Patricio Freire predicts Pedro Carvalho will be champion.</p>
<p>Bellator’s double division champion, Patricio “Pitbull” Freire, checked in with FanSided on Tuesday from his quarantine in Brazil. Freire was originally scheduled to fight Pedro Carvalho on March 13, 2020 but the event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, settled in a beach house in Brazil with his family (including a new baby) Freire is patiently waiting for his return to action, whenever that might be.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of all the topics we discussed.</p>
<p>Patricio Freire has a message for Pedro Carvalho</p>
<p>Freire was set to face Carvalho in the Bellator Featherweight Grand Prix before the coronavirus hit. Now, while he waits for the fight to be rebooked, we asked if he had a message for Carvalho.</p>
<p>Of course, he does.</p>
<p>“Pedro … you are very confident, I actually like that. You’re a good fighter. I’m excited to face you. You’ll probably be champion someday, but that day is not this moment. Not this year, not while I’m here. What you need now is an astounding defeat. What you need now is to get really hurt and broken and that’s exactly what I’m going to do to you.”</p>
<p>Patricio Freire on rewatching his fight with Daniel Weichel at Bellator 138</p>
<p>Freire’s bout with Daniel Weichel at Bellator 138 which will re-air as part of the Bellator Recharged series which airs on CBS Sports Network. He reflected on that bout ahead of the replay this weekend.</p>
<p>“It was one of the very few fights I had an issue with the weight cut. My scale had a difference to the official one and we didn’t have a bathtub, so I ended up suffering a bit more and not going to the fight on my best conditions. I was winning the first round but took a huge shot to the chin with a few seconds left. I guess I was a bit too comfortable there. He got pretty close to finishing me, that’s the closest someone ever got to it. In the second round he tried to rush thinking I was done and I was able to measure his offense and catch him with a counter hook KO. I’m definitely not happy with how that fight went, but I showed everyone of what a champion is made of and it’s a very satisfying win.”</p>
<p>Patricio Freire explains how he’s staying fit in quarantine</p>
<p>Fighters all over the world are creating unique ways to stay in shape, Freire is no different.</p>
<p>“I have my own team and my trainers, they are isolated as well. They only have contact with me and a few other people who have fights booked coming up. Everyone has been doing their isolation as necessary. But I’m not doing any kind of physical contact so I’ve been training, kickboxing, karate, boxing at most my trainer holds pads for me. And strength and conditioning as well, we have a space for that in my gym. But wresting, grappling overall I haven’t been doing this with any person. We have a dummy doll in the gym that I use after practice for some positions. But I have avoided any contact with another person aside from those close in the circle close to me.”</p>
<p>Patricio Freire’s ready to return to the cage</p>
<p>There’s no official date for return to action for Bellator fighters outside of a July target return, which Bellator president, Scott Coker revealed to FanSided a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Freire says he’s heard nothing more about a future fight date.</p>
<p>“Only information that I was the one that everyone has from Scott Coker interview that he said their are plans to return by the end of July. So that’s all that I know so far, nothing official.”</p>
<p>He did say that he was ready, no matter the date Bellator chooses.</p>
<p>“I will be ready. My pre-camp has already been done. I’m doing our work now to maintain all the gains that I’ve had during the camp so I don’t have to start over. And as soon as Bellator gives me the green lights I’ll be ready.”</p>
<p>Patricio Freire isn’t afraid of the coronavirus</p>
<p>Some fighters have voiced their desire to wait until the pandemic has calmed down, especially when traveling to fights is involved. Freire has another way to look at things.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth, we hear in the media that this is the type of virus that everyone will end up getting one way or another. So we can’t really try to control what’s possibly unavoidable things we don’t have control of. So, we just have to take care of ourselves as they say to us such as the masks, hand sanitizers, don’t touch your face and all those things and hope for the best.”</p>
<p>Patricio Freire responds to A.J. McKee’s most recent comments</p>
<p>Ins a recent interview A.J. McKee had some harsh words for the champion. He said he wants to “whip [Patricio’s] ass” something that Freire laughed off.</p>
<p>“My message to him go forward to the tournament, make it up to me and try to do that. This is all that I have to tell you now, everything else, I will show you the ring.”</p>
<p>This interview was done via a translator.

<h3 id="climate-change-burns-its-way-up-the-pop-charts">&ldquo;Climate Change Burns Its Way Up the Pop Charts&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/climate/00cli-popsongs-promo/00cli-popsongs-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Like all good coinages, it’s broadly useful. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University, posted a definition of the word on Twitter: “The bitter pleasure of things going wrong in exactly the way you predicted, but no one believed you when it could have made a difference.”</p>
<p>She added, “I’ve finally discovered the word that describes how nearly every climate scientist feels.” It’s that sense familiar to anyone who works in the field of climate change, or writes about it, of giving warning after warning after warning as the levels of greenhouse gases rise in the atmosphere and the effects of a warming world come in with greater and greater intensity.</p>
<p>Dr. Hayhoe noted in an additional tweet that “there is probably a sizeable number of infectious disease experts and public health professionals who feel the same way,” a reference to scientific experts whose advice and predictions have been disregarded in the coronavirus pandemic. People with other backgrounds began to chime in, as well. “And many an ecologist,” wrote one. “Also, social scientists,” wrote another.</p>
<p>It is important to note one thing that the definition makes clear: the supposedly pleasurable part of Cassandrafreude is anything but. It is a sense, more than anything, of ruefulness, said Harold Feld, senior vice president at Public Knowledge, a technology policy and advocacy group in Washington, who coined the term.</p>
<p>In 2006, he had warned on his blog that an economic meltdown was on its way. In an interview he reminded me that pundits and government officials were still providing “happy talk” about a continued economic boom and a healthy mortgage market. And so, as the Great Recession occurred, he wrote on his blog, “I am experiencing Cassandrafreude.”</p>
<p>“It felt like the fall of Troy must have felt,” he told me. “I was right, and sore about it.” He has used the term many times in his writing since then and, in 2013, created an online page with the definition so that he could link to it whenever he trotted the term out. “It’s a nifty little word,” he said with pride.</p>
<p>I can’t help but agree, even if, in truth, being right about terrible things generally just leaves me miserable.
