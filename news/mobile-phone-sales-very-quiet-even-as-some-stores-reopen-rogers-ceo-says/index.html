<p>TORONTO — Sales of mobile phones have been &ldquo;very quiet&rdquo; and likely won&rsquo;t pick up until customers return to stores and malls that have been temporarily closed due to the pandemic, the head of Canada&rsquo;s largest wireless business said Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t expect the market to re-activate in any material way until the public feels comfortable going to stores, returning to malls,&rdquo; Rogers chief executive Joe Natale said at a virtual conference for the telecommunications and media industries.</p>
<p>article continues below</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re watching that carefully. We&rsquo;re adapting province by province as it&rsquo;s different in each province across the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rogers has opened about 90 stores in each of the past three weeks, Natale said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But volumes are still down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just quiet. Very quiet out there. We&rsquo;ll see what happens as we enter the busier half of the year and people feel more comfortable shopping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BCE chief executive Mirko Bibic, the head of Bell Canada, had said it has had a &ldquo;hodge-podge&rdquo; of experiences with its store re-openings because provinces are at different stages of loosening their pandemic restrictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every day that goes by, it get&rsquo;s a little more active. But it&rsquo;s so early . . . that I can&rsquo;t discern a trend from what we&rsquo;ve seen so far,&rdquo; Bibic said.</p>
<p>Telus chief financial officer Doug French said its retail stores are starting to re-open but noted that the closures had the advantage of reducing churn, which occurs when a carrier loses customers.</p>
<p>French said Telus did see &ldquo;relatively good traction&rdquo; serving customers with its digital sales channels but subscriber additions were down &ldquo;and that will continue to flow through in the second quarter from what we can see today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Analysts have been asking Canada&rsquo;s telecommunications companies whether they&rsquo;ll experience a significant increase in unpaid bills due to the economic impact of the pandemic, which prompted stay-at-home orders and temporary business closures.</p>
<p>Bill payments have been steady at Rogers until now, but higher unemployment levels during the pandemic will likely have an impact, Natale said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our receivable metrics have been holding strong so far. We&rsquo;re seeing a little bit of impact but not a lot yet,&rdquo; Natale said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re starting to see an increase in the number of calls, people calling to talk about bill payments, calling to understand what flexibility they might have. I think we&rsquo;ll see that increase as unemployment rises and that&rsquo;s really a direct reflection of what happens with people&rsquo;s financial position overall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Natale said the slower pace of phone sales has reduced costs for Rogers, which spent about $2 billion in 2019 to subsidize customer phone purchases.</p>

MONTREAL — BCE Inc. executives said Thursday that they are beginning to see early signs that customers are getting ready to emerge from COVID-19 restrictions and Bell Canada is in good position to respond.</p>
<p>MONTREAL — BCE Inc. executives said Thursday that they are beginning to see early signs that customers are getting ready to emerge from COVID-19 restrictions and Bell Canada is in good position to respond.</p>
<p>However, they can&rsquo;t predict yet what measures the company will take to adapt to a post-pandemic environment.</p>
<p>They made the remarks after the Montreal-based company, Canada&rsquo;s largest communications and media business, announced a $680-million profit attributable to common shareholders for the first quarter ended March 31.</p>
<p>BCE and Bell chief executive Mirko Bibic told analysts that overall Bell Media viewership was up 25 per cent as Canadians watched CTV and specialty channels for news and entertainment.</p>
<p>Bibic said even Bell&rsquo;s sport-related services held up, despite a lack of professional events, and thinks viewership will bounce back once events resume.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bibic said he expects a surge in wireless equipment sales, once consumers can return to stores that have been closed since mid-March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sense is those who go out to shop are going out to shop with a purpose, and that&rsquo;s to buy rather than to just browse,&rdquo; Bibic said.</p>
<p>But the outlook for Bell&rsquo;s business customers is more complex, because some small- to mid-size enterprises may be unable to recover fully from the pandemic shut-downs while others may continue to make greater use of communications services by employees, suppliers and clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we have seen an increase in pricing concessions to customers, particularly in the SME space, as well as lower data equipment and business service solutions sales to larger enterprise customers, we also provide critical connectivity services needed to maintain business continuity,&rdquo; Bibic said.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer Glen LeBlanc said that Bell&rsquo;s performance in the early part of the first quarter showed that it was on track to meet 2020 financial estimates, which have now been withdrawn because of COVID&rsquo;s disruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The financial impact of COVID-19 was limited in Q1 as government lockdown measures and related shutdown of businesses only went into effect towards the end of the quarter,&rdquo; LeBlanc said.</p>
<p>He said total service revenue remained positive for the full quarter but product revenue was down 10 per cent compared with a year earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a result of a significant reduction in wireless customer transactions attributable to retail channel disruptions as well as lower business wireline data equipment sales, given last year&rsquo;s strength and the current economic environment,&rdquo; LeBlanc added.</p>
<p>Earlier, BCE Inc. reported its first-quarter profit fell compared with a year ago as the company was hit by derivative losses related to a hedging program, while the pandemic took a bite out of its revenue.</p>
<p>The company said its profit attributable to common shareholders was 75 cents per share, compared with $740 million or 82 cents per share in last year&rsquo;s first quarter.</p>
<p>Operating revenue for the quarter totalled $5.68 billion, down from $5.73 billion as the pandemic affected all of BCE&rsquo;s Bell Canada operating segments.</p>
<p>On an adjusted basis, BCE said it earned 80 cents per share up from 77 cents per share a year ago.</p>
<p>Analysts on average had estimated BCE would earn an adjusted profit of 76 cents per share and nearly $5.68 billion in revenue, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>

<h3 id="tfsa-investors-should-you-buy-bce-tsxbce-stock-for-6-yield">&ldquo;TFSA Investors: Should You Buy BCE (TSX:BCE) Stock for 6% Yield?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://yw553ftvhw1iqegz29fycoyw-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Questions.jpg" alt="img">
The Motley Fool Canada » Dividend Stocks » TFSA Investors: Should You Buy BCE (TSX:BCE) Stock for 6% Yield?</p>
<p>The recent weakness in markets has made BCE (TSX:BCE)(NYSE:BCE) more attractive for investors who want above-average returns for their long-term savings accounts, such as TFSA.</p>
<p>Canada’s largest telecom operator now yields more than 6%, offering one of the best dividend yields one can get from a quality stock in an environment when banks are offering close to zilch. If you’re still confused about buying the BCE stock, here are two points to help make you a decision.</p>
<p>A recession-proof stock</p>
<p>It’s hard to emerge completely unscathed if you’re an equity investor in the type of major downturn that’s taking place after the COVID-19 pandemic. But you can minimize your risk by diversifying your portfolio and adding low-risk dividend-paying stocks to your portfolio.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons to buy telecom utilities, such as BCE, is that they offer a shelter to income investors when the economy slips into a recession. People are highly unlikely to cut their internet and wireless lines, even when they lose their jobs.</p>
<p>BCE has a strong dominant position in Canada’s highly regulated telecom market, where three big players make most of the revenues. BCE, through its diversified service offerings, including wireless, home internet, and media operations, has shown sustained growth in its subscribers.</p>
<p>BCE chief executive officer Mirko Bibic, in a recent earnings call to discuss the company’s first-quarter results, said that the company will keep laying fibre-optic cables to customers’ homes, expanding its fifth-generation wireless networks and providing more high-speed internet service to rural parts of the country, even as it faces short-term financial pressures.</p>
<p>“This is not a time to pull back capital spending on critical network infrastructure,” Mr. Bibic said. “These are healthy investments for the long-term benefit of our company, our customers and our economy.”</p>
<p>Growing dividend</p>
<p>BCE has long maintained a policy of increasing its dividend by 5% annually and has used a series of acquisitions to partly fuel the cash flow growth necessary to keep boosting the payout.</p>
<p>I don’t think BCE’s dividend safety is under threat after the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic. The company will face a temporary slowdown in sales, but it will recover quickly once the virus is contained.</p>
<p>During the first quarter that ended on March 31, BCE revenue rose 5.4% to $3.69 billion from a year ago, as it added more wireless customers.</p>
<p>These factors make BCE stock an attractive option for TFSA investors to consider, despite its recent pullback, especially when its yield is touching 6%.</p>
<p>As per the company’s dividend policy, the company distributes between 65% and 75% of its free cash flow in payouts. In line with this policy, BCE has increased its annual payout by more than 100% since the fourth quarter of 2008; the payout is now at $0.8325 per share, paid quarterly.</p>
<p>If you analyze BCE’s stock performance this year, the stock is down about 8% compared with a 12% plunge in the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index. BCE is a slow-growing investment paying steadily growing dividends while preserving your capital.</p>
<p>Bottom line</p>
<p>Trading at $55.09 at the time of writing, BCE stock has become more attractive for the buy-and-hold TFSA investors. The current weakness creates a good opportunity to buy this stock cheap and earn steady income.

<h3 id="bell-canada-puts-5g-launch-on-hold-due-to-covid-19-ceo">&ldquo;Bell Canada puts 5G launch on hold due to COVID-19: CEO&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rcrwireless.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/5G.jpg" alt="img">
Bell Canada has decided to put on hold the commercial launch of its 5G network due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the company’s CEO Mirko Bibic said during a conference call with investors.</p>
<p>“We are ready with our initial 5G network, but frankly we don’t think that it’s the right time right now to officially launch it for marketing purposes. I just don’t think that customers are paying attention to this right now and that’s not what is top of mind for our customer base. They have other priorities, understandably,” Bibic said.</p>
<p>“As the economy opens up, we’ll have more news on when we will launch our initial 5G services,” he added.</p>
<p>Bell Canada started the construction of its 5G network this year, using equipment from Finnish vendor Nokia.</p>
<p>The executive said that Bell is still waiting for the Canadian government’s decision on the security review of 5G networks. Officials had received pressure from the U.S. government to ban Chinese carrier Huawei from the deployment of 5G networks in the country, over security allegations.</p>
<p>“We waiting for the government’s decision and we will follow all government rules with respect to usage of equipment in our 5G network and as you know, we work with multiple suppliers in our supply chain,” he said.</p>
<p>Bibic has previously said that Bell will continue to enhance 5G access speeds, capacity and coverage as additional 5G wireless spectrum, including in the 3.5 GHz band, becomes available this year through the federal government’s spectrum auction process. Bibic said that the award of that spectrum will allow Canadian carriers to launch more 5G technology in 2021.</p>
<p>Bell reported a net profit of CAD733 million ($526 million) in Q1 2020, down 7. 3% year-on-year, and revenue of CAD5. 68 billion, down 0.9%.</p>
<p>Wireless revenue declined 2.2% to CAD2.03 billion, due to lower product revenue, which was offset partly by higher year-over-year service revenue</p>
<p>During the first quarter of the year, Bell recorded a net addition of 19,595 wireless customers,22,595 broadband customers and 2,852 IPTV customers.</p>
<p>Rival operator Rogers Communications had already begun rolling out 5G network in select cities around Canada using equipment from Swedish vendor Ericsson.</p>
<p>Rogers’ initial 5G cities are Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. The telco said that it will eventually expand into over 20 more markets by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>In a previous conference call with investors Rogers’ CEO Joe Natale said that the company expects to start deploying spectrum sharing technology later this year. The executive said that the deployment of this technology will allow Rogers to use its current 4G spectrum for the provision of 5G.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mobile operator Telus will launch a 5G network in Canada later this year using equipment from Chinese vendor Huawei Technologies, Telus’ CFO Doug French previously said in an interview with the Financial Post.

<p>A little lad from Totnes is enjoying lockdown more than most - in fact you could say he&rsquo;s been having a flipping good time.</p>
<p>Four-year-old Zayne decided to use his love of trampolining to complete 150 backflips - all for a good cause.</p>
<p>When he was about two-and-a-half Zayne began experiencing sensory meltdowns. These are different to tantrums, and occur when a person becomes overwhelmed by their senses.</p>
<p>Zayne&rsquo;s family were keen to find the cause of his difficulties, but were told they faced an 18-month waiting list for any official assessments to be carried out.</p>
<p>So they contacted Bibic, a national charity who support children and young people with conditions affecting their social, communication, sensory, motor and learning abilities. Then things began to change for the better.</p>
<p>Zayne&rsquo;s mum, Jordaine, said: &ldquo;We came across Bibic online, based in Somerset. Within six months of our phone call we were there with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charity gave Zayne and his family professional advice on how to help him at school and how to calm him during meltdowns. He is still awaiting any official diagnoses, but Jordaine said Bibic&rsquo;s help has been wonderful.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;After waiting for so long [on a waiting list] you feel like you&rsquo;re going a bit mad. It was absolutely amazing because there&rsquo;s not a lot of support until they&rsquo;re diagnosed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jordaine said Bibic continued to offer her family support six months after they made their initial phone call, she said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really nice to have somebody there for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: Jordaine Rider)</p>
<p>Zayne is an active little boy who enjoys riding his scooter and doing backflips, so it made sense that he used his trampoline skills to help Bibic.</p>
<p>Jordaine said: &ldquo;He came up with the number of 150 and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if he could do it, but he did. He wanted to do it in a week but he did it in about five or six days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has exceeded his initial fundraising target of £150, but he is hoping he will continue to raise more. Jordaine said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s really, really proud of himself and he&rsquo;s shared it with his teachers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously all charities are struggling at the moment. I know we&rsquo;ve got his target - and Bibic are over the moon - but anything else is so, so appreciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really quite lucky, I&rsquo;d recommend people get in touch with Bibic. What I loved about Bibic was that they said, what can we learn about Zayne and how can we help him?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-crashes-into-canadas-5g-launch-plans">&ldquo;COVID-19 crashes into Canada&rsquo;s 5G launch plans&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.lightreading.com/2020/05/759569/8550.jpg" alt="img">
Rogers launched it with vendor Ericsson in a few cities, but BCE decided to delay its launch with vendor Nokia. Telus, meantime, appears to be waiting in the wings with its own vendor, China&rsquo;s Huawei.</p>
<p>5G was supposed to catapult Canada into a leading global position in the telecom industry, driving a &ldquo;significant improvement as it relates to productivity, innovation, efficiency and importantly digital transformation,&rdquo; at least according to Telus&rsquo; CEO.</p>
<p>And then COVID-19 struck.</p>
<p>Now, like just about everything else in the world, 5G in Canada is on hold while stay-at-home orders stymie the spread of the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready with our initial 5G network, but frankly we&rsquo;ve made  frankly we don&rsquo;t think that it&rsquo;s the right time right now to officially launch it for marketing purposes,&rdquo; explained BCE CEO Mirko Bibic last week during the company&rsquo;s quarterly conference call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript of his remarks. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think that customers are paying attention to this right now and that&rsquo;s not what is top of mind for our customer base. They have other priorities understandably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continued Bibic: &ldquo;As the economy opens up, we&rsquo;ll have more news on that, on when we will launch our initial 5G services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BCE had announced Nokia as its first 5G vendor in February, with promises to launch &ldquo;as next generation smartphones become available.&rdquo; But BCE quietly began selling the Samsung Galaxy S20 5G, Galaxy S20+ 5G and Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G almost the same week Canadian officials issued quarantine orders.</p>
<p>Rogers, on the other hand, started its 5G rollout in January with vendor Ericsson. The company said that in the first phase of its buildout it would deploy 5G in its 2.5GHz spectrum in downtown Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, and that later this year it would expand that effort to include transmissions in 600MHz across broader areas. That effort continues, albeit without much fanfare.</p>
<p>Finally, Telus CEO Darren Entwistle had plenty to say about the potential of 5G for the company and for Canada in February during his company&rsquo;s quarterly conference call with analysts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important to our company as it is to our country and we are going to be extremely thoughtful as we progress through the [5G] roadmap,&rdquo; he said, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript of his remarks.</p>
<p>But in his February comments he declined to provide a concrete 5G launch date: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to pre-announce our 5G launch plans for competitive reasons,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;So when we launch 5G from a network readiness to device availability to see accretion, then the press release will go out that morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the operator&rsquo;s 5G launch certainly appeared imminent in February: &ldquo;Telus will begin rolling out its 5G network shortly, and our initial module will be with Huawei,&rdquo; CFO Doug French told CBC News in February. Canada is still reviewing US claims that Huawei equipment threatens Canadian national security.</p>
<p>So far Telus has not launched 5G, though in April it did tout the performance of its 4G network, reiterating its plan to invest $40 billion over the next three years for 5G.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s 5G difficulties come as network-monitoring company OpenSignal reports that the country now ties with South Korea in terms of speedy wireless networks. The firm said that operators in both countries now provide average wireless download speeds of 59 Mbit/s  making Canada and South Korea tied for the fastest wireless market in the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that the coronavirus pandemic has reportedly delayed South Korean operators&rsquo; push to launch the standalone version of 5G.</p>
<p>Importantly, Canadian executives said that the government is still planning to auction wide swathes of 3.5GHz spectrum for 5G later this year  such spectrum has been hailed as ideal for 5G, and that auction will undoubtedly supercharge 5G offerings in the country.</p>

<h3 id="bell-bien-positionnée-pour-léventuel-déconfinement-jugent-ses-dirigeants">&ldquo;Bell bien positionnée pour l’éventuel déconfinement, jugent ses dirigeants&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://mobile-img.lpcdn.ca/lpca/924x/r3996/0e14b956-9067-11ea-b33c-02fe89184577.jpg" alt="img">
Les dirigeants de BCE disent commencer à observer des signes avant-coureurs que les clients se préparent à émerger des mesures de confinement liées à la pandémie de COVID-19, et estiment que Bell est en bonne position pour en tirer profit.</p>
<p>La Presse canadienne</p>
<p>Cependant, ils ne peuvent pas encore prédire les mesures que l’entreprise prendra pour s’adapter à l’environnement post-pandémique.</p>
<p>Les responsables de l’entreprise montréalaise, la plus grande société de communications et de médias du Canada, s’exprimaient ainsi jeudi, après avoir dévoilé un bénéfice de 680 millions pour le premier trimestre clos le 31 mars.</p>
<p>Le chef de la direction de BCE et de Bell, Mirko Bibic, a indiqué aux analystes que le nombre total de téléspectateurs de Bell Média avait augmenté de 25 % alors que les Canadiens regardaient CTV et les chaînes spécialisées pour s’informer et se divertir.</p>
<p>Même les services de Bell liés aux sports ont tenu bon malgré l’absence d’évènements professionnels, a précisé M. Bibic, qui croit que le nombre de téléspectateurs rebondira une fois que les évènements reprendront.</p>
<p>De même, M. Bibic a indiqué s’attendre à une augmentation des ventes d’équipements sans fil, une fois que les consommateurs pourront retourner dans les magasins fermés depuis la mi-mars.</p>
<p>« Mon impression est que ceux qui vont faire des courses vont faire des courses avec un objectif, celui d’acheter plutôt que de simplement regarder les étalages », a affirmé M. Bibic.</p>
<p>Mais les perspectives pour les clients d’affaires de Bell sont plus complexes, car certaines petites et moyennes entreprises pourraient ne pas être en mesure de se remettre complètement des fermetures liées à la pandémie, tandis que d’autres pourraient continuer à utiliser davantage les services de communications par leurs employés, leurs fournisseurs et leurs clients.</p>
<p>« Bien que nous ayons vu une augmentation des concessions de prix aux clients, en particulier dans le secteur des PME, ainsi qu’un recul des ventes d’équipement de données et de solutions de services auprès de nos clients d’affaires de plus grande taille, nous fournissons également des services de connectivité essentiels au maintien des activités », a précisé M. Bibic.</p>
<p>Le directeur financier, Glen LeBlanc, a souligné que les performances de Bell au début du premier trimestre montraient qu’elle était en voie d’atteindre ses prévisions financières de 2020, qui ont maintenant été retirées en raison de l’incertitude entourant l’épidémie de COVID-19.</p>
<p>« L’impact financier de la COVID-19 a été limité au premier trimestre, car les mesures de confinement du gouvernement et les fermetures d’entreprises ne sont entrées en vigueur que vers la fin du trimestre », a expliqué M. LeBlanc.</p>
<p>Il a indiqué que les revenus totaux de services sont restés positifs pour le trimestre complet, mais que ceux liés aux produits avaient diminué de 10 % par rapport à l’année précédente.</p>
<p>« Ceci est le résultat d’une réduction significative des transactions des clients sans fil attribuable aux perturbations des canaux de vente au détail, ainsi que de la baisse des ventes d’équipements de données filaires d’entreprise, par rapport à la vigueur de l’an dernier et à l’environnement économique actuel », a ajouté M. LeBlanc.</p>
<p>Plus tôt, BCE a affiché un bénéfice du premier trimestre en baisse par rapport à l’an dernier, la société ayant été touchée par des pertes sur instruments dérivés liées à un programme de couverture, alors que la pandémie a pris une bouchée dans ses revenus.</p>
<p>Le bénéfice attribuable aux actionnaires ordinaires s’est établi à 75 cents par action, ce qui se comparait à un profit de 740 millions, ou 82 cents par action, pour le premier trimestre de 2019.</p>
<p>Les revenus d’exploitation pour le trimestre ont totalisé 5,68 milliards, en baisse par rapport à ceux de 5,73 milliards de l’an dernier, la pandémie ayant touché tous les secteurs opérationnels de Bell Canada.</p>
<p>Sur une base ajustée, BCE a fait état d’un profit de 80 cents par action, contre 77 cents par action il y a un an.</p>
<p>Les analystes s’attendaient en moyenne à un bénéfice ajusté de 76 cents par action et à des revenus près de 5,68 milliards, selon les prévisions recueillies par la firme de données financière Refinitiv.
