<p>British actor Sir Ian Holm has died &ldquo;peacefully&rdquo; in hospital at the age of 88.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with great sadness that the actor Sir Ian Holm CBE passed away this morning at the age of 88,&rdquo; his agent Alex Irwin said in a statement on Friday. &ldquo;He died peacefully in hospital, with his family and carer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holm had suffered from a disease related to Parkinson&rsquo;s in recent years, the statement said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His sparkling wit always accompanied a mischievous twinkle in his eye,&rsquo;&rsquo; Irwin said. &ldquo;Charming, kind and ferociously talented, we will miss him hugely.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord of the Rings</p>
<p>Holm secured worldwide fame for his role as Bilbo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson and based on J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s books. He also briefly appeared as the elder Bilbo in parts of the later trilogy, The Hobbit.</p>
<p>His other movie roles included Father Cornelius in The Fifth Element,&rsquo; android Ash in &ldquo;lien,&rsquo; Napoleon Bonaparte in Time Bandits,&rsquo; writer Lewis Carroll in Dreamchild and a royal physician in The Madness of King George.</p>
<p>Holm won a British Academy Film Award and received an supporting actor Oscar nomination for portraying athletics coach Sam Mussabini in the blockbuster 1982 film Chariots of Fire. The actor was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) awards.</p>
<p>In a tweet, BAFTA said it was &ldquo;very sorry&rdquo; to hear of his death.</p>
<p>Excelling on stage</p>
<p>Born in Essex, east of London, in 1931, Holm first established himself as an onstage theater star with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), which he joined in 1958. He also appeared regularly on British TV.</p>
<p>Holm went on to win a Tony Award for best featured actor as Lenny in Harold Pinter&rsquo;s play The Homecoming in 1967.</p>
<p>In 1998, Holm won a Laurence Olivier Award for best actor for his performance in King Lear&rsquo; at the National Theatre in London.</p>
<p>RSC artistic director Gregory Doran called the actor &ldquo;one of the RSC greats.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ian was entirely original. Entirely a one-off,&rdquo; Doran said. &ldquo;He had a simmering cool, a compressed volcanic sense of ferocity, of danger, a pressure cooker actor, a rare and magnificent talent. There&rsquo;s a great spirit gone.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stars pay tribute</p>
<p>American actress and former fashion model Mia Farrow said Holm was &ldquo;among the giants of the theater.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met while working at the RSC…He worked in films and TV, unfailingly brilliant,&rsquo;&rsquo; she tweeted.</p>
<p>British actor and comedian Eddie Izzard tweeted: &ldquo;Wonderful actor and it&rsquo;s so sad to see him go. Farewell, you did great work Sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/holm.jpg" alt="img">
LONDON (AP) — Ian Holm, a versatile British actor whose long career included roles in “Chariots of Fire” and “The Lord of the Rings” has died. He was 88.</p>
<p>FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2012 file photo, actor Ian Holm appears at the premiere of &ldquo;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&rdquo; in London. Holm, the acclaimed British actor whose long career included roles in “Chariots of Fire” and “The Lord of the Rings” has died, his agent said Friday. He was 88. Holm died peacefully in the hospital, surrounded by his family and carer, his agent, Alex Irwin, said in a statement. His illness was Parkinson’s related. (Photo by Jon Furniss/Invision/AP, File)</p>
<p>Holm died peacefully Friday morning in a hospital, surrounded by his family and carer, his agent Alex Irwin said in a statement. His illness was Parkinson&rsquo;s-related.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His sparkling wit always accompanied a mischievous twinkle in his eye,&rdquo; Irwin said. &ldquo;Charming, kind and ferociously talented, we will miss him hugely.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Holm appeared in scores of movies big and small, from costume dramas to fantasy epics. A generation of moviegoers knows him as Bilbo Baggins in &ldquo;The Lord of the Rings&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Hobbit&rdquo; trilogies.</p>
<p>He won a British Academy Film Award and gained a supporting-actor Oscar nomination for portraying pioneering athletics coach Sam Mussabini in the hit 1982 film &ldquo;Chariots of Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His other movie roles included Father Cornelius in &ldquo;The Fifth Element,&rdquo; android Ash in &ldquo;Alien,&rsquo;&rsquo; a smooth-talking lawyer in &ldquo;The Sweet Hereafter,&rsquo;&rsquo; Napoleon Bonaparte in &ldquo;Time Bandits,&rsquo;&rsquo; writer Lewis Carroll in &ldquo;Dreamchild&rdquo; and a royal physician in &ldquo;The Madness of King George.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was also a charismatic theater actor who won a Tony Award for best featured actor as Lenny in Harold Pinter&rsquo;s play &ldquo;The Homecoming&rdquo; in 1967.</p>
<p>He was a longtime member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, though a bout of debilitating stage fright that struck during a production of &ldquo;The Iceman Cometh&rdquo; in 1976 kept him off the stage for many years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it happens quite often to actors,&rdquo; Holm told the Associated Press in 1998. &ldquo;They lose their nerve. They may think it&rsquo;s a crazy way to make a living, or whatever. I was fortunately gainfully employed in the other media. I could have frozen in front of a camera, and I would have had to become a chimney sweep or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He returned to live performance and won a 1998 Laurence Olivier Award for best actor for his performance in the title role of &ldquo;King Lear&rdquo; at the National Theatre.</p>
<p>Holm was knighted in 1998 for his services to drama.</p>
<p>Mia Farrow said he was &ldquo;among the giants of the theater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We met while working at the RSC where, mid-performance of Iceman Cometh, terror seized him and he left the stage — for 14 years,&rdquo; she tweeted. &ldquo;He worked in films and TV — unfailingly brilliant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Royal Shakespeare Company artistic director Gregory Doran called Holm &ldquo;one of the RSC greats&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ian was entirely original. Entirely a one-off,&rdquo; Doran said. &ldquo;He had a simmering cool, a compressed volcanic sense of ferocity, of danger, a pressure cooker actor, a rare and magnificent talent. There&rsquo;s a great spirit gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holm was married four times and had five children.</p>

Fallece el actor británico Ian Holm 1:12</p>
<p>Londres (CNN) — El actor británico Ian Holm murió a los 88 años, informó la agencia de noticias PA Media, citando un comunicado de su agente.</p>
<p>Holm tuvo una larga y variada carrera como actor, en la que interpretó una serie de personajes, incluidos Bilbo Baggins en la trilogía de la película “El señor de los anillos”; Ash en “Alien” de Ridley Scott, y el entrenador de atletismo Sam Mussabini, en la película de 1981 “Chariots of Fire”, una actuación por la que fue nominado a un Oscar.</p>
<p>Nacido en Essex, en el sureste de Inglaterra, en 1931, Holm asistió a la escuela de teatro RADA en Londres.</p>
<p>Después de forjar una exitosa carrera en el escenario, Holm pasó a la televisión y luego a actuar en películas.</p>
<p>Holm también interpretó al padre Vito Cornelius en “El quinto elemento” (1997) y al profesor Fitz en “El aviador” (2004).</p>
<p>En 1989 fue nombrado Comandante del Imperio Británico (CBE) y en 1998 fue nombrado caballero por sus servicios al drama.</p>
<p>Holm murió pacíficamente en el hospital después de una enfermedad relacionada con el Parkinson, con su familia y cuidador al lado de su cama, dijo su agente, según PA.</p>
<p>“Su interpretación de Bilbo Baggins en las trilogías de El Hobbit y El Señor de los Anillos aseguró que la magia de su oficio pudiera ser compartida por todas las generaciones”, dijo su agente en el comunicado citado por la agencia PA.</p>
<p>“Era un genio del escenario y la pantalla, ganó múltiples premios y fue amado por los directores, el público y sus colegas por igual. Su ingenio brillante siempre acompañó un brillo travieso en sus ojos.</p>
<p>“Encantador, amable y ferozmente talentoso, lo extrañaremos enormemente”.</p>
<p>La muerte de Holm provocó una ola de homenajes en línea.</p>
<p>La Academia Británica de Artes de Cine y Televisión (BAFTA) tuiteó sus respetos.</p>

<p>RIP Ian Holm, a genius actor who brought considerable presence to parts funny, heartbreaking &amp; terrifying. Thanks for Bilbo, Napoleon (twice), Sweet Hereafter, Big Night, Brazil and, of course the iconic Ash. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t lie to you about your chances, but… you have my sympathies.&rdquo; pic.twitter.com/tO9tcydVUK — edgarwright (@edgarwright) June 19, 2020</p>
<p>“Descansa en Paz Ian Holm, un actor genio que aportó una considerable presencia a partes divertidas, desgarradoras y aterradoras”, escribió Wright en Twitter.
