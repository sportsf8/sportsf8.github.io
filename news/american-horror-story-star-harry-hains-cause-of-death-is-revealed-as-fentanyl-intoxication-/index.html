American Horror Story star Harry Hains died of an accidental fentanyl overdose, it was announced on Monday.

The cause of death was revealed after a two-month investigation by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.

Harry died on January 7 at the age of 27 after battling addiction and mental health problems.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid with effects similar to heroin that is used for relieving severe pain.

Cause of death: American Horror Story star Harry Hains died of an accidental fentanyl overdose, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner confirmed on Monday

The coroner's report listed Harry's place of death as 'hospital' and the manner of his death as an 'accident'.

Harry's mother, Hollywood actress Jane Badler, announced her son's death on Instagram two months ago.

'On Jan 7 my beautiful son died. He was 27 and had the world at his feet,' she wrote.

'But sadly he struggled with mental illness and addiction. A brilliant spark shone bright too short a time... I will miss you, Harry, every day of my life.'

Tragedy: Harry died on January 7 at the age of 27 after battling addiction and mental health problems. His mother, actress Jane Badler, announced his death on Instagram

Jane did not disclose her son's cause of death at the time.

A funeral service was held at the Hollywood Forever cemetery in Los Angeles on January 12.

Harry shared his last Instagram post - a celebratory New Year's Eve photo with a female friend - just days before his death.

Notable role: Harry (left) was best known for playing a victim of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in a 2015 episode of American Horror Story: Hotel

He wrote in the caption: 'To 2020! The new era has already begun. So let's all keep only moving forward, staying so present to enjoy each and every moment throughout this beautiful new beginning.

'Happy New Year, peeps. So much love and gratitude for all in my life.'

Harry was best known for playing a victim of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer in a 2015 episode of American Horror Story: Hotel.

Gone too soon: Harry shared his last Instagram post - a celebratory New Year's Eve photo with a female friend - just days before his death

He also appeared in three episodes of The Deleted, in which he played a desk clerk.

In 2018, Harry starred alongside Alexis Nichols in the film I, Matter about a college student in Los Angeles who contracts HIV.

One of his last roles was in an episode of The OA titled Angel of Death.

Family ties: Harry is pictured with his mother, American-Australian actress Jane Badler (left)

Harry was raised in Melbourne and was studying pre-med when he decided to move to London to pursue modelling and acting.

He later relocated to New York, before settling in Los Angeles.

Harry was also a musician performing under the name ANTIBOY, an alter ego he described as a 'gender fluid robot from the future'.

Memories: Harry is shown here in a family photo with his parents, Jane and Stephen, and a man believed to be his brother

Harry identified as gender fluid, according to a March 2019 interview with Boys by Girls magazine. The article referred to Harry using 'he' and 'him' pronouns.

'I know that I am born male but I don't think I represent what it means to be a man,' he said at the time.

'I believe we should be whatever we want. It gets kind of confusing when we start labelling ourselves so I try to stay away from labels.

Claim to fame: Harry's mother, Jane Badler, is best known for her roles in Falcon Crest and science fiction series V. Pictured as Diana in V circa 1983

'I grew up in Melbourne and I had a very open and accepting family. Dating someone of either sex didn't make a difference to me.'

He told the same publication that he'd suffered from a 'serious sleeping disorder' (idiopathic insomnia) as a child and had a tendency to be 'self-destructive'.

Harry's mother, Jane Badler, who is known for her roles in Falcon Crest and science fiction series V, was born in New York City but settled in Australia after she married businessman Stephen Hains.
