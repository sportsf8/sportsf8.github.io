<p>BENGALURU: In response to the public health advisory issued by the Indian government, aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 in the country, Isha Yoga Center, situated near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, has suspended programmes at all its centres around the world until further notice.</p>
<p>Isha Yoga Center, that receives a large number of visitors daily, has also implemented precautionary measures.</p>
<p>The Center, in a statement, said visitors &ldquo;are being medically screened&rdquo; before being allowed to enter and those living within the center &ldquo;are being subjected to periodic screening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The statement quoted founder of Isha Foundation Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev as saying that all those who travel frequently to deliver Isha programmes &ldquo;have been grounded, including myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadhguru has also put off his immediate engagements, including an upcoming Inner Engineering programme in Mumbai and a visit to South Africa, scheduled in the first week of April.</p>
<p>Residents at the Center will be screened every three days, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Isha is also sending out guidelines based on the government travel advisory, to all those who plan to visit the Center. It has requested those who &ldquo;have had any symptoms of COVID-19 in the last 28 days - including sore throat, cold, cough, fever, breathlessness, headache, runny nose, etc. &ndash; or have been in close contact with anyone having the above symptoms&rdquo; to refrain from visiting.</p>
<p>In addition to making hand sanitizers available at all common points at the Center, Isha is also holding hygiene orientation programmes for everyone and promoting respiratory etiquette. The precautions also extend to housekeeping, security and other ground staff employed at Isha, the statement added.</p>
<p>Visitors to Adiyogi, located at the outer periphery of the Isha Yoga Center, are being offered hand sanitizers and have been requested to follow the same precautionary measures being followed at the Center. The statement added that Sadhguru has &ldquo;urged everyone to remain alert and report anyone with flu-like symptoms to the Centerâ€™s medical team.&rdquo;
