<p>In the parallel universe, Walternate brainwashes Olivia into believing that she is Fauxlivia, and uses her abilities to conduct more Cortexiphan experiments as they prepare to use the Wave Synch Device to destroy the prime universe. Olivia soon realizes who she is and travels back to the prime world, blowing Fauxlivia&rsquo;s cover. Fauxlivia travels back to her own world, pregnant with Peter&rsquo;s baby. Walternate accelerates the baby&rsquo;s growth and uses his blood to start the machine.</p>
<p>In the prime universe, Peter, Walter, and Olivia have put together their version of the device. With both devices on their versions of Liberty Island, Peter enters the device, hoping to stop the parallel universe from destroying the prime. Instead, he has a vision of 15 years into the future. The parallel universe has been destroyed and the prime is suffering from the same anomalies that the alternate world once endured, leading to eventual destruction. Walter, Astrid, and Ella, Olivia&rsquo;s niece, send the device and manuals back in time through a wormhole, thus becoming, in a sense, the &ldquo;First People,&rdquo; fulfilling a bootstrap paradox.</p>
<p>Instead of destroying one universe, Peter merges the two together, forming a bridge so they can work together to heal both worlds. The two Walters and the two Olivias come face to face. But as they meet each other, Peter disappears from existence, with the Observers looking on all the while.

The administration of President Donald Trump is considering plans Tuesday to wind down its coronavirus task force as early as this month and has already begun to talk about a transition plan with FEMA.</p>
<p>As the national death toll surpassed 70,000, a preliminary internal administration coronavirus report suggesting the daily U.S. death toll could reach 3,000 by month&rsquo;s end does not take into account mitigation efforts that should ease the crisis, Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump was bound for Phoenix to visit a Honeywell aerospace plant that now produces face masks, a day after Gov. Doug Ducey announced he was accelerating a plan to reopen the state&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>In the U.S. there are more than 1.2 million confirmed cases, according to the John Hopkins University data dashboard. Worldwide, the virus has killed over 256,000 people and infected more than 3.6 million.</p>

<p>President Trump is leaving Washington, D.C., for the first major trip in more than a month, bound for a mask-producing plant in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Coronavirus deaths in the United States surpassed 70,000 Tuesday, as the United Kingdom are nearing the 30,000 mark, surpassing Italy as the highest in Europe.</p>

<p>Trump team contemplating future of coronavirus task force</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s administration is considering plans to wind down its coronavirus task force as early as this month, a major shift in the White House response to the health crisis.</p>
<p>A senior administration official speaking on the condition of anonymity confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence told reporters in a briefing Tuesday that members of the taskforce were &ldquo;having a conversation&rdquo; about when and how to wind down the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we’re having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level,&rdquo; Pence told reporters, according to a transcript of his remarks reviewed by USA TODAY. &ldquo;And we’ve already begun to talk about a transition plan with FEMA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump announced the creation of the task force on Jan. 29, saying its goal was to &ldquo;monitor, contain and mitigate the spread of the virus.&rdquo; The group, which Pence has led, has met virtually every day – bringing together not only White House officials but also top public health experts within the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Trump in Phoenix for Honeywell visit, says Navajo Nation will receive over $600M to fight coronavirus</p>
<p>Trump touched down in Phoenix Tuesday, ending his confinement at the White House amid the coronavirus pandemic and kicking off what he hopes is the reopening of state economies.</p>
<p>Trump’s trip will highlight Honeywell International, a North Carolina-based aerospace defense contractor that is producing millions of N95 respirator masks for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>During a roundtable discussion with Native American leaders, Trump announced Arizona tribes will soon receive &ldquo;the single largest investment in Indian country in our history&rdquo; to fight COVID-19.&quot;</p>
<p>The Navajo Nation, which includes land in northern Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, will soon receive more than $600 million and the Gila River Indian Community will receive $40 million in initial funds to protect citizens from &ldquo;the scourge, this plague, from what we&rsquo;re all fighting in this country,&rdquo; Trump said.</p>
<p>Hours before Trump landed, the Treasury Department announced it was releasing $4.8 billion of aid to tribes, some of which includes the Navajo tribe, whose community is among the hardest-hit in the nation by the virus.</p>

<p>Unlike NASA, Florida sheriff encourages people to attend SpaceX launch</p>
<p>A sheriff in Florida is encouraging people to come to his county to watch the scheduled May 27 historic launch of a SpaceX rocket with two astronauts aboard.</p>
<p>It would be the first launch of astronauts from U.S. soil since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. The 230-foot-tall rocket will take astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station in a Crew Dragon capsule.</p>
<p>But Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey&rsquo;s invitation runs contrary to a NASA recommendation for people to watch the launch on television. Administrator Jim Bridenstine reiterated that on Friday during a pre-launch news conference when he asked people to watch from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If NASA is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that&rsquo;s on them,&rdquo; Ivey said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling people what I believe as an American. And so NASA has got their guidelines, and I got mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>HHS official whistleblower complaint claims removal was due to criticism of coronavirus drug</p>
<p>A vaccine expert who said he was ousted after raising concerns about a drug Trump touted as a potential treatment for coronavirus filed a whistleblower complaint Tuesday alleging longstanding political influence at the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>Rick Bright, who until recently served as director of the HHS Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, also said he raised alarms about the coronavirus – and the need to ramp up production of face masks and other personal protective equipment – with White House officials as far back as January.</p>
<p>Bright says in the report that he resisted widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, which Trump had repeatedly touted, because the claims of its benefit lacked “scientific merit.&quot; In his report, Bright said he pushed back against the drug &ldquo;even though the administration promoted it as a panacea and demanded that New York and New Jersey be &lsquo;flooded&rsquo; with these drugs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s the beef? Maybe not at all Wendy&rsquo;s restaurants</p>
<p>Multiple reports and social media accounts suggest some Wendy&rsquo;s restaurants have been running out of beef, which means customers can&rsquo;t order burgers. In a note released Tuesday, Stephens analyst James Rutherford said almost 20% of the restaurants were out of beef due to its &ldquo;famous focus on fresh beef.&rdquo; In a statement obtained by USA TODAY, Wendy&rsquo;s said it continues to supply all its restaurants with beef, but acknowledged that some menu items may be &ldquo;temporarily limited&rdquo; at some restaurants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is widely known that beef suppliers across North America are currently facing production challenges,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;We’re working diligently to minimize the impact to our customers and restaurants, and continue to work with our supplier partners to monitor this closely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Florida&rsquo;s first cases may date to Jan. 1</p>
<p>The novel coronavirus infected as many as 171 people in Florida as long as two months before officials announced it had come to the state, a Palm Beach Post analysis of state records shows. Patients reported symptoms of the deadly virus as early as Jan. 1, when the disease was thought to be limited to China, Department of Health records reveal. Florida did not announce its first two presumed coronavirus cases until March 1. But at the time of the first two cases, 171 people across 40 counties who would later test positive for COVID-19 were suffering from the disease, state records show.</p>

<p>Trump downplays ominous CDC coronavirus death projections</p>
<p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday dismissed a data analysis within his administration that projects the number of coronavirus deaths could reach 3,000 daily by June 1. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the analysis, based on modeling by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, assumes no mitigation efforts would be in place to control the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>“But we’re doing a lot of mitigation,” he said before departing the White House for a trip to Phoenix. The analysis projects the prospect of a steady rise in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths, according to the internal document. The projections forecast about 200,000 new cases each day by the end of the month, up from about 25,000 cases now.</p>
<p>The White House, which has been encouraging states to begin reopening their economies, immediately challenged the report and said it had not been presented to the coronavirus task force or gone through interagency vetting.</p>

<p>Norwegian could be first cruise line felled by virus</p>
<p>Norwegian Cruise Line warned that its upcoming financial statements will carry a statement detailing &ldquo;substantial doubt&rdquo; about its ability to continue as a &ldquo;going concern&rdquo; in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic that has essentially shut down the cruise industry. This comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended a &ldquo;no sail order&rdquo; last month that it imposed in March to help quell the spread of the coronavirus. Cruise ship operators registered in foreign countries, such as Bermuda-incorporated Norwegian, were shut out of U.S. stimulus packages exceeding $2 trillion.</p>
<p>Norwegian is scheduled to release its monthly traffic report on Thursday and its first quarter results on May 28.</p>

<p>In harm&rsquo;s way: Vaccine volunteers face risk in expedited race for answer</p>
<p>To have a vaccine by next summer will require both luck and cutting corners never cut before. To speed up the process, some researchers are planning to give volunteers experimental vaccines and then infect them with the virus that causes COVID-19. Current rules are meant to protect volunteers from harm, but with the global death count from the coronavirus over 250,000, scientists are asking: Is it acceptable to deliberately infect healthy people with a disease for which there is no cure? Increasing scientists say the answer is yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mortality and morbidity and the social consequences that are a result of this infection are enormous,” said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, scientific director of the Vanderbilt University Vaccine Research Program. “We have to figure out how to stop it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ex-Gov. Christie: It&rsquo;s time for America to get back to work</p>
<p>Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, saying that “there are going to be deaths no matter what,” called for leaders to allow people to get back to work before we “destroy American way of life.&quot; Speaking on The Daily DC Podcast hosted by CNN’s Dana Bash on Monday, Christie said, “What we are doing now I just don’t think can be sustained as a country.” Christie, who sought the GOP presidential nomination in 2016, said claims that we must choose between money and lives is a “false choice.”</p>
<p>“We have to start letting people get back to work. I can see in my own state the economic devastation is equally sad,” he said, adding that the medical community might keep us &ldquo;locked in our houses for another year&rdquo; until there is a vaccine.</p>

<p>States reopening: Arkansas businesses reopen, Virginia targets May 15</p>
<p>Arkansas will permit barbershops, beauty salons, massage therapists and tattoo artists, among others, to open again Wednesday.With May 15 as the target date, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam on Monday said he is extending an executive order closing most nonessential businesses that was set to expire May 8. A separate stay-at-home order set to end June 10 will remain in place.</p>
<p>California was preparing for Stage 2 of its reopening plan, which will allow some retail businesses to begin curbside pickup on Friday. In Arizona, barbershops and salons can resume hair, nail, waxing and other services by appointment Friday if they limit occupancy. Find out the latest on your state.</p>
<p>States vary on reporting nursing home COVID-19 deaths, frustrating families</p>
<p>State and local health officials nationwide have faced increasing scrutiny over the collection and release of infection data for long-term care facilities, whose residents are among the most susceptible to COVID-19. States have adopted their own standards with mixed results, according to interviews and examination of states' records by the USA TODAY Network. The head of two industry groups representing most of the nation’s 15,000 licensed long-term care centers has publicly supported releasing facility-level infection data and urged members to provide it to residents, families and staff.</p>
<p>“We believe this information can help identify long-term care providers who are most in need of testing and PPE resources,” said Mark Parkinson, CEO of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living.</p>

<p>UK becoming coronavirus epicenter in Europe</p>
<p>Coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom are nearing the 30,000 mark, the highest in Europe, according to John Hopkins University&rsquo;s COVID-19 tracker. The three countries with the largest death tolls in Europe – Italy, Spain and the U.K – have been recording data around infections and deaths in different ways.</p>
<p>Figures released by the U.K&rsquo;s Office for National Statistics on Tuesday morning showed that 29,648 deaths with COVID-19 mentioned in death certificates had taken place in England and Wales as of April 24. Including deaths for Scotland and Northern Ireland, the toll on this measure now exceeds 30,000, according to the statistical agency. John Hopkins University&rsquo;s COVID-19 tracker lists 28,809 deaths in the U.K. At least 29,079 people have died from the coronavirus in Italy.</p>

<p>Third Russian health care worker plunges from hospital window</p>
<p>A Russian paramedic who complained about being forced to work after testing positive for COVID-19 was in critical condition after falling from a hospital window in western Russia, according to multiple media reports. In the last two weeks, two other health care workers who challenged Russian medical authorities fell from windows to their deaths.</p>
<p>In the latest incident, Alexander Shulepov worked on an ambulance in Voronezh, 300 miles south of Moscow, when he and a friend posted a video on social media April 22 complaining about a lack of personal protective gear, the Russian website vestivrn.ru said. Shulepov fell from the window May 2. The friend, Alexander Kosyakin, told CNN that Shulepov &ldquo;felt fine, he was getting ready to get discharged from the hospital &hellip; and all of a sudden this happened, it&rsquo;s not clear why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Family Dollar guard killed after telling woman her child must wear mask</p>
<p>Three people were facing murder charges Tuesday in the death of security guard Calvin Munerlyn, a father of nine who authorities say was gunned down after turning away a customer without a mask froma Family Dollar in Michigan.</p>
<p>Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton filed the charges Monday against Sharmel Teague, 45, Larry Edward Teague Jr., 44, and Ramonyea Bishop, 23.</p>
<p>Leyton said Sharmel Teague and her daughter left the store after a verbal altercation with Munerlyn, but that her husband and son arrived a short time later. Teague fatally shot Munerlyn after accusing him of &ldquo;disrespecting&rdquo; his wife, Leyton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decisions like staying home when we can, wearing a mask when going to the store and staying a safe distance from those around us, these should not be political arguments,&rdquo; Leyton said. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t necessitate acts of defiance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mnuchin: Don&rsquo;t expect much foreign travel before 2021</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is encouraging Americans to focus on domestic travel this year as the international travel outlook for the rest of 2020 remains uncertain. In response to a question Monday from Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business Network about whether international travel will be opened up this year, he responded, “Too hard to tell at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>The Treasury secretary clarified that there may be room for limited international travel: “Obviously, for businesspeople that do need to travel, there will be travel on a limited basis.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="is-battery-power-the-answer-to-the-quest-for-zero-emission-construction-plant">&ldquo;Is battery-power the answer to the quest for zero-emission construction plant?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/assets/news_articles/2019/12/1576246161_wacker-neuson-image-ez17e-action.jpg" alt="img">
It is now UK government policy that all new cars and vans will be effectively zero-emission by 2040. Obituaries of the internal combustion engine can now be prepared. We are witnessing the dawn of a new age of battery-power.</p>
<p>And where on-highway vehicles lead, off-highway construction machinery is sure to follow.</p>
<p>Battery-powered equipment on construction sites is not itself a new development: mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs), for example, are already routinely battery-powered for use indoors.</p>
<p>To date, however, harder-working machines like excavators have almost exclusively been diesel-powered&hellip;almost. Hybrid machines exist, and there are excavators that can plug into the mains, with the hazard of a trailing cable.</p>
<p>The battery-powered Wacker Neuson E217e</p>
<p>But in the next couple of years we will start to see more and more battery-powered excavators, taking advantage of rapid improvements in lithium-ion battery technology. Diesel retains many inherent advantages over battery-power, but the world is changing.</p>
<p>Advances in diesel engine technology have made the latest machines close to emissions-free, but for many this is still not good enough. And they are also noisy.</p>
<p>Diesel engines compliant with EU Stage V emissions standards may meet even the most rigorous regulatory requirements, such as the London Ultra Low Emissions Zone, but tier one contractors are increasingly looking to gain competitive advantage by demonstrating their sustainability credentials. Replacing diesel with electric, rightly or wrongly, is seen as a way to achieve this.</p>
<p>At recent major trade shows manufacturers have put their latest developments in battery-electric construction machinery at the forefront of their displays. In each case, it is claimed the battery-powered machine is no less powerful or productive than the traditional diesel model on which it is based, although commercial developments to date have generally been restricted to compact sizes.</p>
<p>We have seen Takeuchi’s e240 prototype, for example, and Wacker Neuson’s EZ17e and EZ26e. Wacker Neuson already has battery-powered construction equipment in its product range, including rammers, wheeled loaders, a vibratory plate and a tracked loader – but these are its first battery diggers.</p>
<p>Hyundai&rsquo;s 3.5 tonne prototype is powered by Cummins' BM4.4E battery modules Hyundai Construction Equipment (HCE) and engine producer Cummins have collaborated to produce an electric-powered mini excavator prototype – a 3.5-tonne excavator which is powered by Cummins’ BM4.4E flexible battery modules (4.4 kWh each).</p>
<p>Hyundai’s commitment is clear. Chief technical officer DS Kim says: “As electric vehicles continue to expand their share in the automotive market, we are simultaneously seeing the electrification of commercial power systems being pursued by many as both an environmentally friendly and economically sustainable solution for construction equipment. HCE anticipates mini excavators, which operate in urban workplaces close to residential areas, will be a prime candidate to electrify to meet zero-emission and low noise requirements in the near future.”</p>
<p>Smaller manufacturers are also getting into the game: Eurocomach, part of the Italian Sampierana group, showed an all-electric ES12X (1.2-tonne) mini excavator in concept form at Intermat 2018 in France.</p>
<p>At the Bauma fair in Germany in April this year, battery-power was a core theme. Caterpillar showed a concept Cat 906 compact wheeled loader powered by a 41kW lithium-ion battery that takes three hours to charge. Cat says that on a fully-charged battery, the concept machine can operate in a medium-duty application, such as mixed truck loading or material handling, for up to 4.5 hours or up to 6.5 hours with a one-hour top-up charge during the lunch break.</p>
<p>Komatsu unveiled a pre-launch electric mini excavator based on its expertise of hybrid construction equipment and electric forklift trucks. When fully charged, the battery offers up to six hours of operation depending on operating conditions, Komatsu says. Again, a quick charge during the lunch break can extend working hours.</p>
<p>Since Bauma, Bobcat and JCB have taken things beyond prototype and gone into serial production, with Volvo close behind and set to follow suit next year.</p>
<p>At 1:08pm on 11th July 2019 the first Bobcat E10e one-tonne electric micro-excavator came off the production line at the factory in Dobris in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The zero-tailswing E10e, just 710mm wide, is built on the same platform and produced on the same production line as the diesel-powered E08 and E10z mini excavators. The E10e has a lithium-ion battery pack that runs for up to four hours on one charge. By using an optional external 400V supercharger, it can be recharged to 80% of its capacity in less than two hours. In this way it can be made to serve a full working day with normal work breaks. The battery can also be fully recharged overnight by using the on-board charger from a standard 230V grid.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Austria and Norway have been selected for first shipments. How soon we see it in the UK, if at all, depends on perceived market demand.</p>
<p>Just six weeks after Bobcat’s debut, JCB announced that not only had it gone into full production but had already delivered to dealers more than 50 units of its battery-powered 19C-1E excavator, first unveiled last year.</p>
<p>Orders for the 1.9-tonner are said to be ‘rolling in’ from customers from across Europe and North America and an early high-profile appearance of the new digger was made on an HS2 site in London</p>
<p>Three or four lithium-ion battery packs provide a 15-20kWh storage capacity. There is an on-board charger with 110V input for 12-hour recharging capability (or the option for 230V charging when required, with eight-hour recharging time) and a fast-charge option allowing a full charge in less than two hours.</p>
<p>There is also a battery management system to help ensure full-shift availability. This kind of technology is crucial since you don’t want to run out of juice when you are out of reach of your power source. A diesel-powered machine that runs out of fuel just requires someone to get a jerry can; a battery-powered machine that runs flat is effectively broken down until it is recharged. And if the cable doesn’t reach the power source, that means it needs another machine to pick it up and carry it to sanctuary.</p>
<p>Assuming no such cock-ups, JCB cites research showing that charging costs over the first five years of ownership will be 50% cheaper than using traditional red diesel and servicing costs are expected to be ‘up to 70%’ lower than on similar-sized diesel models.</p>
<p>Volvo Construction Equipment may have been slower to go into full production, but it appears to have the deepest commitment to electric. From mid-2020, Volvo CE will begin to launch its range of electric compact excavators (EC15 to EC27) and wheeled loaders (L20 to L28), stopping new diesel engine-based development of these models.</p>
<p>JCB’s attitude, by contrast, is that battery and diesel both remain very much part of the product mix so long as customers demand them. It has no plans to phase out diesel engines, even on smaller machines, and says battery technology is not yet ready for bigger ones.</p>
<p>JCB 19C-1E is now on the market</p>
<p>JCB’s head of innovation and growth, Tim Burnhope, says: “We have launched our first electric excavator and the response has been fantastic with sales all over the world in the first few weeks of full production.</p>
<p>“Electric technology is currently only suitable for small machines rather than the large excavators used on major housing and infrastructure projects. However, it continues to develop and will have further uses, particularly in compact and mid-range equipment.</p>
<p>“Beyond that, clean diesel will continue to play a major part in the powering of JCB equipment. JCB is a leader in innovative clean diesel technology for construction machines used on housing and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>“Future powertrain offerings will include electric battery/motor systems for small machines and combustion engines for larger machines. The combustion engines will emit practically zero NOx and particulate emissions and run on carbon neutral fuels. Fuel cells might be a good solution for some applications when the technology and fuel distribution has matured. The future will have a variety of powertrain solutions matched to applications and usage,” concludes Burnhope.</p>
<p>Volvo&rsquo;s 2.5 tonne ECR25 is fitted with 48V lithium-ion batteries</p>
<p>Volvo’s 2.5-tonne ECR25 is fitted with 48V lithium-ion batteries and a single electric motor. The batteries store enough energy to power the ECR25 for eight hours in its most common applications, such as utility work, Volvo says. The L25 has lithium-ion batteries which allow for eight hours of operation in regular applications. The L25 also has separate motors for the drivetrain and the hydraulics. Decoupling the subsystems has led to higher efficiency in both the systems and the entire machine, Volvo says.</p>
<p>Both the ECR25 and L25 have on-board chargers for overnight charging via a regular household socket. A fast charging option, requiring more powerful grid access, will also be available.</p>
<p>Volvo’s battery-powered ECR25 mini excavator made its UK debut in May, building one of the gardens at the Chelsea Flower Show. On a landscaping project like this, the lack of polluting spew reduces the risk of damage to the precious trees and herbaceous borders, says Volvo.</p>
<p>The machine’s operator on that job, Peter Holmberg, reports that the excavator not only performed the same jobs as the more conventional diesel version with equal effectiveness but that the digging feeling was “more pleasant and more precise”. It also provided a calmer work environment, he says, as there was less vibration in the cab, better air quality and a quieter atmosphere that allowed for clearer communication between workers.</p>
<p>Following this debut, Volvo’s electric machine went to a French customer, Spac, part of the Colas Group, for further testing. It was used for digging trenches at the Saint-Nom-la Bretèche golf course, near Paris.</p>
<p>Spac’s operator, Alexandre Birot, said: “When we talk to the guy in the trench we don’t have to yell, we talk normally and he can hear everything. With a traditional excavator we first have to turn the engine off for him to be able to hear. What’s more, when we spend the whole day in the trench, usually he would inhale a lot of fumes but now there’s no exhaust gas for him to inhale. If there were only electric machines in the company that would be amazing.”</p>
<p>“Zero emissions and lower noise levels is an absolute game changer,” says Ahcène Nedjimi, Volvo CE’s electromobility specialist. “The challenge now is to figure out the best way to charge them in a faster way. That’s something we are working on now.”</p>
<p>He concludes: “The question is no longer when, or if, we will have a shift to electromobility, but how fast it will come. We are really at the tipping point with no point of return. We need to emit less, pollute less and build the world we want to live in.”</p>
<p>Of course, battery-powered excavators are still only zero emissions at the point of use. The machines still have to be manufactured and the lithium for the batteries has to be mined, neither of which is anywhere close to carbon neutral. But these innovations clearly represent advancement.</p>
<p>Users attest to electric digger’s performance</p>
<p>Costain Skanska Joint Venture has been using a JCB 19C-1E on its HS2 enabling works by Euston Station in London.</p>
<p>Site foreman Ben Lennon says: “We’re involved with the demolition and excavation in the Euston area so we’re currently working underneath an encapsulation structure. We wanted to minimise the noise and the fumes so we’re using the JCB electric machine inside the tent.</p>
<p>“There are safety benefits with the electric machine – there’s no noise, there’s no fumes and no emissions – while servicing and maintenance are a lot easier. Also, we don’t have to worry about the fuel. It’s able to do all of the same work that the diesel machines do. I think for an electric excavator JCB have managed to get it right.”</p>
<p>The machine is on hire from L Lynch Plant Hire, which was involved in the product’s development. Directors Merrill and Rob Lynch describe the 19C-1E as “the leading innovation in the electric machinery market”.</p>
<p>Online discussion about electric diggers has revealed widespread scepticism about manufacturers’ claims on battery life (any mobile phone owner knows that advertised battery life is rarely the same as real life, especially after a few years of use).</p>
<p>But the Lynches are eager to vouch for JCB here. “We are very pleased with the performance of the JCB electric mini,” they say. “We were also proud to play a part in the evaluation of the model and are delighted that the final design meets hirers’ needs to sustain battery life for a longer working period between charges – indeed it lasts a full seven-hour working day on our applications on just a single charge.”</p>
<p>Sunshine &amp; hydrogen</p>
<p>Solar generators can keep electric diggers emissions-free, while hydrogen fuel cells are already powering some static plant</p>
<p>Solar generators can keep electric diggers emissions free, while hydrogen fuel cells are already powering some static plant</p>
<p>One of the obvious drawbacks of electric construction machinery is that you have to have somewhere to plug them in to recharge them. As many construction sites are off-grid, power traditionally comes from a diesel generator. But a battery-powered excavator that needs recharging by a diesel generator immediately loses any claim to virtue. It defeats the point.</p>
<p>One way of keeping electric diggers emissions-free on sites that are off-grid is to use solar generators, like the Solar Pod or the Solatainer.</p>
<p>Solar Pod has been developed by Nixon Hire in partnership with manufacturer AJC Trailers. Nixon Hire wanted an emissions-free power source for its fleet of 10,000 mobile welfare units. It started out last year by putting solar panels on a shipping container and after a series of refinements developed a more compact unit with fold-out wings so two can fit onto a standard truck.</p>
<p>Over the past year it has built up a fleet of 70 Solar Pods and is aiming to have 200 by mid-2020. “We are struggling to keep up with demand,” says managing director Graham Nixon. There is a waiting list but customers that have already had them on site include Barratt and PJ Carey, he says.</p>
<p>The Solar Pod stores energy from the sun, even on a cloudy day, and releases it as required. One Solar Pod is sufficient to power five site cabins. The solar element will either power the site directly or will assist by charging the battery storage. To cope with peaks of energy demand or troughs of sunlight, it has a 25kV back-up diesel generator inside (along with a 400-litre fuel tank) but evidence indicates it is not needed very much.</p>
<p>“I’ve had 20 units on a film production site in Essex,” Nixon says, “and during the whole production the diesel generator only kicked in for 5% of the time.”</p>
<p>This is not a one-off, he says; results from other sites have been similar.</p>
<p>There is also an H20 Solar Pod version, with the added feature of a large water tank.</p>
<p>Solar power is very much the focus of Nixon Hire’s investment this year. The lack of infrastructure investment in the UK and fierce competition in regular plant hire has led Nixon to hold back on building up its plant hire business. In contrast, the company is still getting 90% utilisation for its site accommodation and toilet hire, so most of this year’s £37m capital expenditure is going on growing the solar-powered products side of the business, including solar-powered lighting towers.</p>
<p>Graham Nixon is something of a solar-vangelist – he even has solar panels on the company’s welfare vans to power functions when stationary.</p>
<p>The Solar Pod has been developed by Nixon Hire and AJC Trailers to provide clean power to off-grid sites</p>
<p>Having initially developed the Solar Pod to support his hire fleet, Nixon Hire is now making sales (expect to pay around the £40k mark). AJC is looking after UK sales while Nixon Hire is taking them international, exhibiting at the Big 5 trade show in Dubai at the end of November where a Solar Pod will be charging a JCB 19C-1E and a Tesla sports car.</p>
<p>The Solatainer solar generator was originally developed by Gaia Renewables before the business was acquired in April this year by Prolectric, a manufacturer of solar-powered lighting towers.</p>
<p>The original Solatainer is modelled on a standard 20ft shipping container and delivers up to 25kW of off-grid power. Its array of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels charges on-board lithium-ion or deep-cycle lead acid battery storage. Like the Solar Pod, it has a diesel generator for back-up power. User include Costain, Balfour Beatty and Willmott Dixon.</p>
<p>It was also instrumental (as reported on p9 of our June issue of The Construction Index magazine ) in Colas and Network Rail achieving 97% diesel-free operations on a rail renewal project at Llanwern, South Wales earlier this year.</p>
<p>The new Prolectric SolarCube is a more compact version of the original Solatainer</p>
<p>Two 25kW Solatainer solar generators replaced conventional diesel generators providing light and heat for seven welfare cabins, including site offices, a canteen, toilets and a drying room – saving 6,000 litres of fuel and more than 15 tonnes of CO2 – during a 14-day project centred around a 72-hour possession over the May Day bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Like Nixon and AJC, Prolectric has just recently refined its solar generator to produce a more compact unit for ease of transport. The new Prolectric SolarCube is reduced to 10m3 and promises to at least halve fuel consumption with its AutoMate smart energy management system.</p>
<p>“The environmental impact of running diesel generators all day on a major worksite like Llanwern is absolutely huge,” says Colas Rail production manager Ryan Ballinger. “It’s not just about carbon emissions; our lineside neighbours are very important to us. By using solar harvesting, we’re not polluting their environment with unwelcome fumes and noise.”</p>
<p>He adds: “There’s no doubt these technologies are going to be a complete game-changer and we need to push on to get to a place where using this type of technology is just business as usual.”</p>
<p>Another potential alternative energy source for construction machinery is hydrogen fuel cell technology, which has actually been around for years but has captured growing interest in line with concern about emissions.</p>
<p>The relative merit of hydrogen versus lithium-ion batteries is a topic of much debate. The Toyota Mirai is the world’s first mass-produced hydrogen fuel cell vehicle; Tesla’s Elon Musk, on the other hand, has bet the house on batteries and has been quoted as describing hydrogen fuel cells as ‘mind-bogglingly stupid’.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the construction plant world hydrogen is beginning to be considered for powering static plant, although not yet mobile machinery.</p>
<p>AJC Easy Cabin’s Ecosmart Zero welfare cabins are powered primarily by solar power but, instead of having a traditional diesel generator in support, have a back-up hydrogen fuel cell to eliminate local carbon emissions completely. Water vapour is the only by-product.</p>
<p>Taylor Construction Plant (TCP) is also using hydrogen fuel cells, for lighting and CCTV towers, while visitors to Plantworx 2019 may have noticed Stephill Generators displaying a lighting tower powered by a hydrogen fuel cell.</p>
<p>All three companies, AJC, TCP and Stephill, demonstrated their innovations at an event in Loughborough on 3rd October organised by A-Plant at the premises of fuel cell engineering company Intelligent Energy.</p>
<p>A-Plant sales &amp; marketing director Dave Harris says: “Providing sustainable hire equipment and energy options into the construction and infrastructure market is paramount. As a company we want to reduce our carbon footprint and play a leading role in identifying best practice and reduce emissions within the industry, especially when we consider steps that need to be taken to ensure we contribute to the government’s 2050 zero carbon target.</p>
<p>“Therefore, it’s vital that we collaborate with other industry experts, suppliers and our customers to ensure that we drive changes that will reduce our environmental impact.”</p>
<p>He adds: “The hydrogen workshop was the ideal platform to share our findings and experiences, as well as an opportunity to hear from the hydrogen industry experts and customers such as Balfour Beatty and Costain. Hydrogen fuel cell technology is clean, lightweight and will create greater efficiencies for our customers.”</p>
<p>Intelligent Energy&rsquo;s fuel call</p>
<p>Lee Juby, chief sales officer at Intelligent Energy, says: “Hydrogen fuel cell technology is here and available now. Our hydrogen fuel cell modules are proving to be a viable alternative power source to diesel generators and can help the construction industry transition to zero emission power for a sustainable future, addressing environmental noise and air quality. They also provide an opportunity to both reduce operating costs and increase environmental performance compared with the use of traditional diesel generators.”</p>
<p>Juby says that the higher the duty cycle, the more sense fuel cells make over batteries, which is why developments in buses and trucks are moving in the direction of hydrogen rather than lithium-ion.</p>
<p>He says that the wider adoption of hydrogen as a power source for construction machinery has been inhibited partly by upfront cost and partly by limited availability of the fuel. The former is just a question of market education; fuel cell systems may cost more than diesel power to buy but they cost much less to run and are likely to pay for themselves within a year or two.</p>
<p>As to availability, enter JCB heir Jo Bamford, who has set up a new company called Ryse Hydrogen and has secured a contract from Transport for London to supply hydrogen to 20 buses. These will be the world’s first hydrogen-powered double- decker buses and are expected to be introduced on three London routes from spring 2020.</p>
<p>Ryse’s chief operating officer is Buta Atwal, formerly managing director of JCB Heavy Products.</p>
<p>Liverpool also has a hydrogen bus project in the works, which will see the creation of a new hydrogen refuelling station at the BOC plant in St Helens.</p>
<p>Bamford introduced Ryse to a fringe meeting of the Conservative Party Conference in October. “We have a very simple vision: to totally decarbonise the entire UK bus fleet by 2030,” he said.</p>
<p>Bamford said: “Whilst there have been great strides in developing electric vehicle technology, we risk overlooking hydrogen as a practical, here and now solution to tackling emissions and improving air quality… Our modelling shows that if you reach scale, fuel cell buses will be cheaper than battery electric buses and 12% cheaper than diesel buses by 2030. And once you’ve cracked buses, you can move on trucks, trains, ships and planes.” And diggers, perhaps.</p>

<h3 id="americas-energy-ceo-series-key-captures-jeff-bishop-says-fercs-bsm-rule-creates-uncertainty-for-energy-storage">&ldquo;America&rsquo;s Energy CEO Series: Key Capture&rsquo;s Jeff Bishop says FERC&rsquo;s BSM rule creates uncertainty for energy storage&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/Images/favicon.ico" alt="img">
New York — The challenge for New York battery storage developers is developing projects without knowing how much energy market revenue the projects can make at a time when capacity revenue is being taken off the table, Key Capture Energy co-founder and CEO Jeff Bishop said in a recent interview.</p>

<p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a batch of orders February 20 narrowing exemptions from New York Independent System Operator&rsquo;s buyer-side market power mitigation rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have New York&rsquo;s largest battery in service &hellip; and put six projects during class year 2019 into the NYISO&rsquo;s capacity market so FERC&rsquo;s BSM ruling puts these projects into question,&rdquo; Bishop recently told S&amp;P Global Platts.</p>
<p>NYISO president and CEO Richard Dewey recently told an industry publication that energy storage resources in New York City and the lower Hudson Valley, where transmission congestion and higher capacity prices make siting projects attractive will be the &ldquo;most adversely impacted by these orders.&rdquo; Dewey said the grid operator is planning its own BSM rule improvements to favor energy storage.</p>
<p>The deployment milestone for changes to the Energy Storage Resource Participation Model has been moved to Q4 2020, according to a December NYISO presentation.</p>
<p>Bishop said the recent FERC orders along with these pending changes have led to market uncertainty for energy storage project developers.</p>
<p>With the roughly 2,000-MW Indian Point nuclear plant in Zone G retiring in 2020-2021 and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation looking to retire as much as 3,500 MW of downstate peaking capacity it looked like energy storage would be needed closer to the load of New York City and Long Island, Bishop said.</p>
<p>Under BSM, any Lower Hudson Valley, New York City or Long Island projects will be assessed a minimum offer floor price and if that price is higher than the prevailing capacity price the resource can&rsquo;t participate in the capacity market.</p>
<p>The friction we have now is New York&rsquo;s clean energy goals are trying to inject more energy storage capacity into the power market, but incumbents are erecting barriers and making New Yorkers pay twice for the same capacity, Bishop said.</p>
<p>PAYING TWICE</p>
<p>For instance, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority offers a market bridge incentive – which is a state grant intended to be the &ldquo;missing money&rdquo; for storage that is not already provided under current market rules – so the agency pays a certain amount of money annually for four years with New Yorkers paying for that in utility bills.</p>
<p>Storage owners typically charge their batteries when power prices are low and discharge when prices are high, but because the BSM rules limit participation in the capacity markets, they are making NYISO procure that capacity elsewhere, so ratepayers have to pay again, Bishop said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BSM makes it challenging for storage to successfully participate in capacity auctions, which will lead to other resources with higher bids serving a void due to the lack of energy storage in the market,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the BSM testing process currently has many unknowns due to the ambiguity of items such as future system costs and revenue projections. There is not a clear scoring criteria for BSM, Bishop said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In turn, it is not known if we will be over the floor price. We are unsure if we will &lsquo;clear&rsquo; but are still developing these projects with uncertainty for how we will be judged, ultimately driving us to factor this risk into our financial models,&rdquo; Bishop said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The challenge for battery storage developers is we don&rsquo;t know how much revenue we can get because NYISO is creating a new revenue structure that won&rsquo;t be out until Q4 &hellip; so we are developing projects without knowing how much money the projects can make while capacity revenue is being taken off the table &hellip; I may need to put development dollars in a market with more clarity,&rdquo; Bishop said</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a wholesale markets guy. I would like for wholesale power markets to exist in 10 years, but it&rsquo;s been proven that if federal policies prevent states from doing what they want with their energy policies, states will do their own thing,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Prior to founding Key Capture Energy, Bishop was at Brookfield Renewables and EDP Renewables/Horizon Wind Energy.</p>
<p>He is currently on the Leadership Circle of the Energy Storage Association, is serving on the Maine Commission on Energy Storage, and has served on or led the boards of organizations such as Renewable Energy Northeast, the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, the Advanced Contracting in Energy Storage (ACES) Working Group, and the Maine Renewable Energy Association.

<p>The Latest on the . The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.</p>
<p>TOP OF THE HOUR:</p>
<p>— President Trump heads to Arizona to tour Honeywell plant.</p>
<p>— French President Macron criticized for opening schools next week.</p>
<p>— Italy experts warn of second wave after gradual reopening.</p>
<p>— British government chief acknowledges early testing shortfall.</p>
<hr>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump says Americans should think of themselves as “warriors” in the fight against the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>Trump spoke to reporters Tuesday before boarding Air Force One for a trip to Phoenix to tour a Honeywell plant that’s making N95 respirator masks.</p>
<p>Trump’s trip is designed to give the appearance of a return to normalcy as states begin to reopen after shutting down in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The president has stayed close to the White House since mid-March, when he declared a national emergency over the outbreak. He traveled to Virginia at the end of March to see a Navy hospital shift off to New York, and he spent this past weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland.</p>
<p>Trump says: “The people of our country should think of themselves as warriors. Our country has to open.”</p>
<hr>
<p>LONDON — Virgin Atlantic says it plans to cut 3,150 jobs and end its operation at London’s Gatwick Airport.</p>
<p>The company says the job losses will be across the board and it will reduce the size of its fleet.</p>
<p>Virgin is applying for emergency loans from the British government. The airline says recovery is expected to take up to three years.</p>
<p>Also, new car sales in the U.K. came to a near standstill in April, the lowest monthly level since 1946.</p>
<p>Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders indicate only 4,321 cars were registered during the month, down 97% from the year before. Dealerships were closed and potential buyers have been in lockdown since March 23.</p>
<hr>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — New York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities.</p>
<p>At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state’s nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s office late Monday. It includes, for the first time, people believed to have died from the coronavirus before it could be confirmed by a lab test.</p>
<p>Exactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state’s latest disclosure. The list doesn’t include nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.</p>
<hr>
<p>BEIRUT — Dozens of Lebanese returned home from Syria after authorities briefly opened two border crossings nearly two months after they were closed.</p>
<p>The returnees were subjected to tests for the coronavirus and will stay in hotels for one day to wait for the results. Lebanon, which has reported 741 cases of coronavirus and 24 deaths, will extend the lockdown until May 24.</p>
<p>Information Minister Manal Abdul-Samad says the government has asked security forces to make sure the lockdown is enforced.</p>
<p>She also says Lebanon accepted a $750,000 donation from Google in the form of advertisements to raise knowledge about coronavirus.</p>
<hr>
<p>PARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed plans to gradually reopen schools next week amid concerns from mayors, teachers and parents about the timing.</p>
<p>Macron, wearing a mask, visited a primary school in a suburb west of Paris on Tuesday that has remained open for children of health workers.</p>
<p>More than 300 mayors in the capital region, including Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, urged Macron in an open letter to delay the reopening of primary schools scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>They denounced an “untenable and unrealistic timetable” to meet the sanitary and safety conditions required by the state, including class sizes capped to a maximum of 15. The majority of French children attend public schools.</p>
<p>Many parents say they won’t send their children back to school as France is one of the world’s hardest-hit countries by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>France starts lifting confinement measures on May 11, with businesses to resume activity and parents to return to work.</p>
<hr>
<p>GENEVA — The U.N. human rights office says conditions in many prisons in the Americas are “deeply worrying” as COVID-19 spreads in many overcrowded facilities that lack hygiene.</p>
<p>Rights office spokesman Rupert Colville says fear of contagion and lack of basic services like access to food and health care have stoked riots and protests in some prisons.</p>
<p>He pointed to outbreaks of deadly violence in detention centers in Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela in recent weeks, along with attempted prison breaks in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the United States.</p>
<p>Colville says the incidents suggest some states had not taken “appropriate measures to prevent violence in detention facilities,” urging states to investigate the deaths and injuries and any allegations of use of force by authorities during the rioting.</p>
<hr>
<p>CAIRO — Yemen’s health minister affiliated with the Houthi rebels has announced the first coronavirus death in the rebel-controlled northern part of the country.</p>
<p>Taha al-Motawakel says a Somali migrant who died Sunday in a hotel in the capital Sanaa tested positive for the virus. He didn’t provide details about other confirmed cases in areas under Houthi control.</p>
<p>The surfacing of the pandemic in Yemen has stoked fears that an outbreak could devastate its already crippled health care system.</p>
<p>Yemen’s civil war erupted in 2014, when the rebels seized Sanaa, and much of the country’s north. The U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened to oust the rebels and restore the internationally recognized government. The conflict has killed more than 100,000 people and settled into a bloody stalemate.</p>
<p>The latest coronavirus death brings the total confirmed cases to 22 and three deaths across the country.</p>
<hr>
<p>ATHENS, Greece — Greece’s prime minister says it appears “absolutely feasible” for restaurants and cafes to reopen on June 1 if the coronavirus outbreak keeps slowing.</p>
<p>On Monday, Greece reported two deaths and six confirmed infections, bringing the total death toll to 146, with confirmed infections at 2,632.</p>
<p>Greece began easing its lockdown measures on Monday, with the opening of a limited number of retail businesses, such as beauty salons and bookshops, and people allowed to leave their homes.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis held a video conference with several cabinet members Tuesday to discuss how to reopen the restaurant and café sector while maintaining social distancing regulations. One possibility was increasing the outdoor space for tables and chairs.</p>
<p>Greece imposed a lockdown early on in its coronavirus outbreak, a move credited with containing the number of deaths.</p>
<hr>
<p>LONDON — Scotland’s leader Nicola Sturgeon has outlined how lockdown restrictions could be relaxed while stressing the move is not imminent.</p>
<p>Sturgeon says Scotland was at a “critical” moment and the lockdown will be extended for another three-week period after the next review on Thursday.</p>
<p>However, she says the first loosening considered by the government would be time spent outdoors. Other discussions relate to easing restrictions on community care services and businesses.</p>
<p>She says it’s too early to reopen schools and they possibly won’t reopen before the summer holidays.</p>
<p>Sturgeon says it’s preferred all four nations of the U.K. — England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — should move together on easing the lockdown.</p>
<hr>
<p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Dutch riot police have arrested some demonstrators who gathered in The Hague to call for an end to the partial coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Authorities in the city allowed the unannounced demonstration by a few hundred people near the city’s central railway station on condition that the protesters maintained social distancing.</p>
<p>However, the mayor withdrew permission when demonstrators refused to follow police instructions and officers, supported by police on horseback, began detaining people. Police didn’t immediately say how many people were arrested.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has been in what Prime Minister Mark Rutte calls an “intelligent lockdown” since mid-March. Schools, bars, restaurants and museums are closed and people are urged to work from home and practice social distancing outside.</p>
<p>The first gradual easing came last week when young children resumed sports training. Elementary schools are due to reopen next week.</p>
<hr>
<p>NEW DELHI, India — India has discovered two viral clusters since it partly lifted the nationwide lockdown on Monday, contributing to the largest single-day spike in cases and deaths in 24 hours.</p>
<p>There’s been a total of 3,900 infection cases and 195 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking India’s total to more than 46,000 cases and more than 1,500 dead.</p>
<p>The Health ministry says the spike was due to late reporting of information by several state governments.</p>
<p>A vegetable and fruit market in Chennai, a southern Indian city, has been linked to more than 300 cases. Many of those who had been working in the market, which is among the largest in the country, had returned to their villages due to the lockdown and public health officials are now trying to retrace their footsteps.</p>
<p>In Tripura, a state in India’s north-east, which shares a border with Bangladesh, a total of 27 new cases were reported, of which 13 were linked to the Border Security Force or BSF, the country’s border guarding force.</p>
<hr>
<p>ROME — Italian experts are warning a second wave of coronavirus infections will most certainly accompany Italy’s gradual reopening from Europe’s first lockdown.</p>
<p>They are calling for intensified efforts to identify possible new victims, monitor their symptoms and trace their contacts</p>
<p>Dr. Silvio Brusaferro, president of the Superior Institute of Health, briefed a Senate committee on Tuesday about the next phase of Italy’s coronavirus pandemic. He joined experts a day after 4.4 million Italians went back to work and restrictions on personal movement were eased for the first time in two months.</p>
<p>Brusaferro says the key to keeping the outbreak under control lies in the early isolation of people with suspected infection, more tests and the quarantine of their close contacts. He says it will require “a huge investment” of resources for training medical personnel to monitor possible new cases. He adds any phone app that can help trace contacts, while useful, doesn’t substitute for the actions of people.</p>
<p>The head of the institute’s infectious disease department, Dr. Giovanni Rezza, told La Repubblica the coming weeks were essentially an “experiment” to see how the infection curve reacts to the easing of the lockdown and production shutdown.</p>
<p>“We are not out of the epidemic. We are still in it. I don’t want people to think there’s no more risk and we go back to normal,” Rezza told La Repubblica.</p>
<p>In Italy’s hard-hit northern Lombardy, tens of thousands of sick overwhelmed the health care system. Scientists say a second wave of infection would particularly hit the south, which didn’t have many infections.</p>
<hr>
<p>BERLIN — The German government and the country’s automakers plan to discuss stimulus measures to promote modern technology.</p>
<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, says the German leader and several ministers held a telephone conference Tuesday with the chief executives of automakers in Germany and the head of the IG Metall industrial union.</p>
<p>Germany is home to automakers such as Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW, and the sector is a crucial employer in Europe’s biggest economy. The companies are restarting production in Europe after the coronavirus pandemic brought it to a near-standstill.</p>
<p>Seibert says participants agreed a working group should discuss economic stimulus measures “that constitute a contribution to modernization in the direction of innovative vehicle technologies.” He says they aim to discuss the results in early June.</p>
<hr>
<p>LONDON — The British government’s chief scientific adviser has acknowledged that the country should have been testing more people for the new coronavirus early in the country’s outbreak.</p>
<p>Patrick Vallance told Parliament’s health committee that “if we’d managed to ramp up testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial, and for all sorts of reasons that didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>Critics say Britain’s Conservative government responded too slowly when COVID-19 began to spread, and failed to contain the outbreak by widely testing people with symptoms, then tracing and isolating the contacts of infected people.</p>
<p>Countries that did that, including South Korea and Germany, have recorded lower death rates than those that did not.</p>
<p>The U.K. has recently expanded its testing capacity and is setting up a “test, track and trace” program as it looks to relax a nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>Britain is one of the world’s hardest-hit countries in the pandemic, and looks likely to overtake Italy for the largest number of COVID-19 deaths in Europe.</p>
<hr>
<p>BERLIN — Several German states are setting out plans to reopen restaurants and hotels in the coming weeks — the latest step in a gradual restart of public life.</p>
<p>Governor Markus Soeder of Bavaria, the state with Germany’s highest per capita coronavirus infection rate, on Tuesday set out what he said is a cautious plan to reopen the hospitality sector in his region.</p>
<p>Soeder says restaurants can serve outdoors starting May 18 and indoors a week later, with limited numbers of customers, limited opening times and strict hygiene precautions. Starting May 30, hotels can welcome tourists — though without opening saunas or swimming pools.</p>
<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel and state governors plan to consult Wednesday on Germany’s next steps in loosening coronavirus restrictions. But individual states, which are responsible for imposing and lifting lockdowns, increasingly are pressing ahead with announcing proposals of their own.</p>
<p>The northern state of Lower Saxony on Monday proposed opening restaurants on May 11 and hotels on May 25. The Baltic Sea region of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania wants to open restaurants on Saturday, with hotels welcoming locals from May 18 and guests from other German regions a week later.</p>
<hr>
<p>COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Churches in Norway can again carry out ceremonies as of May 10.</p>
<p>However, there can be a maximum of 50 people in churches, and there must be at least one meter (3.3 feet) between church goers.</p>
<p>Bishop Atle Sommerfeldt, the head of the Church of Norway, told The Associated Press that he is pleased more people will attend baptisms, weddings, funerals, and regular services.</p>
<p>Like elsewhere, priests in Norway, a predominantly Lutheran country, have carried out online services during the lockdown. Norwegian churches shut down March 12, the Norwegian news agency NTB wrote.</p>
<hr>
<p>TEHRAN, Iran — Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency says the country’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has spoken over the phone with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s report says the two discussed bilateral cooperation on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, and during the phone call, Rouhani thanked the Japanese government for its humanitarian assistance to Iran on combating the virus.</p>
<p>Rouhani was quoted as saying that with the “escalation of the United States’ cruel and inhumane sanctions against Iran,” the country faces “many problems today, even in the field of medical equipment and food supply.”</p>
<p>Iran, which has been the hardest-hit country in the Middle East in the pandemic, says its death toll rose to over 6,300 after 63 more people died on Monday. The Health Ministry’s spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour, says Iran has so far confirmed nearly 100,000 cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>STOCKHOLM — A Swedish newspaper says a technology institute in Sweden has found large concentrations of the coronavirus in Stockholm’s sewage system.</p>
<p>The analysis by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology was made in the purification plant in Bromma, west of the capital. The institute told Dagens Nyheter, one of Sweden’s largest newspapers, that the test that can predict a second virus wave.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of April samples have been taken from two treatment plants in Stockholm with the purpose of monitoring how the amount of virus residues develop over time, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Initial results showed the highest virus concentration at the Bromma waste water treatment plant, which handles wastewater from northern Stockholm suburbs. At another treatment plant, an increase in the content between the first and second samples was seen.</p>
<p>The institute told Dagens Nyheter that the survey had quickly grown into an international research project involving six countries. No one at the institute was immediately available for comments.</p>
<p>There are no known cases of infection spreading through wastewater or drinking water.</p>
<hr>
<p>MADRID — Spain added 185 recorded deaths to its coronavirus tally, now counting a total of 25,613 diagnosed patients who succumbed to the COVID-19 disease.</p>
<p>The figures, which are in line with the overall slowdown of the pandemic in the country, don’t include thousands more who have died in nursing homes in March and April before they could be tested.</p>
<p>Despite the country’s limited ability to conduct tests until recently, health ministry data showed infections rose on Tuesday to 250,000, including some 30,000 identified by antibody tests after showing no symptoms or overcoming the disease.</p>
<p>Most new infections are happening among health workers, the data showed.</p>
<p>Top health official Fernando Simón says the easing trend is clear and the goal is avoiding any rebound of the outbreak. He says more than 123,000 people have recovered from the disease.</p>
<p>Spain this week started to roll back from a lockdown in place since mid-March, one of the world’s strictest.</p>
<hr>
<p>LONDON — New figures show Britain has had more than 30,000 deaths among people with the coronavirus, possibly a third more than the official count.</p>
<p>The Office for National Statistics says there were 29,710 deaths involving COVID-19 in England and Wales through April 24 — 34% more than the government’s figure of 22,173 for the same period. Deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland, collected separately, push the number over 30,000.</p>
<p>Britain’s official death toll, which includes cases where there was a positive test for the virus, stands at 28,734, just behind Italy’s 29,079 and the third-highest in the world.</p>
<p>The statistics office data, which is published with a 10-day lag, includes deaths where COVID-19 is suspected, even if there was no test.</p>
<p>Scientists say it will be hard to determine the total toll from the disease until there are complete statistics for excess mortality during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Britain’s statistics office says the number of total deaths registered in the week to April 24 was slightly lower than the previous week, but still more than double the five-year average.</p>
<hr>
<p>NEW DELHI — Authorities in India’s capital are imposing a special tax of 70% on liquor purchases to dissuade huge gatherings a day after thirsty drinkers formed long queues at stores across the country.</p>
<p>The new tax on retail liquor purchases in New Delhi is called the “special corona fee.” It will be effective from Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday, after some lockdown restrictions were eased, thousands turned up at liquor stores without following social distancing guidelines. This led the authorities to shut many of the liquor shops. In some places, officers had to resort to baton-charge to disperse crowds.</p>
<p>The ban on liquor sales formed an important component of the ongoing six-week countrywide lockdown and was meant to rein the pandemic by limiting social gatherings. The ban, however, also deprived state governments in India of tax revenue.</p>
<p>India has recorded nearly 45,000 cases and more than 1,500 deaths. On Tuesday, the country reported almost 3,900 new infections for its highest single day rise.</p>
<p>The pace of infection is growing in India and experts say the virus still hasn’t reached its peak.</p>
<hr>
<p>BERLIN — The head of Germany’s national disease control center says there will be a second wave of coronavirus infections, but his country is well-prepared to deal with it.</p>
<p>Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute, was responding Tuesday to a question about whether a planned contact-tracing app is still relevant given that new infections have slowed significantly. Wieler put the current reproduction rate in Germany — the number of other people whom one person with the virus infects — at 0.71.</p>
<p>However, Wieler pointed to the nature of a pandemic and says “we know with great certainty that there will be a second wave — the majority of scientists is sure of that. And many also assume that there will be a third wave.” He says that means “this app is not coming too late.”</p>
<p>Wieler says Germany’s “preparation is definitely better” for a second wave. He added a lot has been done in recent months and doctors know more about how to deal with COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Germany is currently in the process of loosening restrictions imposed in March to slow the initial coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<hr>
<p>WAGAH, India — Nearly 200 Pakistanis stranded in a nationwide coronavirus lockdown on the other side of the border in India are crossing back home.</p>
<p>Border security forces allowed masked passengers in private vehicles with luggage strapped to roofs to cross the Attari-Wagah border that separates the sprawling Punjab region split between Indian and Pakistan. The border opened Tuesday for the first time since the ongoing lockdown began on March 24.</p>
<p>India has recorded nearly 45,000 cases and more than 1,500 deaths. The lockdown was partially lifted on Monday to allow some employment for the millions of daily wage workers who have survived only on donated food. But the pace of infection is growing and experts say the virus still hasn’t reached its peak in India.</p>

<h3 id="bishop-of-durham-calls-for-an-end-to-two-child-benefits-rule-to-fight-child-poverty">&ldquo;Bishop of Durham calls for an end to &lsquo;two-child&rsquo; benefits rule to fight child poverty&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article15121278.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TMP_NEC_131217BishopDurhamButler14JPG.jpg" alt="img">

<p>The Bishop of Durham has urged the Government to scrap rules which limit benefits for families with more than two children, saying it will drive thousands of families into poverty.</p>
<p>The Rt Revd Paul Butler was one of the speakers at a seminar at Newcastle University, where more than 130 representatives of organisations from across the North East met to debate ways of cutting child poverty.</p>
<p>The previous Labour government set a target of ending child poverty by 2020 but 4.1 million children across the country, including 209,000 in the North East, are still growing up poor.</p>
<p>Bishop Paul said: &ldquo;There are steps that can be taken such as lifting the benefit freeze, which the Government has announced will be lifted in April 2020 – but unless it is lifted so that full value of the benefits is restored to where it was four years ago before the freeze started then the levels of income will still be down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the things that I will be talking about at the conference is the impact of the two child limit on those claiming universal credit – which whilst it only started in April 2017 and hasn’t had a large impact yet, longer term is going to be the main driver of putting another 300,000 children into poverty across the country. So I have long argued that policy should be removed.”</p>
<p>The two child limit restricts the support provided to families through the benefits system, including through tax credits, Housing Benefit or Universal Credit, to two children. Subsequent children born on or after 6 April 2017 are not entitled to the “child element” of tax credits or Universal Credit, which is worth £2,780 a year.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions, including children who are born as a result of rape. Data published last year revealed there had been 510 exceptions made on these grounds, which means hundreds of women have been forced to tell officials in the benefits office that they were raped. However, critics of the policy point out that separate data shows half of women who have suffered the most serious sexual offences never report the offence to the police, and over a quarter never tell anyone about it.</p>
<p>Bishop Paul said he believed the target of ending child poverty was achievable.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I don’t think that the target set by Tony Blair was unrealistic back when it was set. There were policies in place which were beginning to see the numbers drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let’s be clear, ‘eradicate’ didn’t mean that there would be no children in poverty at all, it meant that it would be down below 5% and I think that was probably doable, but changes in policy has now meant that it is on the increase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we talk about child poverty, the definition it is worked out from the median income for families, and it is families where their income is below that level that are defined as having Child Poverty. Absolute poverty is where they are stuck in that for the long term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadly there are children that are in this situation, where they don’t have the basic necessities that we would all expect including such things as shoes, food and suitable accommodation and this has a knock on effect on their health – physical and mental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being poor as a child could affect people for their whole lives, he said.</p>
<p>“We know a lot about the impact on the earliest years of life having a long term impact – even before a child starts school – if their development hasn’t happened appropriately, it doesn’t mean that projecting forward they are likely to remain in poverty but they are much more likely to have a range of social issues including mental health than others.&rdquo;
