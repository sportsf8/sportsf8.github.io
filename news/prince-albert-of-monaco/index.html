<p>Prince Albert II of Monaco BBC / Spun Gold TV / Palais Princier</p>
<p>For many, Monaco conjures up images of billionaires, super-yachts and casinos, not to mention its status as a tax-free haven for the super-rich. Yet its ruling family would like that to change, as seen in a new three-part documentary series starting on BBC Two tonight.</p>
<p>Inside Monaco has rare access to the House of Grimaldi, featuring interviews with Prince Albert II and his wife Princess Charlene, as well as offering a behind-the-scenes look at the Formula 1 Grand Prix, plus Monaco&rsquo;s glamorous casinos and hotels, including a new suite inspired by one of its most famous residents, Princess Grace.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Yet behind the fast cars and the playboy setting, Monaco has the oldest population in the world, with the 40,000 residents having an average age of 52. Some of the most famous include Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green (68), Walgreens share holder Stefano Pessina (79) and Sir David and Frederick Barclay, owners of The Telegraph (85).</p>

<p>This is something the principality is keen to change, with the newly launched Monaco Influencer Awards hoping to attract bright young things (with money) to the glamorous Cote d&rsquo;Azur location.</p>
<p>It is the brainchild of Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a close friend of Prince Albert, who married Prince Charles of Bourbon in a glittering ceremony in Monaco in 1998.</p>

We don’t want that, we want Monaco to be the glamorous place, the diamond place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of Monaco&rsquo;s famous paparazzi ban, she says that the youth now are more comfortable with taking photographs, &lsquo;Royalty often grows up saying you should not take pictures. We have a different approach to everything that has to have social media. Tonight we are posting everywhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the documentary, Prince Albert opens up about life as a royal, saying: &lsquo;I can’t say that every day is wonderful bliss and enjoyment. It’s not easy for anybody in a position of responsibility. There are some very unpleasant meetings. I try to think what nice things will come after my meetings are over&hellip; having a nice glass of wine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He also talks about his parents. Of his father, Prince Rainier III, he says, &lsquo;We did behave when we knew that he was watching. He had ways of raising his voice that was impressive for a six, seven, eight, nine or ten-year-old. Even at 21.&rsquo; And of his mother, Princess Grace, &lsquo;It’s just incredible that so many years after her passing she still very much has a vivid presence in a lot of people’s minds and hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the documentary crew are given a sneak peek at a new £35,000-a-night hotel suite at the Hôtel de Paris which was inspired by Grace Kelly, with the design overseen by Albert himself.</p>

We take a closer look at His Serene Highness Albert II, Prince of Monaco the head of the princely house of Grimaldi and the current reigning Prince of Monaco.</p>
<p>In times of hardship and uncertainty, we can always count on our royal family to inspire and encourage us to never give up, and that is precisely what is happening right now!</p>
<p>For those of you with a keen interest in the monarchy and royalty from around the world, today we’re going to be looking at one of the lesser-known prominent royal figures, who also happens to be one of the wealthiest.</p>
<p>Yes, we’re looking at the reigning prince of Monaco, Prince Albert II.</p>
<p>If you’ve always been interested in the monarchy and are looking to use these next several weeks productively to help you to expand your knowledge on the subject, and learn some fun facts in the process, this upcoming bio will be very much to your liking.</p>
<p>Here’s a brief, yet detailed look at His Serene Highness Albert II, Prince of Monaco.</p>
<p>Who is Albert II, Prince of Monaco?</p>
<p>Prince Albert II of Monaco is currently the head of the princely house of Grimaldi and is the reigning Prince of Monaco.</p>
<p>He currently rules over Monaco and took over back in 2005, in April, when his father Rainier III sadly passed away.</p>
<p>Grace Kelly on her wedding day in 1956.</p>
<p>Albert is the only son and the middle child of the late Rainier III and Grace Kelly. Yes, THE Grace Kelly, who became Princess of Monaco when she married Prince Rainier III back in 1956.</p>
<p>Grace Kelly and Prince Rainier III on their wedding day.</p>
<p>His Serene Highness Prince Albert is currently one of the wealthiest royals on the planet, as he has personal assets which are valued at upwards of $1 Billion. Of these assets, land located in both France and Monaco, makes up a very healthy portion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Albert owns a great deal of shares in Societe des bains de mer de Monaco, which actually operates Monaco’s casino venues, as well as other entertainment properties located in the principality.</p>
<p>Early Life</p>
<p>Albert Alexandre Loius Pierre Grimaldi was born on the 14th of March, 1958, to Prince Rainier III and Grace, the Princess of Monaco – formerly known as Grace Kelly, the world-famous actress.</p>
<p>Born in the Prince’s Palace of Monaco, Albert has ancestry from many countries in Europe, as well as North America.</p>
<p>Albert was a very well-travelled young man. In his youth, he attended Amherst College, Massachusetts, as well as serving a brief stint in the French Navy.</p>
<p>In 1982, when his mother sadly passed away, Albert became the president of the Monaco Red Cross. He was, and still is in fact, a very charitable individual and he would go on to become actively involved in a wide range of different charities.</p>
<p>Sports and Olympics</p>
<p>He is also a very active individual and is an avid sportsman.</p>
<p>In 1987 for example, he would form the Monegasque Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation and was a five-time Olympian as part of the principality’s bobsled team.</p>
<p>In 1994, he became chair of Monaco’s Olympic committee, with many agreeing that he has worked wonders at helping the Olympics to become even more prestigious and popular within the principality. In 2012, Prince Albert was appointed as the patron of the World Olympians Association.</p>
<p>Controversy</p>
<p>As the media can’t resist a good royal scandal, back in 2005, days after the passing of his father, the media, as sensitively as ever considering he was grieving, drew the public’s attention to the fact that Albert had fathered a child out of wedlock.</p>
<p>A year later, Albert would go on to admit that he had also fathered a daughter.</p>
<p>The two children were consequently barred from inheriting the throne.</p>
<p>In 2011, Albert married a competitive swimmer from South Africa named Charlene Wittstock, and in 2014, the couple welcomed twin daughters into the world.</p>
<p>Most recently, His Serene Highness Albert II Prince of Monaco became the first Royal to have contracted COVID-19. Shortly after, it was confirmed that His Royal Highness Prince Charles also had contracted the virus. Thankfully, both royals have since received a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>Prince Albert and his wife Princess Charlene continue to work tirelessly to promote and drive progress within and towards the Principality of Monaco.

<h3 id="prince-albert-ii-chooses-next-head-of-government">&ldquo;Prince Albert II chooses next head of government&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.monaco-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pierre-dartout.jpg" alt="img">
Prince Albert II of Monaco has chosen Pierre Dartout to become the next head of the Prince’s Government, according to Palace representatives. The prefect of the French region Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA) will replace Serge Telle, who has been Minister of State since February 2016. The Sovereign is yet to announce the appointment officially.</p>
<p>As Monaco’s new Minister of State, Pierre Dartout, 66, will be responsible for presenting bills to Prince Albert II and directing the administration of the Principality. This post is typically reserved for a senior French civil servant, with the French presidential palace submitting a list to the Prince of names they deem suitable for the role. The Sovereign has already met Pierre Dartout during engagements in the PACA region. “The prefect of Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur was one of the figures that the Sovereign had imagined as Minister of State”, stated the Prince’s Palace to Monaco Matin.</p>
<p>Pierre Dartout</p>
<p>Born in 1954 in Limoges, Pierre Dartout has held numerous prefectural posts in France for a quarter of a century. Before taking up his position in Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur, Pierre Dartout was prefect of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, the prefect for defence and security for the South-West region, and prefect of La Gironde in 2015. He graduated in the 1980 class at the Ecole Nationale d’Administration (National School of Administration), the most prestigious school for those entering into the French civil service. He was prefect of French Guiana between 1995 and 1997, the Eastern Pyrenees between 1998 and 2000, and the Var region in 2004.</p>
<p>According to the financial newspaper Les Echos, Dartout is due to take up the post at the beginning of September, “the Élysée (presidential palace) wanting him to remain as prefect of the PACA region and Bouches-du-Rhône during the critical period that is ending lockdown.”

Monaco&rsquo;s royal family turned out in force to open the newly renovated Place du Casino in Monte Carlo today.</p>
<p>Prince Albert, 62, and wife Princess Charlene, 42, donned face masks printed with the Grimaldi family crest, proving they are taking no chances with their health even though the prince has already had coronavirus.</p>
<p>They were joined at the event by Albert&rsquo;s sister Princess Stephanie, 55, and her three children, Pauline Ducruet, Camille Gottlieb, and Louis Ducruet, who attended with his wife Marie.</p>
<p>Staying safe: Prince Albert, 62, and wife Princess Charlene, 42, donned face masks printed with the Grimaldi family crest, proving they are taking no chances with their health</p>
<p>Like mother, like daughter: They were joined at the event by Albert&rsquo;s sister Princess Stephanie, 55, and her three children, Pauline Ducruet (pictured), Camille Gottlieb, and Louis Ducruet</p>
<p>Helping hand: Eldest son Louis, 27, reaches across to help Stephanie of Monaco with her mask</p>
<p>Family event: Stephanie of Monaco (far right) with her son Louis (pictured with wife Marie in red), and daughters Camille (centre) and Pauline (second from left)) at the event today</p>
<p>It is thought to be the most high profile outing undertaken by the Monegasque royals since the start of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The Place du Casino, or casino square, has undergone extensive renovations and now features a larger pedestrianised area.</p>
<p>The family looked typically elegant for the engagement, with Stephanie choosing a classic combination of a black shirt and loose wide-leg white trousers.</p>
<p>Her daughter Pauline, 26, complimented her mother&rsquo;s outfit in a cream wrap silk shirt dress, which she wore with a simple pair of nude strap sandals.</p>
<p>Camille, 21, whose father is Princess Stephanie&rsquo;s former bodyguard Jean Raymond Gottlieb, put on a chic display in a cream shirt and flowing floral trousers, while her brother Louis, 27, looked dapper in a suit.</p>
<p>Closer than ever: Charlene and Albert put on an affectionate display in Monte Carlo today</p>
<p>Polished perfection: Princess Charlene wore a floral dress with a white blazer for the outing</p>
<p>Arm in arm: Charlene held on tight to Albert&rsquo;s arm as they arrived for the photo call</p>
<p>Back to work: The engagement is thought to be the couple&rsquo;s first since the COVID-19 outbreak</p>
<p>Support: Princess Charlene held onto her husband&rsquo;s arm as they posed for the cameras</p>
<p>Well-dressed: The couple cut an elegant figure as they arrived at the event together</p>
<p>Official duties: The royal couple were on hand to open the square in the heart of Monte Carlo</p>
<p>Princess Charlene, who held onto her husband&rsquo;s arm, wore a mid-length floral dress with a cropped white blazer for the occasion.</p>
<p>It is thought to be the first time Princess Charlene has been seen in public for at least two months.</p>
<p>The mother-of-two and their twins, Jacques and Gabriella, lived separately to Albert while he was in isolation with COVID-19 in March.</p>
<p>Speaking on how the family kept in touch, Albert told People magazine: &lsquo;We FaceTimed — usually in the evenings. We told stories and talked about what we did during the day.</p>
<p>Family business: Princess Stephanie (in navy shirt) with daughters Camille (centre) and Pauline (right) and daughter-in-law Marie (left) at the event in Monte Carlo today</p>
<p>Lookalike daughter: Princess Stephanie (in navy) with daughter Pauline Ducruet at the event</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told [the twins] to be safe. They knew I was sick and that I had to stay away. I&rsquo;m hoping I get a &lsquo;Welcome Home&rsquo; banner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The royal palace confirmed Prince Albert of Monaco had tested positive for coronavirus on 19 March - which made him the first known head of state to be infected with the virus.</p>
<p>He was monitored by his personal doctor and by specialists at the Princess Grace Hospital Centre, which is named after his mother Grace Kelly.

<h3 id="prince-albert-ii-and-his-passion-for-the-seas">&ldquo;Prince Albert II and his passion for the seas&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.monaco-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/bernard-fautrier-et-pierre-frolla-palais-princier.jpg" alt="img">
As if in tribute to his great-great-grandfather Prince Albert I, H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco is passionate not only about the sea but also environmental issues.</p>
<p>Born 14th March 1958, Prince Albert II is the eldest son of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace. Thanks to his father and older predecessor Prince Albert I, who was a pioneer of oceanography, the Sovereign Prince has always had a passion for the deep sea.</p>
<p>The Prince’s commitment to the environment</p>
<p>Thus, one hundred years after his great-great-grandfather conducted an Arctic exploration campaign in the Svalbard Archipelago, he travelled to the North Pole by dogsled from the Russian base of Barneo in April 2006. The 120-kilometre crossing aimed to highlight the problems surrounding global warming.</p>
<p>The environment is undoubtedly at the heart of the Prince’s concerns. This is why a few weeks after this Arctic expedition, in June 2006, he created the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation to promote sustainable development worldwide. To raise funds, the Foundation organises a major gala every year in favour of ocean protection, the Monte-Carlo Gala for the Global Ocean. The next edition should take place on 24th September at the Opéra Garnier in Monaco.</p>

<p>The Sovereign’s actions have not stopped there. In January 2009, Prince Albert II of Monaco embarked on a three-week scientific voyage to Antarctica to reach the South Pole, accompanied by explorer Mike Horn. The film “Antarctica 2009, land on alert” tells the story of this exploration.</p>
<p>On 20th October of the same year, he was awarded the Teddy Roosevelt Medal in recognition of his commitment to the environment. Other recognitions for his actions have included the Blue Legacy Award, presented to the Sovereign in 2015 as part of the Blue Ocean Film Festival in Monaco.</p>
<p>Diving enthusiast</p>
<p>Prince Albert II has always had a passion for scuba diving and often takes the opportunity to don the oxygen tank. Although usually for good deeds and awareness campaigns, he has sometimes gone diving for more unusual appointments. This is how, in July 2015, he attended the underwater wedding of world freediving champion Pierre Frolla. In the end, Prince Albert II, a friend of Pierre, had to remain on the surface during the ceremony because he had to take a flight just a few hours after.</p>
<p>In the autumn of that same year, Albert II went diving in the Larvotto nature reserve, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Monegasque Association for the Protection of Nature. The Sovereign dived 8 metres down, where there is a plaque in homage to the creator of the association, Eugène Debernardi.</p>
<p>Marine and underwater expeditions</p>
<p>In September 2017, Prince Albert II took a seat onboard the Yersin, Monaco’s exploration vessel, for the first stage of the Monaco Explorations programme, not far from Madeira. Its objective was to map the area to protect the ecosystem, the Sovereign taking part in one of the dives organised by scientists Rosa and Sergio Pereira.</p>
<p>Last February, Prince Albert II joined the Caladan Ocean expedition, led by the explorer Victor Vescovo. Onboard the Triton 36000/2 capsule, also known as DSV Limiting Factoous, both descended into the Calypso Trench, the deepest point in the Mediterranean Sea, at a depth of 5,109m.</p>
<p>Through all these actions, Prince Albert II has thus left his mark in the environmental movement and, more specifically, the preservation of the seas and oceans. Just like his great-great-grandfather, one hundred years ago.

<h3 id="a-long-and-happy-love-story-monacos-history-with-sport">&ldquo;A long and happy love story: Monaco’s history with sport&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.monaco-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2048x1536-fit_st-moritz-championnat.jpeg" alt="img">
Home of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, the Principality of Monaco has been one of the world’s leading sports venues for decades. Here’s why.</p>
<p>An intimately entwined relationship with no sign of stopping in sight, Monaco has always been synonymous with sport on the Rock. As the epicentre of a handful of the world’s biggest sporting events, the Principality is a true model of urban planning when it comes to its facilities.</p>
<p>Despite its small surface area, little over 2 km2, Monaco is home to the Stade Louis II, the heart and soul of the territory, which homes an unsuspected number of disciplines. The water sports centre, sports hall, dojo, fencing and boxing hall all quietly sit below the stadium’s pitch which itself has seen some of the most prestigious teams in Europe challenge the Rock’s very own AS Monaco. Many world athletics stars have crossed its hallowed track, thanks to the Herculis Meeting which takes place every summer. The formidable showcase of Monaco’s architecture, way ahead of its time, was built in 1985, reflecting Monaco’s love of sport.</p>
<p>If Louis II has not satisfied your sporting appetite, the streets of the Principality often transform into a life-size playground. The whole Rock lights up with a thousand lights throughout the year as sporting events follow one another in the Principality, from the Formula 1 Grand Prix, Jumping International and Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters at the Country Club. A country of champions, Monaco is home to many sportsmen and women, some of whom, in addition to having written their own history on the Rock, reside all year round on the Mediterranean shores.</p>
<p>Sport in Monaco: a family affair</p>
<p>As a stronghold of world sport, Monaco hosts the SPORTEL Awards, a conference which brings together decision-makers from the media and sporting industries. Playing a pivotal role in significant sport advances worldwide, Monaco has the unwavering support of the HSH Prince Albert II. After all, it is the result of the passionate sportspeople of the Princely Family that makes Monaco’s roots in it so strong.</p>
<p>Jack Kelly, the Sovereign’s maternal grandfather and father of Grace Kelly, was an Olympic rowing champion at the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games. President of the Monegasque Olympic Committee, which brings together twenty federations and prepares athletes to compete for the Olympic Games, Prince Albert II continually strives to make Monaco a sporting stronghold. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, the son of Prince Rainier III took part in five Olympic Winter Games on the bobsleigh team (Calgary 1988, Albertville 1992, Lillehammer 1994, Nagano 1998 and Salt Lake City 2002).</p>
<p>More recently, Princess Charlene of Monaco, the Prince’s wife and ex-swimmer became involved by putting forward an official car to take part in the forthcoming virtual 24 Hours of Le Mans (June 13-14th), a unique endurance race involving professional drivers and Esport specialists. The team is composed of Francesco Castellacci, Felipe Masa, Giancarlo Fisichella and Tony Mella.</p>
<p>“Being starter of the 87th 24 Hours of Le Mans was an unforgettable moment, and I am grateful to the Automobile Club de l’Ouest for offering me the opportunity to experience it,” said Princess Charlene. “This year we forge more ties between Monaco and Le Mans, both well-known for motorsport, with the #54 Strong Together team that will be racing under the banner of my foundation and the flag of the Principality.” It is set to be yet another way of positioning Monaco centre on the worldwide sporting stage.</p>
<p>Physical education at the heart of the national curriculum</p>
<p>The Prince’s Government has put in place a policy focused on three primary objectives: the development of sport in schools, the promotion of mass sport and the encouragement of competitive sport. To meet the first point, the Government has included physical education and swimming lessons in the timetable, which are taught from a young age by specialised teachers. School buildings are equipped with sports facilities for more conventional sports, both group and individual. With nearly a hundred sports associations, many of which receive state funding, young Monegasques can practise a multitude of disciplines.</p>
<p>Secondary school pupils benefit from a large number of hours of training due to many classes offered at flexible hours. In line with the status of high-level Olympic sportsman, which was introduced to encourage the participation of national sportspeople in significant events such as the Olympic Games, sport is encouraged in all areas of life in Monaco. Through the Monegasque Olympic Committee, national athletes can benefit from assistance in their Olympic training.
