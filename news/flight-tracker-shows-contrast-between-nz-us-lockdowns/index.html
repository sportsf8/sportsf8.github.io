A live flight tracker reveals the impressive impact on New Zealand&rsquo;s travel restrictions compared to the United States of America (US).</p>
<p>Nanotechnologist Dr Michelle Dickinson, also known as Nanogirl, shared a surreal tweet comparing flights operating in New Zealand to the US.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Zealand early lockdown has to be one of the best in the world. Was just looking for flights &amp; found 1 cargo plane,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then thought I&rsquo;d look at what the plane travel situation looked like for the country with the highest number of confirmed #COVID-19 cases in the world the USA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The US currently has at least 139,745 cases, 2448 deaths with 4435 recovered from the illness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New Zealand has much lower statistics - including 476 cases, 38 probable cases, 1 death and 56 recovered.</p>
<p>At 11.59pm on Wednesday, New Zealand went into lockdown and the country&rsquo;s borders closed to almost all travellers - not including New Zealand residents.</p>
<p>Some exceptions include: humanitarian reasons, health and other essential workers</p>
<p>citizens of Samoa and Tonga for essential travel to New Zealand, the holder of a visitor visa who is the partner or dependent of a temporary work or student visa holder, and who normally lives in New Zealand and is currently in New Zealand.</p>
<p>No other foreign traveller can now enter New Zealand.</p>
<p>Regional flights are allowed for those who have returned from international travel in Auckland and need to make their way home to their region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the US, according to the CDC only foreigners from a certain number of countries are banned from entering, including:</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Iran</p>
<p>European Schengen Area (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Monaco, San Marino, Vatican City)</p>
<p>United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland)</p>
<p>Republic of Ireland</p>
<p>Currently, regional flights are still allowed in America, which implicate one of the fundamental premises of the union among the 50 states: the right of American citizens to travel among them freely.</p>
<p>Today at 10.48am, Flight Radar showed that at least 1500 flights were operating in the US, while New Zealand had at least 17.</p>
<p>The CDC, who do not generally issue advisories or restrictions for travel within the US, urged citizens to consider taking precautions including checking if there are Covid-19 cases in the area they are travelling to.</p>
<p>New York remained the hardest hit, with more than 52,000 confirmed cases and at least 728 deaths.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s day-long dance over whether he would order a federal quarantine of the New York City metro region ended with him ultimately retracting the idea.

<p>Flights across the UK’s airspace have dramatically decreased as major airlines ground planes to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Images using data from flight tracking service Flight Radar 24 reveals a massive reduction in planes flying over the country.</p>
<p>Thousands fewer planes are flying as countrys around the world go into lockdown and major ailines cut services.</p>
<p>British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have reduced the number of planes they fly by 90%. According to the International Air Transport Association, it now expects 2020 air traffic to fall by 38 per cent in total before embarking on a recoverylater this year.</p>

<p>Low cost airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet are planning to ground their entire fleets over the coming weeks. Others such as Thai Airways International have already cancelled almost all their international flights from today as a result of the pandemic.</p>

<p>IATA has warned that many airlines are facing collapse and will require substantial government rescue packages.</p>

<p>Last week Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was preparing a package to help the aviation industry, rumoured to include a multi-billion-pound deal which could have seen the Government purchase stakes in the hardest-hit airlines.</p>
<p>However, he has reportedly now told industry leaders the Treasury will provide support only ‘as a last resort’ and if individual companies have ‘exhausted other options’ such as raising extra capital from investors.</p>
<p>The Airport Operators Association accused the government of abandoning the sector.</p>
<p>British Airways said it has cut up to 90% of its flights (Credits: PA)</p>
<p>Chief executive Karen Dee said: ‘Our industry will now have to fight on its own to protect its workforce and its future.</p>
<p>‘With passenger numbers approaching close to zero, airports have seen a major drop in revenue.</p>
<p>‘They are taking unprecedented steps to safeguard airport staff and operations, which could include in some cases considering shutting down for a period of time. This could have major impacts for UK communities and businesses.’</p>
<p>The AOA has demanded a support package including extending business rate relief to airports and deferring all aviation taxes.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Heathrow Airport said it is working with airlines to bring Britons who are stuck abroad home as quickly as possible after Dominic Raab ordered travellers to fly back to the UK.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-why-are-planes-still-flying">Coronavirus: Why are planes still flying?</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A7CD/production/_111475924_0d87eb59-95e5-4add-848c-2c60ab5e61bf.jpg" alt="img">

<p>You&rsquo;ve only got to look up to see there&rsquo;s still a fair amount of activity in the air, despite all the airline cutbacks. Why is that?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, a number of global airlines are still running passenger flights, including British Airways (BA).</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s despite aviation largely grinding to a halt as the coronavirus crisis hit passenger traffic numbers and governments banned flights.</p>
<p>But tens of thousands of Britons stranded abroad will be flown home under a new government agreement, while many planes carry essential cargo.</p>
<p>Have the number of flights been cut?</p>
<p>Passenger flights are believed to have been cut by up to 95%, but that still means one in 20 are taking off.</p>
<p>Airlines say they are keeping vital links open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working with European Union (EU) governments to try to keep some minimum flight links open for emergency reasons, even though the passenger loads on these flights will be very low,&rdquo; said Ryanair.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The coronavirus outbreak has had a severe impact on demand for air travel</p>
<p>But other flights are to bring stranded people home.</p>
<p>BA, Virgin Atlantic, EasyJet, Jet2 and Titan are among airlines that have agreed to fly Britons back to the UK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are doing everything we can to bring customers home, including critical workers,&rdquo; BA told the BBC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all governments are allowing flights. We are working with the Foreign Office to open routes where we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UK government has also pledged £75m to help provide charter flights to bring UK nationals back from countries where commercial flights aren&rsquo;t available.</p>
<p>Image caption The UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced a deal between government and airlines to return Britons stranded by coronavirus on Monday</p>
<p>BA is already operating a number of repatriation flights chartered by the Foreign Office from Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>Are airports and planes safe for travellers?</p>
<p>Heathrow Airport said it is working closely with Public Health England officials &ldquo;to facilitate their access to the airport so that they can implement their enhanced monitoring measures as a precaution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In line with the latest Public Health England advice, we are encouraging passengers and colleagues to maintain good hand hygiene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ryanair said all its aircraft &ldquo;are disinfected daily&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With low loads, social distancing will be optimised on-board,&rdquo; the airline said.</p>
<p>How many flights are there?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s difficult to find out, but you can check at any airport&rsquo;s website to see how many planes are flying in and out at any given time.</p>
<p>When the BBC checked Heathrow Airport - heathrow.com/departures - on Monday morning, for instance, there were flights scheduled in the following hour or so to Dublin, Copenhagen, Bahrain, Manchester, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Madrid, Hamburg, Moscow, Barcelona, Doha, Berlin, Paris, Kuala Lumpur, Valencia, Boston and Stockholm.</p>
<p>You can also see at-a-glance live data of how many flights are in the air at any one time through flight tracker website flightradar24.com.</p>
<p>But many flights you see in the sky will be cargo planes. The amount of cargo handling via Heathrow Airport has doubled in recent days, it told the BBC.</p>
<p>What do cargo planes carry?</p>
<p>They often carry vital supplies, including food and medical equipment.</p>
<p>For example, two-fifths of the UK&rsquo;s pharmaceutical products such as medicines, vaccines and respirators are imported via Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>The airport is the UK&rsquo;s largest port by value, with 34% of the country&rsquo;s cargo passing through.</p>
<p>Normally 95% of the cargo that comes into Heathrow Airport is carried in the belly-hold of passenger planes, but the airport is currently &ldquo;repurposing its operation and scaling up its cargo offering&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It has temporarily increased the number of dedicated cargo flights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will bring in vital supplies of food and medical equipment to help Britain weather this storm,&rdquo; said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye.</p>
<p>Last week it reported a 243% increase in the number air traffic movements carrying only cargo.</p>
<p>During normal operations, the airport usually handles 47 cargo-only planes a week, on average.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 31 March, it is forecast to have 48 cargo-only planes in just one day.
