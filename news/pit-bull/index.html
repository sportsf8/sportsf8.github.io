<p>CHULA VISTA, Calif. (KGTV) &ndash; A frightening encounter between a coyote and a pit bull at a Chula Vista park was captured on video.</p>
<p>Keyanue McCallon was with his dog at Loma Verde Park (1420 Loma Lane), near Loma Verde Elementary School, on May 22 when the incident occurred.</p>
<p>McMallon said a coyote hopped over a fence and confronted his pit bull. With his camera recording, the animals stared at each other for about 10 seconds, and then the coyote became aggressive.</p>
<p>As the coyote attacked his dog, McMallon yelled and managed to chase the coyote away.</p>
<p>He said he is worried a similar incident could happen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an animal lover and anyone who knows me knows I&rsquo;m an animal lover. But this particular coyote needs to be removed. I&rsquo;m not suggesting it be eliminated, We need to capture him to relocate him to a more proper place. This is not the park for him,” McMallon said.</p>
<p>10News learned a coyote &ndash; believed to be the same one that attacked McMallon’s dog – attacked another person’s dog the day before.

<h3 id="best-friends-animal-society---from-pit-bulls-and-no-kill-to-real-estate-mogul">&ldquo;Best Friends Animal Society - from Pit Bulls and ‘No Kill’ to Real Estate Mogul&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.citywatchla.com/templates/ja_teline_v/favicon.ico" alt="img">
ANIMAL WATCH -Shortly after being appointed Los Angeles Animal Services General Manager in 2010, Brenda Barnette insisted that the City Council grant a &lsquo;rent-free&rsquo; contract for sole usage of the city&rsquo;s newest animal shelter to Best Friends Animal Society to create a &ldquo;No Kill&rdquo; City.</p>
<p>The location has served as a Best Friends&rsquo; LA adoption and marketing center since that time.</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS - PIT BULLS, DOG FIGHTING AND MICHAEL VICK</p>
<p>Until the 2008 bust of a major dog-fighting ring at Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bad Newz Kennels,&rdquo; many people were only vaguely aware of Best Friends Animal Society (the former Process Church of the Final Judgment) and it would probably have remained a relatively unknown secluded Utah animal sanctuary seeking donations in the shadow of The Humane Society of the U.S. and the ASPCA.</p>
<p>But for Best Friends, the opportunity to take 22 of these &ldquo;underdogs,&rdquo; was a unique opportunity for media exposure and fundraising.</p>
<p>DogsBite.org chronicled this entire era:</p>
<p>Best Friends received some of Michael Vick&rsquo;s pit bulls &ndash; 21 &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo; dogs deemed too unstable for adoption. The group believes that pit bulls seized in dogfighting raids can be rehabilitated and adopted out as pets. DogsBite.org believes this policy is dangerous and irresponsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Best Friends has shamelessly capitalized on Vick&rsquo;s dogs. Each dog also came with a $18,275 dowry, as part of the sentence deal worked out with Michael Vick. The sizable press campaign around the &ldquo;Vicktory&rdquo; dogs has undoubtedly brought in substantial donations and Best Friends has cashed in on the fanfare. Yet months before acquiring Vick&rsquo;s dogs, Best Friends refused to take in 40-plus pit bulls seized in their own state from a hoarder.</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS NOW DESCRIBES ‘A DOG WILLING TO BITE’</p>
<p>Best Friends can barely bring itself to admit that dogs &ndash; especially Pit Bulls &ndash; bite, let alone that they maul and kill humans and pets without provocation&ndash;incidents that are now becoming a worldwide epidemic. (See: Pit Bull Attack Epidemic Spreads Worldwide).</p>
<p>But it now advises &ldquo;How to Manage a Dog Willing to Bite, &ldquo;and states that behaviors labeled as &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; typically occur because the dog is afraid. Best Friends further explains, &ldquo;There are various tools and techniques that can help dogs who are currently exhibiting dangerous behavior.&rdquo; (Emph. added.)</p>
<p>However, at the end of the article written by Best Friends&rsquo; own behaviorist, Sherry Woodard, there is a Disclaimer which describes that if you use the suggested techniques, you do so at your own risk and Best Friends is not responsible for any resultant injuries. (Read Best Friends exact statement here.)</p>
<p>MOST PEOPLE WANT A PET, NOT A ‘MANAGEMENT PROBLEM’</p>
<p>Any organization that does not inform adopters/owners of dogs that are considered &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; that it may be necessary to euthanize the animal in order to protect children, adults and other pets/animals from injury or death, is&ndash;in the opinion of many, including rescuers &ndash; acting irresponsibly. It is especially concerning when any organization waives responsibility for its own recommendations.</p>
<p>(See: Best Friends Animal Society in Dog Fight over Shock Collars)</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS &ldquo;HUMBLE BEGINNING&rdquo; AS THE PROCESS CHURCH OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Process Church of the Final Judgment first officially incorporated Louisiana, in 1968, after two of its founders separated from the Church of Scientology. They later changed its name becoming, in chronological order, the Foundation Church of the Millennium, the Foundation Faith of the Millennium, and the Foundation Faith of God before it took on a new role as Best Friends Animal Society, according to Sinister Scenesters.</p>
<p>The name changes of the organization on the Louisiana Secretary of State website, state it was last changed on 8/12/1993 to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FROM ANIMAL SOCIETY TO REAL ESTATE MOGUL?</p>
<p>A 2011 article, Best Friends of Utah: The Process Church of the Final Judgment to Animal Society, describes how, &ldquo;In 1984, an obscure canyon just north of Kanab, Utah, became the home of Best Friends Animal Sanctuary. The 3,700 acres purchased by Best Friends was later extended into an additional 33,000 acres leased from the federal Bureau of Land Management.</p>
<p>IN 2011 - &ldquo;The Best Friends&rsquo; website advises that about 1,700 dogs, cats and other animals live there, some awaiting adoption and some that will spend the rest of their lives. Best Friends describes itself as “. . .the nation’s largest no-kill safe haven for displaced, homeless or unwanted domestic animals.”</p>
<p>GuideStar records at that time showed Best Friends&rsquo; income at almost $44 million in 2009 and net assets near $38 million.</p>
<p>IN 2020 - The Best Friends website states that the Sanctuary is &ldquo;the home-between-homes for about 1,600 rescued animals, including assorted wildlife on any given day.&rdquo; (Thus, the number of animals has decreased.)</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS FINANCIAL REPORTS</p>
<p>INCOME (from Best Friends Website)</p>
<p>2018 $102,896,740</p>
<p>2017 93.163.465</p>
<p>2016 $106,16,834</p>
<p>CHARITY NAVIGATOR (for non-profits)</p>
<p>Overall Rating 81.92. And it noted Best Friends has some interesting Executive Positions, including: A &ldquo;Chief Experience Officer&rdquo; who is paid $236,568 Annually.</p>
<p>Best Friends Animal Society - GuideStar Profile (Information from Best Friends Animal Society) for 2018, shows:</p>
<p>Spay/neuter surgeries performed through Best Friends spay/neuter clinics and programs .</p>
<p>In 2015 Best Friends provided 133,000 spays/neuters.</p>
<p>In 2018 that number was 92,068 spays/neuters.</p>
<p>Under &ldquo;Animals adopted through Best Friends adoption centers, events and promotions:</p>
<p>In 2015, 76,000 animals were adopted.</p>
<p>In 2018, that had dropped to 33,968.</p>
<p>An Increase of Lives Saved</p>
<p>&ldquo;Measured by reduction in shelter deaths of individual animals by Best Friends and our partners. (Best Friends has always claimed it is &ldquo;No Kill. How would it have a reduction in shelter deaths.&quot;)</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS OWNS TWO PRIVATE PLANES?</p>
<p>According to an article on May 28, 2019, by Humane Watch, &ldquo;Why Does Best Friends Animal Society Own Two Planes?&quot;, Best Friends listed on its IRS report that it owns two private planes, claiming they are used to charter air travel for its employees and to transport animals, but the report does not state how that airtime is divided.</p>
<p>This article also examines the &ldquo;nepotism&rdquo; resulting from the fact that six well-paid employees are related to board members or executives; for instance, &ldquo;BFAS employs the board chair’s wife, son, and daughter in law. The total compensation for these individuals is close to $600,000.&rdquo; (Read more here.)</p>
<p>Note: Charity Navigator gave Best Friends an 81.92 overall rating for 2018 and listed a notable annual salary of $236,568 for the &ldquo;Chief Experience Officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS STARTS A REAL-ESTATE EMPIRE (Best Friends Borrows $25,000,000)</p>
<p>At the Kane County Commissioners May 14, 2018, meeting a resolution was passed, approving the financing of acquisition, construction, equipping and furnishing buildings, fixtures and improvements for Best Friends Animal Society&ndash;issuance not to exceed $25,000,000, by the sale of industrial facilities and government revenue bonds. It was noted that this was a conduit bond and also that it can&rsquo;t be spent on land.</p>
<p>The minutes said that &ldquo;Best Friends financial reports were done on revenue, not on property or real estate.&rdquo; (Best Friends Animal Sanctuary reportedly owns 3,700 acres, with an additional 33,000 acres leased from the United States Bureau of Land Management.)</p>
<p>Three members of the public objected or asked questions. One said these types of bonds should be used for university studies and parks and should support the public and not just one entity.</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS ROADHOUSE AND MERCANTILE OPENS IN KANAB</p>
<p>In early November 2019, Best Friends announced the opening of the Best Friends Roadhouse and Mercantile in Kanab, UT &ndash; a pet-centric hotel.</p>
<p>Room prices will range from $159 to $299, according to the LA Times. The Mercantile next door offers food, drinks, including beer and wine, and Best Friends-branded merchandise. Proceeds from the hotel and store will help fund the animal sanctuary’s campaigns, the report states.</p>
<p>Trip Advisor describes it as, &ldquo;. . .the new Best Friends Roadhouse and Mercantile, innovative pet-centric lodging in the village of Kanab, Utah, that helps support the lifesaving work of Best Friends Animal Society. 40 rooms and suites with complimentary continental breakfast, complimentary guest laundry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BEST FRIENDS&rsquo; STATEMENT ON OPENING THE HOTEL</p>
<p>Best Friends opened a pet-luxury 40-room hotel with a &ldquo;soft opening&rdquo; at the end of October, which it claims did not use any donor dollars to build.</p>
<p>Brooks Bradbury, Best Friends’ general manager of hospitality explained that the hotel was opened: “As an extension of Best Friends Animal Sanctuary and its tradition of warm hospitality. . .And in case you’re wondering, the hotel wasn’t built with donor dollars. It’s being financed through a bank loan that will be repaid from income generated by the Roadhouse itself. Funding won’t come from donor dollars or Best Friends’ operating budget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SALT LAKE CITY TRIBUNE ASKS, ‘IS BEST FRIENDS LOSING FRIENDS?’</p>
<p>On May 24, Brian Maffly, of the Salt Lake City Tribune, asked &ldquo;Is Best Friends losing friends? Kane County officials push back against Utah animal sanctuary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-six years after establishing its famed pet sanctuary outside Kanab, the nonprofit organization has mushroomed from “almost nothing” into a global brand with millions of members,&rdquo; Maffly notes as he discusses Best Friends Animal Society&rsquo;s success. He reports that approximately 37,000 visitors come to the Angel Canyon animal sanctuary each year, which has benefited employment rates and local Kanab, Utah, enterprises.</p>
<p>However, many residents are now becoming suspicious of Best Friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;animal-welfare mission and promotion of tourism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He points out that Best Friends’ has recently acquired 1,637 acres of state trust lands that was the site of a proposed sand mine which was supported by County officials. One Council member described it as, &ldquo;. . .the big company coming in and buying all the land like an environmentalist land baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In letter to Best Friends, Maffly reports, officials warned of &ldquo;greater public alarm and distrust, which is already significant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This refers back to the CityWatch article which noted there were allegations at the County meeting that Best Friends may be improperly using a county-backed “conduit bond” to fund the purchase.&rdquo; The letter also reportedly demanded cancellation of the sale or that Best Friends &ldquo;make the land’s minerals available for extraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Best Friends disagrees and states that community use of the land would be allowed &ldquo;as long as it doesn&rsquo;t harm the sanctuary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday, the Salt Lake City Tribune quoted Castle as saying, “We aren’t going anywhere and they aren’t going anywhere, so we may as well work together.”</p>
<p>This is a disagreement that may not be easily resolved.</p>
<p>Respect for Differing Values</p>
<p>Can the residents and officials of Kanab withstand the influence and money that Best Friends seems to have at its disposal?</p>
<p>And does Best Friends, a non-profit organization for over 30 years, have the outside resources to assure that the legal obligations of an expanding real estate empire&ndash;grown far beyond the basic mission of an animal sanctuary &ndash; will not become donor funded?</p>

<h3 id="arkansas-boy-9-killed-by-two-pit-bull-dogs-as-he-checked-mail">&ldquo;Arkansas boy, 9, killed by two &lsquo;pit bull&rsquo; dogs as he checked mail&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/29/22/28989354-0-image-a-49_1590786663400.jpg" alt="img">
A nine-year-old boy has died in Arkansas after he was apparently attacked by dogs while getting the mail.</p>
<p>The boy, identified by a family friend as Robby Taylor, was reported missing at 9.15am on Thursday from his home in Mount Vernon, the Faulkner County Sheriff’s Office said in a press release.</p>
<p>Taylor&rsquo;s mother said he had gone outside to check the mail but never returned.</p>
<p>A Mount Vernon, Arkansas, boy identified by a family friend as Robby Taylor (pictured with his mother) died in an apparent dog attack on Tuesday</p>
<p>The nine-year-old boy had gone to check the mail and never returned. He was later found mauled to death in a field</p>
<p>When the boy failed to come home from what was supposed to be a quick trip to the mailbox after a few minutes, his mother went looking for him but could not find him.</p>
<p>The mother said she saw several dogs running from a field near her home, and Taylor was later found dead from &lsquo;an apparent dog attack,&rsquo; the sheriff’s office said.</p>
<p>Investigators who responded to the scene questioned two people in connection to the dog mauling, but no arrests were made.</p>
<p>The Conway Animal Shelter took custody of two dogs from a home off Chambers Lane. The animals will be quarantined pending the outcome of the investigation.</p>
<p>Two dogs described by a family friend as pit bulls were taken away by animal control officials and placed in quarantine (stock photo)</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office has not released information about the breed of the dogs, but according to the description of a GoFundMe campaign launched by a family friend, both animals were pit bulls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Robby was walking to the mailbox at his home in Mount Vernon and was attacked by 2 loose pit bulls that ended up taking his life,&rsquo; the woman describing herself as the mother&rsquo;s best friend wrote. &lsquo;His family will forever be at a loss and changed from this horrible tragedy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the fundraiser, which as of Friday has drawn more than $11,400 in donations, the boy is survived by his parents and two siblings.

The owners of three loose pit bulls are being cited after their dogs mauled a Pomeranian being walked by its owner in the 200 block of Chambers Street.</p>
<p>Sirmeerah Clemmons, Nyasia Clemmons, and Nigel Clemmons, no ages provided, are being cited with having potentially dangerous dogs and dogs remaining at large. The three pit bulls have since been separated and are being placed in homes outside of Phillipsburg, police said in a news release.</p>
<p>The incident happened around 6 p.m. as owner Jim Kelly walked his small dog, Vinnie, along their normal route near Fulton and Chambers streets in Phillipsburg. Kelly and his family have lived on Chambers Street for decades, and Kelly and his 80-year-old mother trade off walking the small white dog.</p>
<p>The trio of loose dogs came up from Washington Street to Chambers Street, Kelly had said, and by the time he saw them, the dogs were “barreling toward my dog.” After one dog sniffed the leashed Vinnie and then lunged at the dog, the two other followed suit, Kelly recalled.</p>
<p>Video footage captured the scene on Facebook showed Kelly trying to pull Vinnie away and then trying to fight the other dogs off of the pup. The group then rolled around on the sidewalk between a backyard wall/fence and a parked car. At one point, a neighbor slapped the dog and grabbed its collar until it let go.</p>
<p>The canine trio eventually left with Kelly holding Vinnie in his arms, crying and screaming. A neighbor grabbed the injured dog and rushed it to nearby Harmony Animal Hospital, where the dog eventually had to be euthanized.</p>
<p>Phillipsburg Mayor Todd Tersigni posted on his Facebook page Saturday that he was aware of the dog attacks. He told the public he was in contact with the town’s animal control officer and was assured all procedures were being followed in accordance with the law. Town Councilman Bob Fulper said Monday having the dogs deemed “potentially dangerous animals” carries a $700 annual licensing fee per animal and a slew of very strict handling guidelines.</p>
<p>All of which, Fulper said, cannot be met by the current owners.</p>
<p>Since then, a second dog owner has come forward saying his dog also was attacked this past Thursday.</p>
<p>Lincoln Powell, of Phillipsburg, claims his 11-year-old Border Collie, Roxy, was mauled by three pit bulls as they walked at Fulton and Filmore streets around 6 p.m. At first, Powell told lehighvalleylive.com, just two of the pit bulls appeared from across the street. They seemed standoff-ish but were wagging tails until one of them let out a growl, he said.</p>
<p>“It all happened in about 45 second; it happened so quick,” Powell recalled.</p>
<p>One dog swept Roxy’s leg while the other went at her chest. Eventually, the third pit bull appeared and followed suit, attacking Roxy, he said. Powell was able to call police from his cellphone, which later broke in the dog fight. Powell had to fight off the dogs himself &ndash; jumping on top of them and slapping them off &ndash; with no help from neighbors or police, he claimed.</p>
<p>“I went nuts (trying to get the pit bulls off Roxy),” Powell said.</p>
<p>Eventually, police responded and took the dogs into a patrol vehicle, Powell said.</p>
<p>Roxy was injured with various puncture wounds, kept overnight at Harmony Animal Hospital and wasn’t released until the next day. The bill for the emergency visit was $850, Powell said.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the dogs in the second incident were the same dogs that attacked Vinnie or if any separate charges are pending. Phillipsburg police did not return repeated calls requesting information about the incidents. Michelle Crosson, animal control officer for Phillipsburg., also did not return a voicemail seeking information about the incidents.</p>

&ldquo;How dare she,&rdquo; one commenter wrote. &ldquo;Call your vet, get all appropriate documentation on your dog’s temperament. Does he/she have any friends at the local pet park? Have you boarded him or her? I&rsquo;m so, so sorry that she did this to you. I&rsquo;d apply for a restraining order to keep you and your family safe. My heart is breaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another advised, &ldquo;Get a lawyer ASAP, get vet involved. But most of all go public &ndash; Facebook, TV tell your story, go nuclear. The more attention, the better to ensure that no harm comes to your dog. Get animal rights groups involved. Basically create as much noise as you can, get the internet keyboard warriors to do their thing. So authorities face public ridicule, and do not attempt to rush anything. Make your MIL, understand the true meaning of escalating things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third asked, &ldquo;Can you ask your vet for their professional opinion of Zara’s temperament? Can they vouch for her being a lab mix? As for your MIL, hopefully you, DH and DD never see her or speak to her again. She can&rsquo;t be rewarded for killing an innocent dog.&rdquo;
