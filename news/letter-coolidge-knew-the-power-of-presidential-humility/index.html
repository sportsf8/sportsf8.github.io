<p>With so much focus year after year on the newest and wildest rebranding projects in Minor League Baseball, MiLB.com takes a look at the flip side. This spring and summer, we will be profiling teams with some of the longest continually used nicknames in each league. Next up: the South Atlantic League&rsquo;s Asheville Tourists. (Previous installments: Rochester Red Wings | Nashville Sounds | Harrisburg Senators | Chattanooga Lookouts)</p>
<p>Babe Ruth was a tourist. So was Michael Jordan. Zelda Fitzgerald and Bryan Cranston and Dave Chappelle, too. Tourists, all. Not ones with a capital &ldquo;T,&rdquo; of course, but tourists just the same.</p>
<p>Snuggled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, the city of Asheville is as beautiful and picturesque a setting as any in Minor League Baseball. Long before MiLB existed, Asheville was a draw for visitors from all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asheville, beginning in the early 1890s, became a big tourist destination,&rdquo; said Bill Ballew, an Asheville-area baseball writer and historian. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s always been the No. 1 industry. Lots of big hotels were built in the 1890s. Tourism has always been a big part of Asheville&rsquo;s history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some came for the outdoors. Some came for the city&rsquo;s therapeutic health facilities and resorts. Later, they came for music, dance and the arts. And along the way, they played ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The team over the years, Moonshiners was the most popular name,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;Newspaper writers gave the team their own nicknames. Teams really didn&rsquo;t ascribe to any particular (names) for the longest time. Moonshiners was a big one for a time. In the early 1910s, Mountaineers was a big-time name, and then 1915 was the first time Tourists was used, and it went back and forth for the next couple years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skylanders was a bigger name, not so much Highlanders but Skylanders, and then we didn&rsquo;t really have baseball from about World War I through 1924.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tourists name was first used in 1915 to pay homage to the city&rsquo;s destination status. A decade later, Tourists baseball became a near-permanent fixture in Asheville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McCormick Field, the same place it is right now, was built in 1924 and the team was actually known as the Skylanders when they opened up,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;The next season, they were the Tourists and they have been ever since, except from 1972-75 when the team was the Asheville Orioles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asheville&rsquo;s teams bounced from circuit to circuit in their early decades, including the Southeastern, Appalachian, North Carolina State and Piedmont leagues. Those loops have come and gone, but the nickname has remained &ndash; except for those brief O&rsquo;s years, which came on the heels of frenetic affiliation changes. The Tourists were a co-op Phillies-Pirates team in 1959, a Phils farm team in 1960, a Pirates affiliate from 1961-66, an Astros club in &lsquo;67, a Reds squad from &lsquo;68-70 and a White Sox team in 1971.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d kind of been an orphan team that was barely hanging on,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;The ballpark wasn&rsquo;t the most inviting place. Baltimore needed a place for their Double-A team, so it was kind of an agreement that they would go all-in on the Orioles. They painted the seats all orange in the ballpark, and the seats were [still] wet when they had their first game, and they had to refund a lot, give people some money for their clothes and all that stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was kind of a debacle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the only time since World War I, Asheville&rsquo;s team wasn&rsquo;t the Tourists. Cal Ripken Sr. managed the Asheville Orioles from 1972-74, losing in the league finals in his debut season. His sons, Billy and Cal Jr., were bat boys. Eddie Murray learned how to switch-hit in Asheville, and while the affiliation didn&rsquo;t last, it helped steady the franchise, which returned to the Tourists name in America&rsquo;s bicentennial year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1976, the Orioles left to go to Charlotte, little bit better ballpark, little bit bigger city, that kind of thing,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;Asheville dropped down to Class A, where they are now in the Western Carolinas League, which became the South Atlantic League a couple of years later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Minor League Baseball headed toward its renaissance, the Tourists played a supporting role in the film that helped spark it. The fictional Crash Davis is remembered more for his tutelage of young phenom Nuke LaLoosh for the title team in 1988&rsquo;s Bull Durham , but he hit his Minor League record-setting homer for the Tourists after being released by the Bulls, a make-believe milestone Asheville &ndash; both team and city &ndash; has been proud to honor.</p>
<p>Alongside the movie, new visual identities were beginning to sprout in the 1980s and &rsquo;90s, helping to usher in the Minor Leagues&rsquo; revolution. Like many teams before the boom, the Tourists needed a spark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Ron McKee took over, he was the general manager from 1980 through the mid-2000s,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;He had developed [a logo], it was &lsquo;Asheville Tourists&rsquo; and a scene of mountains basically, and it said &lsquo;Baseball in the Smokies.&rsquo; That was their logo, so to speak, with kind of a block &lsquo;A.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same era with Chattanooga, &lsquo;91-92, [the Tourists] decided they had always had a bear mascot. &lsquo;Baseball in the Smokies,&rsquo; the Smoky Mountains have bears, so they had a bear mascot who kind of walked around in a cheap suit. Ron decided with some help from some other people that they would create a logo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kevin Costner&rsquo;s jersey from Bull Durham &ndash; complete with &ldquo;Baseball in the Smokies&rdquo; sleeve patch &ndash; is on display in the team&rsquo;s front office.</p>
<p>What resulted was one of the Minors&rsquo; first iconic character marks of its resurgent age. Mascot Ted E. Tourist was immortalized in logo form. A smiling bear holding a suitcase and bat sporting spikes and a side-slung camera draped across his Hawaiian shirt became the graphical face of the Tourists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fans liked it from the beginning,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;They were very enthusiastic about it, and it was only the players that had a little bit of a problem with it. The fans were all in on it from the get-go. It was something new, something completely different, and between the (Carolina) Mudcats and the (Chattanooga) Lookouts and the Tourists and a couple of others, they were really kind of forerunners in all of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got orders from all over the country, and that was really unheard of at that time for a Minor League team. The Tourists got orders from when you had to pick up the phone and call and say, &lsquo;Do you all have any stuff for sale?&rsquo; There was no internet back then. It became a decent revenue source that other teams kind of realized. Minor League Baseball had to put in a rule that you couldn&rsquo;t change your logo more than every so often so that teams wouldn&rsquo;t keep trying to build a better mousetrap and reinvent the wheel and get more souvenir sales every two or three years with a new logo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Players were a different story at first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Initially, the players were not real thrilled,&rdquo; Ballew said with a laugh. &ldquo;They thought they were wearing little cartoons. And my, times have changed. They were more used to seeing logos with basically the same thing or something very similar to a Major League team&rsquo;s logo, their caps with an &lsquo;LA&rsquo; or an &lsquo;A&rsquo; for Atlanta or an &lsquo;SF&rsquo; for San Francisco or something along those lines. Asheville just had a block &lsquo;A&rsquo; basically for years and years, and now they put the bear logo, the full-body bear, and it turned out to be very, very successful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During that first year, the players ended up really liking it because they had a lot of their friends asking for caps or things along those lines. They&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s pretty cool. That&rsquo;s pretty different. Can you get me one of those hats?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like their contemporaries wading into uncharted waters of the Minor League identity pool, Asheville was rewarded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did create a good bit of souvenir sales for the Tourists, so it was very positive from that standpoint,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;Chattanooga, Columbus &ndash; who became the Carolina Mudcats &ndash; the Asheville Tourists, they were really ahead of the curve with a lot of this stuff. Today, you almost kind of expect it. A lot of them don&rsquo;t really shock you like maybe they used to. At the time, it was pretty different with the players. I just remember talking to several of them, and a lot of guys didn&rsquo;t really like them at first but really grew to like them over time because they were among the first, and it attracted some attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The logo took hold as the Tourists embarked on an affiliation with the Colorado Rockies that is now one of the longest in the Minors, dating back to 1994. Ted E. survived as Asheville&rsquo;s primary logo until a mid-2000s ownership change. Palace Sports, then owners of the Detroit Pistons, Tampa Bay Lightning and Detroit Shock, purchased the club ahead of the 2006 season and moved away from the bear to a stylized &ldquo;A&rdquo; draped by a mountainous treescape with a baseball sweeping across its front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David King, who was the merchandise manager for the Tourists at that time, he was the one who pretty much came up with that,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;It was not a big thing, getting an outside agency to do anything. It was just locally, in-house done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sold some new hats and that sort of thing, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say there was a big rush to get it like there was maybe with Ted E. Tourist or the current logos and stuff. The diehard fans obviously were excited and liked getting it, but it was more of a minor change than a major shift, I would say. The Ted E. logo was used here and there in addition, but the primary logo was the mountains with the &lsquo;A.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tourists&rsquo; muted era didn&rsquo;t last long. In 2010, the team was purchased again by the family of current Tourists president Brian DeWine. Immediately, it overhauled the club&rsquo;s look with links to its past and future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They worked with Brandiose &ndash; or Plan B they were called at the time &ndash; and they were trying to tie in the old Moonshiners name, tying in the moon and the mountains and all that,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;They changed the color scheme completely, going with shades of blue and almost a teal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new character, Mr. Moon, was front and center in Asheville&rsquo;s new look. In alternate marks, there was a hobo bindle. There were ribs. The team&rsquo;s &ldquo;A&rdquo; was totally different. Navy paid tribute to the Blue Ridge Mountains. The teal color is actually &ldquo;Biltmore jade,&rdquo; a nod to the roof of local landmark the Biltmore House, which contains jade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Initially, some people were kind of confused, but over time, that year and the next year, it&rsquo;s become very popular,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;People I think in general have grown to be very positive about it. I think a lot of people really like it. The merchandise sales are very solid, but I think initially there was a little bit of a disconnect because there wasn&rsquo;t the understanding about the past with the Moonshiners and that theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brian and the front office really toyed with the idea of considering going with Moonshiners (as a full rebrand), but it really wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; trying to be a family promotion and really attract families &ndash; maybe not the best name in the world. A lot of people say it&rsquo;s derogatory toward people who live in the mountains and that sort of thing, although I think it would&rsquo;ve been incredibly popular if they had some logos like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2015, the team marked 100 years with its moniker through a series of promotional uniforms honoring various points in Tourists history. Even with its life-sized characters, the club united old and new.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you have Mr. Moon, the mascot who walks around along with Ted E. Tourist, who&rsquo;s still there, and they act like brothers who are in a constant rivalry with each other, kind of a love-hate relationship,&rdquo; Ballew added. &ldquo;At times, they can be very funny during games. Ted E. Tourist still has a presence in the ballpark, as does Mr. Moon, and over time they&rsquo;ve really evolved into a popular twosome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While remaining true to its naming roots, Asheville has taken advantage of its rich history with other special identities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asheville has a very alternative scene, downtown Asheville. The ballpark is located just on the south slope of downtown,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve tied in with Asheville Hippies. They&rsquo;ve had Moonshiners a couple of times. They have tied in those names, and those are very popular. Some of the special jerseys from those nights have been very, very popular amongst the fans as well as the players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McCormick Field is quiet now, waiting like all of us for baseball&rsquo;s return. Asheville does the same in anticipation of those who pass through its confines. When it all comes back, the Tourists will be there. All of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think for the people who are real knowledgeable about baseball in Asheville, there&rsquo;s a lot of love for the name,&rdquo; Ballew said. &ldquo;People maybe who come in or are just looking at it, they might think, &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s stupid. They&rsquo;re the home team, they&rsquo;re not visiting.&rsquo; The old scoreboard, before they had electronic scoreboards, it was &lsquo;VISITORS&rsquo; and &lsquo;TOURISTS&rsquo; on the scoreboard which was always kind of neat. People kind of get it then. I think the people that appreciate the history of baseball and understand Asheville love the name.&rdquo;</p>

“We want to be out there sooner rather than later. It’s just kind of a wait and see kind of approach where everything is going to land. We want to get back to playing some baseball.”</p>

<p>“I’m working toward that day when they say, ‘Look, we’re going to open up and we’re coming back in there,’ ” Freitas said. “Everybody’s getting a taste of, you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone.</p>
<p>“I try to keep it as nice as I can, in hopes that there will be a break. I’m trying to stick with it the best I can. I miss having the kids around. I haven’t seen a ball player in months – and I feel for them, because they must be going nuts.”</p>
<p>There is a lot of history to baseball at the Veterans Home, as it dates back to the early 1930s, according to a report by goodoldsandlotdays.com.

<p><img src="https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-115284897-e1580921343554-1024x747.jpg" alt="img">
Hey, everyone has to start somewhere.</p>
<p>Before leading the country was even a distant dream they pondered in their quietest moments, the men who would become our nation’s leaders explored other careers. Yep, they were just like the rest of us—sort of. Their first jobs spanned the gamut but were often the result of family connections, personal interests, luck, and maybe even fate. From land surveyors and ice-cream scoopers to teachers and a whole lot of lawyers, the 45 leaders of the United States all have fascinating stories about the first places they earned a paycheck.</p>
<p>George Washington</p>
<p>While most of today’s 15-year-olds are entering their sophomore year of high school and worrying about algebra tests and finding a date for the homecoming dance, Washington was starting his first job as a land surveyor, according to the George Washington Foundation. His connections were important to his early success, as his brother-in-law married into the powerful Fairfax family, and he went on his first expedition to explore wild areas of Virginia. Frontier exploration would later lead to his interest in the military, and by the age of 17, he had already held county public office as a surveyor. Here are more surprising facts you never learned about George Washington in school.</p>
<p>John Adams</p>
<p>Being the town’s schoolmaster wasn’t really Adams’ favorite thing, as it turns out, because he didn’t find it very intellectually stimulating. However, he used that time to take a bit of a “gap year,” as modern-day students would call it, to figure out his future. He grappled with the idea that becoming a lawyer might require him to sacrifice his own moral beliefs, which bothered him, but he came to terms with it and eventually did just that, according to the John Adams Historical Society. In the meantime, he earned money for law school as a schoolmaster, and he was known to call only on the smartest students in order to satiate his own intellectual boredom. He also kept detailed journals of his life.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>Born to one of Virginia’s most well-off and well-known families, Jefferson was given a top-notch education and became a lawyer. When he was 14, however, his father died, and he inherited around 5,000 acres of land, including his father’s plantation at Shadwell. Despite this, Jefferson really wanted to live on a mountain, so he cleared the land on a nearby mountain, where he’d played as a boy, and named it Monticello. Of course, that’s also what he named his new estate, which he would spend the next 40 years building and redoing in what he called his “essay in architecture,” according to Monticello.org. Don’t miss these 52 astonishing facts you never knew about U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>James Madison</p>
<p>Madison was the oldest of 12 kids in his family, which sounds like a job in and of itself. He grew up on the famous plantation Montpelier, which is now open to the public. After graduating from college at what is now Princeton University, he became interested in the relationship between Britain and America, which had become strained over the topic of British taxation, according to History.com. He was appointed a colonel in the military but quickly realized his talents were in politics. He went on to write the first drafts of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as one of the country’s Founding Fathers.</p>
<p>James Monroe</p>
<p>Monroe had lost both of his parents by his mid-teen years, and they left him quite a bit of land and slaves before he left for college in Williamsburg, Virginia. According to the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, it was quite a fun time to be hanging around Williamsburg, as the governor had fled for his life. “After he left, Monroe and some of his fellow classmates helped loot the arsenal at the Governor’s Palace. They escaped with 200 muskets and 300 swords, which they donated to the Virginia militia.” Not quite a first job…but a large and charitable prank story, nonetheless. By 1776, around two years later, Monroe had joined Virginia infantry and then became an officer in the Continental Army.</p>
<p>John Quincy Adams</p>
<p>Print Collector/Getty Images</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson</p>
<p>There’s nothing like a presidential apprenticeship to pave the way for a successful career! John Quincy Adams was the son of John Adams, the second president of the United States. He lived his childhood in an apprenticeship-style role to his father, and he and his mother even watched the Battle of Bunker Hill from their own family farm. As a 14-year-old, he received on-the-job training in the diplomatic corps as well as attended school, according to Biography.com . He also served as the secretary and translator for diplomat Francis Dana, accompanying him to Russia as a teenager. His language skills served him well, as he also went to Paris to help his father during the negotiations for the Treaty of Paris. Like many presidents, he was first a lawyer. Learn what presidents’ handwriting reveals about them , including John Quincy Adams’.</p>
<p>Unlike some previous presidents, the man still on our $20 bill had “humble beginnings as a poor orphan with little education,” according to CNN. His teenage job was more dangerous than your average preteen’s, as he served as a courier in the Revolutionary War who was responsible for delivering messages and packages. He had joined the cause after his older brother died, and he and his other brother were captured as prisoners by British forces, further fueling his hatred for the British. He was released as a part of a prisoner exchange and went on to be called the “people’s president,” in spite of controversial decisions that forced Native Americans to migrate. Today, his legacy is complicated, to say the least.</p>
<p>Martin Van Buren</p>
<p>The son of Dutch parents, Van Buren was a law clerk under a local lawyer at age 13 and went on to open his own firm at age 21, according to History.com. His father owned a tavern, and politics was often the center of discussion. Prominent guests including Alexander Hamilton frequented the bar, and young Van Buren got his start listening to such conversation and debate, according to UVA’s Miller Center. His job as a law clerk was the result of a favor called in by his father, as Van Buren hadn’t attended college and didn’t come from a well-off family. He spent seven years doing grunt work and studying at night to become a lawyer.</p>
<p>William Henry Harrison</p>
<p>The son of Benjamin Harrison, who signed the Declaration of Independence, William Henry would end up dying in office after serving for just one month. In his early years, he studied medicine and then became an “aide-de-camp,” which is basically a secretary for handling routine matters confidentially, for General Anthony Wayne, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. He also spent a considerable amount of time and effort dating and marrying his future wife in secret, as his father didn’t approve. These are the funniest jokes told by 23 U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>John Tyler</p>
<p>Tyler took over after Harrison’s untimely death and, as a result, earned the nickname of “His Accidency,” according to History.com. But his upbringing was no accident, as he was groomed for great things from early years in his top-notch education and learned law from private tutors. He began college coursework at 14 when most current teenagers start high school, and he was elected to the Virginia Legislature at 21.</p>
<p>James K. Polk</p>
<p>Known as “Young Hickory,” Polk was an enthusiastic supporter of Andrew Jackson, who was referred to as “Old Hickory.” A “first job” wasn’t on Polk’s radar as a teen, as he had struggled with illness throughout his childhood, suffering from gallstones. At 17, he had them surgically and painfully removed, without anesthesia or sterilization, according to ThoughtCo. After recovering from his challenging ordeal, he was finally ready to attend college the following year in 1816; by 1825, he had a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. Here are 13 facts about the White House you never knew.</p>
<p>Zachary Taylor</p>
<p>Unlike many presidents who came before him, Taylor wasn’t a huge fan of school, and UVA’s Miller Center refers to him as a “poor student” who had crude and unrefined handwriting, spelling, and grammar throughout his life. His desire to join the military was seen as an acceptable alternative to a law career. He grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, in a cabin in the woods, with seven brothers and sisters. He went on to be recognized later as a Mexican War hero, fulfilling his boyhood goal of being a military leader.</p>
<p>Millard Fillmore</p>
<p>While many presidents claim to have a rags-to-riches story, the 13th president of the United States actually did. Fillmore was born into extreme poverty in a log cabin in the New York Finger Lakes region. According to History.com, his first job was as a wool carder, which involves gathering pieces of various fibers and textures to prepare it for the textile process. Woolery.com says that a variety of fibers can be “carded,” from dog hair to llama to soy fiber to polyester. Fillmore went on to become a lawyer, and sadly, he would eventually become known for his ambivalence in taking a stance on slavery and his inability to prevent civil war. Do you know which state has produced the most U.S. presidents?</p>
<p>Franklin Pierce</p>
<p>Education was the main focus for Pierce’s mother, who raised this future president and his seven siblings, according to Biography.com. At age 12, Pierce was removed from public schools and spent three years in private academies. He went to college, where he graduated fifth in his class and became known for his public-speaking skills—something that would certainly come in handy later on. His father, Benjamin, was an accomplished Revolutionary War hero and, later, a governor, and he eventually helped get Pierce selected as Speaker of the House in the New Hampshire State Legislature when he was in his mid-20s.</p>
<p>James Buchanan</p>
<p>Buchanan didn’t exactly follow the rules: He was almost expelled from college twice, before turning things around and ultimately getting his law degree. UVA’s Miller Center called him a “spirited presence on campus.” He was also the only bachelor president after his fiancée broke up with him and died soon thereafter. After that, he vowed never to marry, and he kept that promise. Here are some surprising legacies of U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>MPI/Stringer/Getty Images</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson</p>
<p>As you may already know, Lincoln was born in a one-room log cabin in Kentucky. He lost his infant brother and then, later, his mother when he was 9. Although he loved poetry, storytelling, and public speaking, he had to do the work of the house and land, which could be considered his first job. After his mother’s death, his father married a woman who had three young children, so by his early teens, Lincoln was taking care of eight people as his father’s health deteriorated, according to the Abraham Lincoln Historica l Society . He had early jobs loading freight onto boats to go down the river and as a general-store clerk, which would prove helpful to his future in politics, as the store was the center of town gossip and news . Speaking of Lincoln, did you know there’s a typo on the Lincoln Memorial</p>
<p>According to Google Arts and Culture, Johnson was a tailor who ran away from his apprenticeship, and “with a reward on his head,” he traveled through the South honing his trade. He eventually returned to North Carolina, where his mother and stepfather lived, and settled in Tennessee. There, he opened his own tailoring shop, which is now protected inside the Memorial Building. In the Journal of the Costume Society of America, Johnson’s mother, “Polly the Weaver,” was affectionately described as a hardworking seamstress, working with the linens for the North Carolina Supreme Court members. Apparently the combination of clothes and politics rubbed off on her son as well!</p>
<p>Ulysses S. Grant</p>
<p>Grant was a quiet kid, often mistaken as stupid by classmates. But not only was he obviously not dumb—he was also a horse whisperer, according to UVA’s Miller Center. His first job involved corralling rambunctious horses on his farm, and he became known as the one who could handle horses that others couldn’t. But his father had larger goals for him, so he applied for an appointment to West Point, which led to his free college education in return for Army service.</p>
<p>Rutherford B. Hayes</p>
<p>Hayes was one of the first advocates of women in the legal arena, and he even signed an act that permitted female lawyers to argue cases in U.S. federal court. But way before that, he was a young lawyer finding his way. He graduated top of his class from Kenyon College and went on to Harvard Law, after studying in a law office for months before attending. Hayes overcame a tragic childhood, in which his father and sister died before his birth and his 9-year-old brother died afterward.</p>
<p>James Garfield</p>
<p>Kean Collection/Getty Images</p>
<p>Chester Arthur</p>
<p>James Garfield was another president who endured a tough start in life. His father died when he was just a year old, leaving his mother to raise four children in an impoverished situation. So, this future president used his first job as a teacher to pay his way through college, teaching clas sical languages at the Eclectic Institute. He even became the school’s president before transitioning to a career in law, and Business Insider also reports that he tended to mules for $8 per month. Plus, when he was 15 years old, according to The Week , he was a canal boat driver…though apparently not a very good one. He fell overboard 14 times in just a few months. Another random fact: James Garfield was the first left-handed president. Here are other surprising presidential firsts you never knew about</p>
<p>Arthur also taught school on holiday breaks to pay for his law degree, but his pursuits in his early law career were particularly interesting. Britannica calls him an “ardent abolitionist,” and he represented Lizzie Jennings, an African American woman who sued a streetcar company in Brooklyn for forcing her off an all-white car. This and other legal victories paved the way for equal transportation rights.</p>
<p>Grover Cleveland</p>
<p>Cleveland was a unique president for a few reasons, but similar to the previous few leaders, he was a teacher before—you guessed it—he pursued a legal career. He was one of the least healthy presidents and generally a big guy, according to the Constitution Center, and he enjoyed cigars and beer. His real first name was actually Steven, and he was not only the 22nd preside but also the 24th, illustrating the law that you can serve multiple consecutive or nonconsecutive terms up to a total of two terms or 10 years.</p>
<p>Benjamin Harrison</p>
<p>The grandson of president #9, William Henry Harrison, and the son of a Congressman, the younger Harrison grew up on plentiful acres of farmland, according to UVA’s Miller Center. If substantial but enjoyable work with the land qualifies as his first job, then Harrison was an expert: “He hunted, fished, hauled wood, tended livestock” before studying at a private school in Cincinnati and then at Miami University (of Ohio) to become a lawyer. Speaking animals, these are the most famous First Pets to live in the White House.</p>
<p>William McKinley</p>
<p>McKinley was a native Ohioan. His father managed an iron foundry, and his mother was a very religious woman. He participated in some debate societies as an extracurricular interest and attended one term of college but had to quit prematurely due to illness and financial issues, according to Study.com. To make money, he became a teacher and a post-office clerk, and he eventually served in the Battle of Antietam in 1862.</p>
<p>Theodore Roosevelt</p>
<p>Teddy Roosevelt’s family owned a plate-glass import business, according to Biography.com. He grew up dealing with illnesses, especially asthma, so he was home-schooled. His father encouraged him to engage in an intense physical routine by his teens years, including boxing and weightlifting. After quitting law school early, he became the youngest member of the New York State Assembly. He was on the fast track until his mother and wife died on the same day (February, 14, 1884); he took a break from politics and headed out to the Dakota Territory for two years, where he worked as a cattle rancher. Check out the hidden talents of 24 U.S. presidents.</p>
<p>William Howard Taft</p>
<p>Taft had to live up to a prestigious legacy: His father was a lawyer and the Secretary of War under President Grant. While he was in law school at the University of Cincinnati, the younger Taft served as a courthouse reporter for the Cincinnati Commercial, now the Cincinnati Enquirer, which reported on his early life. They joked that technically a president worked for them.</p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson</p>
<p>Wilson spent his early years observing the horrors of war close-up, as his father’s church was turned into a military hospital during the Civil War, according to Britannica. He struggled with education, as he was apparently dyslexic, but he later became somewhat famous for publishing an essay and later his first book, which focused on valuing public opinion in politics. Can you guess the middle name of every U.S. president?</p>
<p>Warren Harding</p>
<p>This future president’s father was the partial owner of an Ohio newspaper, so Harding’s apprenticeship was in printing. This was just the beginning of his career in journalism, which he practiced as the editor of his college paper at Ohio Central College. He would go on to revive the Star, as well as to establish its political stance as Republican in an area mostly comprised of Democrats, piquing his interest in politics and merging his two career paths.</p>
<p>Calvin Coolidge</p>
<p>“Silent Cal” was a lawyer before he was president, and he married a woman who both liked to talk a lot and also taught for a school for the deaf. Biography.com calls the two nearly completely opposite, although they went on to have a very happy marriage. Like many presidents up to this point, he endured intense tragedy as a child, losing both his mother and sister at a young age. He also lost his son later in life to sepsis.</p>
<p>Herbert Hoover</p>
<p>After losing both parents in his youth, Hoover spent many years fending for himself. His first job was as the founder of a student laundry service at Stanford University. He also worked for the school’s registration office as he majored in geology. (He was one of the few presidents to pursue a science-based degree.) After graduation, he looked for a job in surveying, but ended up finding a position in mining engineering, according to UVA’s Miller Center. Check out these presidential “facts” that just aren’t true.</p>
<p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</p>
<p>The distant cousin of Teddy Roosevelt, Franklin was inspired by a speech he heard his relative give during his time at Groton, an elite private school. He went on to attend Harvard, where his first official role was serving as the editor of the school paper, The Harvard Crimson. According to George Washington University, he was a good-looking man who women flocked to—”handsome, charming, and fun-loving.” Unfortunately, he contracted polio at age 39 and lost the ability to walk.</p>
<p>Harry Truman</p>
<p>Historical/Getty Images</p>
<p>Dwight Eisenhower</p>
<p>Perhaps best known as the president to drop the atomic bomb, Truman grew up working on his family’s farm and did not attend college. After high school, he had a variety of interesting jobs, starting as a timekeeper for a railroad company, according to Biography.com . He was also a bookkeeper and a clerk at two banks, but he eventually joined the National Guard. Did Truman also cover up a UFO when he was in office? This is one of 15 presidential mysteries that were never solved</p>
<p>Eisenhower’s family struggled with poverty. He was one of seven brothers, and to contribute, he started selling vegetables at a very young age and also working in a creamery, making and selling dairy products. He enjoyed history and sports, but he took a year off from school to help fund his brother’s education by working. Word is that he cared a bit more about football than school at West Point Academy, but he did graduate.</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy</p>
<p>Kennedy wasn’t really in a position to need a job as a young man, as his family lived comfortably by the time he was in Harvard. He had some health struggles as a young child, but he enjoyed a well-off, sports-based upbringing; his father and brother Joe encouraged a competitive spirit. He wrote his college thesis on why England wasn’t prepared for World War II, according to JFK Library’s website, and shortly after college, he enlisted in the Navy and became a lieutenant and commander of a patrol torpedo boat in the South Pacific. After Joe’s tragic death in the war, JFK decided to forgo his original plans of becoming a teacher or writer and instead ran for Congress. The rest, as they say, is history. These are the 13 things that must happen when a president dies.</p>
<p>Lyndon B. Johnson</p>
<p>This future president was prepared to fill big, and shiny, shoes as he was a shoe-shiner before making his way into the political spotlight. According to The Week, he used the part-time job to make summer money but went on to shine shoes through high school as well, before becoming a goat herder on his uncle’s farm.</p>
<p>Richard Nixon</p>
<p>Nothing makes for a future in politics like seeing the country’s problems up close and personal. This is how Nixon got started in his career—as a lawyer for the Office of Price Administration in Washington, D.C., which, according to the Richard Nixon Foundation, would “greatly influence policies Nixon would develop later in his career.” He also spent two summers visiting relatives in Arizona, where he would pluck chickens at the butcher. His other early jobs included spinning the wheel at the carnival, working as a pool boy at a country club, and helping at his father’s grocery store.</p>
<p>Can you recognize these baby photos of American presidents, including Nixon?</p>
<p>Gerald Ford</p>
<p>Ford was an all-star athlete and an Eagle Scout and, the Gerald Ford Foundation claims, the only president to earn that high honor bestowed upon Boy Scouts who complete certain tasks that display service, leadership, and an ideal attitude. He also worked hard at his first jobs as a painter for the family business and as a restaurant employee.</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter</p>
<p>PhotoQuest/Getty Images</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>As you probably know, Jimmy Carter was a Georgian peanut farmer, and he started working at a younger age than any president. According to Notable Biographies , “Jimmy already showed a talent for business: He began to sell peanuts on the streets of Plains.” He was also one of the original “flippers,” as he invested his earnings at age 9 in five bales of cotton, which he stored and resold years later, earning himself enough to purchase five old houses. Check out these 13 surprisingly frugal habits of past presidents and their families</p>
<p>Reagan had a combination of the most unique jobs, according to The Week. Way before he was a successful actor, he earned a quarter an hour working briefly for Ringling Brothers and later worked 12-hour days as a lifeguard. Early newspaper reports apparently credited him for saving 77 lives by the end of his lifeguarding career. He had a typical college side job of washing cafeteria tables and cooking, and he contributed to college costs and sent money home to his struggling family as well.</p>
<p>George H. W. Bush</p>
<p>The elder Bush’s first job was joining the Navy at age 18 in 1942. He served in World War II and was the youngest pilot to receive his wings at the time, according to the White House archives. He went on to complete 58 combat missions. His job was a bit more dangerous than some previous presidents’, as he was even shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire and was rescued from the water by a submarine. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton</p>
<p>Bill Clinton started working at age 13 at a grocery store, where he convinced the owner to let him sell comic books. In addition, Clinton was a “band kid” (and one of the presidents with the highest IQ scores), spending time at a band camp in the Ozarks playing saxophone. His family life involved his parents’ tumultuous marriages and divorces, and he apparently had to break up some violent fights. According to UVA’s Miller Center, his mom went to the racetracks on Sundays, and he usually went to church to hear the music.</p>

<p>George W. Bush</p>

<p>Barack Obama</p>
<p>Following in his father’s footsteps, George W. Bush joined the National Guard and flew planes. He would deal with oil later in politics, but it also gave him his start after graduating with an MBA from Harvard. Business Insider reports that he was a scout for drilling sites, and he would later go on to establish his own oil-exploration company.</p>
<p>In Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama found his first paycheck at a Baskin Robbins, as an ice cream scooper. According to New York, the conditions were brutal. “Chocolate ice cream gets real hard,” he said. “Your wrists hurt. [Carpal tunnel syndrome, although] they didn’t call it that.” Obama was the only president to be born outside the contiguous 48 states. He also apparently spent too much time eating ice cream, and he doesn’t like it anymore as an adult. These 10 jokes prove that Barack Obama is maybe the funniest president ever.</p>
<p>Donald Trump</p>
<p>In a pre-presidency interview with Forbes, Trump revealed that his first job involved scavenging for soda bottles with his brother at his dad’s sites to turn in for the deposit money. From there, he started accompanying rent collectors to learn about that process, and in the interview, he said that he “learned to stand out of the doorway to avoid the possibility of being shot.” He went on to joke about bottles being much safer to collect than rent and said that his job was probably equal to a “below-average allowance.”</p>

<h3 id="calvin-coolidge-silent">&ldquo;Calvin Coolidge: Silent&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gdb.voanews.com/5765aa12-6437-4c9a-9107-fdf3e26d3c0a_tv_w1200_r1.jpg" alt="img">
VOA Learning English presents America’s Presidents.</p>
<p>Today we are talking about Calvin Coolidge. He was the vice president under Warren Harding. When Harding died suddenly a little more than two years into his term, Coolidge became president.</p>
<p>Coolidge is linked to two opposing ideas. The first idea is quiet restraint.</p>
<p>The president’s nickname was “Silent Cal.” He rarely took part in casual conversation. And as a leader, he often thought the best action was not to take any action.</p>
<p>Many voters liked his “cool” style. Coolidge quickly earned a public image as a serious man who did not spend money or words easily.</p>
<p>But Coolidge is also linked to a period in U.S. history known as the Roaring Twenties.</p>
<p>In those years, the 1920s, the American economy was generally good. Many people spent money on exciting things – such as the still-new automobile – and on entertainment, including alcoholic drinks, cigarettes, and dancing. Creative expression such as jazz and Art Deco architecture became popular.</p>
<p>Calvin Coolidge is often given credit for helping fuel the Roaring Twenties with his pro-business economic policies.</p>
<p>But some historians caution against remembering Coolidge’s business freedom policies too fondly. They say he helped create the conditions for the severe economic depression that followed his presidency.</p>
<p>Early life</p>
<p>Calvin Coolidge and his sister were born and raised on a farm in the northeast state of Vermont.</p>
<p>Coolidge spoke highly of both his parents.</p>
<p>His father owned a store, and also held local political offices. He had a public image for honesty, public service, and thrift.</p>
<p>Young Calvin Coolidge helped his father in the store, and hoped to be just like him.</p>
<p>Coolidge also admired his mother’s strong character. He was 12 years old when she died, and he wrote that losing her was “the greatest grief that can come to a boy.”</p>
<p>Six years later, his sister also died.</p>
<p>Their deaths made young Calvin Coolidge even more serious than he already was.</p>
<p>But Coolidge was also known for his wit – a kind of humor that often depends on word play or intelligence. As a student at Amherst College in Massachusetts, Coolidge became known as an able and funny public speaker.</p>
<p>That skill helped him rise in politics. He began with lower-level offices in Massachusetts, and later served as that state’s governor.</p>
<p>​Along the way, he married Grace Anna Goodhue, a teacher for the deaf. She was known to be warm and social, and the couple were reported to have a loving marriage. They went on to have two sons.</p>
<p>In 1920, the Republican Party nominated Coolidge to be its vice presidential candidate. In general, voters liked the Republican ticket. They were ready for a change after the reform policies and international engagement of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the Republicans won the election in a landslide.</p>
<p>But Coolidge did not enjoy the office of vice president very much. He had little power in the government. During meetings, he often remained silent.</p>
<p>One summer night he and his wife were on vacation in Vermont. His father, Colonel Coolidge, woke them up in the middle of the night with some dramatic news: President Harding had died.</p>
<p>Reporters quickly gathered at the small farmhouse. Colonel Coolidge had not put electricity in the house. So everyone watched by the light of an oil lamp.</p>
<p>Colonel Coolidge was a public official. He used the family Bible and a copy of the Constitution to swear in his son as the 30th U.S. president.</p>
<p>Then the country’s new leader did a very sensible thing: he went back to bed.</p>
<p>Presidency</p>
<p>President Coolidge believed in limited government, especially limited federal government. He permitted state and Cabinet officials to decide as many issues as they could.</p>
<p>Coolidge used his authority to focus mostly on the country’s economy.</p>
<p>At the time he took office, the U.S. was at the start of an economic boom. Coolidge tried to maintain that prosperity. He did not regulate businesses too much, and he sharply reduced taxes, especially on the wealthy.</p>
<p>By nearly every measure, the economy grew.</p>
<p>But the policies also widened the divide between rich and poor Americans, and put the country’s economy in a risky situation.</p>
<p>More and more people began to invest their money in the stock market. Some put their dollars in dangerous investments.</p>
<p>And business owners produced more goods than most members of the public could really afford. Increasingly, people borrowed money on credit to pay for luxury goods.</p>
<p>At the same time, the economic situation of many American farmers was getting worse. The weather had been unusually dry in some places. And the price of food was falling.</p>
<p>Farmers asked the federal government for assistance. But Coolidge rejected several bills that might have helped them. The bills had other problems, Coolidge reasoned, and he did not think that the federal government should intervene in the situation.</p>
<p>So the farmers continued to suffer.</p>
<p>But most voters remained supportive of Coolidge. Even though the president was considered a quiet person, he spoke often on the radio, appeared in a talking film, met with reporters regularly, and posed in funny costumes for photographers.</p>
<p>He easily won elected in 1924. Historians believe he could have won another term, too, in 1928. But Coolidge chose not to seek office.</p>
<p>Some believed he was too saddened by the death of his teenaged son. Shortly after Coolidge became president, the boy had been playing tennis and slightly wounded his toe. The wound became infected. The infection spread to the boy’s blood. A few days later, he died.</p>
<p>Although Coolidge continued his presidency, he later said the joy had gone from the job.</p>
<p>But when he decided not to seek re-election, he did not talk about his feelings. Instead, he simply wrote a note to reporters saying: “I do not choose to run for President in 1928.”</p>
<p>His secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, was elected instead. Coolidge retired to his home in Massachusetts and led a quiet private life.</p>
<p>Legacy</p>
<p>President Coolidge was well-liked by most Americans. Later presidents – including Ronald Reagan – sought to follow some of his economic policies.</p>
<p>But many historians have questioned those policies. They say that Coolidge did not pay enough attention to the situation of farmers. And they say the stock market was rising too fast.</p>
<p>Seven months after Coolidge left office, the U.S. economy collapsed.</p>
<p>The country was still deep in the Great Depression when Coolidge passed away. He died – quietly, of course – during an afternoon nap at the age of 60.</p>
<p>His will was but a single sentence.</p>

<h3 id="letter-trump-coolidge-have-little-in-common-as-presidents">&ldquo;Letter: Trump, Coolidge have little in common as presidents&rdquo;</h3>

Perhaps the biggest difference between Coolidge and Trump was that Coolidge&rsquo;s nickname was &ldquo;Silent Cal.&rdquo; Donald Trump by contrast is boastful, crass, rude and arrogant and that&rsquo;s usually all before lunch! Unlike Trump, who before becoming president was allegedly busy laundering money for the Russian mafia with his real estate empire and becoming a successful reality TV star, Coolidge was an experienced public servant. Coolidge was an elected mayor, Lt. governor, governor and vice president all before becoming president when Harding died in office. Coolidge ran successfully for re-election in 1924 garnering 382 electoral votes, which is an actual &ldquo;landslide.&rdquo; Comparably, Trump has never won the popular vote in any election. His historically low approval ratings and strong likelihood of impeachment demonstrate effectively that he is one of a kind.
