<p>Minehead is among the towns in the country most affected economically by the coronavirus lockdown, according to a study.</p>
<p>The coastal town, which is home to a number of beaches, has been the joint fifth worst hit area in England and Wales according to the report, which has been produced by the University of Southampton and the Centre for Towns.</p>
<p>The report looked at how many people in each town are employed in the four sectors that have been placed most at risk by the economic shutdown.</p>
<p>These are in accommodation, non-food based retail, in pubs and restaurants and in arts and leisure.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 48 per cent of all workers in Minehead, which is home to a number of beaches and a Butlin&rsquo;s resort, are employed in one of these four sectors, making it particularly susceptible to the impacts of the lockdown and more at risk of suffering permanent economic damage.</p>
<p>That includes being placed on furlough and the longer term risk of redundancy once the pandemic is over.</p>

<p>The South West has been particularly badly hit compared with other areas of the country, with nine of the 20 most affected communities being in the region.</p>
<p>That includes Newquay, which has been the hardest hit area in the entire country, with 56 per cent of workers in the most at-risk sectors.</p>
<p>St Ives, Penzance, Falmouth and St Blazey in Cornwall, Kingsteignton and Sidmouth in Devon, and Swanage in Dorset are also among the 20 worst hit areas, with employment in the at risk sectors ranging from 48 per cent in St Ives to 39.3 per cent in St Blazey.</p>
<p>(Image: Birmingham Mail/Handout)</p>
<p>Minehead also has the third highest proportion of people employed in the accommodation sector, at 23.4 per cent and behind only Newquay and Skegness.</p>
<p>This is primarily due to the number of staff employed by Butlin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the county, Street and Wells rank in the top 20 towns when it comes to people employed in the non-food retail sector, at 20.9 and 20.6 per cent respectively, although neither are identified as among the most economically at risk communities.</p>
<p>Somerset has no towns which rank among the top 20 employers of people in the arts and leisure or pubs and restaurant sector.</p>
<p>Additional measures needed to prevent &ldquo;permanent damage&rdquo; from lockdown</p>
<p>As CornwallLive reports, the Centre for Towns report says that additional government measures, on top of those already announced, are needed to prevent the initial shock of the lockdown from &ldquo;turning into permanent damage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The study adds that the impact of COVID-19 economic measures on the South West economy are “likely to be both more severe and longer lasting than in other parts of the UK due to its sector structure”.</p>
<p>In addition to the current economic risks, the study also looked at resilient towns could be to the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown by analysing their socio-economic characteristics.</p>
<p>While the UK population is getting older across the whole country, some places are aging at different rates to others.</p>
<p>University towns and large cities remain attractive to younger people, while ex-industrial and coastal towns are seeing a greater and more steady aging of their populations.</p>
<p>This factor is already having an impact on local economies, which will make recovery more difficult.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that many coastal towns already suffer from economic decline, social isolation, a lack of investment, under-employment and low levels of social wellbeing, challenges that are likely to be further exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>John Houghton, a PhD student at the University of Southampton and who co-authored the report, said: “Our research shows that coastal and ex-industrial towns are most economically vulnerable due to the shutdown. These areas have the highest proportion of workers in the industries most affected by closures such as tourism and retail.”

The Summerfield project, named after a nearby Lutheran church, is predominantly gas-fired. It comprises eight combined cycle fast-start gas turbines capable of producing 380 megawatts of power, 30 megawatts from storage batteries, and 12 megawatts from an array of 40,000 solar panels.</p>
<p>A 512-page planning document shows the storage batteries will be housed in a large storage shed encompassing 800 square metres.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said the Summerfield project would be able to generate enough electricity to supply 550,000 houses.</p>
<p>It is located close to an existing high-pressure SEA Gas pipeline, while a high voltage transmission line operated by ElectraNet already runs through the allotment, which is currently used for low-grade cropping and cattle grazing.</p>
<p>The aim is to also provide power into Victoria through the Heywood interconnector, and eventually into New South Wales via the proposed NSW-South Australia interconnector.</p>
<p>GE is providing the technical knowhow for the project.</p>
<p>GE Australia Country Leader Sam Maresh said the Summerfield project was a &lsquo;&lsquo;significant development&rsquo;&rsquo; for South Australia’s energy market because the plant would deliver an instant response to changes in renewable generation supply and demand, using gas to provide dispatchable power that will back up wind and solar energy.</p>
<p>He said the new power station would provide the firming capacity the market needs.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The State Commission Assessment Panel in South Australia has given the all-clear for the project.</p>
<p>SAPGen expects the Summerfield power station will be feeding electricity into the grid in 2022.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The development of this project will enhance the reliability and security of energy supply in the National Electricity Market,&rsquo;&rsquo; SAPGen&rsquo;s Mr Lee said.</p>
<p>He said it would also deliver substantial benefits to the economy and help to reduce electricity prices. South Australia&rsquo;s unemployment rate climbed to 7.9 per cent in the national unemployment figures out on Thursday, equal with Queensland and behind Western Australia at 8.1 per cent.</p>
<p>AGL in November, 2019 switched on a $295 million fast-start gas-fired power generator in South Australia in time for summer peak demand.</p>
<p>The Barker Inlet generator on Torrens Island about 25 kilometres from the Adelaide CBD was the first addition of on-demand generating capacity in the National Electricity Market for seven years.

<p>New homes could be heading to Llanelli after plans were put forward by Carmarthenshire Council for a development of up to 202 properties in the Dafen area of the town.</p>
<p>If given the green light, the Cwm y Nant development would be built on land north of Gors-Fach, with the main entrance to the site from nearby Nant-y-Gro.</p>
<p>An archaeological assessment, carried out by Archaeology Wales, states: &ldquo;The development area occupies an irregular plot of land bounded by arable fields to the east and south with housing to the west and retail and industrial units to the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The site would be created on 8.50 hectares of land close to the Dafen Industrial Estate, with Prince Philip Hospital and Parc Trostre and Parc Pemberton retails parks all a short drive away.</p>
<p>The current site has been referred to as overgrown grassland, with an area close to the site being used as an agricultural field.</p>
<p>The homes would be part of the county council&rsquo;s local development plan, which sets out a vision for the future of Carmarthenshire, as well as a framework for the distribution and delivery of growth and development.</p>
<p>The agents, Asbri Planning Ltd, carried out a pre-application consultation on behalf of the county council for the development.</p>
<p>(Image: Urban Design Box)</p>
<p>The report details concerns from Llanelli Rural Council, calling the site &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; and that the local area &ldquo;lack general amenities e.g. shops, recreational facilities, schools places and GP surgeries&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A response to the concerns reads: &ldquo;The site forms part of a wider housing allocation identified within the local development plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to obtain this status within the plan, it would have had to undergone rigorous testing and reviews by both the LPA and Planning Inspectorate to establish that the site was suitable for residential development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carmarthenshire Council leader and executive board member for regeneration, Councillor Emlyn Dole said: &ldquo;This proposed development contributes towards our plans for delivering over 900 new affordable homes in Carmarthenshire in the near future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This key strategic site is allocated for residential development in the current Carmarthenshire Local Development Plan which was subject to wide-scale consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further consultation has taken place in the community and with statutory bodies as part of our more detailed plans for the site which we have recently submitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We intend to progress with the planning application so that we’re in a position to proceed with the development at an appropriate time in the future.&rdquo;

<h3 id="five-cornwall-towns-among-the-worst-hit-by-lockdown-in-the-country">&ldquo;Five Cornwall towns among the worst hit by lockdown in the country&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.cornwalllive.com/incoming/article4076122.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GMP_DCM_230420Newquay_13JPG.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Five towns in Cornwall are likely to be among the places in the country most affected economically by the lockdown, according to a study.</p>
<p>A report released by the University of Southampton and the Centre for Towns has shown that coastal communities in particular will be hit hard as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at the distribution of workers in four sectors that are most impacted by the economic shutdown - accommodation; non-food retail; pubs and restaurants; and arts and leisure.</p>
<p>The South West is particularly affected by the government shutdown as it has the highest proportion of people employed in each of the four sectors, with Wales a close second.</p>
<p>At 56%, Newquay has the highest combined employment in the four at-risk sectors identified, making it the most exposed town in England and Wales.</p>
<p>St Ives (48%), Penzance (42%), Falmouth (41%) and St Blazey (39%) also feature in the top 20 most affected places. Cornwall has more towns in the list than any other region.</p>
<p>Both Newquay and St Ives, as well as five other places in Cornwall, had some of the highest increases in unemployment claimants in the country in March and April, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>(Image: Greg Martin / Cornwall Live)</p>
<p>The closure of hotels, campsites and caravan parks has had a major impact on coastal towns, but they are also disproportionately affected by the shutdown of pubs, restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>Accommodation</p>
<p>The accommodation sector covers all people employed in hotels, bed and breakfasts, guest houses, campsites and caravan parks. The government shutdown has effectively closed these sectors for at least two months.</p>
<p>Whilst the sector overall constitutes a small proportion of all employment in England and Wales (1.4%), there are many towns reliant on these sectors for local employment, particularly coastal towns which need the revenue associated with tourism.</p>
<p>In Newquay, 26% of the workforce is employed in accommodation, more than anywhere else in the country. St Ives, at 14.5%, is also affected.</p>
<p>(Image: Greg Martin/Cornwall Live)</p>
<p>Art and leisure sector</p>
<p>This sector comprises a range of sub-sectors. Creative arts and entertainment facilities, libraries, museums, cultural services and sports activities are all covered. The government shutdown and social isolation has effectively closed this sector down.</p>
<p>St Blazey, at 22.5%, has by far the highest proportion of people employed in this sector in the country, mainly because of the nearby Eden Project.</p>
<p>(Image: The Eden Project)</p>
<p>Non-food retail sector</p>
<p>The non-food retail sector is made up of employees working in high street shops, stalls and markets. This is a sector which has already faced significant challenges in recent years. Dozens of multiple chain retailers have ceased trading in the last decade and many high streets are in decline, particularly but not exclusively in towns.</p>
<p>Therefore, the advent of COVID-19 provides yet another challenge to the sector, meaning many employees in this sector are either being furloughed or losing work altogether.</p>
<p>Towns in the South West, North West and Wales are more likely to have higher proportions of people employed in the retail sector, according to the study. The only Cornwall town in the top ten is Penzance, where 23% of people are employed in the sector.</p>
<p>Pubs and restaurants sector</p>
<p>As with the retail sector, pubs have been facing a challenging landscape in recent years. Many pubs have closed across Britain. Along with restaurants, this sector has been shut down due to COVID-19, although many restaurants and some pubs are carrying out deliveries.</p>
<p>Cornwall only has one town in the top 20; in St Ives, 20% of people are employed in the sector.</p>

<p>Ability to recover</p>
<p>The Centre for Towns report says additional government measures, on top of those already announced, will be needed to prevent the initial shock of the lockdown from &ldquo;turning into permanent damage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The study adds that the shock in the South West due to the COVID-19 management measures is “likely to be both more severe and longer lasting than in other parts of the UK due to its sector structure”.</p>

<p>As well as looking at the current economic risks, the study also considered how resilient towns could be to the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown by looking their socio-economic characteristics. Whilst the UK population is getting older across the whole country, places are aging at different rates.</p>
<p>University towns and large cities continue to attract younger people whilst ex-industrial and coastal towns are seeing a steady aging of their populations. This is already impacting local economies which will make recovery more difficult.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the researchers found that many coastal towns already suffer from economic decline, social isolation, a lack of investment, under-employment and low levels of social wellbeing. These challenges are likely to be further exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>John Houghton, a PhD student at the University of Southampton who co-authored the report, said: “Our research shows that coastal and ex-industrial towns are most economically vulnerable due to the shutdown. These areas have the highest proportion of workers in the industries most affected by closures such as tourism and retail.”

<h3 id="chepstows-business-owners-on-coronavirus-lockdown">&ldquo;Chepstow&rsquo;s business owners on coronavirus lockdown&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/resources/images/11405320/" alt="img">
Now more than ever Gwent’s independent stores are relying on customers to use their services and keep them afloat, and that feeling is keenly felt in Chepstow, writes JONATHON HILL.</p>
<p>FOR one reason or another, Chepstow&rsquo;s main shopping areas at Moor Street and St Mary Street saw a drop in footfall pre-lockdown, but a trio of business owners have come forward to thank consumers for their custom through what has been a seriously challenging two months.</p>
<p>Matt Trim, of Trim’s Town Gate Butchery on Moor Street, says he has seen a rise in the number of people coming through his doors each week, and he is now almost fully booked.</p>
<p>Trim’s is currently operating a two-in-two-out service, as well as deliveries on a Tuesday and a Thursday, which Mr Trim says is “at capacity”.</p>
<p>Matt Trim, of Trim&rsquo;s Town Gate Butchers.</p>
<p>“It has been unbelievable how many customers have supported me,” he said. “I feel lucky that I’ve been able to stay open. I don’t know whether it’s because the supermarkets are so busy or people are starting to think differently about using independent stores, but I’ve seen lots of new faces too.”</p>
<p>MORE NEWS:</p>
<p>He isn’t the only one seeing an influx in customers. Jeordan Renouf – owner of the CodFather Fish and Chip Shop, says he has been inundated with orders.</p>
<p>“We were quite lucky we’d just signed up to Just Eat and got everything sorted for that, so we have been able to do lots of orders,” he said.</p>
<p>Jeordan Renouf at the CodFather has had a brilliant time delivering food to customers new and old.</p>
<p>Mr Renouf, who opened for the first time for visiting customers since March on Monday, says he has had so many orders that he didn’t have enough drivers to deliver the meals, and had to start delivering the food himself.</p>
<p>“I’ve really enjoyed it,” he added, “it’s given me a chance to get out the shop and get to know people. I think people have made more of an effort to support us through this time, and I think as visible business owners we have a chance to give something back to our communities as well.</p>
<p>“One elderly woman told me I am the only person she sees in lockdown when I deliver the food. It’s a chance for us to do a bit more and go the extra mile.”</p>
<p>Mr Renouf is certainly going the extra mile, and is also offering a 20 per cent discount for all key workers.</p>
<p>Matt Taylor at Chepstow Books and Gifts, thought the shop could be in for a gruelling time given that it wasn’t allowed to open in lockdown, but he has been pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Matt Taylor, of Chepstow Books and Gifts.</p>
<p>“I think we have been lucky that many people seem to have deemed lockdown as a good time to get through some books,” he laughed.</p>
<p>“We’ve been operating a delivery service as well as an ordering service where we leave the books outside for people to collect.</p>
<p>“While we’ve not managed to reach the sales we were achieving before lockdown, we have stayed pretty consistent.”</p>
<p>The lockdown has also offered a chance for Mr Taylor to move most products online and diversify his business, and he says he is now ready to open again when the time comes.</p>
<p>“We’ve managed to get a screen for the till and necessary protective equipment for the staff, and plenty of hand sanitiser too, so we’re all set,” he added.</p>
<p>Life in lockdown hasn’t been as easy for new businesses like Wye Valley Meadery, however.</p>
<p>Mead-crafting brothers Kit and Matthew Newell have put everything into their new venture, and have been desperately unlucky with the timing of the pandemic.</p>
<p>It has been a different story for brothers Kit and Matthew Newell, whose dreams of starting their meadery brewing events this spring were dashed.</p>
<p>“Pretty much all our plans for 2020 have gone out the window,” Kit said. “We had invested in a tap room at our site at Station Road Industrial Estate, and had lots of plans for events at the meadery, where we wanted to teach people about mead and eco-friendly brewing.”</p>
<p>All of the pair’s events have been cancelled, and they have also slipped through the cracks of government support, not qualifying because they haven’t been running long enough and pay business rates through their rent package rather than directly, among other reasons.</p>
<p>“We are continuing to sell stuff online which is keeping the lights on,” Kit added, “and I’d like to think once we’re through this period what we are offering will be even more popular.”

<h3 id="massive-1000mw-baseload-wind-solar-and-hydrogen-plant-pitched-for-nsw">&ldquo;Massive 1000MW “baseload” wind, solar and hydrogen plant pitched for NSW&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://reneweconomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Canva-Multiple-solar-panels-pollution-free-green-energy-base-optimised.jpg" alt="img">
New South Wales could become host to one of Australia’s first solar, wind and hydrogen “baseload” power plants, under a multi-billion dollar plan pitched for the state.</p>
<p>The massive proposal, to be dubbed “Project NEO” would see up to 1000MW of combined wind, solar and hydrogen fuel cell generation capacity deployed in New South Wales, delivering continuous power to the state.</p>
<p>The $3.5 billion concept proposed by Infinite Blue Energy would see the delivery of a zero emissions “baseload” supply of electricity to the New South Wales grid and aims to transition a range of energy intensive industries to running on 100 per cent renewables by 2027.</p>
<p>“A traditional weakness with solar and wind energy is the variability associated with a reliance on natural seasonal changes and conditions,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>“By converting the solar and wind energy into Green Hydrogen, it is possible to provide electricity when there is no wind, a cloudy day or limited to zero sun exposure at night via its Fuel Cell Technology.”</p>
<p>Infinite Blue Energy is a relative newcomer to the Australian energy scene, but which is being led by a team of executives with a range of experience previously from the oil and gas sector.</p>
<p>Its proposal is one of a number of large scale “mega projects” that will look to store or export electricity on a massive scale.</p>
<p>Last week BP said it was looking at a 1.5GW wind and solar project in W.A. to create renewable hydrogen, Siemens has proposed a bigger 5GW renewable hydrogen project in the same region, and further north the Asia Renewable Energy Hub is contemplating a 15GW wind and solar project, although that focus is also on a sub=sea cable to south-east Asia. In the Northern Territory, the 10GW Sun Cable project is looking at massive battery storage and a link to Singapore.</p>
<p>Infinite Blue Energy will look to design and develop a project that would use large-scale solar and wind projects to produce electricity, and store hydrogen that could be supplied directly to industrial users, or be converted back to electricity during periods of low wind and solar supplies.</p>
<p>The company estimates that the project would require around 235 wind turbines, and 1,250 hectares of land for solar generation, but the company said that it would look to use high-value sites for solar and wind production, in combination with a “distributed generation model” to diversify the project’s supplies of renewable power.</p>
<p>“This allows the generation sites to blend in with existing land users with minimal impact. The potential also exists for mine voids to be used to minimise visual impact on adjacent landowners,” the company said.</p>
<p>Overall, the proposed project could meet the equivalent energy needs of around 2 million New South Wales homes.</p>
<p>The project would look to supply zero emissions energy to some of New South Wales most energy intensive industrial users and would look to draw upon some of the existing power station expertise within the state, by providing opportunities to re-deploy former coal-fired power station workers.</p>
<p>“Infinite Blue Energy anticipates that a significant proportion of the workforce required for Project NEO will be drawn from the existing coal fired power stations in NSW, since many of the skills are similar,” the company said.</p>
<p>“Project NEO will produce local and indirect employment, allow existing industries to de-carbonise, and facilitate the establishment of new industries,” CEO of Infinite Blue Energy Stephen Gauld added.</p>
<p>“It will localise manufacturing, give a 100% green supply of power to NSW, fuel the reduction of the state’s carbon emission and can therefore play a pivotal role in ultimately helping Australia become leaders in carbon emission reduction.”</p>
<p>Renewable hydrogen provides an opportunity to transition many industrial manufacturing processes that have traditionally been reliant on fossil fuel supplies, such as steel production, to a zero emissions alternative.</p>
<p>Several European steel manufacturers have announced trials of green steel manufacturing, and the Grattan Institute has argued that a similar shift in Australian steel production could generate thousands of new jobs, particularly in sectors likely to be impacted by a transition to zero emissions.</p>
<p>Infinite Blue Energy has announced that it will commence a feasibility study and commence design work over the next 18 months and has started negotiations with potential off-takers for both electricity and hydrogen supplies.</p>
<p>“The vision at IBE is to show the world, first and foremost, that Australia has the technology, skills and entrepreneurial mindset to be a true leader in the development of Green Hydrogen plants,” Gauld added.</p>
<p>“We are currently in robust negotiations with major electricity users in the NSW Hunter Region that have confirmed their intentions to transition to Green Hydrogen baseload Electricity this decade.”</p>
<p>Infinite Blue Energy announced in April that it had secured finance for a $300 million renewable hydrogen development planned for Western Australia.</p>
<p>That project, the Arrowsmith Hydrogen Project, would be constructed at a facility in the town of Dongara, located 320km north of Perth, and would produce 25 tonnes of green hydrogen each day, powered by wind and solar.</p>
<p>The project is set to include its own dedicated onsite supplies of renewable electricity, including 85MW of solar power, supplemented by 75MW of wind generation capacity.</p>
<p>Infinite Blue Energy is ultimately looking to tap into demand for renewable hydrogen from China and South Korea, with an aim for first production hydrogen at the Arrowsmith in late-2022.</p>
