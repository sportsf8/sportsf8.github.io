<p>Jordana Brewster has seen a change in Hollywood.</p>
<p>The star of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise has told Health magazine that these days actresses are treated with more respect than they were in the 1990s when budding stars had to do sexy shoots for men&rsquo;s magazine to get noticed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I was coming up in this business, it was all about, &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get on the cover of Maxim, and let&rsquo;s put on a bikini or lingerie,&rdquo; said the 40-year-old siren. &lsquo;And now it&rsquo;s no longer about that, which is really refreshing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Better days: Jordana Brewster has seen a change in Hollywood. The star of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise has told Health magazine that these days actresses are treated with more respect than they were in the 1990s</p>
<p>Showing skin: &lsquo;When I was coming up in this business, it was all about, &ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s get on the cover of Maxim, and let&rsquo;s put on a bikini or lingerie,&rdquo; said the 40-year-old siren. &lsquo;And now it&rsquo;s no longer about that, which is really refreshing&rsquo;; seen in 2011</p>
<p>Gone are the days when the Yale graduate had to walk around in her films dressed in very little.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even with a movie like Fast &amp; Furious, it&rsquo;s awesome that we&rsquo;re all wearing pants,&rsquo; added Brewster.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, there were the booty- dancing scenes around the car, but those are gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s about strength and loyalty to one another. I almost wish I was born 20 years later so I could really thrive in what&rsquo;s happening right now in the industry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She also told the magazine how she is in therapy.</p>
<p>This cover - on stands June 12 - comes out just after People claimed she has separated from her husband of 13 years, Andrew Form.</p>
<p>New world: Gone are the days when she had to walk around in her films dressed in very little. &lsquo;Even with a movie like Fast &amp; Furious, it&rsquo;s awesome that we&rsquo;re all wearing pants,&rsquo; added Brewster. &lsquo;Of course, there were the booty- dancing scenes around the car, but those are gone.. Seen with the late Paul Walker</p>
<p>The change: &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s about strength and loyalty to one another. I almost wish I was born 20 years later so I could really thrive in what&rsquo;s happening right now in the industry,&rsquo; she noted</p>
<p>&lsquo;In some ways [self-isolation] been good because it&rsquo;s pushed me toward getting back into mental health,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m doing therapy and acting and writing classes through Zoom. It&rsquo;s also been very difficult to create a structure, when really there is no structure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really hope that I don&rsquo;t get back into the rat race, that I continue to slow down a bit and continue to simplify. I think that&rsquo;s the biggest gift.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brunette bombshell shared that she has told her kids about the pandemic. &lsquo;We&rsquo;re pretty open. My youngest plays doctor, and so he&rsquo;s dealing with it by imaginative play.</p>
<p>Therapy is key: As far as social distancing, she is not relaxed about it but thinks it has made her focus on what is important. &lsquo;In some ways it&rsquo;s been good because it&rsquo;s pushed me toward getting back into mental health,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m doing therapy and acting and writing classes through Zoom&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lovely as ever: The photo shoot was done by Eric Ray Davidson and the issue goes on sale on June 12</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Mommy, you have coronavirus.&rdquo; And then he gives me a shot,&rsquo; added the cover girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s heartbreaking. But I feel honesty is the best policy because even when we go out and they have to wear masks, how do you explain that? In some ways, I think my anxiety level has gone down because it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;OK, there&rsquo;s a real problem, and everything else pales in comparison.&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Brewster also talked about the ninth installment of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, which has been pushed back a full year due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re family,&rsquo; said Jordana. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s like this was lightning in a bottle. When I first heard the title, Fast &amp; Furious, I was like, &ldquo;Guys, I don&rsquo;t know if this movie is going to work.&rdquo; And then it was this massive success, and it resonated with so many people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s great about this franchise is none of us takes that for granted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vin [Diesel] works his ass off to make sure that the movies continue to have integrity and that the themes resonate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Justin [Lin, the director] also works his butt off. We want to put something great out into the world, and we all work really hard. We go to each other&rsquo;s birthdays, and I text Vin for advice—we&rsquo;re all very close.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Parting ways: This cover comes out just after it was claimed she has separated from her husband of 13 years, Andrew Form; pictured in November</p>
<p>Jordana and Andrew have reportedly &lsquo;quietly separated&rsquo; after 13 years of marriage. The pair, who share three-year-old son Rowan and Julian, six, reportedly ended their relationship earlier this year.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have the utmost respect for each other,&rsquo; a source told People. &lsquo;They remain committed to lovingly co-parent their two children as a team.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actress met film producer Andrew, 48, on the set of the horror movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning which he produced and she starred in.</p>
<p>The pair&rsquo;s whirlwind romance escalated quickly after they vacationed in the Bahamas for Christmas that same year. She soon moved into his Hollywood Hills home.</p>
<p>On their one-year anniversary he proposed with a 3.2-carat engagement ring and they wed in a private ceremony after a six-month engagement.</p>
<p>Handling it well: &lsquo;They remain committed to lovingly co-parent their two children as a team&rsquo; a source told People; seen in 2017</p>
<p>The exchanged vows on Nevis Island, nearly two years after meeting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We started dating in secret, you know, hanging out in my trailer, because it would have been unprofessional otherwise,&rsquo; the mother-of-two previously told InStyle Weddings ahead of their nuptials.</p>
<p>She added: &lsquo;But every day, Andrew wore these work boots to the set, and if I was lying down in the shot or there was equipment in the way, I&rsquo;d look for his shoes. It was comfortable just to know he was nearby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pair&rsquo;s breakup appears amicable, as they were seen on a number of strolls together last month.</p>
<p>She has a resume that includes TV shows American Crime Story, Secrets And Lies, Lethal Weapon and TNT&rsquo;s Dallas reboot. But she is best known for her role as Mia in the Fast &amp; Furious big screen franchise.</p>
<p>She first played Mia in 2001&rsquo;s The Fast And The Furious and has reprised the character in five subsequent films including the yet-to-be-released F9.

<p>Later he became the co-lead in Hobbs and Shaw film series, and it seemed like his role was forgotten by people in the Fast and Furious movie. Recently in an interview, it was indicated that that fans did not really forget his character and want him back.</p>
<p>Fans were asked to wait to see what happens, which leads to a hint that there is a chance that we may see him in the ninth part of the movie again.</p>

<h3 id="10-most-ridiculous-stunts-in-fast-and-the-furious-movies">&ldquo;10 Most Ridiculous Stunts In Fast And The Furious Movies&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2017/04/a2e79663f6eb5973-1200x675.jpg" alt="img">
Cast your mind all the way back to 2001, when the very first Fast and the Furious movie introduced us to Dominic Toretto and his gang of burly vest-wearing petrolheads. Back then, the F&amp;F films were all about small scale heists and something called ‘the streets’, The action was mostly limited to the road, one quarter mile at a time.</p>
<p>Today, you&rsquo;d barely recognise the same franchise under the hood. The locations are now global, the stakes are often world-affecting, and Dom’s gang is now not only ethnically diverse, but also capable of planning and executing the most ludicrous feats of automobile insanery.</p>
<p>It’s these inventive uses of vehicular destruction that has elevated the franchise however. Our intrepid crew can use all manner of ingenuity to get the job done, but only if there’s a moving vehicle involved, and said vehicle gets totalled in the process.</p>
<p>With this in mind, here are ten times when Fast and Furious stunts went way past the redline of believability.

Avec Fast and Furious 10, Vin Diesel compte bien tenir une promesse faite à Paul Walker, et pousser la franchise jusqu’à atteindre l’incroyable score d’une dizaine de films au compteur.</p>
<p>Malgré son tragique décès en 2013, l’interprète de Brian O’Conner continue d’être une pièce inaltérable du puzzle de la saga Universal. Ses anciennes co-stars lui rendent régulièrement hommage, et se sont fait un devoir de porter cet univers chromé aussi loin que possible en son honneur. Une tâche moins difficile qu’il n’y paraît, puisque les aventures vrombissantes de Dominic Toretto et de son groupe n’ont jamais été aussi populaires qu’aujourd’hui. Toutefois, il se pourrait que la franchise fasse un break après Fast and Furious 10, et revienne seulement au bout d’une dizaine d’années.</p>
<p>En effet, si la saga est censée se finir au bout de 10 épisodes, elle est beaucoup trop lucrative aux yeux d’Universal pour que les producteurs abandonnent cette mane providentielle alors qu’elle n’est pas épuisée. Avec un box-office total s’élevant à presque 6 milliards de dollars (pour huit films et un spin-off), il est certain que les studios vont chercher par tous les moyens comment continuer à exploiter l’univers de Fast and Furious. Déjà, le projet 100% féminin dont Vin Diesel a récemment donné des nouvelles, ainsi que la suite de Hobbs &amp; Shaw, leur permettront de tester (ou confirmer) la popularité des personnages secondaires dans les salles obscures. Mais comme l’a fait Star Wars avant eux, on les imagine parfaitement mettre la saga sur pause durant une décennie avant de produire d’autres suites.</p>
<p>Pendant cette période, ils se concentreraient sur les nombreux projets dérivés de la franchise. Puis, en revenant sur le devant de la scène aux alentours de 2035, ils surferaient sur la vague de nostalgie que ferait naître le retour du Dominic Toretto de Vin Diesel auprès des fans de la franchise. Ces derniers amèneraient leurs enfants dans les salles obscures afin de leur faire découvrir un de leurs univers préférés. De quoi entamer un nouveau chapitre de Fast &amp; Furious avec la génération de héros suivante, c’est-à-dire les enfants des personnages principaux, et fédérer une communauté toujours plus grande de spectateurs.
