<p>She was not told until 2018 that two smear tests she had undergone through the screening programme in 2009 and 2012 were reported incorrectly.</p>
<p>She sued the Health Service Executive (HSE) and two laboratories and was awarded 2.1 million euro in damages at Dublin’s High Court.</p>

<p>Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he was deeply saddened by her death.</p>
<p>“Ruth was a brave, courageous woman who worked tirelessly for others and for future generations of women in this country,” he said.</p>
<p>“She was generous of spirit and had the interests of others at heart.</p>
<p>“I wish to extend my sympathies to her husband Paul, her daughter Libby, her family and friends.</p>

<h3 id="cervicalcheck-campaigner-ruth-morrissey-dies-aged-39">&ldquo;CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey dies aged 39&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/0014d67a-1600.jpg" alt="img">
CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died at the age of 39.</p>
<p>Her death comes two years after she gave evidence in the High Court in her action against the HSE and two laboratories over the misreading of her cervical smear tests.</p>
<p>She and her husband, Paul, won the case and were awarded damages.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Supreme Court heard that the full sum of €2.16m awarded to them had been paid.</p>
<p>The High Court heard that Mrs Morrissey was not told until 2018 that a review carried out in 2014 showed smears taken under the CervicalCheck screening programme in 2009 and 2012 had been incorrectly reported.</p>
<p>Mrs Morrissey gave evidence during the case in July 2018.</p>
<p>She had been told earlier that year that her cancer had returned.</p>
<p>In her evidence she described having the &ldquo;most difficult conversation&rdquo; she ever had to have with her then seven-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>She said she had told her daughter she could not promise she was not going to pass away but she would promise to fight as hard as she could to live for her.</p>
<p>The High Court found in favour of the Morrisseys saying that those who examine cervical smear tests should have &ldquo;absolute confidence&rdquo; that a slide was clear before passing it as such, a ruling later upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>A statement issued on behalf of Ruth&rsquo;s husband Paul today said that neither the HSE nor the State ever apologised to Ruth Morrissey.</p>
<p>The statement said that now it was &ldquo;too late&rdquo; for such an apology.</p>
<p>President Michael D Higgins paid tribute to Mrs Morrissey, saying: &ldquo;So many people across Ireland will have learned with great sadness of the passing of Ruth Morrissey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth Morrissey&rsquo;s tremendous courage in an arduous campaign for truth and justice leaves a legacy of courage for all Irish people, and for those campaigning for women&rsquo;s right to healthcare in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sabina and I send our sincere condolences to her husband Paul, their daughter, her family and friends, and to all those who have shared Mrs Morrissey&rsquo;s journey.&rdquo;

Ruth Morrissey, a cervical check campaigner, who sued the HSE over the misreading of her cervical smear tests has died.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey had only received the full payment of the €2.16m she won in court during the week.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Supreme Court heard that the entire payment had been received by Morrissey and her husband, despite an allowed appeal for over €500k of the damages concerning one of the laboratories.</p>
<p>Ms Morrisey had to wait until 2018 to discover that a 2014 review of tests she had been given in 2009 and 2012 were incorrect.</p>
<p>I was on my own this morning at home when I received the news that I have been dreading for some time now, the news that my good friend and fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died. Ruth passed away peacefully at Milford Hospice… pic.twitter.com/QWms9G6rH1 — Vicky Phelan (@PhelanVicky) July 19, 2020</p>
<p>Fellow campaigner Vicky Phelan posted a tribute to her friend online, saying ‘I was on my own this morning at home when I received the news that I have been dreading for some time now, the news that my good friend and fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died. Ruth passed away peacefully at Milford Hospice.’</p>
<p>While another survivor and patient advocate, Lorraine Walsh said ‘Rest in Peace @RuthMorrissey a beautiful, gentle lady, your life has been cut short far too soon, you shouldered a great burden for many of us, @221plus my sincere condolences to Paul &amp; Libby and your family, May your gentle soul rest in peace.’

<p>The Irish cervical cancer campaigner Ruth Morrissey, who was awarded €2.1m (£1.8m) in damages over the alleged misreading of smear tests, has died aged 39.</p>
<p>Mrs Morrissey had claimed that if tests in 2009 and 2012 had been correctly interpreted and reported, she could have avoided developing cancer.</p>
<p>She sued the Health Service Executive (HSE) and two laboratories in 2018.</p>
<p>In a statement, her husband Paul said she never received an apology.</p>
<p>He added that it was now &ldquo;too late&rdquo; for either the HSE or the state to say sorry.</p>
<p>Mrs Morrissey died at Milford Hospice in County Limerick on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>During her legal action, the High Court heard that Mrs Morrissey was not told until 2018 that a review four years earlier had showed the tests carried out under the CervicalCheck screening programme had been reported incorrectly.</p>
<p>The HSE admitted it owed a duty of care to Mrs Morrissey, while the laboratories denied all the claims.</p>
<p>In February 2018, she was diagnosed with a recurrence of her cancer and given a prognosis of 12 to 24 months.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Inspiration&rsquo;</p>
<p>Giving evidence in court in July 2018, Ms Morrissey said she had to have the &ldquo;most difficult conversation&rdquo; she ever had to with her then 7-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>She told the court she did not want to die.</p>
<p>It was the first case of its kind to be heard in full in the Republic of Ireland and considered in a High Court judgement.</p>
<p>In July 2020, the Irish Supreme Court heard the family had received the full amount of money awarded to them.</p>
<p>Paul Morrissey said his wife showed &ldquo;courage and determination&rdquo; during the trial and is an &ldquo;enduring inspiration of strength and determination that should help many others through difficult times in the future&rdquo;.

<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/0012fa9e-1600.jpg" alt="img">
The Supreme Court will give its decision later on an appeal against a High Court judgment in the case of Limerick woman Ruth Morrissey, who is terminally ill with cervical cancer.</p>
<p>A key issue is the High Court&rsquo;s finding that screeners should have &ldquo;absolute confidence&rdquo; that a smear test has no abnormalities before passing it as clear.</p>
<p>The five judge court&rsquo;s decision in the case will deal with the legal standard of care for cervical screening and is seen as a test case which could affect other cervical cancer cases and the work of the CervicalCheck tribunal.</p>
<p>After a three-day appeal, the Chief Justice Frank Clarke said it was a &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo; case both because of its underlying and tragic conditions and the legal issues with very wide implications.</p>
<p>He said the court would try to give its judgment in a way that &ldquo;brings clarity&rdquo; to this area as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The HSE and two laboratories - Quest Diagnostics Ireland Ltd and Medlab Pathology Ltd - have appealed the July 2019 judgment by the High Court&rsquo;s Mr Justice Kevin Cross awarding €2.1m to Ms Morrissey and her husband Paul over misreading of Ms Morrissey&rsquo;s cervical smear slides.</p>
<p>The Government has guaranteed the award of damages irrespective of the outcome of the appeal.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the HSE and two laboratories say the High Court judgment had far reaching consequences for cancer screening services and medical diagnosis generally as well as for the CervicalCheck tribunal and other litigation relating to cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Ms Morrissey and her husband - who were awarded the €2.1 million in damages by the High Court - said the High Court judgment does not have the consequences argued by the labs and the HSE, and was widely misunderstood. They said no new legal test was laid down by the judgement.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2014 and her case concerned smears taken under the CervicalCheck screening programme in 2009 and 2012.</p>
<p>She was not told until May 2018 that a 2014 review showed two smears were reported incorrectly.</p>
<p>Her lawyers told the court today that this case was a &ldquo;human tragedy&rdquo; which arose entirely out of the fault of all three defendants.</p>
<p>Senior Counsel Jeremy Maher sad an &ldquo;abundance of evidence&rdquo; entitled the High Court to conclude Ms Morrissey&rsquo;s cancer was caused by negligence of the laboratory defendants, he said.</p>
<p>A pre-cancer specialist gave &ldquo;clear evidence&rdquo; that pre-cancer was present in 2009 and 2012 and was allowed, through the fault of the laboratories, to develop undetected, he said.</p>
<p>Were it not for that negligence, Ms Morrissey would not be facing death in early 2020 or possibly 2021, he said. She had suffered a recurrence of cancer, surgery is not now possible and her treatment is now &ldquo;effectively palliative&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Patrick Treacy SC who also represents the Morrisseys urged the court to find that a cytoscreener&rsquo;s practical duty is to have &ldquo;absolute confidence&rdquo; that a slide is normal before reporting it as negative.</p>
<p>Absolute confidence is &ldquo;absolutely essential&rdquo; in this &ldquo;fundamental issue of women&rsquo;s health&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;We are dealing with people&rsquo;s lives here, there is no room for mediocrity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Cush SC, replying for Quest, said the law cannot use words which suggest &ldquo;absolute confidence&rdquo; and any such legal requirement, particularly for screeners, is &ldquo;contrary to logic and common sense&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Because a competent screener will know that some women who go on to develop cancer could have been screened as negative, how could any screener say they have &ldquo;absolutely confidence&rdquo; in their screening result, he asked.</p>
<p>Patrick Hanratty SC, for the HSE, said the incidence of cervical cancer was increasing here before the Cervical Check programme but has fallen by 7% year on year since.</p>
<p>The High Court judgment can be interpreted as setting a new absolute confidence test concerning cytology screening and other areas of medicine, he said. An absolute confidence test was &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;capable of causing confusion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Conor Halpin SC, in reply for Medlab, said it is an Irish company incorporated here and employing screeners who got their qualifications here and it &ldquo;does not matter that it is part of a US multinational&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Evidence that there were 35,000 cells on the 2012 slide tested by Medlab had not been challenged and the High Court erred in saying Medlab should have found that slide was inadequate for screening, he argued.</p>
<p>Vicky Phelan was among a number of CervicalCheck campaigners who attended the final day of the appeal.
