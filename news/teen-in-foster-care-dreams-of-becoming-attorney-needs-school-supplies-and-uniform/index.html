<h3 id="the-thr-100-hollywood-reporters-most-powerful-people-in-entertainment">&ldquo;The THR 100: Hollywood Reporter&rsquo;s Most Powerful People in Entertainment&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/06/_iger_bonnie_hammer_and_kevin_hart_split.jpg" alt="img">
With her rise in the coming months to chairman and CEO (as Gianopulos, 64, moves into an undefined &ldquo;strategic role&rdquo;), Snider, 55, will preside over the second-hottest studio at the 2016 box office (after Disney). Watts, 46, has become the envy of many of her counterparts at rival studios thanks to hits like The Martian ($630 million).</p>
<p>BIG WIN Deadpool ($778 million), another Watts film, is the top-grossing R-rated title ever.</p>
<p>BIG BET Will the executive shakeup work out? Fox&rsquo;s future is all about the next Avatar films — and filmmaker James Cameron&rsquo;s strongest relationship at the studio is with Gianopulos.</p>
<hr>
<p>What&rsquo;s the least powerful thing about your life?</p>
<p>SNIDER I don’t think about my life in terms of power. I think about my life in terms of meaning.</p>
<p>WATTS The list expands daily.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS Managing my really smart and independent daughters.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get through a day without …</p>
<p>SNIDER Quiet time to think (and tea!).</p>
<p>WATTS Many espressos.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS Sugar-free Red Bull. (I know, don&rsquo;t tell me.)</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s your most important adviser?</p>
<p>SNIDER My husband, Gary Jones.</p>
<p>WATTS Jonathan Krauss.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS My wife, Ann, who is amazing, beloved by all (and certainly by me) and always tells me the truth while making it easier to accept.</p>
<p>In high school, I was …</p>
<p>SNIDER A lot like I am today.</p>
<p>WATTS Younger.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS In a Rolling Stones cover band (and unsuccessfully pretending to be Keith Richards).</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s your hidden talent?</p>
<p>SNIDER I can change from work clothes to sweats in record time.</p>
<p>WATTS A really loud two-fingered whistle.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS I can discern meaning in half-a-dozen languages I don&rsquo;t speak.</p>
<p>If I could have lunch with anyone, living or dead, I&rsquo;d choose …</p>
<p>SNIDER Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>WATTS Vanessa Nadal and Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS Ernest Hemingway, and he could pick the place.</p>
<p>The first powerful person I ever met was …</p>
<p>SNIDER My teachers at Friends&rsquo; Central School had the greatest influence on my life (after my parents). But, given their Quaker affiliation, they would not have considered themselves powerful.</p>
<p>WATTS Diane Von Furstenberg.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS My father, who overcame odds that still humble anything I&rsquo;ve done. And also, the Queen of England (but not at the same time).</p>
<p>Have you seen Hamilton and how many times?</p>
<p>SNIDER Yes, off-Broadway and then on Broadway.</p>
<p>WATTS Yes, I love it! I&rsquo;ve been twice.</p>
<p>GIANOPULOS Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen Hamilton, and even managed to close my dropped jaw long enough to think of something to say to Lin-Manuel Miranda. I told him I had never experienced anything so exalted that so surpassed its expectation.
