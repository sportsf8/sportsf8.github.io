PARIS — Manu Dibango, who fused African rhythms with funk to become one of the most influential musicians in world dance music, died Tuesday with the coronavirus, according to his music publisher. He was 86.</p>
<p>The Cameroon-born saxophonist, who gained international fame with his 1972 song “Soul Makossa,” died in a hospital in the Paris region, Thierry Durepaire said.</p>
<p>Dibango was hospitalized with an illness “linked to COVID-19,” his official Facebook page said last week.</p>
<p>“Soul Makossa” was one of the earliest hits in the nascent world music scene, including a catchy hook copied by some of the world’s biggest pop stars.</p>
<p>In 2009, Dibango filed a lawsuit against Michael Jackson and Rihanna, claiming they had stolen his music in “Wanna Be Startin’ Something” and “Don’t Stop the Music,” respectively. Jackson settled out of court.</p>
<p>Funeral services were to be “held in strict privacy” followed by a tribute “when possible,” Tuesday’s announcement said. Funerals in France have been limited to 20 people n the closest circle of the deceased because of a lockdown to try to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Dibango is survived by four children.</p>

<p>Tributes have been flowing, especially on the social media, following the death in France of Cameroonian Afro-jazz icon Manu Dibango, whose family said he succumbed to the novel coronavirus (Covid-19).</p>
<p>Dibango died on March 24, 2020 aged 86.</p>
<p>AU Commission Chief Moussa Faki Mahamat said the continent is united in grief.</p>
<p>UNITED IN GRIEF</p>
<p>“Africa united in grief as we learned of the passing on of jazz icon Manu Dibango after complications from Covid-19. May his gentle soul rest in eternal peace,” he tweeted.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The United Nations office in Cameroon said it is celebrating the life and legacy of one of country’s finest artistes.</p>
<p>“He was a great idol and his legacy lives on through the beautiful music he made,” the UN said in a tweet.</p>
<p>OLYMPICS AMBASSADOR</p>
<p>In 2015, Michaëlle Jean, then Secretary-General of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie, appointed Dibango as the ambassador to the Rio Olympics and Paralympic Games of 2016.</p>
<p>Louise Mushikiwabo, the current secretary-general of the organisation, said the Covid-19 pandemic has stolen “a very valuable man” from La Francophonie, the world, the world of music and Africa.</p>
<p>“Dear Manu, we keep your music, your laughter, and all the happiness that you have given us,” she tweeted.</p>
<p>INSPIRED ARTISTES</p>
<p>The acclaimed saxophonist, songwriter and singer, who lived in Paris but regularly visited his native Cameroon, inspired many other artistes and influenced folkloric music lovers to like jazz.</p>
<p>Renowned Benin singer Angélique Kidjo said Dibango has always been there for her, from her beginnings in Paris to a rehearsal just two months ago.</p>
<p>“You (Manu Dibango) are the original giant of African music and a beautiful human being,” she tweeted.</p>
<p>MUSICAL GENIUS</p>
<p>Kenya’s Director of the Permanent Presidential Music Commission Donald Otoyo said Africa and the whole world has lost an icon and a legend, “a musical genius who hugely influenced my love for Afro-jazz and the saxophone.”</p>
<p>“His music shall forever remain in our hearts,” Dr Otoyo said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Christophe Guilhou, the French Ambassador to Cameroon, said Dibango’s death is a huge loss for all.</p>
<p>“A brilliant Cameroonian musician, he has been able to create bridges between the cultures of Africa and the world,” the ambassador tweeted.</p>
<p>Manu Dibango’s family said “his funeral service will be held in strict privacy, and a tribute to his memory will be organised when possible.”

<h3 id="manu-dibango-and-aurlus-mabele-two-west-african-musical-giants-die-of-covid-19">Manu Dibango And Aurlus Mabele, Two West African Musical Giants, Die Of COVID-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400" alt="img">
Manu Dibango And Aurlus Mabele, Two West African Musical Giants, Die Of COVID-19</p>
<p>The coronavirus has taken the lives of two elderly musicians in Paris: Manu Dibango, a Cameroonian saxophone and vibraphone superstar, and Aurlus Mabele, the king of Congolese soukous music.</p>
<p>AILSA CHANG, HOST:</p>
<p>While Africa has had relatively few deaths from the coronavirus, the continent has lost two legendary musicians to the disease. Both of them defined their genres, and both died of COVID-19 in Paris. NPR&rsquo;s Eyder Peralta has this remembrance.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, &ldquo;LISTE ROUGE&rdquo;)</p>
<p>AURLUS MABELE: (Singing in non-English language).</p>
<p>EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Aurlus Mabele&rsquo;s music was defined by that fast beat and those arpeggio guitar licks that are full of urgency. Almost all his songs had long instrumentals. They let him dance, and Mabele let loose. Mabele defined the Congolese soukous. The name is inspired by the French word for shake, so Mabele shook, sensually sometimes, carelessly others.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, &ldquo;LISTE ROUGE&rdquo;)</p>
<p>MABELE: (Singing in non-English language).</p>
<p>PERALTA: Mabele liberated rumba. He packed New York City clubs in the &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>The other great that Africa lost today was the Cameroonian Manu Dibango. His influence came much earlier in the &rsquo;70s. George Collinet hosts the radio show &ldquo;Afropop&rdquo; on PRX.</p>
<p>GEORGE COLLINET: He revered black musicians, American musician particularly.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Dibango&rsquo;s early work was influenced by American jazz greats like Louis Armstrong.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF MANU DIBANGO SONG, &ldquo;SOUL MAKOSSA&rdquo;)</p>
<p>PERALTA: But the saxophonist came to have a profound influence on American dance music. Collinet was in a studio in Paris when Dibango recorded the phrase that changed everything.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, &ldquo;SOUL MAKOSSA&rdquo;)</p>
<p>MANU DIBANGO: (Playing saxophone). (Singing) Hey, soul makossa.</p>
<p>PERALTA: That song was played everywhere. People danced it on &ldquo;Soul Train,&rdquo; and Michael Jackson stole it on &ldquo;Wanna Be Startin&rsquo; Somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>COLLINET: Everybody was copying that mamago mamasa mama makossa (ph). He was suing everybody right and left (laughter).</p>
<p>PERALTA: Over the course of his career, Dibango put out dozens of records. He was genre agnostic - played reggae and New Orleans jazz. He played with anyone who would play with him. But his roots were always in Africa - in those beats, in those grooves.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF MANU DIBANGO&rsquo;S &ldquo;WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD&rdquo;)</p>
<p>COLLINET: The thing, is in, Africa music is dance, no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>PERALTA: In the end, these two West African musicians not only helped define genres but, more importantly, they transcended borders and languages to make people dance.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF MANU DIBANGO&rsquo;S &ldquo;WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD&rdquo;)</p>
<p>PERALTA: Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Nairobi.</p>
