<p>PLENTY of beef breeders say working cattle is the best job in the world but in Trish Worth&rsquo;s case, she has a fair bit of career experience to back that up.</p>
<p>A nurse by trade, she went into midwifery, pathology, management in health administration and then she entered politics.</p>
<p>The Federal Member for Adelaide for 11 years, she was parliamentary secretary for three ministers.</p>
<p>At 16, after growing up on a Hereford operation at Riverton, north of Adelaide in South Australia, where she was referred to as her father&rsquo;s &lsquo;right hand man&rsquo;, her plan was to run her own poll Hereford stud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was quite a long journey but I&rsquo;m there now,&rdquo; she laughs.</p>
<p>Ms Worth, who operates Kilkerrin Poll Herefords at Mount Compass in SA with her husband Michael Cobb, has just been elected the new chairman of Herefords Australia. Marc Greening, Injemira Beef Genetics, at Book Book in NSW, is her deputy.</p>
<p>Ms Worth has great optimism for the future of both the beef industry and the Hereford breed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pandemic has shown us just how much Australians consider beef to be a staple part of their diet - there was evidence that one of the top searches on google during the lockdown was how to cook a good steak,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the industry has shown just how resilient it is. Some of our Hereford breeders have come through drought and fires but are rebuilding strongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future is bright for the breed. Herefords fit so well into Australia. They&rsquo;re so versatile and are run on the biggest stations through to small operations and from Queensland to the snow country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collectively, we have an abundance of wisdom and experience in breeding top quality Herefords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Worth developed her love and admiration for Herefords as the oldest child in a farming family where everyone was expected to chip in.</p>
<p>While she always had ambitions to be a beef producer, in the tradition of the time her brother inherited the farm and is still working it today with his family.</p>
<p>However, Ms Worth says today she still operates by the philosophies she learned as a youngster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father would say when we were breaking in bulls that you should always be nice to cattle, they&rsquo;re bigger than you, and I&rsquo;ve found that works best,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never any shouting at cattle at our place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is the first woman to lead the Hereford society and says women all over Australia are heavily involved in the beef industry and the career opportunities the industry affords are many and varied.</p>
<p>Ms Worth, along with Tony Hegarty, Bill Kee and Geoff Birchnell, was elected to the Board in 2017 and has recently been joined by Sam Becker, Ian Durkin, Mark Duthie and Mr Greening.</p>
<p>The story Beef has plenty to crow about, says new Herefords chair first appeared on Farm Online.

Ostali u dobrim odnosima.</p>
<p>Boris Beker, bivši trener Novaka Đokovića, govorio je o svom nekadašnjem pulenu. Legendarni Nemac i najbolji srpski sportista su sarađivali u periodu od 2014. do 2017. godine, kada je Novak odlučio da napravi pauzu zbog problema sa laktom.</p>
<p>Beker je u jednom podkastu ispričao šta je rekao trenutno prvom igraču na ATP listi, godinu dana pre ozvaničenja saradnje.</p>

<ul>
<li>Razlog zašto više nisi tako dobar je taj što si se previše dobro osećao kao broj jedan, nisi napredovao. Ostali igrači poput Nadala i Federera su prilagodili svoju igru. Rekao sam mu: ‘Ne sviđa mi se tvoje pozicioniranje na terenu, ne sviđa mi se tvoj servis&rsquo; -rekao je Beker.</li>

<p>I nakon rastanka, Beker i Đoković su ostali u dobrim odnosima.</p>
<p>“Na narednim Grend slemovima smo se sretali kad god je imao pitanje o nekom igraču. Moja vrata su uvek bila otvorena. Takvo partnerstvo trenera i igrača karakteriše poverenje. Mogu da pomognem igraču samo ako on želi da se pozabavi svojim brigama i strahovima. On mora biti potpuno iskren, a ja stvarno cenim to poverenje - istakao je čuveni Nemac.</p>
<p>Beker je na kraju rekao da nije isključio mogućnost povratka tenisu, “njegovoj velikoj ljubavi”.</p>

<h3 id="hear-dion-and-paul-simons-song-for-sam-cooke-here-in-america">&ldquo;Hear Dion and Paul Simon’s ‘Song for Sam Cooke (Here in America)’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2020/05/Dion-Paul-Simon.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
Dion has unveiled his new collaboration with Paul Simon, “Song for Sam Cooke (Here in America).”</p>
<p>“At first, I just had the melody and the refrain ‘Here in America,’” Dion explained in a conversation with American Songwriter. “A friend suggested I use an episode from my memoir about walking southern streets with Sam Cooke in 1962. It’s a good story, a true story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dion’s lyrics tell of his experience with Cooke during a visit to the South. “Sam and I went to see James Brown in 1962,” the singer explained. “People were getting on my case. Sam brought me to some soul dive, a nightclub in the hood. And he told people, `Dion’s with me. Cool out.’&rdquo;</p>
<p>The experience stuck with Dion for decades. “He stood up for me. He was a good guy. I miss him,” the singer recalled of Cooke, who was shot and killed in 1964.</p>
<p>After initially finishing the song many years ago, Dion put it on the shelf, deeming the subject too personal for public release. The singer revisited the track in 2019 after being inspired by an Academy Award winning film.</p>
<p>“I saw the movie Green Book and after that, I couldn’t shake the song. I thought, `Hey, they almost wrote a movie about my song.’ I loved the movie so much that I thought I’d better take that song out to see it if works. And it did. It actually did.”</p>
<p>Dion then sought the input of his friend and regular collaborator, Simon.</p>
<p>“When I first played it for Paul, he saw it like I saw it,” Dion noted. “He didn’t see it as a song which is purely about racism in America. He saw it as a song of brotherhood and understanding. Because I was telling him that Sam Cooke took care of me in the South. Paul said he wanted to record what he was hearing on the tune.”</p>
<p>The result is an earnest song about race relations and personal strength. “I think Paul really helped it,” Dion confessed. “He embellished it beautifully. He elevated it and made it something sublime.”</p>
<p>Listen to “Song for Sam Cooke (Here in America)” below.</p>
<p>Dion’s new album, Blues with Friends, will be released June 5. In addition to his collaboration with Simon, the LP features Dion joining forces with such vaunted artists as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Gibbons, Van Morrison and Jeff Beck.

<p>SANDPOINT — The Sandpoint wrestling team has announced its end of the season awards.</p>
<p>Typically, the awards for the Bulldogs are given out during a banquet following the season. But the team wasn’t able to hold their banquet prior to the coronavirus pandemic shutting down school and public gatherings so head coach Jake Stark has released the awards to the Bee.</p>
<p>Senior Brady Nelsen earned the team’s MVP Award. Nelsen finished this season with a 36-20 record, 17 pins and 58 takedowns. Nelsen made it to state for the third straight year in 2020 and has been a key piece to the Bulldogs program throughout his high school career.</p>
<p>“You could always count on Brady whether it was at practice, showing up for a dual or just being accountable in general,” Stark said. “He’s been our rock.”</p>
<p>Nelsen only missed two practices during his four years with the team. Stark said Nelsen showed up even when he was “sicker than a dog.”</p>
<p>Nelsen’s dedication and work ethic were unmatched, Stark said, and he had a demeanor that helped him intimidate his opponents.</p>
<p>“When he gets on the mat he knows how to flip that switch and get it done,” Stark said.</p>
<p>Nelsen also won the Kluver Award, which is given to the most inspirational wrestler and is voted on by the team, and the Captain Award. Fellow senior Isaiah Caralis earned a Captain Award as well.</p>
<p>Caralis and Nelsen were the heart of the Bulldogs this season. The duo tied for the most pins on the team. Stark said they ran the show and took the younger wrestlers under their wings and showed them what it takes to be on the Sandpoint wrestling team.</p>
<p>Often when kids on the team came to Stark with a question, he directed them to Nelsen and Caralis because they typically know the answer, he said.</p>
<p>“It gives them some responsibility to take ownership of their team &hellip; because when it comes down to it, it’s their team,” Stark said.</p>
<p>Junior Trevan Adam grabbed the Grinder Award. Adam really stepped it up down the stretch of the season to earn a chance to wrestle at districts and notch an at-large bid to state at 138 pounds. Adam had the most takedowns on the team with 67.</p>
<p>Stark said Adam got after it every practice and stuck with the team through thick and thin. Adam was a positive influence on his teammates and embodied what the award is all about. “I couldn’t be more proud,” Stark said. “He earned it.”</p>
<p>The Newcomer Award was given to Wyatt Marker. The sophomore showed up to the team this season with no prior wrestling experience but quickly made an impact.</p>
<p>Stark said Marker is a natural athlete and he believes Marker has a chance to place at state as a senior if he continues to progress like he did in just a few months.</p>
<p>“He’s a very fast learner,” Stark said. “Usually, I can show him one thing and he can pick it up. I showed him the cradle one time and he went out and did it in a match like that week.”</p>
<p>Junior Tag Benefield earned the Coaches Award. Benefield had a remarkable season, but he didn’t step on the mat for the Bulldogs until their final regular season tournament due to a knee injury.</p>
<p>Benefield took full advantage of his three weeks on the mat and as a No. 8 seed at state battled his way to a third place finish at 220 pounds. And he wasn’t even at full strength.</p>
<p>“He did something that you rarely ever see,” Stark said about Benefield. “I think being out kind of just showed him, ‘man I really want to be out there,’ and when he got out there and got his opportunity, he stepped it up.”</p>
<p>Freshman Jacob Albany was also voted Most Improved by his teammates.</p>
<p>Here are the 23 wrestlers that earned a varsity letter for their efforts this season: Trevan Adam, Tag Benefield, Jordan Birkhimer, Jake Ryan, Blake Sherrill, Jake Suhr, Matt Thurlow, Heather Wallace, Jacob Albany, Forest Ambridge, Sam Becker, Raphael Eldridge, Calvin Hinds, Carson Laybourne, Carson Mavity, KJ Johansen, Darrian Resso, Christian Troumbley-Karkoski, Evan Twineham, Owen Wimmer, Isaiah Caralis and Brady Nelsen.
