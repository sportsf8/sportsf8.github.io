<p>On the eve of the Rio Olympics four years ago Jason Kenny made a few headlines - something of a rarity where Kenny is concerned - when he revealed that despite his stunning Olympic success stretching back over eight years he had no personal sponsors whatsoever.</p>
<p>Kenny, who had three Olympic gold medals to his name at the time, was not overly upset about the situation. He admitted he would “like to be paid more” but said he had learned to accept his lot in life. “We’re in competition with all the pretty athletes, your Tom Daleys and people like that,” he told the BBC. “People I would never be able to compete with when it comes to, like, a marketing point of view&hellip;” Harsh, but given he was, by his own admission, a quiet lad from Bolton who actively shunned the limelight, probably not entirely unfair.</p>
<p>At some point, though, your achievements surely get too big to be ignored, however cool you are with your lot. After Kenny’s exploits in Rio where he defended his individual and team sprint titles, added the Olympic keirin crown for good measure, and became the joint most successful British Olympian of all time in terms of gold medals won, the 31 year-old must fall into that bracket.</p>
<p>There is a decent argument to be made that Kenny, who will be competing in the team sprint, the individual sprint and the keirin at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Berlin this coming week, is the most underrated sportsman in Britain right now. His total of six Olympic golds places him alongside Sir Chris Hoy at the top of the British pile. And if that wasn’t ‘marketable’ enough, he also married Laura Trott, Britain’s golden girl and most successful female Olympian of all time, following the last Games. Together they have settled down in Cheshire with their two dogs and had a baby.</p>
<p>So, has the landscape changed? Are sponsors queuing round the block to back him now as he prepares now for Tokyo? “Umm a little bit,” he says, smiling. “It’s up and down. But I’ve learnt to roll with it now.”</p>
<p>The truth is, Kenny would not have it any other way. He does actually have a few personal sponsors at the moment, including HSBC and Dreams, while he and Laura are due to announce an “exciting” new sponsor soon. But he wouldn’t want many more. Laura attracts more than enough sponsors for the both of them (“Oh yeah, way more. Laura has always done really well. She is obviously really appealing to that kind of market.”) and he prefers to fly under the radar most of the time. The quiet life suits him.</p>
<p>Kenny is happy to focus on his training, his motorbike and his son Albie, now two and a half, who will be joining his parents in Berlin this week.</p>
<p>Kenny says he does not know what to expect from this year’s worlds but, as ever, cautioned not to expect too much. The man accused by vanquished sprint rival Gregory Baugé at London 2012 of being “a sheep” between Games only to become “a Tiger” when it got down to business, hinted the same thing could happen this year.</p>
<p>“All right I think, we will see,” Kenny replied when asked how he, Ryan Owens and Jack Carlin were going in training. “We had a hit-out last Wednesday and it went OK. For us now, the challenge is, we just want to make sure we nail it technically in the team sprint.</p>
<p>“The Dutch have set a really high benchmark at the minute. It will be interesting to see what they can do. They are not going to be standing still. But we are going OK. Jack is going well at man two, which is important. The guy in the middle is important to string the team together. We have had a few decent signs but it is just making sure we put our ride down on the day.”</p>
<p>“[But] we try to hold back to the Games as best we can. That is the philosophy. Everything we are doing now is to put ourselves in the best position possible for the world champs. But as a team, it all comes together, hopefully, in five or six months’ time when it really matters.”

<p>Hoy was already a double world champion in the one kilometre time trial before his first Olympic gold medal in Greece. Arnaud Tournant had set the fastest ever sea-level kilo before Hoy set a new world and Olympic record of one minute 00.711 seconds to add to the Olympic silver in the team sprint he won four years earlier.</p>
<p>Beijing 2008</p>

<p>Hoy became the first British Olympian for 100 years to claim three golds at one Games at the Beijing Olympics. He won the keirin, the team sprint and also the individual sprint after the kilo was removed as an Olympic discipline and was knighted in the New Year honours list.</p>

<p>A home Games gave Hoy – who carried the flag for Team GB at the opening ceremony – the perfect platform in the velodrome which is now named after him in Stratford. He won the team sprint with Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes, setting a new world record, and won the keirin to overtake Sir Steve Redgrave and become the most decorated British Olympian ever.</p>

<p>Hoy retired on April 18, 2013 saying: “It is a hard time – it is one moment at the end of your career when you say ‘enough is enough&rsquo;”. He explored his interest in motorsport and competed in the 2016 Le Mans 24 Hours race, sharing a Ligier JS P2-Nissan with Andrea Pizzitola and Michael Munemann and came 17th overall.

SIR Bradley Wiggins launched a foul-mouthed tirade in Disneyland Paris, shouting “Mickey Mouse is a c***”.</p>
<p>The Olympic cycling legend, 39, was filmed ranting in the main street as he walked past families with children.</p>

<p>In the 14-second clip he shouts: “F<strong>k off. F</strong>k off Disneyland.”</p>
<p>“Mickey Mouse is a c***. You can f**k off.” He adds: “Paedophile. Paedophile.”</p>
<p>It is believed the dad-of-three was enjoying a break at the park between Christmas and New Year.</p>
<p>Despite his Mickey comment, he posed for a selfie with the cartoon star and posted the pic on Instagram on December 28. He wrote: “We just dem old schools geezers!!”</p>
<p>FALL FROM GRACE</p>
<p>Next day he posted two photos including a picture wearing a Monsters Inc hat.</p>
<p>A source said of the video: “Brad has a mad sense of humour and was messing around with a friend. He didn’t mean to cause offence.”</p>
<p>The cycling ace won eight Olympic medals including five gold, and in 2012 he became the first Brit to win the Tour de France.</p>
<p>He was knighted in 2013 Queen’s Honours List and voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2012. He retired from cycling four years ago and last year revealed he was planning to take a degree in social work to help with vulnerable children.</p>

<p>Last September he spoke about his bad behaviour saying: “Post 2012, I had a few hissy fits, throwing my bike on the floor, things like that, and they are all now on YouTube.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for the star said: “Bradley is disappointed that the video was leaked by someone he thought was a friend.”</p>

<h3 id="steven-de-jongh-i-dont-look-back-at-that-team-sky-period-with-joy">&ldquo;Steven De Jongh: ‘I don’t look back at that Team Sky period with joy’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/12/DE-JONGH-Steven001p.jpg" alt="img">
Team Sky never even stopped to enjoy its victories such as those in the Tour de France, says former sports director Steven De Jongh.</p>
<p>De Jongh now works with Trek-Segafredo with Bauke Mollema, Richie Porte and starting in 2020, Vincenzo Nibali. He spent two years, 2011 and 2012 with Team Sky.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Struggling to get to the shops try 6 issues of Cycling Weekly magazine for just £6 delivered to your door &laquo;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>“I don’t look back on the period that I worked there with much joy,” the Dutchman told Wielerflits. “Sir David Brailsford was not the most pleasant person to work with, to put it simply.</p>
<p>“I missed the cycling experience. If there was a win, it was normal. The moment was never enjoyed. With Brailsford, I had the idea that he did it more for his own ego than for cycling.”</p>
<p>The team since changing sponsor this May 1, races as Team Ineos. Team principal David Brailsford led the team since their beginning in 2010 and has overseen seven Tour de France titles with Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and this summer, 22-year-old Colombian Egan Bernal.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tom Dumoulin back in competition at mountain bike beach race</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2013, Brailsford was knighted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace after a successful 2012 season with Wiggins winning the Tour de France and Great Britain taking gold medals in the London Olympics. For many years, he was also the performance director of British Cycling.</p>
<p>The end of 2012 also saw Team Sky re-confirm their zero-tolerance stance and part ways with many staff members including Bobby Julich, Sean Yates and Steven De Jongh. De Jongh admitted at the time that he used blood booster EPO in his career as a professional cyclist.</p>
<p>De Jongh went to the Tinkoff-Saxo Bank team with Yates and helped Alberto Contador win the 2014 Vuelta a España and the 2015 Giro d’Italia. Since 2017, he is working with American team Trek-Segafredo.</p>
<p>In the same interview, he revealed that the team also tried to sign Tom Dumoulin, winner of the 2017 Giro d’Italia and second in both the 2018 Giro d’Italia and Tour de France. Dumoulin, who fell out with Sunweb, is switching to Jumbo-Visma for 2020.</p>
<p>“At Team Sunweb they have so many rules and protocols,” De Jongh told Wielerflits. “Tom had outgrown that. For champions like him you have to make exceptions.</p>
<p>“His name was also mentioned with us, because he really wanted to leave. He was dead and unhappy. If you both feel that you are on a dead end, you have to look for a solution.”</p>
<p>Dumoulin returned to racing for the first time since June. He took part in a mountain bike race on Sunday.

<h3 id="sir-bradley-wiggins-admits-he-wont-push-his-very-talented-son-14-into-a-brutal-cycling-career">&ldquo;Sir Bradley Wiggins admits he won&rsquo;t push his &lsquo;very talented&rsquo; son, 14, into a &lsquo;brutal&rsquo; cycling career&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/11/19651554-0-image-a-160_1570962043776.jpg" alt="img">
Sir Bradley Wiggins has revealed he won&rsquo;t be pushing his &lsquo;very talented&rsquo; son into becoming a professional cyclist - claiming that doing so to bask in the reflected glory would be &lsquo;cruel&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 2012 Tour de France winner, born in Kilburn, north London, said he doesn&rsquo;t get involved in 14-year-old Ben&rsquo;s training.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley, 39, whose own father was a cycling champion, revealed that the teenager recently came within half a second of winning the North West Youth and Junior Tour in August - but he&rsquo;d told him he didn&rsquo;t care if he finished &lsquo;first or last&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking on the last night of his national roadshow in London, he explained: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to push him into that now so I can stand there in 10 years&rsquo; time when he wins Olympic gold and the reflected glory - &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my son.&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t do that, it&rsquo;s cruel,&rsquo; adding that someone else coaches him.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins has revealed he won&rsquo;t be pushing his &lsquo;very talented&rsquo; son into becoming a professional cyclist - claiming that doing so to bask in the reflected glory would be &lsquo;cruel&rsquo;</p>
<p>The ex-champion, pictured with son Ben, revealed that the teenager recently came within half a second of winning the North West Youth and Junior Tour in August - but he&rsquo;d told him he didn&rsquo;t care if he finished &lsquo;first or last&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the Sunday Times Home, the proud father said Ben is &lsquo;mad for cycling&rsquo; and is &lsquo;getting good results&rsquo;, while his daughter Bella, 12, is &lsquo;talented and could be very good if she wanted to be&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s hard growing up with a famous father,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want them to be judged or feel they have to do what I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the roadshow, Sir Bradley admitted his years racing on the road with Team Sky were &lsquo;the most unhappy&rsquo; of his career.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was no enjoyment. It was a brutal elite sport,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the Sunday Times Home , the proud father said Ben is &lsquo;mad for cycling&rsquo; and is &lsquo;getting good results&rsquo;. Pictured with his son at the end of the 120km and last stage of the 2012 Tour de France</p>
<p>In August it was reported the sportsman is taking a degree in social work as he looks to redefine himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t give a s*** about my cycling career now,&rsquo; he told The Big Issue magazine. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just detached from it, I don&rsquo;t want to live off the back of it.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley was the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2012, with his Tour success helping transform the popularity of cycling and his pose on a throne in front of Hampton Court Palace after his Olympic gold becoming one of the defining images of the London Games - as were his late-night celebrations.</p>
<p>Having moved to Manchester in 1999 to be nearer the city&rsquo;s velodrome, he and wife Cath now live in a 1970s barn conversion in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty - the Trough of Bowland, north of Preston.</p>
<p>The champion, pictured competing in the Madison Chase during during day six of the Six Day London Cycling Event at the Velodrome in 2016, admitted to keeping his Olympic medals &lsquo;in a Co-op bag in the drawer&rsquo; and his jerseys in boxes for the kids</p>

<p>Sir Bradley told how the couple enjoy watching First Dates and no longer throw wild parties as he doesn&rsquo;t like people in his house and now treasures his &lsquo;personal space&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In the interview with Sunday Times Home, he also admitted to keeping his Olympic medals &lsquo;in a Co-op bag in the drawer&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All my jerseys are in boxes for the kids when they get older,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;If they don&rsquo;t want them, they can chuck them in a skip.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sir Bradley, who briefly attempted to become an elite rower after his cycling career ended, has now found success as a pundit for Eurosport, and during this year&rsquo;s Tour he drew rave reviews for his commentary when riding on a motorbike, laughing and joking with riders in the peloton.

<h3 id="taking-us-all-on-the-ride-of-his-life-sir-bradley-wiggins-talks-ahead-of-birmingham-show">&ldquo;Taking us all on the ride of his life: Sir Bradley Wiggins talks ahead of Birmingham show&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.shropshirestar.com/resizer/y0cOo65kRmMOh9Erzqj4WTs2nAI=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-shropshirestar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HPAL6QXURBEGZLGLC3CUNMFPVE.jpg" alt="img">
The five-time Olympic gold medal winner was in his element across the channel, describing it as an outstanding highlight of his experience in the sport.</p>
<p>However, as he concedes, he doesn’t miss the intensity of preparing for one of the world’s most celebrated yet grueling spectacles.</p>
<p>So this time around felt poignant for the champion cyclist, witnessing his former teammate Geraint Thomas narrowly miss out on gaining what would have been a second victory in the stellar French race.</p>
<p>“Covering the tour made me realise just how much I love it – when you are competing there’s a lot of emotion taken up with it all in dealing with the event to cross the line. It’s actually hard to get excited at the end of a race, so going back to it without all the pressure and watching it as a fan was great,” says the record-breaking athlete.</p>
<p>After seven years from his own career-defining victory in France, he says it was encouraging to gain such a warm reception from crowds.</p>
<p>Despite this, he adds his commentating stint this summer couldn’t possibly tempt him out of retirement and prompt him to don his racing kit once again.</p>
<p>“Going back to the tour and seeing some of those climbs brought back memories of just how hard it is. While people can make it look easy, it really isn’t, especially when you see guys getting taken out of the peloton, and some of crashes you witness. It can be brutal.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins</p>

<p>“But it was a brilliant event and doing those interviews was something special. Cycling is all that I have ever known, right back to my school days when I was focusing on riding rather than all the lessons,” admits the man who stands as the UK’s most decorated Olympic athlete.</p>
<p>He says that at 36 (he is now 39), it was not a difficult decision three years ago to walk away from the sport at a high point, enabling him to fully focus on the challenges of raising a young family with his wife at their home in Lancashire.</p>
<p>While the celebrity status following his unprecedented back-to-back victory at the Tour de France and London Olympics in 2012 may not have sat entirely comfortably with him, the wider effect of ‘Wiggo’s win’ was clearly tangible. It saw cycling in the UK enjoy a significant resurgence that is showing no sign of subsiding.</p>
<p>The achievement led to his knighthood in 2013, which he built upon further at the Rio Olympics with a final gold as part of the winning British team pursuit squad.</p>

<p>Wiggins is focusing on a number of projects including sports broadcasting and setting forth on his nationwide Bradley Wiggins: An Evening With tour which began last night in Lincoln.</p>
<p>He’ll be reflecting on his lengthy career, and discussing some of his own heroes who feature in his latest book, Icons, who have proved an inspiration along the way.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins</p>
<p>As he explains, another key area that is now close to his heart is that of supporting the next generation of potential stars within his sport.</p>
<p>“Cycling is a great and necessary force in my life, and something I’ve been institutionalised in as well as being passionate about. If there’s a legacy from what I have done it’s with helping young people develop an interest in cycling and getting out there on bikes.</p>
<p>“For many kids there’s a lot that keeps them indoors on their iPads, so one of the great things about cycling is that it’s something you can do as a family and get outdoors – you can’t go out and play rugby as a family,” says the former Olympian, who has worked on a developing series of bikes for children. These days, he enjoys riding near his home in the Preston area.</p>
<p>As for his own formative experiences, he acknowledges a challenging upbringing meant his was far from a case of being an overnight success.</p>
<p>He was born in Ghent, Belgium, but his mother soon moved them to London after Bradley’s father, who was also a cyclist, parted from the family and had no involvement with his son’s upbringing.</p>
<p>“In a weird way, my father is still my hero. I’ve kept two of his riding jerseys, though I detested the man, as he left us when I was just a baby. But my mum still glorified him, so if it hadn’t been for her, then I wouldn’t have had my career.”</p>
<p>As a twelve year-old he took up cycling on the same south London circuit his dad had once ridden, setting him on a long path to an eventual sporting career.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins</p>
<p>However, as he recounts, kids from Kilburn were not expected to achieve any great mark in society. So taking an active interest in cycling was far from a recipe for fitting in within a tough neighbourhood.</p>
<p>He concedes he even resorted to wearing tracksuits over his riding gear for fear of homophobic abuse that might be dished out for his clothing.</p>
<p>“I was asked by a teacher when I was 12 what I wanted to do with my life and I said I wanted to wear a winner’s jersey at the Tour de France, and she just laughed at me,” he adds with regret at the seeming lack of early support.</p>
<p>As he explains, even after winning a bronze medal at his first Olympics at Sydney, there were expectations upon him to go and gain a ‘proper job.’</p>
<p>Such thoughts were never going to be a reality for him though, and he earned his spurs in the early part of his career as a track specialist, before turning to road racing.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins</p>
<p>“I never found that process of going to road racing hard at all, as I am someone who can be coached, so it came easily to me. If it was a question of having to lose weight for the tour then it’s just something I did with hard work and stopped eating and looked at my nutrition.”</p>
<p>From a position of coming 4th in the Tour de France in 2009, observers began to take his credentials as a road-based rider seriously.</p>
<p>Though it was joining Team Sky in 2010 (recently re-named Ineos under new sponsors), which was to herald his most consistent era of success.</p>
<p>While he rates the elite set-up as ‘very businesslike and unsustainable’ in regard to managing his family life, he accepts those years led to his biggest victories that gave him a major international profile.</p>
<p>“I know that it does mean a lot to other people that I won the tour and Olympics in 2012, but I wouldn’t be a very good person if those were the things that were the most important to me in my life,” reflects Wiggins.</p>
<p>These subjects and plenty more besides will come under the microscope as Sir Bradley offers up some insights into his eventful career to his audience with his UK tour. Expect plenty of memorabilia and anecdotes of racing rivalries that will offer a very personal window into his world.</p>
<p>Sir Bradley Wiggins</p>
<p>“I’ve been enjoying doing these shows as I like to break down perceptions. I feel you never really know someone until you’ve heard their story properly.</p>
<p>“It gives me chance to meet people, and I can particularly remember speaking to one guy in Nottingham. He said his wife would really have loved the show, but she hadn’t made it as she had just died of cancer, so I just told him that she was right there with him. So with these kinds of shows, people see your emotions and I am looking forward to getting out there again,” adds Sir Bradley, reflecting on one of the most eventful careers in cycling history.</p>
<p>l Bradley Wiggins brings his show to Birmingham Symphony Hall on September 20.
