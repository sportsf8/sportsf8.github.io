<p>L’équipe de Chez Germaine qui avait procédé en septembre dernier à l’acquisition de l’ancien bâtiment qui abritait le restaurant La Piazzetta est en voie de réaliser de nouveaux travaux sur la partie extérieure du restaurant reconverti. Ces travaux devraient contribuer à améliorer l’expérience client de façon substantielle dès sa réouverture. On se rappellera que les promoteurs avaient complètement rénové l’intérieur du bâtiment patrimonial lors de son acquisition.</p>
<p>Redonner les allures d’autrefois</p>
<p>Les travaux d’aménagement de la terrasse à l’avant, côté St-Germain Est, pourront accueillir près de 70 personnes comparativement à 42 avant l’aménagement. Anne-Marie Bélanger, co-promotrice du projet explique : « La terrasse sera recouverte d’une pergola afin de contrôler le soleil et la pluie et sera aussi munie de toiles ainsi que de chauffage afin d’élargir de quelques mois son temps d’utilisation, soit de mai à octobre chaque année. Les travaux comprennent aussi de peindre la bâtisse en blanc qui est la couleur originale du bâtiment centenaire. Nous allons aussi effectuer diverses retouches sur le recouvrement extérieur. Une terrasse d’une trentaine de places à l’arrière, pour celles et ceux qui voudront profiter du soleil en journée accompagné d’un bon dîner, viendra compléter les travaux ».</p>
<p>Aussi un projet de restauration</p>
<p>Sur l’ancienne terrasse démolie le weekend dernier, Anne-Marie et Frédérique Bélanger, co-propriétaires de La Boîte 73 qui regroupe le restaurant Chez Germaine et la firme de marketing Les Influenceurs . Photo: Courtoisie</p>
<p>Dès le départ, Frédérique Bélanger, promotrice du projet avec sa sœur Marie-Anne avaient expliqué la nécessité que leur projet en soit un de restauration patrimoniale au centre-ville en simultané à leur projet de développement d’affaires. Le bâtiment qui abrite aussi la firme de marketing Les Influenceurs porte maintenant le nom de La Boîte 73 et se veut un lieu de rencontre créatif.</p>
<p>Déjà plusieurs citoyens ont constaté à quel point le projet contribue à dynamiser ce secteur de la rue Saint Germain Est. Ces améliorations devraient être de nature à pousser un peu plus loin cette revitalisation.</p>
<p>La réouverture est prévue cet été, mais évidemment à ce stade, le sort de l’ouverture des restaurants et bars est entre les mains de la direction de la Santé publique qui n’a pas encore fait connaître son plan d’action de ce côté. On encourage les gens à consulter le compte Facebook de Chez Germaine afin de s’enquérir des détails de l’ouverture en temps et lieu.

<p><img src="https://i.f1g.fr/media/cms/629x354_crop/2020/06/04/3f30f65cbeaacd8ade1f6fb230763f7968c176ca01dd59a4ed8dc9c1b6160d62.jpeg" alt="img">
RÉCIT - Dans une église qu&rsquo;il aimait particulièrement, sa famille et ses amis ont dit au revoir au fantaisiste. Dehors, la foule était nombreuse.</p>
<p>Derrière les barrières de sécurité, les admirateurs patientent dans le calme. Une heure avant le début de la cérémonie, prévue à 14h30, la foule est nombreuse, ceinturant la place, face à l'église Saint-Germain-des-Prés où une grande photo de Guy Bedos a été installée. Le ciel est gris, mais doux. Un grand panneau, hissé au milieu du public, le dit : «L&rsquo;humour est un humanisme.» Sur l&rsquo;autre face, « Merci Guy Bedos ». Côté parvis, le carré des photographes est dense. Les premiers invités sont déjà arrivés. Oui. On dit bien « invités » car il fallait montrer un document : une photo du jeune Bedos –on dirait son fils !- mains offertes, accueillant. « Cérémonie d&rsquo;adieu à Guy Bedos. Jeudi 4 juin 2020. » Avec la mention : « Invitation personnelle » barrant en rouge l&rsquo;affichette…Pour Le Figaro et notre confrère du Parisien, c'était justement mal barré. On n&rsquo;avait pas pensé à solliciter une invitation, imaginant qu&rsquo;une carte de presse suffirait… On avait même dans le fond du sac un vieux billet de l&rsquo;Olympia : lundi 23 décembre 2013, Rideau. Preuve qu&rsquo;on n&rsquo;avait pas attendu qu&rsquo;il disparaisse pour le saluer… Mais rien à faire ! Bref. Le service d&rsquo;ordre était intraitable… Il fallut en appeler à la famille… et l&rsquo;on pénétra.</p>
<p>Nicolas Bedos, long et fin, costume et lunettes noires, parapluie à la main, cravate légèrement desserrée, à la manière paternelle, était arrivé quelques minutes auparavant, sous les applaudissements nourris de la foule.</p>
<p>Jean-Paul Belmondo est là. Le grand copain des débuts ; il avait 17 ans et Guy 16</p>
<p>Le curé de Saint-Germain-des-Prés, Antoine de Folleville a rouvert son église fin mai. Il est là, avec la chasuble violette des deuils. Pourquoi la cérémonie n&rsquo;a-t-elle pas lieu à Saint-Roch, paroisse des artistes ? «Parce que Guy Bedos aimait cette église», répond-il en souriant, sur le seuil pour accueillir le fourgon funéraire. Les applaudissements crépitent à nouveau à l&rsquo;arrivée du convoi.</p>

<p>Dans l'église, si belle, avec son ciel d&rsquo;un bleu intense constellé d'étoiles d&rsquo;or, les proches sont réunis. Épouse, enfants, petits-enfants, famille élargie. Joëlle Bercot, Victoria, Leslie et Mélanie, qui sont certainement là elles aussi. Jean-Paul Belmondo, le grand copain des débuts - il avait 17 ans et Guy 16 -, est là, accompagné de son fils Paul. Pas moins de trois ministres de la Culture : Franck Riester, masque noir cachant le visage, mais aussi Jack Lang et son épouse Monique, ainsi qu&rsquo;Aurélie Filippetti. Présent également, Christophe Girard, un peu étonné que la distanciation soit peu strictement observée : « Guy, c'était l&rsquo;un des éléments de notre devise : il était la liberté même. » Arnaud Montebourg, qui partageait son amour de l&rsquo;Algérie, est lui aussi présent.</p>
<p>Je ne veux pas qu&rsquo;on m&rsquo;enterre. Finir en poudre à éternuer dans une petite boîte, merci bien</p>
<p>Et puis sont là tous les amis : les journalistes et écrivains, Anne Sinclair, Ivan Levaï, Michel Drucker, Mireille Dumas, Bruno Cras, Frédéric Beigbeider&hellip; Les compagnons du spectacle, toutes générations : Jean-Michel Ribes, Vladimir Cosma dont on va entendre de très belles pages de musique. Et puis Pierre Richard, Michel Leeb, Bernard Crombey, Daniel Colas, Fanny Ardant, François Berléand, Smaïn, Alex Lutz, David Foenkinos, Catherine Frot, Benoît Magimel, Myriam Boyer, Elsa Zylberstein, Catherine Lachens, Macha Méril, Emmanuelle Béart, Thomas Langmann, Virginie Effira, Élie Semoun, tant d&rsquo;autres que nous n&rsquo;avons sans doute pas vus…</p>
<p>Fanny Ardant. THOMAS SAMSON / AFP</p>
<p>Pages de musique, prises de parole. Mais auparavant, c&rsquo;est la voix de Guy Bedos qui résonne. «Je ne veux pas qu&rsquo;on m&rsquo;enterre, supplie-t-il. Finir en poudre à éternuer dans une petite boîte, merci bien. »</p>
<p>» VOIR AUSSI - Obsèques de Guy Bedos: ses proches ont rendu un dernier hommage au comédien à Paris</p>
<p>Bouleversée, ravagée de chagrin, Muriel Robin fait le portrait du frère idéal que fut Guy. «Gentillesse» revient plusieurs fois. Tonnerre d&rsquo;applaudissements. Il y en aura beaucoup. Michel Boujenah, lui non plus, ne retient pas ses larmes. Pas plus que Maria Bedos, la cousine germaine, la fille de Jacques Bedos, pionnier des planches de la famille, animateur merveilleux de la radio et de la télévision d&rsquo;Alger… Maria, très émue, évoque ses conversations avec Guy et cite un poème d&rsquo;un des frères de Tibhirine…</p>
<p>La vie est une comédie italienne, en piste, en piste les artistes. C&rsquo;est notre rôle d'être drôle</p>
<p>Voici l&rsquo;un des très grands moments de beauté : Doria Tillier chante Barbara. Admirablement bien. Résonne «Du plus loin que je me souvienne». L'émotion est à son comble. Puis les filles de Guy, disent le père qui les couvait et «son sourire intact aux portes de la mort». Puis, après Boujenah qui intervient là, voici Nicolas au piano accompagnant sa sœur Victoria. «La vie est une comédie italienne (…), en piste, en piste les artistes. C&rsquo;est notre rôle d'être drôle.»</p>
<p>Jean-Michel Ribes. BERTRAND GUAY / AFP</p>
<p>Le curé de la paroisse a accueilli chacun. Ceux qui croient et les autres. La cérémonie est tout de même religieuse. On va écouter l'Évangile de Marc. Jour de tempête. Mais Jésus ne craint ni vent ni eaux déchaînées. Le père de Folleville aura beau jeu de s&rsquo;adresser au disparu : «Cher Guy, vous qui aimiez les églises vides, il y a du monde…» Il affirme sa foi chrétienne et la certitude de «la vie après». Pas sûr que Guy Bedos en ait été toujours persuadé. Le prêtre allume les bougies rituelles avant l'évangile et l&rsquo;homélie. Il cite Freud et les trois blessures narcissiques qui déchirent l'être humain. Copernic et l&rsquo;héliocentrisme, Darwin et l'évolution, Freud lui-même et l&rsquo;inconscient.</p>
<p>Voûte étoilée et youyous</p>
<p>Lamartine a la réponse, pour ce prêtre à l'écoute. L&rsquo;homme est «borné dans sa nature, infini dans ses vœux». Et de conclure plus tard : «Cher Nicolas, votre père pourrait être une petite étoile sur la voûte étoilée de cette église magnifique. » Ajoutant : «Il n'était pas très pote avec la religion, avez-vous précisé, mais Dieu l&rsquo;avait pour pote.»</p>
<p>Alors là, les applaudissements pourraient faire crouler l'église… Peu de personnes sont capables de réciter le Notre Père. Encens, orgue, amen. «Faut pas mégoter son chagrin», comme a dit Nicolas.</p>
<p>Dehors, où la cérémonie était retransmise, les youyous vont venir en renfort des applaudissements. La foule n&rsquo;a pas bougé. S&rsquo;est même étoffée. La pluie se met à tomber. Rideau.

Mauro Icardi 2024 nyaráig szóló megállapodást kötött a Paris Saint-Germainnel, amelynél szeptembertől az Internazionale kölcsönlabdarúgójaként szerepelt.</p>
<p>MTI-HÍR</p>
<p>A hivatalos megállapodás tényét a francia és az olasz klub egyidejűleg kiadott kommünikében tudatta vasárnap.</p>
<p>A francia bajnokságban címvédő Paris Saint-Germain 50 millió euróért (17,4 milliárd forintért) vásárolta ki az Inter olasz állampolgársággal is rendelkező argentin támadóját, miután a milánói klub engedett 70 milliós követeléséből.</p>
<p>Mielőtt a koronavírus-járvány miatt felfüggesztették volna a francia bajnokságot, a 27 éves csatár 31 meccsen 20 góllal és négy gólpasszal segítette a PSG-t.</p>
<p>A nyolcszoros argentin válogatott játékos 2013-ban egy másik élvonalbeli itáliai együttestől, a Sampdoriától szerződött az Interhez, amelynek színeiben 219 mérkőzésen lépett pályára, és 124-szer volt eredményes. Két alkalommal gólkirályként zárta az olasz bajnoki szezont, 2018-ban pedig a Serie A legjobb játékosának választották.</p>

<h3 id="who-is-saint-germain-castlevania-season-3s-strangest-new-character-explained">&ldquo;Who is Saint Germain? Castlevania Season 3&rsquo;s strangest new character, explained&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/3/4/10b83205-f80e-4ee8-a5af-ac717926adc3-screen-shot-2020-03-04-at-55139-pm.png?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;fm=jpg" alt="img">
Castlevania Season 3 is finally here, and one of the most surprising new additions to the cast is the mysterious Count Saint Germain, a presumptuous and flamboyant traveling magician whom Trevor and Sypha encounter in the town of Lindenfeld early in the season.</p>
<p>But who is this Saint Germain and what do we know about him from the games?</p>
<p>Castlevania Season 3 arrives on Netflix early in the morning on March 5, bringing with it a new story exploring the fallout of Dracula&rsquo;s death at the end of Season 2. Trevor and Sypha have spent about a month defeating Night Creatures in the wild, protecting humanity from what remains of Dracula&rsquo;s demonic hordes, but they quickly arrive in the small town of Lindenfeld. There, a formerly religious priory has sinister intentions and an uneasy relationship with the local townsfolk, but by far the most interesting new person we meet is Saint Germain, voiced by Bill Nighy.</p>
<p>Light spoilers follow for Castlevania Season 3 and Castlevania: Curse of Darkness.</p>
<p>In his very first scene, Saint Germain tries to buy apples from a shrewd tradeswoman, but he only has Grosh coins from the east instead of the local denarius currency, so she refuses him. With some sleight of hand and a bit of magic, he&rsquo;s able to transform and multiply a single large coin into four smaller coins. It speaks to his vibe with easy confidence bolstered by the magic that feels decidedly different from Sypha&rsquo;s elemental spells.</p>
<p>Saint Germain&rsquo;s clothes look expensive, his golden necklace has a large hourglass in the center, and he saunters about with a kind of suave confidence that makes him seem like a nobleman who knows exactly how powerful he is. (He describes himself as &ldquo;immortal and glorious&rdquo; at one point early in the new season.)</p>
<p>The character is a very loose adaption of the character from the 2005 PlayStation 2 game Castlevania: Curse of Darkness. That game follows Hector as a hero on a quest for revenge against Isaac, who killed his wife. (Yes, these are the same two Forgemaster featured in the series but in wildly different storylines.) In Curse of Darkness, Saint Germain appears as a time-traveler with seemingly infinite knowledge of the universe, and his outfit looks like something a gentleman magician might wear with a posh top hat. He seems keen on upholding a certain kind of cosmic status quo and stands in Hector&rsquo;s way on occasion to achieve that, but his secrets and true intentions were always mysterious.</p>
<p>Warren Ellis, creator of Netflix&rsquo;s Castlevania series, has never (and probably will never) play the games, instead preferring to adapt whatever piques his interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m free to just cherry-pick whatever I want,&rdquo; Ellis tells Inverse in a recent interview. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been interested in history and the history of magic in the real world. There were many people like Saint Germain in the period up to the 1500s who were essentially itinerant &lsquo;magicians&rsquo; wandering between the great courts of Europe in search of patronage — that always fascinated me.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s this version of Saint Germain: A wandering magician in search of knowledge rather than some time-traveling godly figure &hellip; or is he?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to watch Castlevania Season 3 to find out whether or not Saint Germain winds up being an all-powerful time magician, but adapting him as a posh magic-user in search of lost knowledge establishes him as a compelling agent of chaos in Season 3 and beyond.

Ryan Murphy&rsquo;s first Netflix show, The Politician, arrived to the streaming service on September 27.

<p>Here, all that we know about Theo Germaine, the trans non-binary actor who&rsquo;s about to be a star.</p>
<p>The first season of Ryan Murphy’s The Politician brings some of Hollywood’s favorite actors to Netflix: Ben Platt, Gwyneth Paltrow, January Jones, Jessica Lange, Bette Midler, and Judith Light, to name a few. Platt takes on the role of Payton Hobart, an unbelievably anxious high school student who’s addicted to success and will do anything to become student body president in the hopes of one day ascending to President of the United States. But while Platt is the star, the new comedy—which is being ripped apart by critics yet beloved by fans on Twitter—has also done a fantastic job of casting fresh talent that have the charisma (hello, David Corenswet—a.k.a. River) to become household names overnight.</p>
<p>Among them is Theo Germaine, a newcomer who plays James Sullivan, one of Payton’s “campaign” managers and, as Payton says early on in the new series, his “best friend.” Germaine, who identifies as trans non-binary and uses they/them and he/him pronouns interchangeably, is based in Chicago and has a background in theater. And they admit that within days of being cast on The Politician, their life changed forever. Here&rsquo;s what we know about Germaine.</p>
<p>Germaine flew to Los Angeles to work on The Politician within a week of their audition.</p>
<p>The actor’s background is rooted in theater, and their work has appeared on a platform called OpenTV. According to The Politician’s production notes, Germain was auditioning for several roles before being cast, “living paycheck-to-paycheck” and crossing their fingers to land the part for a play in Seattle. And then, that all quickly changed.</p>

<p>“I was working at Wormhole coffee shop in Wicker Part and received a call on a Tuesday. My agency—I work with Gray Talent in Chicago—they were like: ‘Hey, there’s a self-tape request, we don’t have a ton of information about this project, it’s super secretive, but it’s this new Netflix show called ‘The Politician’ from Ryan Murphy.’ So I did all the research that I could, and two days later went into the office and did a self-tape,” Germaine told The Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>The following Monday, Germaine got the offer.</p>
<p>“And I remember I freaked out in the coffee shop and screamed a whole bunch! And then I ran outside and a rainstorm started and I was running around in the rain in the street, and all the people sitting at the counter at the front windows at Wormhole were like, what is this crazy person doing? I had to be in Los Angeles by Thursday, so I quit my job and tied up all my loose ends. I didn’t even know what was going on, I just said ‘yes’ and was on a plane.”</p>
<p>Courtesy of NETFLIX</p>
<p>James’s gender identity is never discussed on the show—and that’s intentional.</p>
<p>Germaine told the Chicago Tribute that producers sought a transmasculine actor for the role of James, however, mention of the character&rsquo;s identity doesn’t make it into the storyline in order to allow Payton’s friend to just exist.</p>
<p>In an interview with OprahMag.com ahead of the September release, Germaine expressed just how refreshing it is to not be pigeon-holed into playing a character that has to unpack and provide explanations of gender identity for mainstream audiences.</p>
<p>“I am constantly trying to fight stereotyping and labels and have to represent my community well. There’s a lot of pressure and this was the first time that I was really able to just be an actor and have that effect me in a really positive way,” Germaine said.</p>
<p>Courtesy of NETFLIX</p>
<p>“It was honestly a little daunting for a while, because I’m so conditioned to figuring out how to work inside a box and sell myself in a particular way to try to get a job, that to not have those walls has become really freeing. I can’t believe I get to do this and not have it be about gender identity. That doesn’t really happen yet, but I’m hoping that the show will inspire more shows to keep it up.”</p>
<p>Germain has some ideas for season 2 of The Politician.</p>
<p>The Netflix series is confirmed to return for a sophomore run, and while the cast doesn’t yet know where there characters are going, there’s one storyline Germaine would like James to explore. Spoiler: Remember when we learn James and Alice (Julia Schlaepfer) hid a love affair from Payton? Well, Germaine wants more of that.</p>
<p>“Because I love juicy gossip, I’m like, &lsquo;Is anything gonna happen between James and Alice?&rsquo; I don’t know! I’m so curious, but also I think you don’t see a lot of James’s more human side and where his vulnerability is beside from a couple of points in the show,” Germaine told OprahMag.com. “I am curious to explore and see what else will come up for him and what sides get developed.”</p>
<p>Courtesy of NETFLIX</p>
<p>The Politician isn’t the only project you’ll see Germaine on.</p>
<p>In December, the actor is expected to star in Work in Progress, a new eight-episode Showtime comedy starring Abby McEnany. “The show is super stripped down; it’s very raw, it’s very honest, and it’s very funny. The character that I play, Chris, is a 22-year-old waiter who works at a restaurant. He is the love interest of Abby, which is also really exciting because I get to be the romantic lead,” Germaine told Them. “I never thought I’d be able to do that on TV. It’s so different from The Politician, but The Politician put me in such a position of confidence in terms of believing in myself that I was so ready to start shooting Work in Progress when I was back.”</p>

<p>Germaine looks up to Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox.</p>
<p>In May, Germaine shared a selfie with Cox, explaining they ran into each other at a party in New York after meeting years prior, when she offered kind words of wisdom for becoming an actor.</p>
<p>“Laverne Cox has always been one of my biggest inspirations, and I’m sure that millions of people would say the same thing,” Germain wrote. “Thanks for doing what you do, Laverne; you inspire me to do what I love to do! It was so nice to re-meet you last night!”</p>

<h3 id="woman-turns-99-gets-birthday-parade-in-plover">&ldquo;Woman turns 99; gets birthday parade in Plover&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/99TH+BIRTHDAY+PARTY.png" alt="img">
A tune up for a triple-digits birthday next year. Germaine Brillowski turned 99 Friday. Her family wasn&rsquo;t able to celebrate the way they normally do, so four generations below her gave her a birthday parade at Whispering Pines Nursing Home in Plover where she lives.</p>
<p>Signs, cards, and balloons were dropped off. For her sons, it was the least they could do for mom.</p>
<p>Leroy Brillowski, Germaine&rsquo;s son, said, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a wonderful woman. It&rsquo;s the reason she lived to be 99, because she doesn&rsquo;t have a bad bone in her body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t be more proud of my mom, she was the best mom in the world,&rdquo; said Dennis Brillowski, Germain&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Mark Brillowski, also Germaine&rsquo;s son, said, &ldquo;It makes me feel good, and I could see ma felt good. It isn&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s the best we could do at these times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, what do the sons have planned for next year&rsquo;s big 100? Dennis said, one big party with a lot of exclamation points.

<h3 id="a-master-list-of-cocktail-recipes-to-make-at-home-courtesy-of-denver-bartenders">&ldquo;A Master List of Cocktail Recipes To Make at Home, Courtesy of Denver Bartenders&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.303magazine.com/uploads/2020/02/Room-for-Milly_303MAG_Adrienne-Thomas-41.jpg" alt="img">
Since the first week of lockdown, we facilitated a 10-part series highlighting recipes from bartenders across the front range. Here is a complete list of all the beverages, bringing together an astonishing array of talent from some of the best cocktail aficionados the state has to offer. We have been incredibly grateful for the chance to compile the over 50 recipes, that together present a considerable window into the many great minds that make up Colorado’s illustrious bar culture. Below we’ve arranged the recipes by spirit — highlighting a range of classic and creative drinks and a great array of local products. Taken together, it represents a scene that could rival any in the nation.</p>
<p>As service industry workers continue to struggle, various services have popped up to assist those in need. This website allows people to tip a randomized staff member when they have a drink. We will also be including Venmo handles of the involved bartenders below if anyone wants to tip them personally.</p>
<p>Vodka</p>
<p>Katie Kelly – Bar Manager at Barolo Grill</p>
<p>Location: Barolo Grill is located at 3030 East 6th Ave., Denver. It is open for curbside pickup Tuesday – Thursday 4 – 8 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 4 – 8:30 p.m. It is open for indoor and outdoor dining Tuesday – Thursday 5 – 9 p.m., and Friday and Saturday 5 – 10 p.m. by reservation only.</p>
<p>Recipe: The Italian Rabbit</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz vodka 1 oz Aperol 3/4 oz carrot juice (freshly juiced is best if you have a juicer) 3/4 oz lemon juice 1 tsp ginger syrup (I use Fiji Ginger Syrup by The Ginger People, available at Sprouts and Whole Foods, same section as maple syrup)</p>
<p>Fill a cocktail shaker with ice, or a mason jar with lid if you don’t have a shaker. Add all ingredients, shake well and strain into chilled glass. Garnish with any of the following — a carrot frond, an edible flower (chamomile flowers are especially nice) or a lemon twist.</p>
<p>Reason: I love using ingredients in season, plus the carrots in this cocktail make me feel like I’m being a touch more healthy and we all need every bit of health we can get right now. I put this on the Barolo Grill cocktail list every spring, but since it’s best enjoyed immediately, we can’t offer batched versions. I hope to make this for you when we safely reopen the bar — until then enjoy this cocktail from the comfort of your home, yard or spring garden.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: @K-Kelly-10</p>
<p>Adam Reed – Director of Operations at Jax Fish House and Oyster Bar</p>
<p>Location: Jax has multiple locations. Both Glendale and LoDo locations are open for dine-in and takeout every day from 3:30 – 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Recipe: Jax Cucumber Lemon Press</p>
<p>4 oz cucumber-infused vodka 1/2 oz simple syrup 1 oz fresh lemon juice 2 1/2 oz soda water English cucumber and lemon, for garnish</p>
<p>Why such a large recipe? Because you will find you never end up drinking just one of these. This recipe makes a pair of really lovely large drinks for two. Fill two large rocks glasses with ice. Again, one is for your “‘friend,” wink wink. Dump the ice from rocks glasses into a shaker tin. Add the infused vodka, simple syrup and lemon juice, stir to chill. Pour the ice and vodka mixture back evenly into the two glasses and top both with soda water to the top. Garnish with a wheel of cucumber and a large lemon twist. Enjoy. Feel free to add more simple syrup — this version is intentionally not very sweet, but you can sweeten as much as you prefer.</p>
<p>Cucumber-Infused Vodka Infusing your own vodka is incredibly easy. Combine 750 ml of vodka with 1 English cucumber, sliced. You will want to do the infusion in a different bottle or vessel so you can strain off the cucumbers and then put the vodka back in its own bottle. We typically infuse for about five days. The longer you go, the stronger the cucumber flavor will be. You also can use a pre-infused or flavored cucumber vodka from the store — but we never do that at Jax because the fresh cucumber flavor is unbeatable.</p>
<p>Reason: A press is a drink that typically has a base spirit mixed with lemon-lime soda and soda water. In this case, we substitute a housemade lemonade for the lemon-lime soda and use vodka that has been infused with fresh cucumber. This has been a guest favorite at Jax for many, many years.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: @BigRedF-Fund. Any proceeds that go to this will go to the Big Red F family fund 4013c. The money in this fund is distributed to employees in need via grants, at the sole discretion of a Fund Board made up of BRF peers.</p>
<p>Gin</p>
<p>Nick Touch – Brand Ambassador for The Family Jones</p>
<p>Location: The Family Jones Spirit House is located at 3245 Osage St., Denver. It is currently open only for special pop-ups. Its spirits are sold across the front range and can be found here.</p>
<p>Recipe: Tom Collins</p>
<p>2 oz Juniper Jones Gin</p>
<p>3/4 oz Fresh Lemon Juice</p>
<p>1/2 oz Simple Syrup (1:1 sugar to water)</p>
<p>5 oz Sparkling water</p>
<p>Reason: The Tom Collins was memorialized in writing in 1876 by Jerry Thomas, the Father of American Mixology. I love this drink because it is easy to make, very refreshing and can be enjoyed at any time of day. This simple, sour style classic cocktail is versatile, and at-home-bartenders can add various ingredients to make it their own. Some suggestions would be fruit purees, liqueurs, honey syrup in place of the simple syrup, or herbs such as mint or basil. Cheers from The Family Jones.</p>
<p>Devin Chapnick – Lead Bartender at Poka Lola Social Club</p>
<p>Location: Poka Lola Social Club is located at 1850 Wazee St., Ground Floor, Denver. It is open for dine-in and takeout Wednesday – Saturday 4 – 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Recipe: The Clover Club</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Bulldog Gin</p>
<p>1/2 oz Imbue Dry vermouth</p>
<p>3/4 oz lemon juice</p>
<p>1/2 oz raspberry preserves</p>
<p>1 egg white</p>
<p>Shake all ingredients in tin with ice, strain off the ice and shake again. Strain into coupe and garnish with three drops of Peychaud’s</p>
<p>Reason: Creating this cocktail came to me while scouring through my pantry in search of something to drink. After stumbling upon some preserves, I thought it would be neat to see what other innocuous goods can be transformed into tasty drinks. This approach is fun and practical enough to share, so I’m actually going to have a live streaming class on using unexpected ingredients found around your kitchen. Everyone’s kitchen has possibilities that aren’t getting explored, so an interactive virtual class will uncover some new and exciting cocktails to try at home.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: Chapnik asked that anyone hoping to tip donate to the Sage Hospitality Group Associate Relief Fund.</p>
<p>Bonus: Chapnik’s “Keep Calm and Mix On” episode about making drinks with what you have in your pantry already will air next Tuesday, April 14 at 6 p.m. on @sagerestaurantconcepts Instagram, as part of an ongoing series to benefit furloughed associates.</p>
<p>Sebastian Zydek – Bartender at El Five and the Vice President of the Colorado Bartenders Guild</p>
<p>Location: El Five is located at 2930 Umatilla Fifth Floor, Denver. It is currently closed.</p>
<p>Recipe: Tom’s G&amp;T</p>
<p>2 oz gin (I use Hendrick’s Orbium)</p>
<p>top with tonic water (I used Fever Tree, any flavor works)</p>
<p>lemonade ice – combine lemon juice, sugar and water to your flavor preference and free in any household ice cube tray.</p>
<p>Reason: I wanted to create a cocktail that anyone could make at home that is simple, delicious and exciting. So I combined two of my favorites — the gin and tonic and a Tom Collins. By making lemonade ice cubes and using tonic water instead of seltzer you have a new, refreshing cocktail that changes in flavor over time.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: @Sebastian-Zydek</p>
<p>The Spirits Department at Molly’s Spirits</p>
<p>This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p>
<p>Location: Molly’s Spirits is located at 5809 W 44th Ave., Denver. It is open every day from 11 a.m. – 8 p.m., with limited capacity shopping and curbside pickup for online orders.</p>
<p>Recipe: Molly’s Aviation</p>
<p>2 oz The Block Distillery Spring Gin</p>
<p>1/2 oz Golden Moon Distillery Creme De Violette</p>
<p>1/4 oz Leopold Bros Distilling Maraschino Liquer</p>
<p>3/4 oz fresh lime juice</p>
<p>Shake well over ice and pour in a martini glass or on the rocks. Garnish with a brandied cherry.</p>
<p>Reason: We created this beautifully vibrant purple drink for the Rockies Opening Day. However, this light, floral and citrus gin concoction is the perfect springtime drink to enjoy with your quarantine crew or over a virtual happy hour. Make it truly festive with Colorado distilled spirits.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: Molly’s asked that anyone hoping to tip consider purchasing a Colorado Strong Tee from the Colorado Brewer’s Guild.</p>
<p>Brent Walker and Meghan Gold – Proprietors at Foraged</p>
<p>Location: Foraged is located at 1825 Blake St, Denver. Open with limited dine-in and patio seating every day 12 p.m. – 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Recipe: The Foraged Black Rose</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Roku Japanese Gin</p>
<p>1/2 oz Gifford Blackberry Liquor</p>
<p>1/2 oz lime juice</p>
<p>1/2 oz agave nectar</p>
<p>In a cocktail shaker, combine Roku Gin, Gifford Blackberry Liquor, lime juice, agave nectar and ice cubes. Shake vigorously. Strain into a chilled tulip cup. Garnish with a rosemary sprig.</p>
<p>Reason: Meghan and I collaborated on this drink during a cocktail development session with our team. We loved the refreshing brightness of this cocktail as the Japanese Gin was such a great combination with the blackberry liquor and the agave kept it lower-calorie.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: Walker and Gold asked that anyone hoping to tip donate to the employee relief fund.</p>
<p>Colin Overett – General Manager at Union Lodge</p>
<p>Location: Union Lodge is located at 1543 Champa St., Denver. It is currently closed for construction.</p>
<p>Recipe: The Martinez</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz gin (I prefer Barrel Aged Bols Genever)</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz sweet vermouth (Cocchi Di Torino adds a beautiful spice to it)</p>
<p>1/4 oz Maraschino Liqueur</p>
<p>2 dashes Regan’s Orange Bitters</p>
<p>Stir with ice and strain into a coupe. Express an orange peel over the top. Sip and enjoy.</p>
<p>Reason: This is personally one of my favorite cocktails. It is very easy to make but it can be easily made unbalanced or incorrectly. It has so many layers of flavors and textures but done with elegance. I could sit at a bar for hours or relax at home watching a good movie while sipping this drink. It also works for people who are whiskey drinkers wanting to try gin or vice versa. It is a cocktail that can be made with ingredients from pretty much any liquor store for anyone trying this beauty at home.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: @Colin-Overett</p>
<p>Kraig Weaver – Head Distiller at The Block Distilling Co.</p>
<p>Location: The Block Distilling Co. is located at 2990 Larimer St., Denver. It is currently open for pickup Monday-Saturday 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Recipe: Golden Girl</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz The Block Distilling Co. Summer Gin 1 oz turmeric-ginger simple syrup 1 oz coconut milk 1/2 oz lime 1/4 oz orange juice To make the turmeric-ginger simple syrup, combine 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water and 2 teaspoons ginger in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Continue to boil until ingredients are fully incorporated. Turn off heat, add 1 teaspoon turmeric. Cool and set aside. Add vodka, turmeric-ginger simple syrup, coconut milk, lime and orange juice into a shaker over ice. Shake well. Serve immediately with an orange twist.</p>
<p>Reason: This was one of my favorite drinks on our winter and spring menus. It’s a boozy take on golden milk, a traditional ayurvedic drink. The subtle sweetness along with the aromatics of ginger and turmeric in the simple pair well with the citrus notes that are found in our summer gin. Although we use coconut milk, feel free to use an alternative like almond milk, oat milk or whatever you have at home. If you are not a fan of gin, feel free to substitute vodka.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: Weaver asked that if anyone would like to support The Block, the best way is by ordering spirits and cocktails-to-go or by purchasing a gift card.</p>
<p>Matt Samson – Principal Bartender at B&amp;GC</p>
<p>Location: B&amp;GC is located at 249 Columbine St., Denver. It is currently closed.</p>
<p>Recipe: Safety Net</p>
<p>1 oz gin 1 oz pisco 1/2 oz maple syrup 1/2 oz Amaro Montenegro 3/4 oz lemon juice 1 dash floral bitters</p>
<p>Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker, add ice, shake and strain.</p>
<p>Reason: For this cocktail, I kind of combined a couple of my favorite ingredients into a sour that reflects springtime from my balcony. Pisco and Montenegro are great additions to any bar, and here they are providing a nice floral note throughout the cocktail. The maple gives the drink both body and complexity, and the gin provides a good familiar dry flavor to get everyone aquatinted.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: @Matthew-Samson-1</p>
<p>Jon Mateer – Bartender at Death and Co.</p>
<p>Location: Death and Co. is located at 1280 25th St., Denver. It is currently closed. However, Death and Co. Market is selling a variety of accessories including glasses, flasks, hats and apparel. There is also a GoFundMe set up for staff relief.</p>
<p>Recipe: Negroni</p>
<p>1 oz Plymouth Gin 1 oz Campari 1 oz Cocchi Vermouth de Torino garnish with an orange half-moon</p>
<p>The perfect “stay-at-home” cocktail. You can make a bunch of these in advance and keep it stored in your fridge. Just mix equal parts of each ingredient into a pitcher and pour three ounces into your rocks glass over a large ice cube — or whatever you have available. Just remember to stir it before pouring into your glass!</p>
<p>Reason: I remember my first experience with this drink. It was during my first month of bartending — almost 10 years ago — and my manager had asked me to come up with a drink for a new menu. I got super excited. I went out and bought a bunch of bottles, spent hours making drinks at home for my friends, and thought that I had come up with a winning recipe. I walked in super confident to the staff meeting and was so excited that I had come up with a delicious drink that was only three ingredients. I stirred it up and served it to the owners, bar manager and the rest of the staff. My bar manager takes a sip, looks me directly in the eye, and says “That’s delicious! But you do realize that all you did was make a negroni.” I’ll never forget that day. I make these at home all of the time for my fiancé and I — and to this day, it’s still my favorite cocktail.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle:@JTMateer</p>
<p>Whiskey</p>
<p>Austin Carson – Beverage Director at Restaurant Olivia</p>
<p>Location: Restaurant Olivia is located at 290 South Downing St., Denver. It is open for takeout every day from 12 p.m. – 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Recipe: Choose-Your-Adventure Jelly Sour</p>
<p>Add to a shaker:</p>
<p>2 oz whiskey</p>
<p>3/4 oz fresh lemon juice</p>
<p>1 tbsp jelly/jam of your choice</p>
<p>the white from one egg</p>
<p>Fill shaker with ice and shake vigorously for 60 seconds — pro tip: play Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off” while shaking. Strain liquid and discard ice. Shake again for another 30 seconds — pro tip: play Florence and the Machine’s “Shake It Out” while shaking. Strain into your favorite glass and enjoy.</p>
<p>Obviously sweetness will vary from one jelly/jam/preserve to the next so when building the drink in your mixing glass give the ingredients a stir before adding the egg white and taste for balance. If you want it sweeter, add more jelly. Want it a little zippier? Add a little more lemon juice.</p>
<p>Before you juice the lemons zest those suckers, add the zest to some vodka and seal it up. You may need some Limocello down the road.</p>
<p>Reason: I’m guessing most folks, like myself, have some jelly/jam kicking around the fridge. This is a very basic egg white sour recipe that will work with most any that you’ve got. This does require folks to separate the whites of eggs from the yolks but the bonus recipe from Chef Ty is good for a basic make-at-home pasta dough so you can put those to good use.</p>
<p>BONUS: Basic Make-At-Home Pasta Recipe (Using Leftover Egg Yoks from Cocktails)</p>
<p>7 egg yolks</p>
<p>1 1/4 cups flour</p>
<p>1 tsp extra virgin olive oil</p>
<p>1 tsp salt</p>
<p>Mix together the flour and half of the yolks, oil and salt. Add the rest of the yolks one at a time until combined. Knead for an additional five minutes. Wrap in plastic and let rest. Roll out the dough and cut to your desired shape. Voila.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: @Austin-Carson-1. All tips will go directly to Restaurant Olivia staff.</p>
<p>Kevin Galaba – Bartender at Bread Bar and Executive Director at Friends and Family</p>
<p>Location: Bread Bar is located at 1010 Main St., Silver Plume. It is currently closed. More info about Friends and Family can be found here.</p>
<p>Recipe: Winter Old Fashioned</p>
<p>2 oz bourbon</p>
<p>1/4 oz brown sugar-cinnamon simple syrup</p>
<p>2 dashes Fee Brother’s Black Walnut Bitters</p>
<p>garnish with orange peel.</p>
<p>To make the syrup — boil 12 oz of water and bring down to a simmer. Crack a few whole cinnamon sticks and steep them in the simmering water for 15 mins. Add brown sugar to the hot water — sugar volume should equal water volume — and when the sugar dissolves, remove from heat, strain and bottle. If you want to keep it for a while in the fridge, leave in the cinnamon sticks and let it continue to infuse over time. Cheers.</p>
<p>Reason: The Winter Old Fashioned is my go-to cold-weather cocktail. I love an Old Fashioned for its simplicity, and for this version, a few tweaks to the classic recipe really dial in the seasonal flavor. The brown sugar-cinnamon syrup adds a bit of earthiness and a thicker mouthfeel, while the black walnut bitters add a magical warmth and sweetness that really evokes Christmas or Apres-Ski.</p>
<p>Venmo Handle: @kevingalaba</p>
<p>Scott Ruggiero – Bar Manager at OAK</p>
<p>Location: OAK is located at 1400 Pearl St., Boulder. It is currently open for takeout Wednesday -Sunday from 11:30 a.m. – 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Recipe: Toddys for Days</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Redemption High Rye Bourbon</p>
<p>1/2 oz Real McCoy 5yr Rum</p>
<p>1/2 oz Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur</p>
<p>1/2 oz Honey</p>
<p>1 oz lemon juice</p>
<p>3 oz Tension Tamer tea from Celestial Seasonings (or any of your favorite herbal teas)</p>
<p>2 dashes of Angostura bitters</p>
<p>Reason: When I am at home I like to make simple drinks, typically stirred and boozy like a Manhattan or Negroni. Lately, though, I have been on a Toddy or Hot Toddy kick depending on the weather. They are fun, simple and can allow for a lot of creativity depending on what is in the pantry. This recipe can be modified in many ways depending on what the home bartender likes. You can substitute Bourbon for Rye, Rum or Tequila. The ginger liqueur can be modified with Allspice Dram, herbal liqueurs — such as Yellow Chartreuse, Benedictine, Licor43 and St. Germain. The tea can be as simple as a lemon tea or complex as any herbal tea one would like. You can use honey syrup, agave, ginger syrup or any type of sugar you have laying around the house.</p>

<p>Recipe: Boulevardier</p>
<p>2 oz Old Overholt rye</p>
<p>1 oz Dolin Rouge sweet vermouth</p>
<p>1 oz Campari</p>
<p>Reason: It’s no secret that I’m a huge Negroni fan, but I thought I’d suggest the Boulevardier for our homebound friends. The Boulevardier is a whiskey-based Negroni variation, typically made either with a standard 1:1:1 ratio or with an extra half ounce of whiskey. I prefer a bold rye whiskey, generally. Since making drinks at home, by definition, means you can treat yourself, and because I like my cocktails to be spirit-forward, I bump the drink up to 4 ounces.</p>

<p>Recipe: The Blackberry Sage Smash</p>
<p>2 oz Woody Creek Rye Whiskey (works with whatever bourbon or rye you have)</p>
<p>1/2 oz 1:1 simple syrup (1:1 by volume)</p>
<p>1/2 oz fresh lemon juice</p>
<p>4 medium-sized blackberries</p>
<p>4 medium-sized sage leaves</p>
<p>In a mixing glass or tin, muddle blackberries and sage with simple syrup and lemon juice. Add whiskey and ice. Shake. Strain over fresh ice. Garnish with a blackberry and sage leaf.</p>
<p>Reason: Actually, a drink that I created 15 years ago and has been on the menus at Steuben’s, The Squeaky Bean and Williams and Graham. It is perfect and easy to make at home.</p>

<p>Recipe: Brown Derby</p>
<p>2 oz Laws Bourbon (love my local whiskey, but please use whatever bourbon you’re comfortable with)</p>
<p>1 oz Grapefruit Juice (fresh is best, but any will do) 1/2 oz Honey Syrup (2:1) (two parts honey to one part water: boil the water and mix in the honey, let chill)</p>
<p>Combine and shake ingredients for 10-12 seconds and strain the cocktail into your desired glass. Honestly, just put it in whatever cup you want. I like serving mine up, but it’s a quarantine, so put it in a mug if you want. Garnish with a grapefruit twist. The peel adds a great aromatic and it’s pretty sexy.</p>
<p>Reason: I chose the Brown Derby because it’s one of the first cocktails I taught my mom to make at home. She asked me for something without a lot of sugar but still had a ton of flavor, and this cocktail is just that. Everything in this cocktail should be easy to find and the clean-up is a breeze — no need to make a dozen crazy syrups to achieve a delicious flavor. Feel free and adjust the honey syrup to however sweet you’d like it, 2:1 is just my personal preference. I love bourbon, and this Derby Day classic is consistent, easy to make, and it packs a punch.</p>

<p>1 oz Sweet Vermouth</p>
<p>2 dashes aromatic bitters (I used spiced cherry)</p>
<p>Stir until chilled and diluted. Strain into a cocktail coupe. Garnish with a lemon twist. Stay home.</p>
<p>Reason: I love this drink because it’s so easy to make — equal parts baby! It’s a whole bunch of flavors that just layer so nicely together and make the couch a whole lot more comfortable. It’s super easy to batch out and just have on deck for those Netflix marathons.</p>

<p>Recipe: Wake Me Up Old Fashioned</p>
<p>1 oz Elijah Craig Bourbon</p>
<p>1 oz Bacardi 8 Year Rum</p>
<p>1/2 oz Coffee Syrup*</p>
<p>3 Dashes Angostura Bitters</p>
<p>Stirred and served over your largest cube</p>
<p>Coffee Syrup 1 Cup Brewed Coffee 1 Cup Demerara Sugar Heat over medium-low heat to combine stirring often</p>
<p>Reason: Being socially distant from the world I find myself drinking a lot of whiskey, rum and coffee. This is the perfect harmony of all three of those delicious ingredients. I took my hours-old pot of coffee and turned it into a delicious syrup to add a little buzz to a classic Old Fashioned. Splitting your base spirit between whiskey and rum gives it a little something extra and also helps those bottles last a little longer. Here’s to you, cheers!</p>

<p>1 1/2 oz bonded rye</p>
<p>3/4 oz apple brandy</p>
<p>2 dash Peychaud’s bitters</p>
<p>2 dash aromatic bitters absinthe rinse</p>
<p>Rinse Old Fashioned glass with absinthe. Add sugar cube to mixing glass. Add bitters. Muddle into a fine paste. Add the remainder of the ingredients. Add ice. Stir approximately 30 times. Strain into absinthe rinsed Old Fashioned glass. Garnish with orange crusta.</p>
<p>Reason: I love a great sazerac. The addition of apple brandy is a salute to French Brandy, originally used in this historic cocktail. The combination of rye and apple brandy really brightens and opens up the traditional sazerac cocktail. Stir this cocktail right up and sit down with your favorite whiskey book.</p>

<p>Recipe: The Aspen</p>
<p>2 oz Woody Creek Rye (you may change the rye up, but I feel the profile on this spirit is perfect. And support local!) 1/2 oz Fernet Branca 1/2 oz Demerara 2 dashes Angostura bitters Stir to chill and garnished with cinnamon in a clove-smoked glass.</p>
<p>Reason: I chose this drink because it is simple to make and a play between two of my favorite classics, a Black Manhattan and a Toronto. I serve mine in a smoked snifter, however in these times just enjoy any way you would like. It is a delicious treat with cured meats, a nice steak or after dinner. Always my go-to when hosting dinner and want to impress, when we can again.</p>

<p>Recipe: Bacon-Infused Earl Grey Manhattan / Breakfast Manhattan (since we can start drinking any time now that there are no rules)</p>
<p>Bacon Infused Whiskey</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz bacon fat</p>
<p>750 ml rye whiskey (Rittenhouse or Old Overholt are great)</p>
<p>On low heat, warm bacon fat in a small saucepan. Stir until it melts, about five minutes. Combine the molten fat and whiskey in a large nonreactive container and stir. Infuse for four hours, then place the container in the freezer for two hours. Remove solid fat, fine-strain whiskey through a terry cloth or cheesecloth and bottle.</p>
<p>Earl Grey (we used Tekoe brand) infused Vermouth</p>
<p>Simply pour the desired amount in a nonreactive container and add either loose-leaf or earl grey tea bags — generally, I use two tea bags per six ounces of vermouth —and let steep for about an hour and a half. Strain and it’s ready to serve.</p>
<p>Cocktail</p>
<p>2 oz infused rye</p>
<p>1 oz infused vermouth</p>
<p>2 dashes aromatic bitters</p>
<p>Combine ingredients and ice in mixing glass — pint glass is great too — and use a barspoon — a single chopstick is a great substitute as well — to stir approximately 50 revolutions. Strain and serve without ice and garnish with a maraschino cherry or lemon peel.</p>
<p>Reason: Personally, this is one of my favorite variations of a Manhattan — the smokiness of the bacon with the quasi-dry tannic mouthfeel from the vermouth and aromatic nose that these ingredients combine to create is truly a match made in heaven.</p>

<p>Recipe: Bangarang!</p>
<p>1 oz dark rum, bonded bourbon or rye 1/2 oz creme de cacao 1/2 oz banana liqueur 1/2 oz Becherovka whole egg</p>
<p>Shake all ingredients in a tin, serve up with a little dark chocolate grated over the top or a mint sprig.</p>
<p>Reason: This was the very first cocktail I ever imagined, late one night after a long shift when I was craving a chocolate banana. I chose to share this particular one as my quarantine cocktail because of the flexibility, decadence and ease of it. Depending on if you go with the rum or whiskey, the spicy, slightly minty Becherovka will highlight different aspects of your base. Don’t have creme de cacao? Use a little chocolate syrup, or make a quick 1:1 simple syrup with brown sugar and dive into bananas foster in a glass. Right now it is all about working with what we have and finding the little daily pleasures. This cocktail is boozy, rich, and hits that fine line between dessert and after-dinner drink that’s my favorite treat yo’ self moment. Not to mention, something about using the whole egg definitely helps ease any responsibly acquired hangovers I may have the next morning.</p>

<p>Recipe: Oooooh My</p>
<p>2 oz Laws Wheat Whiskey (or your favorite wheat bourbon) 1/2 oz fresh lemon juice 3/4 oz maple syrup 3 apple slices 1 pinch ground cinnamon</p>
<p>In a cocktail shaker, combine apple slices, cinnamon and lemon juice. Muddle together until apple slices are pulverized, then add the rest of the ingredients to the shaker — if you don’t own a muddler, mash with the bottom of a spoon or ladle. Top ingredients with ice, and shake for 20-30 seconds. Double-strain over fresh ice cubes in whatever glass you have available. Garnish with an apple slice sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.</p>
<p>Reason: Apples seem to be one of the most ubiquitous fruits to be found in kitchens, so what better to base our cocktail with. A couple of other household ingredients, combined with a pour out of your favorite bottle of whiskey and you’ve got yourself a cocktail for all occasions. Most whiskeys should work for this, but I prefer a softer, more mellow whiskey, and Laws is a local favorite. This cocktail should treat you right whether you’re sitting on a patio in the sun, or cozying up to a roaring fire.</p>

<p>Recipe: Highball</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz whiskey 4 /12 oz Topo Chico 1/2 oz Umeshu (plum liqueur)</p>
<p>The highball cocktail is typically pretty simple, but you need to make sure you’re using a whiskey you really enjoy, as they become very pronounced. I like using A.D. Laws Centennial Wheat Whiskey or Atticus Jones Rye. In a highball glass, pour whiskey and Topo Chico over ice. For extra credit, add Umeshu (plum liqueur) and a small amount of saline or a very light pinch of salt. Garnish with a thin lemon wheel. The important part of the highball is how you mix it. Using a bar spoon, gently lift the ice while you stir slowly. This lets the ingredients incorporate, but doesn’t flatten the sparkling water.</p>
<p>Reason: I appreciate the drink because it transforms whiskey into a format that can be enjoyed for a longer period of time and lightens the flavor in a way that allows for it to function better with food. A few whiskeys with dinner can ruin your meal, and arguably the experience. But one can drink highballs all evening without dampening the next day.</p>

<p>Recipe: DuaRita aka “The Quarantinarita”</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Reposado tequila</p>
<p>3/4 oz Patron Citronage (Triple Sec)</p>
<p>Fresh juice of 1/2 orange (1/2 – 1 oz)</p>
<p>Fresh juice of 1 lime (1 – 1 1/4 oz)</p>
<p>Dash of agave nectar 12 oz or 16 oz glass full of ice (I like a 12 oz glass) I prefer it shaken rather than stirred but it will be tasty either way.</p>
<p>Reason: This drink is just a really good version of a margarita so please feel free to name it whatever you want. I dig this drink because it’s fresh, extremely delicious and really easy to drink. I prefer a decent reposado tequila but use what you have or what your pocket can afford. If you don’t have a fruit juicer or a fruit squeezer, you can use your hands to squeeze out the orange and lime. Feel free to adjust the amount of OJ or lime juice used per your taste, and the same goes for the agave nectar. For the record, you can not get this version of a margarita at any of the music venues I work at.</p>

<p>6 oz Maestro Dobel Blanco Tequila</p>
<p>6 oz fresh-pureed watermelon</p>
<p>2 oz fresh-squeezed lime juice</p>
<p>4 oz Tajin simple syrup*</p>
<p>Combine all ingredients and stir well. Rim glasses with Tajin spice, add ice and pour the drink over ice. Garnish with a lime wedge.</p>
<p>Tajin Simple Syrup*</p>
<p>1 liter sugar</p>
<p>1 liter hot water</p>
<p>2 oz Tajin</p>
<p>In a pan on the stove mix the sugar and water until it’s dissolved – do not let the water boil. Add Tajin spice and stir well. Let the mixture cool before mixing with the cocktail.</p>
<p>Reason: This refreshing cocktail is perfect for sipping while chilling out in your backyard or on your patio! While you can use any tequila that you have at home, we prefer mixing it with the smooth Maestro Dobel Blanco Tequila, which is double distilled and known for its subtle herbal hints. The Tajin spice rim gives the cocktail a nice chili lime kick and the watermelon juice definitely has us dreaming of sunny Colorado barbeques with friends and family! Watermelon juice is also good for you as it is rich in antioxidants, which are known to help lower inflammation and boost brain health.</p>

Smoke-laced and orange-hued, it features one of my favorite, local ingredients to play with — Distillery 291 The Decc Citrus-Clove Liqueur.

<p>Combine ingredients with ice and shake. Strain into a glass with ice. Garnish with a lime or a slice of jalapeno.</p>
<p>Reason: This margarita is inspired by my grandmother who passed away last year at the age of 92, and enjoyed the simplicity of this margarita any time of day. This is my go-to margarita at home because it is straightforward, fresh and can be enjoyed along with the trails, the tailgate or the tacos — perhaps an afternoon at grandma’s with a nice puzzle. Mix a batch for your elders. Choose a bold tequila that will stand up to the subtle and sour notes that the brandy and lime juice contribute. For a spicy variety, muddle a jalapeno.</p>

<p>1 1/4 oz El Tesoro Tequila (or silver tequila of your choice)</p>
<p>3/4 oz fresh lime juice</p>
<p>1/4 oz agave nectar</p>
<p>1 1 inch-thick wheel of cucumber</p>
<p>orange wedge</p>
<p>In a shaker, muddle cucumber and agave nectar. Add ice, tequila, lime juice and orange wedge. Shake well and strain into an ice-filled glass. Garnish with an orange wedge and a cucumber peel twist.</p>
<p>Reason: This iconic Big Red F drink was created more than a decade ago and has been a Lola staple ever since. A blend of silver tequila, fresh muddled cucumber, orange, agave and lime — it’s an incredibly refreshing and crisp take on the classic marg. I chose this drink not only because it’s such a fan-favorite, but because it’s a super easy and complex tasting cocktail to make at home with grocery store ingredients. All you need is a bottle of tequila — no orange liqueur or any additional bottles needed.</p>

<p>Recipe: Hibiscus Margarita</p>
<p>2 oz hibiscus infused tequila*</p>
<p>1 oz fresh-squeezed lime juice</p>
<p>1 oz simple syrup</p>
<p>ice</p>
<p>lime for garnish</p>
<p>Measure all ingredients into a mixing glass except the lime for garnish. Hand shake. Pour into a glass of your choice and garnish with a lime wedge or wheel.</p>
<p>Hibiscus-Infused Tequila 1 750 ml bottle of tequila (we prefer Maestro Dobel Diamante Tequila) 1/2 oz dried hibiscus flowers (You can find hibiscus online or at a specialty food store) ice</p>
<p>Pour tequila over hibiscus flowers in a glass jar. Screw on the top and let sit for at least 24 hours and no more than three weeks. Strain out the hibiscus and enjoy.</p>
<p>Reason: The hibiscus adds a tart, bright, floral element as well as a vibrant beautiful color to a classic margarita. The key to a great drink is that it is well balanced, contains at least one high-quality ingredient and is freshly prepared. Additionally, this cocktail clocks in at less than 200 calories, making a great lighter drinking option.</p>

<p>1 cup of water,</p>
<p>4oz of ginger</p>
<p>4 sprigs of rosemary</p>
<p>Bring sugar and water to a very light simmer and add in ginger and rosemary. Let it simmer for 3-5 minutes and then take it off the heat and let it steep for 45-60 minutes.</p>
<p>Reason: I love this cocktail. Super easy to make, refreshing and perfect to sip on during this — finally — summer weather. An excellent choice to stave away cabin fever and pretend you are kicking it on a beach in Cozumel.</p>

<p>Recipe: Mango y Michelada</p>
<p>A salty, sour and sweet twist on the traditional Mexican Michelada</p>
<p>1 oz blanco tequila (preferably Roca Patron Silver) 1 oz mango-infused mango liqueur* (preferably Patron Citronage Mango) 1/2 oz agave 1/2 oz lemon juice 1/2 oz lime juice Mexican lager</p>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a mixing tin and shake hard. Strain into a pint glass and top with your favorite Mexican lager — leave room for ice. Add ice and the booze-soaked mango and peppercorn pieces from the infusion. Smile and enjoy.</p>
<p>*Salty Mango Infused Mango Liqueur Peel one mango — green, sour, slightly unripe mangos work best — and chop it into pieces. In a Mason jar or other non-reactive container, combine the mango pieces, six ounces of mango liqueur, 25 black peppercorns a teaspoon of salt — Tajin works great — and 1/2 ounce each lemon and lime juice. Let the infusion sit for at least one day and up to five days — agitate periodically by shaking jar. Strain, keeping the mangos and peppercorn for later use, then label the infusion and store in the fridge — best if used within one month.</p>
<p>Reason: This is a fun, fresh cocktail perfect for spring. I first discovered this drink while vacationing on the beach of Salinas, Ecuador and it’s been a favorite since.</p>

<p>Recipe: Kiwi-Basil Daiquiri</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz white rum</p>
<p>1 oz fresh lime juice</p>
<p>1/2 oz demerara</p>
<p>Muddle half a kiwi with two basil leaves — rip the basil into pieces if you don’t [want to] muddle. Add rum, demerara and fresh lime juice to a shaker tin with ice and shake vigorously. Strain into a coupe or martini glass. Garnish with a slice of kiwi and a basil leaf.</p>
<p>Reason: When I think of spring, I think of beautiful green grass and flowers blooming. Kiwi is so juicy and delectable and pair that with herbal brilliance of basil, it’s like a match made in heaven. Truly a garden in the glass.</p>

<p>Recipe: “Before You Go Go”</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Bacardi Anejo 1/2 oz Combier Liqueur de Banane 1 oz nitro cold brew 1/2 oz honey syrup (1:1 Colorado local honey to water) 1/2 oz lemon juice 1/2 ripe banana, smashed 5 dashes Fees Brothers Toasted Almond Bitters 1 egg white</p>
<p>Glassware: Coupe Method: wet shake, dry shake. Garnish: Banana chunk dipped in caramelized sugar.</p>
<p>Reason: I wanted to create a riff on the classic Whiskey Sour, something bright and fruit-forward with a creamy texture — due to the banana and egg white. Considering most people are learning a new craft during quarantine, baking being a big one, these ingredients should be readily accessible for any banana bread connoisseur. This classic spin-off “Before You Go Go” can be enjoyed any time of the day but is best served with breakfast. Drink responsibly, video-chat your friends and wash your hands.</p>

<p>Recipe: Bitters End</p>
<p>2 oz Banks 5 Rum 3/4 oz Zucca Rabarbaro amaro 1 dash of black walnut bitters Build into a rocks glass over ice. Garnish with an orange twist.</p>
<p>Reason: The cocktail I chose to share is a take on a Black Manhattan. When I make cocktails at home I typically want something quick and easy that doesn’t require much prep or clean up. So with this drink, I build the cocktail right into the glass. Black Manhattans usually call for whiskey, amaro and bitters. I prefer a blended or aged rum, Zucca Rabarbaro and black walnut bitters. This is my go-to cocktail when I’m hanging out at home or about to go to bed which makes a perfect digestif.</p>

<p>Recipe: Jungle Bird</p>
<p>2 oz El Dorado 5-Year Demerara Rum</p>
<p>3/4 oz Campari</p>
<p>1 oz fresh pineapple juice</p>
<p>1/2 oz fresh lime juice</p>
<p>1/2 oz orgeat (commercial or homemade) splash soda water</p>
<p>Shaken and served over rocks with a splash of soda.</p>
<p>Reason: One of my favorite cocktails by a backyard fire to ring in the spring. Great in the hot summer months as well when pineapples are sweet and readily available. Excellent when paired with coconut rice, jerk chicken and good friends. This tiki classic is a favorite among the uninitiated and pro bartenders alike and not too complex to pull off at home to kill the COVID blues. The El Dorado’s deep and darkly sweet profile really shines in this cocktail providing a solid backbone for it to stand on. Happy summer!</p>

<p>Samuel Magone – Bar Consultant</p>
<p>Location: Boulder</p>
<p>Recipe: Classic Rum Sour</p>
<p>2 oz Ron del Barrilito Two Star 1 egg white 3/4 oz simple syrup 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice 5 dashes habanero shrub</p>
<p>Build: Into a shaker, pour together rum, simple syrup, lemon juice and an egg white. Dry shake for about 10 seconds to emulsify ingredients. Toss in a handful of large ice cubes, and shake even harder for 20 more seconds. Strain into a stemmed glass. Dash a few drops of bitters onto the heavenly bed of foam, and challenge yourself not to guzzle it down</p>
<p>Reason: As winter begins to take its leave, it’s about that time to look for a bit more sunshine in the glass. The Rum Sour is the light, bright libation that hits that mark every time. With a good kick of spirit, the velvet texture of egg white, zippy acidity balanced with a bit of sweet and topped with lifting aromatics, this classic is a timeless hit. I like a tinge of spice in mine, so I use Habanero Shrub Bitters, but Angostura or Orange Bitters are also great substitutes. It’s a perfect refreshment pairing for sunny porch siestas and backyard quarancations. Salud.</p>

<p>Recipe: Nacional con Café</p>
<p>2 oz Bacardi Gold 8 yr Reserva 1 oz Wray and Nephew Rum 3/4 oz Borghetti Espresso Liqueur 1/4 oz Gifford Apricot Liqueur 1 oz pineapple juice 3/4 oz lemon juice</p>
<p>Add all ingredients into a shaker tin, shake vigorously with ice, strain back into the shaker tin, discard ice, shake to aerate and pour into your favorite glass. Add a little decorative bitters if you’d like.</p>
<p>Reason: I’d like to share with you Nacional con Café. This is my riff on a classic called a Hotel Nacional, from the 1935 Waldorf-Astoria bar book. Will P. Taylor, manager of the Hotel Nacional in Havana, came up with his own version of a Daiquiri using — of course — Bacardi, pineapple juice, a squeeze of lemon and a touch of apricot brandy. I have added another ingredient for a bit of a caffeine kick, Borghetti – an Italian espresso liqueur. One ounce has as much caffeine as a shot of espresso. While moving apartments during quarantine, I really craved a tried and true cocktail but also needed the pep to get me through the work ahead. I hope you will enjoy this go-gettin’-big-boi as much as I do.</p>

<p>Recipe: Soul Plane (Paper Plane Riff)</p>
<p>3/4 oz chamomile rye (Old Overholt or Rittenhouse) 3/4 oz Amaro Nonino 3/4 oz honey-infused Aperol 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice</p>
<p>Shaken, then double strained. Orange or lemon peel expression</p>
<p>Chamomile Rye Recipe Add 10-12 tablespoons of chamomile flowers to your preferred bottle of rye. I say the spicier the rye the better. And let that sit for about 24 hours. Then strain and filter. Honey-Infused Aperol Make a 1:1 honey syrup. Then mix with Aperol at a 2:1 ratio of Aperol to syrup. Feel free to adjust the ratio for sweet to bitter.</p>
<p>Reason: I have always loved the simplicity of the Paper Plane build and created this version a couple years ago purely out boredom at home and sifting through stuff I had in my kitchen. This is just a very well balanced and relatively low abv build that utilizes some pretty basic ingredients and creates a light, simple and refreshing yet nuanced cocktail.</p>

<p>Recipe: Wolf’s Mojito</p>
<p>1 oz white rum (currently using Montanya Platino) 1 oz sake (Bushido Way of the Warrior) 1/2 oz lime juice 1/2 oz 1:1 mint simple syrup 1 dash of angostura bitters top with soda water and garnish with fresh mint</p>
<p>Reason: I love this drink because it is simple and classic and reminds me of days on the beach when traveling. The addition of sake brings a whole other layer to the drink without throwing it off balance. It’s important to use fresh mint for the syrup and the garnish, it makes the biggest difference.</p>

<p>Build ingredients in a wine glass over ice. Garnish with an orange wedge, if you have some oranges available.</p>
<p>Reason: This was one of my favorite drinks when I visited Jerez, Spain back in 2017. Sure, at first glance it might just sound like a low-brow Sangria, but this thirst quencher is a total delight. Not to mention it’s great for the budget and you can play around with whatever sodas you already have at home. Bonus, I’ve seen a lot of people Venmo-ing their local bartenders tips for every time they enjoy a beverage at home right now. A great way to take care of those of us that rely on guest tips during a time when we are seeing very steep declines in business.</p>

<p>Recipe: Knuck If You Buck</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Manzanilla Sherry (Lustau or similar) 1/2 oz Calvados (or gin works great too) 1/2 oz Lemon Juice 1/4 oz simple syrup 3 oz Ginger Beer (Fever Tree or something similar) 6 dashes Angostura Bitters (or Absinthe if you want to get freaky) If you have a shaker tin at home, great. If not, no worries – just grab a glass and add all ingredients together and get to business. If shaking, add all ingredients to the tin minus ginger beer. Give a good shake — depending on the quality of ice — and strain into a highball or your favorite glass that can hold some ice. Add ginger beer and fill with ice. Garnish with any number of awesomeness — mint, lemon peel, more bitters — all the above.</p>
<p>Reason: A classic from the Rino Yacht Club days and one I love to knock back if I want something that feels like a fancy cocktail but in actuality is just a spruced up mule of sorts. It’s easy to make and even easier to drink. This low ABV drink has depth, spice, bubbly lift and is the party you’ll be looking for once you’re holed up waiting on things to calm down out in the world.</p>

<p>Location: Japango is located at 1136 Pearl St., Boulder. It is open for takeout every day 11:30 a.m. – 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Recipe: Apparent Sour</p>
<p>Procure:</p>
<p>2 oz Aperol</p>
<p>1 oz St. Germaine</p>
<p>1 oz fresh lime juice</p>
<p>Combine and shake with ice for 8-12 seconds. Serve up. Consume quickly and often.</p>
<p>Reason: Taxonomically, it’s a modified Aperol Sour. You can call it whatever, it’s delicious. It’s a low ABV cocktail, so you can drink many while keeping your wits about you. I often switch the lime juice out for lemon juice or use half of each. I picked this drink for its session-ability. It’s aromatic, crisp, full of flavor and doesn’t become cloying as you repeatedly imbibe. It would appeal to lovers of the Aperol Spritz, as well as anyone who isn’t stupid.</p>

<p>Recipe: Pimm’s Cup</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Pimm’s No. 1 Cup</p>
<p>1/2 oz freshly squeezed lemon juice</p>
<p>1/2 oz simple syrup</p>
<p>2 cucumbers wheels cut 1/4 inch thick</p>
<p>2 oz your favorite ginger beer (we use Fever Tree)</p>
<p>Add all ingredients except ginger beer into a shaker and give the cucumber a good muddle. Put some ice in there and shake it up good. Finely strain your drink into a Collins-type glass filled with ice and top with ginger beer. Garnish with a cucumber wheel speared with a blackberry and mint bouquet. You could really garnish this with any fruit you have. Get creative and create a beautiful arrangement.</p>
<p>Glassware: Collins</p>
<p>Garnish: Cucumber wheel, blackberry and mint bouquet.</p>
<p>Reason: With spring is in the air and the lilies rising from their sleep, the days are getting warmer and sitting on the patio near the garden is just about the best place to be right now. This is the ideal warm-weather drink and the freshness of the cucumber, lemon and sharp ginger add to the gorgeous botanical notes of the Pimm’s No.1 Cup. Plus, the low alcohol content makes it an ideal drink for any time of the day.</p>
<p>In Britain where this originated, they prefer using lemonade — which is very similar to what we know as Sprite — and strawberries instead of the American-preferred, ginger beer and cucumber. Why not try both? You could also try topping it with your favorite soda or even your favorite sparkling water flavor. This easy to make drink is fun to experiment with and try new combinations — go ahead, get creative and mix it up.</p>

<p>Recipe: Spiced Cranberry and Orange Gluhwein (Mulled Wine)</p>
<p>1 bottle of red wine (cheap is totally fine)</p>
<p>1 cup orange juice (use fresh if you have it)</p>
<p>1 cup of cranberries (if you don’t have fresh, frozen or dried is fine, just add 1/2 cup more)</p>
<p>1/2 cup sugar or preferred sweetener</p>
<p>1 orange studded with cloves 2-3 cinnamon sticks depending on size 1-star anise clove 1 allspice berry (optional) 1-2 green cardamom pods (optional) Give it a kick! (optional) 1/2 cup of brandy 2 oz orange liqueur</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prepare all ingredients above as well as gather a large saucepan or pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take the orange that you studded and slice it into about 6 round slices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add all ingredients to the pot and gently stir to ensure mixing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat over low heat for 2-3 hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a small strainer to remove the spices, the fruit can stay and be used as delicious garnishes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave on the stove on the warming setting and serve until gone!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Reason: As most of us are starting to go a bit stir-crazy, I decided to choose a drink that made me think of the comfort and safety of home. My mom would always make this when we had family game nights or just had a nice night in by the fire. As most of us find ourselves away from family during all of this I thought a bit of home would do us all good. The aroma of the spiced wine filling your home will make anyone feel relaxed and comfortable and after a few glasses, you will find nothing but warmth and tranquility in whatever you are doing.</p>

<p>Recipe: Ramona Flowers</p>
<p>1 1/2 oz Junmai sake 1/2 oz lime juice 1/2 oz simple syrup 1/4 oz Leopold Bros Tart Cherry Liqueur 1/4 oz Leopold Bros Navy Strength Gin</p>
<p>In a shaker tin, add all ingredients and shake for a short time as this drink does not need a ton of dilution. Strain into a champagne flute and garnish with your choice of an edible flower.</p>
<p>Reason: The drink was originally force-carbonated but this is not necessary, as it is tasty either way. This seems to be the cocktail I come back to the most, it’s definitely the one that I recommend frequently when people ask me what to make at home. This is the first cocktail I ever created when I started working at Williams and Graham — six years ago — with the help of my two most predominant mentors Allison Widdecombe and Christina Andrews. I was having a hard time coming up with something for the spring menu when Christina asked me what I think about when I think “spring.” My immediate answer was cherry blossoms and we started throwing around ingredients and ideas that would make a cherry blossom drink. Allison helped me to balance the drink as I still had no idea what the heck I was doing.</p>
<p>It’s a simple, refreshing cocktail that I would hope makes you feel like you are sipping an exotic Japanese sake underneath a blooming cherry blossom in the full swing of spring.</p>
