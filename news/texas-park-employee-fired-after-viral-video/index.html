<p>The officers involved in the incident have not been identified, but Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) announced Tuesday afternoon that they had been terminated.</p>
<p>“It is the right decision for our city, the right decision for our community. It is the right decision for the Minneapolis Police Department,” Frey said at a news conference with Police Chief Medaria Arradondo. “We’ve stated our values, and ultimately we need to live by them.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Police Department originally said that Floyd, who was stopped Monday night on a report of a forgery, had “physically resisted officers.” But in a Tuesday interview with local outlet North News, Frey said that as additional information was revealed, “it became clear that the original statement was not accurate.”</p>
<p>Arradondo said during the news conference that he had decided to ask the FBI to investigate after receiving “additional information” about the incident from a community source, but he declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Calling in the FBI was “the very clear and obvious choice when you watch the footage provided in the civilian video,” Frey said in the North News interview.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“For five minutes we watched as a white officer pressed his knee into the neck of a black man who was helpless,” the mayor said. “For five whole minutes. This was not a matter of a split-second poor decision.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The quick dismissals of the officers contrast with several previous high-profile incidents, including the 2014 death of Eric Garner in New York. After other deadly encounters between civilians and police, officers involved have often retained their jobs for a time — including the police officer recorded with his arm around Garner’s neck, who was fired five years later.</p>
<p>Minneapolis-area law enforcement has faced criticism in recent years over its use of force. In a 2016 incident that drew widespread condemnation, an officer with the suburban St. Anthony Police Department shot and killed 32-year-old Philando Castile during a traffic stop, the aftermath of which was streamed live on Facebook.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And in 2017, a Minneapolis police officer fatally shot 40-year-old Justine Damond after she called 911 to report a possible assault near her house. Damond’s death followed the acquittal of the officer who killed Castile, exacerbating the already tense relations between law enforcement and the community.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Floyd’s death came amid a national conversation about the rush to judgment of unarmed black men, both by police and civilians. Earlier this month, authorities in Georgia arrested two white men after one shot and killed a black jogger, Ahmaud Arbery, telling police they believed he was involved in local burglaries. A prosecutor initially argued the actions of the men, father and son Gregory McMichael and Travis McMichael, were in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>And Tuesday, social media was largely consumed with the story of a white woman, Amy Cooper, who called 911 on a black birdwatcher who told her to leash her dog in New York’s Central Park, telling a dispatcher that he had threatened her life.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Two Minneapolis police officers approached a parked vehicle in the 3700 block of Chicago Avenue South around 8 p.m. on Monday, according to security footage reviewed by The Washington Post. After a brief struggle with the driver, who appeared to be Floyd, they placed him in handcuffs and sat him against the wall of the Dragon Wok restaurant.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Dragon Wok owner Rashad West provided The Post with nearly two hours of footage of the incident.</p>
<p>Before police arrived, three people were seen in the footage walking out of the nearby Cup Foods convenience store, and one spoke with the people in the vehicle.</p>
<p>Billy Abumayyaleh, whose teenage son works at the market, told The Post that his son “confronted the man about a fake $20 bill” before police were contacted. Abumayyaleh said his son tried to intervene when the officer put his knee on Floyd’s neck but was stopped by another officer, who pushed him away.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Darnella Frazier, who filmed the police encounter with Floyd, was on her way to see friends when she saw the incident unfolding outside the Cup Foods market. She quickly began recording the encounter in a 10-minute video later shared to Facebook.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“When I walked up, he was already on the ground,” Frazier said in a different Facebook video. “The cops … they was pinning him down by his neck and he was crying. … They wasn’t trying to take him serious.”</p>
<p>As more people gathered around the encounter, the man pleaded that his whole body was in pain. Frazier recalled that his face was being pressed so hard against the ground that his nose was bleeding.</p>
<p>“You’re going to just sit there with your knee on his neck?” one bystander said on the video.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Minutes later, the man appeared to be motionless on the ground, his eyes closed and head lying against the road.</p>
<p>“Bro, he’s not even f&mdash;&mdash; moving!” one bystander pleaded to police. “Get off of his neck!”</p>
<p>Another asked, “Did you kill him?”</p>
<p>Later, the unconscious man was loaded onto a stretcher and into an ambulance. Bystanders who remained in front of Cup Foods pointed at the two officers and said the incident would haunt them “for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“The police killed him, bro, right in front of everybody,” Frazier said on Facebook. “… He was crying, telling them like, ‘I can’t breathe,’ and everything. … They killed this man.”</p>
<p>The case will be separately investigated by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, investigates most in-custody deaths.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The agency said in a statement that it would present its findings to the county prosecutor’s office for review.</p>
<p>As it circulated late into the day Tuesday, the video continued to draw denunciations. In neighboring St. Paul, Mayor Melvin Carter (D) said on Twitter that it was “one of the most vile and heartbreaking images I’ve ever seen,” adding, “This must stop now.”</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D) described the incident as “yet another horrifying and gut-wrenching instance of an African American man dying.” She called for “immediate action,” including a thorough outside investigation and accountability for those involved.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Justice must be served for this man and his family, justice must be served for our community, and justice must be served for our country,” she said in a statement shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Floyd was a father and a security guard who worked at Conga Latin Bistro and had previously lived in Texas, said Jovanni Thunstrom, the restaurant’s owner. He described Floyd as the kind of employee who would go out of his way to help a customer, offering a safe ride home to those who had too much to drink and once helping a woman who locked her keys in her car.</p>
<p>“When I heard the news, I saw the video, I couldn’t believe it was him,” Thunstrom told The Post, calling Floyd a “brother” and a friend. “He was a great person, a great worker. I’m going to miss him.”</p>
<p>Thunstrom said he could not understand the officers’ treatment of Floyd.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“They are supposed to serve and protect, but Floyd didn’t get either,” he said. “He didn’t get served or protected. He got choked.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of people gathered along Chicago Avenue on Tuesday night, standing in the rain for hours at the spot where Floyd had his fatal altercation with police. They waved signs reading “Abolish the Police” and “I Can’t Breathe.” “Say his name,” they chanted again and again. “George Floyd.”</p>
<p>A large crowd marched to the city’s 3rd Precinct police headquarters, where some protesters clashed with police clad in riot gear. Tear gas was fired to disperse the crowd, according to the Star Tribune.</p>
<p>Adding to the tensions were concerns about the novel coronavirus. With cases on the rise, Minneapolis remains under a safer-at-home order, but city officials said Tuesday they would not try to stop protesters from gathering to speak out and express their anger at Floyd’s death.</p>
<p>At the protest, many wore masks — many distributed by organizers who sought to keep the crowd safe — but there was little effort made to socially distance.</p>
<p>“It’s scary to come down here in the middle of the pandemic, but how could I stay away? How could any of us stay away?” said Anita Murray, who visited the scene with her 6-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Murray, who is a Mexican American, said she felt it was important to bring her daughter to the scene as a lesson about “unfairness in the world.”</p>
<p>“She’s little, but I hope she remembers this,” she said. “Hopefully, she will remember this as a turning point for good.”</p>
<p>Holly Bailey and Jared Goyette in Minneapolis and Julie Tate and Mark Berman in Washington contributed to this report.

<h3 id="white-woman-who-called-police-on-a-black-man-bird-watching-in-central-park-has-been-fired">&ldquo;White woman who called police on a black man bird-watching in Central Park has been fired&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200526102231-02-central-park-video-dog-video-african-american-trnd-screengrab-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) The white woman who called police on a black man in Central Park during an encounter involving her unleashed dog has been fired from her job, her employer said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following our internal review of the incident in Central Park yesterday, we have made the decision to terminate the employee involved, effective immediately. We do not tolerate racism of any kind at Franklin Templeton,&rdquo; the company said on Twitter</p>
<p>Amy Cooper was walking her dog Monday morning while Christian Cooper (no relation) was bird-watching at a wooded area of Central Park called the Ramble . They both told CNN their dispute began because her dog was not on a leash, contrary to the Ramble&rsquo;s rules, according to the park&rsquo;s website</p>
<p>Christian Cooper recorded video of part of their encounter and posted it on Facebook , where it has since been shared thousands of times and became a trending topic on Twitter. In the video, he is largely silent while she frantically tells police he is threatening her and her dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking a picture and calling the cops,&rdquo; Amy Cooper is heard saying in the video. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell them there&rsquo;s an African American man threatening my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In comments to CNN as the video spread widely, Amy Cooper said she wanted to &ldquo;publicly apologize to everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a racist. I did not mean to harm that man in any way,&rdquo; she said, adding that she also didn&rsquo;t mean any harm to the African American community.</p>
<p>The New York Police Department told CNN when officers responded neither Christian Cooper nor Amy Cooper was present. No arrests or summonses were made, according to NYPD.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I videotaped it because I thought it was important to document things,&rdquo; Christian Cooper said. &ldquo;Unfortunately we live in an era with things like Ahmaud Arbery , where black men are seen as targets. This woman thought she could exploit that to her advantage, and I wasn&rsquo;t having it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What led up to the video</p>
<p>Christian Cooper, who described himself as an avid bird-watcher, was out birding between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m. Monday in the Ramble, a section of Central Park full of winding paths and thick greenery that attracts over 230 bird species</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when he says he saw a dog off its leash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s important to us birders because we know that dogs won&rsquo;t be off leash at all and we can go there to see the ground-dwelling birds,&rdquo; Christian Cooper said. &ldquo;People spend a lot of money and time planting in those areas as well. Nothing grows in a dog run for a reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy Cooper told CNN she was walking her unleashed dog, knowing that it was against the rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was running in an open field. This man, he was bird-watching. He came out of the bush,&rdquo; she said, adding that Christian Cooper was screaming at her.</p>
<p>Christian Cooper said the dog was &ldquo;tearing through the plantings,&rdquo; and he told Amy Cooper the dog needed to be on a leash. He said he was not screaming at Amy Cooper, and &ldquo;was actually pretty calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two went back-and-forth about the dog leash. Christian Cooper, according to his Facebook post, then told her: &ldquo;Look, if you&rsquo;re going to do what you want, I&rsquo;m going to do what I want, but you&rsquo;re not going to like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what that meant. When you&rsquo;re alone in a wooded area, that&rsquo;s absolutely terrifying, right?&rdquo; Amy Cooper said.</p>
<p>Christian Cooper said he then pulled out dog treats. He told CNN he keeps dog treats with him to get dog owners to put their dogs on leashes because, in his experience, dog owners hate when a stranger feeds their dog treats and immediately restrain their dogs afterward.</p>
<p>Amy Cooper said he was throwing them at her dog. Christian Cooper said he never threw any treats.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s when he started recording the incident, he said on Facebook.</p>
<p>What happened in the video</p>
<p>The video begins with Amy Cooper pulling her dog by the collar and telling Christian Cooper to stop recording.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t come close to me,&rdquo; Christian Cooper says, as she approaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I&rsquo;m asking you to stop recording me,&rdquo; Amy Cooper says.</p>
<p>He asks her again not to come close. That&rsquo;s when Amy Cooper says she&rsquo;s going to call the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell them there&rsquo;s an African American man threatening my life,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell them whatever you like,&rdquo; Christian Cooper says.</p>
<p>The video shows Amy Cooper on her phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man, African American, he has a bicycle helmet,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;He is recording me and threatening me and my dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While she&rsquo;s on the phone, her dog appears to be straining and trying to get free while she tries to restrain it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m being threatened by a man in the Ramble,&rdquo; she continues in an audibly distraught voice . &ldquo;Please send the cops immediately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The video ends with Christian Cooper saying &ldquo;Thank You.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aftermath</p>
<p>Amy Cooper told CNN that since the video was posted, her &ldquo;entire life is being destroyed right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I was just scared,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re alone in the Ramble, you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening. It&rsquo;s not excusable, it&rsquo;s not defensible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was placed on administrative leave and fired by her employer on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Asked if he&rsquo;d accept her apology, Christian Cooper told CNN he would &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s genuine and if she plans on keeping her dog on a leash in the Ramble going forward, then we have no issues with each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The National Audubon Society, the country&rsquo;s leading bird conservation organization, said they were grateful that Christian Cooper, a board member of the New York City Audubon Society, is safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Americans often face terrible daily dangers in outdoor spaces, where they are subjected to unwarranted suspicion, confrontation, and violence,&rdquo; said Rebeccah Sanders, Audubon senior vice president for state programs. &ldquo;The outdoors &ndash; and the joy of birds &ndash; should be safe and welcoming for all people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy Cooper&rsquo;s dog has been surrendered to the shelter he was adopted from years earlier while the dispute is addressed, according to a Facebook post from Abandoned Angels Cocker Spaniel Rescue Inc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dog is now in our rescue&rsquo;s care and he is safe and in good health,&rdquo; the post said.</p>
<p>Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when Amy Cooper adopted her dog. The dog was adopted a few years ago from Abandoned Angels Cocker Spaniel Rescue Inc.

As the number of times police have used tear gas, batons and pepper spray during the nationwide protests over George Floyd’s death flashed across the screen, John Oliver reflected on how such incidents have long been present in American culture.</p>
<p>“It didn’t start this week or with this president,” he said on his Sunday-night show. “It always disproportionately falls on black communities.”</p>
<p>To mark the two weeks that have passed since Floyd’s death in Minneapolis, Oliver spent the entirety of “Last Week Tonight” unpacking the history of the systemic racism in policing that has some critics pushing to defund police departments.</p>
<p>“This clearly isn’t about individual officers,” he said. “It’s about a structure built on systemic racism that this country created intentionally and now needs to dismantle intentionally and replace with one that takes into account the needs of the people that it actually serves.”</p>
<p>Oliver, who also slammed President Trump for invoking Floyd’s name when announcing the job numbers on Friday, noted that while images of police officers kneeling in solidarity with the protesters was a start, much more change was needed.</p>
<p>“We need so much more than that because ours is a firmly entrenched system in which the roots of white supremacy run deep, and it is critical that we all grab a f&mdash;&mdash; shovel,” he said. “To do anything less would be absolutely unforgivable.”</p>
<p>He ended the show playing a clip of author Kimberly Jones talking about the protests.</p>
<p>“There’s a social contract that we all have that if you steal or if I steal, then the person who is the authority, they come in and fix the situation. But the person who fixes the situation is killing us,” she said. “So the social contract is broken.”</p>
<p>She added, “You broke the contract when you killed us in the streets and didn’t give a f&mdash;.”

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EW2WO4VDCEI6VPQGV5KRJ3QDQU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
BROOKLYN — The downtown area of this New York City borough looked like it was under martial law as Saturday night turned into Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Dozens of police vehicles screamed to a halt in front of a McDonald’s near the DeKalb subway stop, as what appeared to be at least a hundred officers with plastic shields pushed back on crowds shouting “George Floyd,” and “Eric Garner,” two African Americans killed by police. “Go home!” officers shouted back, waving batons.</p>
<p>A pile of trash burned on the asphalt. Cars honked their horns. Sirens blazed. Fire trucks rushed to the scene. Multiple times, police pushback caused a stampede — sometimes prompted by glass bottles thrown at officers from the crowd, sometimes seemingly prompted by nothing at all.</p>
<p>One woman who said she was a medic rushed forward to help a man bleeding from his forehead. Seconds later, she ran the opposite direction, clutching her eyes, saying she’d been pepper sprayed and asking for someone, anyone to grab saline solution from her bag.</p>
<p>“At nighttime they get real dirty. They want you to go home and they become very, very aggressive,” said protester Derek Rutledge, 53, an unemployed accountant born and raised in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
<p>He’d arrived by bicycle for a way to escape if things got hairy and said this was his second night protesting. “There are good cops and there’s a whole bunch of dirty cops. If I was a cop and I saw somebody killing somebody for $20, I’d say, ‘Dude, get off of him!’ There’s no need.”</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the police said that they’d made more than 300 arrests during the overnight protests in New York. At least 30 officers were injured and nearly 50 police vehicles were damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p>“I’m extremely proud of the way you’ve comported yourselves in the face of such persistent danger, disrespect, and denigration,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea wrote to the NYPD force on Twitter. Shea noted that the spams of violence in the city were driven by “a mob bent solely on taking advantage of a moment in American history, to co-opt the cause of equality that we all must uphold, to intentionally inflict chaos, mayhem, and injury just for the sake of doing so.”</p>
<p>All along Brooklyn’s Atlantic Avenue thoroughfare were shattered windows and piles of glass, at a TD bank, a Men’s Wearhouse, and the downtown Brooklyn Apple Store, where a single panel of the store’s tempered glass facade had cracked but was not broken.</p>
<p>Photographer Flo Ngala, 25, came from Harlem and was wearing a Martin Luther King Jr. T-shirt. She carried a sign reading, “Can’t breathe with a mask on. Can’t breathe without one.” Most of the day, she said, had been inspiring, with crowds cheering protesters on from cars and balconies. Two little black boys had marched with them, one with a sign that read “Stop killing us.” Ngala stopped talking mid-sentence, as batons and plastic shields came into view, and ran.</p>
<p>Among the bystanders caught up in the melee were a few people exiting the subway and a homeless woman pushing a shopping cart filled with her belongings. She leaned over and let out a hacking cough. A protester with his mask around his chin stood in the sidewalk, directing the traffic of fleeing protesters around her. “Yo brother, run that way,” he said. “Coronavirus is real.”</p>
<p>Around a corner, a 26-year-old black woman slumped on the sidewalk surrounded by five other protesters, all of them people of color who said they came from the city. They’d been strangers to her until moments earlier, when, they said, she’d gotten pepper sprayed. The woman’s face was caked with salt and milk from a solution the other protesters poured into her eyes to stop the burning.</p>
<p>Even when the stinging stopped, she cried. “They’re just good people who saw me in pain,” she said of her new protest friends. “I’m moved to tears by the kindness.”</p>
<p>A special education teacher from Brooklyn, the woman said she’d previously been arrested when an ex-boyfriend beat her and she physically defended herself. “I want to believe in them so badly. I want to believe that they’re good,” she said of police, but that was hard when she’d spent five hours in the same station as her ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>She burst into tears explaining that she’d come out to protest, despite her fears of the police and the pandemic, because she felt like she’d be letting her students down if she didn’t.</p>
<p>The woman works in a poor school district with mostly children of color. “And they tell me, ‘I want to be an astronaut. I want to become a pilot,’” she said.

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AFI7JNFHZII6VCMOWINZVA7XSI.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
CHICAGO — Tens of thousands filled the streets as a march that started in the Fulton Market area lasted nearly two hours and stretched for at least a mile. Police estimated the crowd at more than 30,000 and said Saturday afternoon there had been no arrests.</p>
<p>It was the biggest organized march here since the past Saturday when a march against the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis turned into a riot and subsequent looting that lasted for days.</p>
<p>The path of the march, titled “the Chicago March For Justice,” was kept secret. Hundreds of police officers accompanied the marchers; the greatest presence was around the 18th District police station. There, barricades and police on horses and in large groups created a protective perimeter.</p>
<p>An organizer, who did not give his name, told the crowd that they requested the police not wear riot gear, have a limited presence in Union Park and not obstruct marchers.</p>
<p>“I just want to say they complied with all of those demands,” he said. “So what we know it is possible for them to honor their word. It is possible for them to be peaceful. Keep that in mind. Because if they meet our demands today, they will meet our demands a year from now and forever in the future.”</p>
<p>A police lieutenant who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record, said the protesters “already lied” to them by saying they would head in one direction when they did not. “Like herding cattle,” he said. No permits were given for the march.</p>
<p>For Jessica Cruz, 29, it was the first march she has attended. “I want to be part of change,” she said. “I was raised to believe everyone is equal, and I want the government to see that too.”</p>
<p>A resident of the Back of the Yards neighborhood on the South Side, she brought her 4-year-old daughter, who is of mixed race, she said. “I needed her to see that her life matters, too,” she said.</p>
<p>In Union Park, speakers said the names of the many unarmed black people killed by police in past years, including Laquan McDonald, the Chicago teenager killed in 2014. “Sixteen shots!” the crowd repeated, evoking the number of bullets fired into his body by a lone police officer who today is in federal prison.

<h3 id="nation-braces-for-outpouring-of-protests-saturday-as-clashes-with-police-largely-ebb">&ldquo;Nation braces for outpouring of protests Saturday as clashes with police largely ebb&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L6EAZ7FHPMI6VCMOWINZVA7XSI.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
One Facebook post falsely claimed that George Floyd’s death was a “staged event,” meant to rile up opposition to President Trump. Another showed a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. juxtaposed on a banana — an established racist trope.</p>
<p>And a third claimed that George Soros, the liberal billionaire, paid “white cops to murder black people” and that “black people to riot because race wars keep the sheep in line.”</p>
<p>All of the posts were shared in recent days by Republican county leaders in Texas, who are now facing calls to resign from top state officials within their party, the Texas Tribune reported.</p>
<p>“I have said it before and I will say it again now: the GOP must not tolerate racism. Of any kind. At any time,” George P. Bush, the state’s land commissioner, wrote on Twitter late Thursday. “I urge them to do the honorable thing and step aside now.”</p>
<p>The earliest, loudest and most damning condemnations were directed at the two GOP party chairs who shared a Facebook post floating a conspiracy theory about Floyd’s death.</p>
<p>Cynthia Brehm, the Bexar County chair, wrote on Facebook that Floyd’s death could have been a “filmed public execution” with “the purpose of creating racial tensions.”</p>
<p>Nueces County chair Jim Kaelin then posted the same text, calling it an “interesting perspective.”</p>
<p>Their posts drew immediate calls to resign from top Texas Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, who called the posts “disgusting,” and Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn.</p>
<p>“Spreading conspiracy theories that the murder was staged simply defies reality; it is irresponsible,” a spokesman for Abbott said in a statement to the Tribune.</p>
<p>Brehm, however, told Spectrum News San Antonio that she would not resign.</p>
<p>Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) and Rep. Michael McCaul (R-Texas) both called for the resignation of Keith Nielsen, the GOP chairman-elect in Harris County, who earlier this week had posted the image of the MLK quote and the banana, according to the Tribune.</p>
<p>“The Facebook post made by the Harris County GOP Chair-elect was racist and unacceptable,” McCaul tweeted. “Racism has no place in the Republican Party, the state of Texas or the United States of America.”
