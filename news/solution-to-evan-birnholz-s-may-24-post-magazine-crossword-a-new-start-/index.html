<p>It turns out that GEOCENTRIC and OPENS are the correct words for those clues, but the first letters of the twelve answers have shifted over to the right, with the parenthetical number indicating how many spaces those letters moved forward.</p>
<p>The shifted first letters, in order, spell out the revealer at 108A: [From this point on … and a phrase that explains (and is spelled out by) the 12 shifted first letters in this puzzle] which is GOING FORWARD .</p>
<p>The issue of this weekend’s Magazine is “America, Resilient,” with stories about hope and community during the pandemic. So, this was my take on the concept. Of course, I originally tried to spell out MOVING FORWARD, but I didn’t find many good options for a word beginning with V that could move three spaces forward and make a new legitimate word. In fact, limiting myself to words that could move the first letter X number of spaces based on their positions in GOING and FORWARD was a much bigger constrain than I had realized. That’s why I went with SPIREAS and ONE-TIMED; there simply were no other options for that D to move seven spaces to the right.

FRIDAY PUZZLE — At a time when the world is upside down and people are struggling, I think it is especially important to look around for good, positive things that are being done and blessings that can be counted, no matter how small they are. Sometimes, internalizing the good things is what keeps us going.</p>
<p>I’ve found that there are many such things — a heartfelt “thank you,” for instance, to all of the people on the front lines of the pandemic, who are showing us all what dedication and bravery truly are — but within the scope of this column, it’s the little kindnesses that count.</p>
<p>Today is Sam Ezersky’s birthday and, according to tradition, we should be giving him gifts. But Mr. Ezersky, who is associate puzzles editor for The Times and the editor of some of our other games, like Spelling Bee and Letter Boxed, gives us a gift today: a challenging and well-made puzzle that includes a fun Easter egg at the very end at 52D, which Mr. Ezersky confesses is a coincidence, but I don’t believe him.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Ezersky, and you shouldn’t have. But it’s just what we wanted.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>1A. I wanted TRENDING for this one, because that is what users see most often on Twitter on top hashtags. There is a category called TRENDS, which groups the “trending” hashtags, though.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s grid is a surprise and a delight, the type that makes me want to grab any poor solver I see on the street and explain every loving dimension. Andrew Chaikin, who also goes by Kid Beyond, is a San Francisco-based musician and game inventor, a constructor of pleasurable mind-benders for us and elsewhere (please read his notes and check out Puzzle Bouquet as well; he’s also philanthropic).</p>
<p>This grid smashes its black-and-white, two-dimensional constraints in so many ways, but if you think about puzzles, they’re really all mysteries that we unravel; solvers of crosswords, solvers of capers. What a lark.</p>
<p>If you’re not solving this on paper or haven’t looked at the online puzzle notes and read the preamble to “The Mystery of McGuffin Manor,” here it is:</p>
<p>This crossword contains a whodunit: “Thank you for coming, Inspector,” said Lady McGuffin. “The famed McGuffin Diamond has been stolen from my study! The eight members of the staff had a costume party tonight — it has to be one of them: the butler, driver, cook, baker, page, porter, barber or carpenter. They have all been confined to their respective rooms surrounding the parlor, as shown here [center of the grid].” Can you determine who stole the diamond … and where it is now?</p>
<p>Note: If you’re solving this in the magazine, there’s an additional mystery in the southeast corner — 92 is repeated in the grid, so read that second 92 as 93, 93 as 94, and 94 as 95. This was unintentional, and more of a red herring.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>There’s a ton of theme today, all of it blindly clued — there’s just no way you got started on this mystery without a bunch of crosses. That doesn’t mean that Mr. Chaikin gave us a pass, however; he is a robust cluer and I found myself smiling at fill like ARK, EVER, NO FUN (as if!), BEERS and others — loved the juxtaposition of WRINGER and DRYMOPS. I was edified by TAMPA and mystified by SOPH, as clued.

Joana Cabrera, who is 24 and came from the Philippines at age 9, said, “I’m actually still shaking.” Cabrera added, “I’m unbelievably happy, because I was expecting the worst.”</p>
<p>The decision was the second this week in which at least one conservative justice — Chief Justice John Roberts, in this case — joined the court’s four liberal members to issue a left-leaning ruling. Immigration is proving to be one of the issues (along with L.G.B.T.Q. rights) on which the court is not reliably conservative. Last year, a majority effectively blocked the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship status to the 2020 census.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s decision was a narrow one, holding that the administration did not follow the proper procedures for terminating President Barack Obama’s policy, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, of allowing Dreamers to stay. Trump quickly suggested that he still planned to end the policy.</p>
<p>But, as The Times’s Miriam Jordan told us, “There’s nothing the Trump administration could do fast enough to get rid of the program before the election.”</p>
<p>Many Republicans may be quite happy about that, anyway. “Polls show extraordinarily broad support for giving legal status to the Dreamers,” said Julie Davis, a Times editor who’s written a book about Trump’s immigration policy with her colleague Michael Shear, “and being on the wrong side of that issue is the last place Republicans want to be five months before an election.”

<p>&ldquo;It was a big day for John Elway on Januy 25th 1998. But it wan&rsquo;t a good day on the other 4 Super Bowls that thay didn’t win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so began the first &ldquo;game story&rdquo; of my sports journalism career: A recap of the Denver Broncos&rsquo; 31-24 win over the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. I was 6 years old &ndash; and clearly not yet ready to let Elway off the hook. I loved everything about sports, and especially NFL football, long before that game. But Super Bowl XXXII took it to another level. It was the most memorable sporting event of my childhood, even though I don&rsquo;t exactly remember watching it live. I mostly just remember the feeling of it.</p>

<p>It would be near impossible to be a kid in 1960&rsquo;s suburban Boston and not grow up with an obsession for the Red Sox, Celtics, Patriots or Boston Bruins. Decades later, getting the crossword puzzle clue &lsquo;Hockey Great Bobby ___&rsquo; correct evokes a poignant knowing for me.</p>
<p>Yet, my devotion for sports came at Quincy (MA) High School football games as a 9-year old, where my brother played the clarinet in the marching band. Mom would dress me up in a long blue and white stocking cap with a pom at the end. I would cheer with the cheerleaders and wanted so urgently to have crepe pom poms that my Mother made me some.</p>
<p>As I followed in my brother&rsquo;s footsteps, playing for my high school band, our song &lsquo;Anchors Aweigh&rsquo; never did cut it like QHS&rsquo;s &ldquo;March Down the Field To the Music&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not one to live in the past. Life and time marches on. But like the revolving crisp fall New England weather signaling football season, memories can&rsquo;t be robbed from our playbooks. They&rsquo;re as irreplaceable as home made pom poms and blue and white long stocking caps with a pom at the end.</p>

<p>I learned a lot about my dad from watching Michael Jordan win championships for the Chicago Bulls. To me, my dad had a similar mindset to Jordan and a thirst to prove anyone who doubted him wrong. Dad told me he had been an &ldquo;average&rdquo; hoops player in high school. But then I attended a basketball camp at my dad&rsquo;s old high school &ndash; and saw something that changed everything. That&rsquo;s when I learned about &lsquo;Free-Throw Tom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I grew up in New Jersey, the daughter of a lifelong Cleveland Browns fan. In the heart of New York Giants country, my dad, David Rosenberg, rooted for a team that had never even made it to the Super Bowl. But his dedication and devotion to his team was infectious, and I found myself rooting for the Orange and Brown, too. My love of my team keeps me close to my dad and every time I go to a game, I wear one of his old hats or jerseys so he is there with me.</p>

<p>For a tween in the early ‘80s, no team could fill up a living room like the Georgetown Hoyas. Not that I was a fan, per se. Already a man of the people, my collegiate rooting interests favored public schools like Cal and UCLA, an ideal winter evening spent with Kevin Johnson running the point and Barry Tompkins on the mic. Yet this emerging beast called the Big East Conference was impossible to ignore. And with every passing year, the myths and realities of Georgetown basketball only grew. “Hoya Paranoia,” as it was known. In 1985, the Hoyas faced off with conference rival Villanova for the national title. What unfolded next remains the greatest upset in college basketball history, 16-over-1 be damned, simply because of what was required to pull it off. A perfect game.</p>

<p>I grew up as a Jewish boy in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles and my four years of Little League were 1963-1966. Of those years, the Dodgers were in the World Series in three of them and won the championship twice. Also, the best pitcher on the planet was Sandy Koufax and he was also Jewish and lived near my neighborhood so I had an idol + local MLB team + world championships + Little League = WHY I LOVE SPORTS!</p>
<p>-Ross Miller, Los Angeles</p>

<p>I never planned to go to college. Sports gave me the opportunity and I seized it. My grades were not good in high school. ACT score was terrible. Too hyper. I guess they call it ADD now. Never applied to college and was working in a metal fabrication plant welding and burning beams for new construction in summer of 1981. While playing summer baseball after barely completing high school, a competitor&rsquo;s parent asked me where I was going to college. I said I am not going. He said, &ldquo;You have some of the most talent around here. My son is going to a JUCO in Florida so tell your mom to call me.&rdquo; That call led to a JUCO and ultimately to a College World Series title. All heart, buddy. Like sports, give it your all and you can overcome adversity. That&rsquo;s why I like (any) sports every day and that&rsquo;s my story.</p>
<p>-Rick Kosek, Atlanta</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t fall in love with sports because of a specific game or player or team. I fell in love with them because of the guy who got me hooked. As far back as I can remember, I watched Packers games with my Dad, Mickey. Every Sunday, without fail. My Dad would stretch out on the living room or basement floor in front of the TV and I&rsquo;d flop down beside him. The team was godawful when I was a kid, with losing records in eight out of 10 seasons at one point, but still we watched. It&rsquo;s those Packers games that turned me into who I am and for that I have my Dad to thank.</p>

<p>I was a teenager growing up in little old Clemson, selling hot dogs in the stadium, when they won the championship in 1981. After decades of frustration, including my son asking, “Dad, why did you raise me to be a Clemson fan?” there was (Deshawn) Watson to (Tyler) Renfrow, and I wept.</p>

<p>Imagine a child, a young sports fan, living so near a college campus that she could see the glow of the football stadium lights from her front yard. Imagine her walking to the football stadium with her dad, cheering for the team playing in that stadium for three consecutive years, and never once leaving disappointed. That team, her team, never lost a game for three straight years. You&rsquo;re a young fan, and you throw your heart and soul into a team, and it never, ever lets you down. That young fan was me, and that&rsquo;s when I fell in love with sports.</p>

<p>As early as I can remember I was always playing some sport involving a ball, stick, or puck. When I began team sports at 4 years old I poured my heart and soul into every practice and game as much as a 4-year-old could. As time passed the joy a simple practice, scrimmage or a game brought to my life was amazing. Growing up within an unstable home environment I sought refuge in sports. Sports saved me from a life that would have ended in despair as many of my childhood friends ended up incarcerated or dead due to unwise choices and unwise time decisions.</p>
<p>Sports teaches us all about hard work, dedication, teamwork, and discipline. You cannot be successful in sports without hard work, and I think us former athletes appreciate and respect that the most. Sports gives us the sense of achievement and the agony of defeat. Every human emotion is revealed in sports. I fell in love with sports because it allowed me an escape from reality at home and taught me the value of life’s most precious gifts: time, love, and desire. Sports made me the man I am today. A husband, father, teacher, professor, coach, mentor, and fan. I fell in love with sports because it created the best version of myself through teaching me how to fail, succeed, and continue to apply myself every day until I became a champion of life. And I hope to get the next 86,400 seconds to try it again.</p>

<p>If there was a moment that crystallized how important sports were to me, it was the death of Thurman Munson. I was 14 years old and living in New Jersey on Aug. 2, 1979, the day the Yankees All-Star catcher died in a plane crash. I was devastated. Four days later - hours after attending Munson&rsquo;s funeral in Canton, Ohio - the Yankees returned to Yankee Stadium to play against the Baltimore Orioles. I watched on TV. The Yankees trailed most of that game. But Bobby Murcer, after delivering one of Munson&rsquo;s eulogies earlier in the day, played hero in an amazing 5-4 win for the Yankees. It unleashed the emotions of the crowd at Yankee Stadium and my own sitting at home.</p>

<p>I grew up attending Milwaukee Braves games with my father. During the late &rsquo;50s, my dad and I sat in the right field extension and saw the future Hall of Famer, Hank Aaron. I collected baseball cards just like any other child who fell in love with the game. And in 1960, I watched the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Championship Game, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles, 17-13, as Green Bay was driving when time expired. From that game until today, I became an avid Packer fan, not missing a game on TV or radio for going on 59 years now. And as a 7th grader, I began attending Marquette Warrior games at the old Milwaukee Arena, with the late Coach Al McGuire pacing the court. I say all this to give one an idea of what sports has meant to me. I love sports because it’s been my escape from the realities of life, which today are hard to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Not having any “live” sports since the first week of March has been hard to deal with. I’ve already lost the NCAA Tournament, The Masters, Kentucky Derby and Preakness, the NBA playoffs, and the Indianapolis 500. Sports has, and always will be my number one love. I can’t fathom my life without sports to watch.</p>
