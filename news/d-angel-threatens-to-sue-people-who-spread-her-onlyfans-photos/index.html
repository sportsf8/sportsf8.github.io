<p>Dancehall artiste D&rsquo;Angel is threatening legal action against parties who continue to spread her OnlyFans photos, following a breach of the account last week that resulted in several semi-nude images of the artiste being disseminated over social media.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Angel said she became aware of the leak, but then was forced to seek legal advice after a new batch of photos appeared this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to shut them down,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Angel told Loop News. &ldquo;The first leak seemed to create a buzz, my IG followers went up, my subscriptions went up, but now I realize that people are deliberately trying to stop me from earning, but the devil is a liar, I am going to send the demons dem back to hell. So you can keep the photos in your phone, but if you want problems, disseminate them, and I will see you in a court of law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Subscribers must pay $19.99 monthly to access her OnlyFans account.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Angel has retained attorney Christopher Townsend to represent her in the matter.</p>
<p>“You are hereby on notice that accessing the OnlyFans database with the intent to steal copyrighted material amounts to a breach of the Copyright Act and Part II of the Cybercrimes Act. Perpetrators are subject to civil and criminal liability. In prosecuting these claims, third-party transmitters of copyrighted images by whatsoever means, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Youtube are investigated and may be held liable,” the attorney outlined in a letter.</p>
<p>The public has been further advised to delete all unauthorised images of D&rsquo;Angel and to refrain from further dissemination without her consent.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the &lsquo;First Lady of Dancehall&rsquo; recently released a new single called &lsquo;Exposed&rsquo; on the Black Sheep Music label.

(JAMAICA STAR) — The ‘Lady of Dancehall’, D’Angel, has retained legal counsel over a breach of her OnlyFans account.</p>
<p>Last week, several semi-nude photos of the artiste were disseminated over social media, purportedly from her OnlyFans account, which subscribers must pay $19.99 monthly to access.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dancehallmag.com/assets/2020/04/angel.jpg" alt="img">
Dancehall songstress D’Angel says her OnlyFans account was hacked on Thursday as dozens of raunchy photos of her in various provocative poses littered social media.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem to bother her though as she took to social media and said “OnlyFans got hacked but since this a circulate, just gwaan sign up,” along with one of the leaked photos.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The cost for the OnlyFans is $9.99 and D’Angel on Instagram is encouraging fans to “keep the subscriptions coming!”</p>
<p>Fans however are suspicious as they think that D’Angel is the one who leaked her photos to promote her account.</p>
<p>“Girl know how fi market har ting!!” said one fan. D’Angel replied: “subscribe same way.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Even though the photos leaked are risqué, some fans are upset that they aren’t x-rated. “Fansonly has no raw pics kmt con artist,” said one disappointed user.</p>
<p>At least one of her fans seems to care about her as she told her “Jesus is coming soon give your life to Christ. I love Angel but shift your focus.”</p>
<p>Another commenter left a mouthful as she criticized those who leaked the photos and those criticizing the ariste.</p>
<p>“D’Angel you are looking gorgeous Queen and I represent that meagre percentage of the Jamaican diaspora who isn’t backward in thinking. I most certainly don’t in the numbers that put down our local creatives especially our women with patriarchal ideologies aimed at making women inferior subjects. I will not exist as a hypocrite who supports international celebrities while simultaneously oppressing our local celebrities for the same expression,” the fan said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Meanwhile, D’Angel had words for unnamed persons, probably those criticizing certain body parts of hers which did not meet their expectations.</p>
<p>“This a some a unnoo”, captioned to a meme of someone saying a beauty queen’s nose is too big but that person themself is not even physically fit.

<h3 id="dangels-request-for-removal-of-nude-photos-denied--dancehallmag">&ldquo;D&rsquo;Angel&rsquo;s Request For Removal Of Nude Photos Denied – DancehallMag&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dancehallmag.com/assets/2020/07/dangel-lawyer-1.jpg" alt="img">
A week after D’Angel’s attorney demanded that unauthorized persons delete all photos and videos of the Dancehall singer which they illicitly grabbed from her OnlyFans account, at least one offender has flatly refused and even sought even to jeer the artiste.</p>
<p>The deejay had declared that she had retained attorney-at-law Christopher Townsend, to pursue a lawsuit related to a breach of her OnlyFans account, after several nude and semi-nude photos of her were circulated on social media.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>At the time, Townsend said the photos and videos, which are for the eyes of subscribers only, were stolen and, as such, constitutes a breach of the acceptable use policy of the OnlyFans platform, as well as a contravention of the Cybercrimes Act.</p>
<p>He also said perpetrators are subject to civil and criminal liability, and third-party transmitters of D’Angel’s ‘copyrighted images,’ including via Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube, are being investigated and may be held liable.</p>
<p>However, up to today, not only are the photographs and videos still showcased on at least one Instagram page and its website, but the operators of one of the pages bragged on D’Angel’s own Instagram page, that any efforts by her to sue them will be in vain.</p>
<p>The mocking of the artiste began after she posted a photo of herself hugging Townsend, which she captioned: “Great legal representation @christownsend.twp. We had to take a quick pic, then back to business!”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Your lawyer don’t understand the laws. Only Fans can sue for those pictures. You can’t sue nobody,” the poster from the offending IG page wrote.</p>
<p>“We have every single piece of content from D” Angel’s Fan Only. You and D’Angel and her legal team come sue us. When we told our lawyer, they issued a cease and desist in the Jamaica Star and Observer, he laughed till he almost cried. He said that was just a promotional stunt to grow her subscriber base because even the most novice lawyers know that’s not how you issue cease and desist. Do you know?” the poster added in response to objections from D’Angel’s supporters.</p>
<p>One female fan came to D’Angel’s rescue, arguing that the detractor’s arguments were legally unsound.</p>
<p>“You sound so stupid. Is you serious?????? Onlyfans own the platform but who’s pictures!? Look here go to yah bed and stop making a fool of yourself!”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>However, some followers also lampooned the 42-year-old artiste, claiming she was wasting time and money by seeking legal redress.</p>
<p>“You don’t have a case and he (Townsend) knows that. Stop the foolery,” one man said.</p>
<p>“As far as me see it those pics that got leaked isn’t it promotion good promo bad promo you name a buzz. U fi just drop some music now and run wid it and tek some more dope pics and hope dem leak so people can talk,” another follower said.</p>
<p>Some other followers maintained that D’Angel had heaped condemnation upon herself by creating the OnlyFans page, and so should have expected the backlash and the negative exposure.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Well I for one haven’t gotten or paid for that… I’m not going judge either…but if people going put themselves out like that u have to expect the negative or in this case leaks…if I was her I’d close that fan thing down,” one man said.</p>
<p>“Now that you r getting the attention you wanted, you can’t handle it,” another man rebuked.</p>
<p>OnlyFans has been dubbed by the New York Times as the “paywall of porn, and a place where subscribers, ‘mostly male; straight, gay and beyond, pay models and social media influencers a fee to view a feed of imagery it described as “too racy for Instagram’.</p>
<p>Subscription to OnlyFans enables users to access, direct message, and “tip” to get pictures or videos created on-demand, according to their sexual tastes.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In February, The Independent newspaper reported that a huge cache of pornographic photos and videos totaling approximately 1.5 terabytes, were leaked from OnlyFans. It said this was equivalent to approximately three million photos or 750 hours of HD video created by sex workers, porn stars, and social media influencers.</p>
<p>At the time, users complained that sites like OnlyFans lack accountability, which has sinister implications for creators’ safety, as their content “can be bought and then freely distributed to others.</p>
<p>OnlyFans reportedly said the leak was not the result of a data breach and attributed it to being the likely result of private users disseminating content from behind the paywall. OnlyFans policies prohibit the sharing of content, but presently no technology exists to avert the re-sharing of private images and videos from pay-walled sites.</p>
<p>The platform said the measures it takes with respect to stolen content, includes “takedown notices against all reported copyright violations and the issuing of notices on all illicit target websites, hosting services and domain registrars”.

<h3 id="all-eyes-on-dangel---artiste-says-interest-in-her-onlyfans-page-rises-after-racy-photos">&ldquo;All eyes on D’Angel - Artiste says interest in her OnlyFans page rises after racy photos&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://jamaica-star.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2020/07/12/903244/3737993.jpg?itok=kkkeUhnS" alt="img">
Dancehall artiste D&rsquo;Angel said that interest in her OnlyFans page has soared since risque images of her began swirling on social media late last week. The artiste said that her OnlyFans page was hacked and the photos leaked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This leak has resulted in the skyrocketing of my subscriptions. I have not had enough time to navigate my days. People have been reaching out to me with various offers and potential endorsements,&rdquo; the Stronger singer told THE STAR.</p>
<p>Despite being flooded with a sea of negative criticism for the raunchy photos, D&rsquo;Angel says she will not allow people&rsquo;s opinions of her to weigh her down. She said that the high interest in her content shows that &ldquo;whatever negative publicity people are trying to reap from this is futile and inconsequential&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the same time, D&rsquo;Angel said that she is not ashamed of anything that was posted to OnlyFans, a content subscription service which has been dubbed a type of paywall of porn. D&rsquo;Angel, while concerned about the manner in which her photos were publicly shared, said that her images cannot be classified as explicit content. She contends that &ldquo;my team and I have kept it tasteful and artistically censored for the right viewing audiences&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Social media users have been lashing out at the entertainer since the racy photos began making their way around the Internet. Some persons have deemed her decision to join OnlyFans a desperate attempt to stay relevant, while others said that she was getting too old for that type of behaviour. D&rsquo;Angel, however, is unmoved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal, I&rsquo;m a model and that&rsquo;s a career from which I&rsquo;ll never retire, as well as an entertainer. Many others have done much worse but, for some reason, there&rsquo;s a witchhunt out with a bounty on my head. But my social media platforms and OnlyFans will keep growing as long as this expose continues,&rdquo; the artiste said.</p>
<p>As for those concerned about her son and how these images will impact him, D&rsquo;Angel said she takes all the necessary precautions to shield him from the public&rsquo;s venom. She also said that he understands the nature of her job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s aware what OnlyFans is. So, regarding repercussions, if they come, I&rsquo;ll cross that bridge when I reach it. I&rsquo;m always prepared to weather any storm that blows my way.&rdquo;

<h3 id="i-will-sue-you---dangel-warns-persons-pirating-her-onlyfans-photos">&ldquo;‘I will sue you’ - D’Angel warns persons pirating her OnlyFans photos&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://jamaica-star.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2020/07/20/913442/3419853.jpg?itok=tazY6yKZ" alt="img">
Dancehall artiste D&rsquo;Angel is warning that anyone who uses images she posted on adult site OnlyFans in future without her permission will be hit with lawsuits.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the entertainer siad that her lawyers have got involved in the case involving leaked photos from her OnlyFans account, and so it is out of her hands if persons ignore the cease and desist order issued by her representatives.</p>
<p>The legal document prohibiting any further circulation of the photos from her hacked OnlyFans account was also issued yesterday.</p>
<p>The entertainer, who is being represented by the firm operated by noted attorney Christopher Townsend and his partners, told THE STAR that if persons do not want to be drawn into a legal battle, they had better heed the stop order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s out of my hands now, and so all I will say is that if you insist on circulating the pictures from my private subscription-only account, you must be prepared to face the consequences. My lawyers have full control over the matter now, and I will not speak about it again,&rdquo; she told THE STAR.</p>
<p>A copy of the document, signed by Townsend, was submitted to THE STAR yesterday. The document states that the pictures obtained from her OnlyFans account were stolen and that is in breach of the Copyright Act.</p>
<p>Under investigation</p>
<p>The matter is now under investigation to determine the initial point of breach, but the cease and desist letter went on to state that while the investigation is ongoing, any third party that continues to publish or post the photos would face charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third-party transmitters of the copyrighted images by whatsoever means, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube, are investigated and will and may be held liable,&rdquo; a portion of the document read.</p>
<p>It goes on to advise that all unauthorised postings of the photos should be deleted immediately and that persons who wish to continue using the artiste&rsquo;s images should seek permission via her manager, Patricia Henry.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Angel was the subject of harsh criticism earlier this month when her nude photos were leaked. Following a number of posts that went viral, D&rsquo;Angel revealed that her page was hacked and hinted then that she would be taking legal action against the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Still, although disturbed by the fact that someone would intentionally sabotage her adult-only platform, which is a paid subscription page, D&rsquo;Angel said the move did more good than harm.</p>
<p>She told THE STAR that interest in her page skyrocketed following the leak, and endorsement deals were flooding her table.
