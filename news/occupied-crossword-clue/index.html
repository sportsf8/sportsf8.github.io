<p>SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today’s grid is a surprise and a delight, the type that makes me want to grab any poor solver I see on the street and explain every loving dimension. Andrew Chaikin, who also goes by Kid Beyond, is a San Francisco-based musician and game inventor, a constructor of pleasurable mind-benders for us and elsewhere (please read his notes and check out Puzzle Bouquet as well; he’s also philanthropic).</p>
<p>This grid smashes its black-and-white, two-dimensional constraints in so many ways, but if you think about puzzles, they’re really all mysteries that we unravel; solvers of crosswords, solvers of capers. What a lark.</p>
<p>If you’re not solving this on paper or haven’t looked at the online puzzle notes and read the preamble to “The Mystery of McGuffin Manor,” here it is:</p>
<p>This crossword contains a whodunit: “Thank you for coming, Inspector,” said Lady McGuffin. “The famed McGuffin Diamond has been stolen from my study! The eight members of the staff had a costume party tonight — it has to be one of them: the butler, driver, cook, baker, page, porter, barber or carpenter. They have all been confined to their respective rooms surrounding the parlor, as shown here [center of the grid].” Can you determine who stole the diamond … and where it is now?</p>
<p>Note: If you’re solving this in the magazine, there’s an additional mystery in the southeast corner — 92 is repeated in the grid, so read that second 92 as 93, 93 as 94, and 94 as 95. This was unintentional, and more of a red herring.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>There’s a ton of theme today, all of it blindly clued — there’s just no way you got started on this mystery without a bunch of crosses. That doesn’t mean that Mr. Chaikin gave us a pass, however; he is a robust cluer and I found myself smiling at fill like ARK, EVER, NO FUN (as if!), BEERS and others — loved the juxtaposition of WRINGER and DRYMOPS. I was edified by TAMPA and mystified by SOPH, as clued.

<h3 id="all-it-takes-is-inexhaustible-patience-limitless-time-and-a-warped-mind-a-conversation-with-adrienne-raphel">&ldquo;“All It Takes Is Inexhaustible Patience, Limitless Time, and a Warped Mind”: A Conversation with Adrienne Raphel&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://lareviewofbooks-org-cgwbfgl6lklqqj3f4t3.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/adrienneraphel.png" alt="img">
I HAD BEEN DOING crosswords (the easier, American kind) off and on, with partners or alone, for maybe two decades when I learned that Adrienne Raphel — at the time, a graduate student at Harvard, and before that an Iowa Writers’ Workshop poet — planned to write part, and then all, of her dissertation on crosswords and their literary implications. In the same year, I learned with great pleasure just how good she had become at literary journalism, at the kind of long-form reviewing I do and at the kind of synthetic, reporting-included cultural coverage that I don’t do: I read her work in The New Yorker online and elsewhere. And then I started to see where the dissertation — no, the book — was going: into the greater world of human beings who read for pleasure, human beings who might not care about interpretations of interpretations of interpretations of Milton (which, for the record, I do care about!), but who absolutely care about the history of the thing with the boxes and grids and puns and inside jokes, the thing that has become a highlight of their Sundays, or their every day, the thing whose interpersonal and social and ludic and indeed literary implications have never been fully explored.</p>
<p>Thinking Inside the Box, the trade press book that is also a dissertation that is also a masterful first prose book (her actual first book was a book of poems), discusses the history of the American crossword and of the British cryptic crossword, the major figures on both sides, the fun and the fast pace of an in-person tournament (remember when we had in-person events? good times), and the philosophy of construction, cluing, and solving from the first Word Cross to the end of time — when we become crow dross, when doom strikes us down or cows drs, when we must pull our way out of our quarantined future by learning to row with our scow rods, when we take refuge in the imaginary realm of Sinbad and have to fight off sword rocs.</p>
<p>You see what kind of a mess this book can make of your brain. Please ignore me and listen to Adrienne as she discusses the past and the future of crosswords. She and I conducted our interview via Google Hangouts and speedy typing in mid-May.</p>
<p>¤</p>
<p>STEPHANIE BURT: I already know something about the history part of [your] book (since I kind of watched you write it), so I’m going to start at the other end, with the present-day culture of crossword fiends, people who organize their social lives and their free time around being or becoming really good at crosswords. How would you describe that subculture? How is it different (if it is) from other subcultures and social milieux?</p>
<p>ADRIENNE RAPHEL: I love this question. Getting to know people along the gradient of cruciverbal immersion, from casual participant to crossword superfan, has been the joy of living with this book. I’m not an expert in other subcultures so I’m not sure I can speak to differences across various groups, but I can point out a few things that strike me about today’s crossword fiends.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>One thing I wasn’t expecting going into the book was the huge diversity of types of people who live in crossword-land. I had a stereotype in my head of a solver who was older, retired, probably white, white-collar, lived in the suburbs. And that was completely blown out of the water.</p>
<p>I had similar stereotype going in.</p>
<p>And to be honest, that was probably more true than not, even just a few decades ago.</p>
<p>But now …</p>
<p>But today’s crossword community is really diverse, and celebrates diversity. And that’s only growing and expanding, even since I finished writing the book.</p>
<p>What’s changed about that community since you finished, then?</p>
<p>Efforts such as constructors Erik Agard and Will Nediger organizing a Facebook group to mentor crossword people, focusing on people who didn’t feel like their voices were being represented as well as they could be. Just this March, constructor Rebecca Falcon organized a “Crossword Women’s March,” meaning that major editors would only publish constructors by women in the month of March. “Queer Qrosswords” and “The Inkubator” are two great indie crosswords that encourage diverse voices. In a world where we can meet in groups again, there are more and more crossword tournaments, and functions like crossword demos in breweries, that are both by and for people who might not have seen themselves in this puzzle world a few decades ago.</p>
<p>That’s a good segue into what I’m afraid is an obvious next question: right now, we can’t meet in groups, except online, but crosswords can be done while socially distanced. Has the crossword community done anything (either in terms of bringing people together and feeling helpful, or in terms of formal innovation) in response to the pandemic?</p>
<p>Yes! A couple of immediate examples: The American Crossword Puzzle Tournament (ACPT), the biggest annual tournament, was supposed to be [this] March 20–22. Obviously not. In about 36 hours, some crossword folx organized “couchwords,” an online ACPT, for the main day of the tournament. About 1,000 people joined! That’s 300 more than usually come to the IRL ACPT. It was amazing and really worked well. Also, Will Shortz and his crew at the Times put together an “emergency puzzle mania” for May, a band-aid but a nice bonus gift. And The New Yorker has introduced “Partner Mode,” where you can co-solve a puzzle online. So these represent three categories of fixes as I see them: online substitutes for IRL things, more puzzles to help people keep their minds off pandemic, and new solutions for whatever times we’re in.</p>
<p>Will Shortz — the most famous currently active constructor, I imagine — becomes a character in your book. Did you know that would happen?</p>
<p>Quick clarification: He’s the most famous active crossword editor, for sure, but the puzzles are constructed by lots of different people who submit to The New York Times. It’s funny, I originally pitched the project as a magazine piece, to write a profile of Will Shortz, because I thought that he was such an intriguing figure — like, if Will Shortz didn’t exist, the puzzle world would have had to invent him.</p>
<p>An earlier version of your book project tried really, really hard to find connections between the history of crosswords and the history of poetry, which didn’t quite work. I wonder whether crosswords as a verbal or paraliterary form are in some ways an alternative to, or an opposite for, “literary” arrangements of language as we usually understand them? Or whether you are trying to start telling us how to see crosswords as a literary form? One with subgenres, a formal history, connotation, emotional arcs for the reader/solver, perhaps even a “protagonist” or central character — but who would that be?</p>
<p>You’re right that trying to force a connection between crosswords and poetry never really worked! To answer your question with another question, here’s another way I’ve been thinking about crosswords and literary form: why can’t AI solve crosswords better than humans can? Or, what are the things about crosswords as a form (literary, paraliterary) that still tap into some sort of ineffable human creativity? I’m interested in all the things that crosswords ask our brain to do, both in constructing them and solving them: the ways in which clues and answers relate, and the ways all of those associations pull on riddle, metaphor, symbol, et cetera. And I’m also interested in the totally math-brain ways in which the grid’s letters get put together.</p>
<p>Can you give examples for our LARB audience? I know there are examples in the book.</p>
<p>A great example clue by the amazing Erik Agard is: “Pool noodles.” The answer is mind meld. So “pool” is a verb and “noodles” means “brains.”</p>
<p>That’s lovely! I have trouble with obscure puns.</p>
<p>Yeah, I find this an insanely elegant and good clue, and one in which misdirection is firing on all levels, yet it’s inevitable once you get it!</p>
<p>Are you a constructor right now?</p>
<p>Ha, I’d say — sort of! I dabble. I’ve been writing some for the Paris Review, which has been really fun.</p>
<p>Has the Paris Review historically run crosswords?</p>
<p>Nope! I’m the first, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Did you have to sell it or did the web editor Craig [Morgan Teicher] say, “Of course!”</p>
<p>I like doing them because I like thinking about different things that crosswords can do, and different things I can do with crosswords — these ones really highlight authors in the archives. Craig had commissioned me to write a couple of crosswords for internal Publishers Weekly things when he was there, and then during book promotion, I pitched to him and Nadja [Spiegelman], and they were both immediately into it.</p>
<p>We’ve been talking about NYC institutions, and Shortz is from Indiana but lives in [the] New York metropolitan area. Is there a regional difference between East Coast and West Coast or East Coast and non-East Coast puzzles? (I’m really hoping there is a Minnesota School of Crossword Construction.)</p>
<p>Oh, really interesting question. There’s a fantastic puzzle collection in Indiana University’s rare books library, the Jerry Slocum Puzzle Collection — mostly mechanical puzzles, but I went out there for book research and it was fascinating. Anyway, to your question: Crosswords that are in a publication typically reflect the publication that they’re in, so a New York Times or New Yorker crossword will likely be sort of New York–centric, regardless of where the constructors come from, but will also have a national flavor. Syndicated puzzles in newspapers nationwide don’t usually have regional flairs, also for that reason. They need to appeal to all audiences. On the other hand, there’s a constructor named Myles Mellor who makes a living solely writing puzzles for super-niche audiences, like Westchester Magazine or Dog Fanciers — and his puzzles are totally tailored to these regional group. (I want there to be a “Minnesota School of Crossworders” too!)</p>
<p>How many people have constructing or editing crosswords as their primary source of income, as Mellor does? Is it in the single digits, as with poets, or the low triple digits, as I suspect is the case with SF writers? Do people teach courses in how to construct (better) crosswords, or is it entirely learn-by-doing, send-out-your-work, hope-you-make-a-connection?</p>
<p>In answer to your first question, it’s single digits for now but definitely growing. The New York Times and other places pay more than they used to for puzzles, but construction is a freelance business model and it’s almost always a side gig. There are crossword editors for publications who can make a living (like Shortz), and the move to online has also opened up some of the economics of the crossword world. The Times employs a whole team for the digital games division. The short answer is, though, mostly crosswords are more a labor for love than for money (like poems).</p>
<p>As for improving crossword construction, there are awesome crossword mentors out there, like Nancy Salomon, Andrea Carla Michaels, Ross Trudeau, among others. Basically if you email any constructor you love, they will probably help you, or will point you toward a person who has bandwidth to help! So not really formal schools, but tons of informal support systems.</p>
<p>Constructing and solving crosswords resemble — but aren’t — a number of other human activities: constructing and solving math puzzles; writing poems, especially poems in challenging forms; playing trivia games or other nongeometric word games; taking part in an intricate conversation; cryptography. Is there a quick way to describe what’s unique about crosswords? What they do that nothing else does?</p>
<p>Is it too easy to say that what’s unique about crosswords is that it actually can involve most or all of the activities you mention?</p>
<p>I mean, that’s an argument of the form “X is great because many things can A or B or C or D, but only X can A and B and C and D.” I was wondering if there was any other way to see it! Maybe there’s not. I have been known to make arguments of that form myself.</p>
<p>I do think that crosswords pull on all cross-sections of the brain: the simplicity of the form (here’s a blank grid, here are clues, go!) make them both predictable and infinitely malleable.</p>
<p>That’s really good. Traditionally literary kinds of writing (including subcultural/lower prestige forms of writing, like fantasy novels!) occupy all kinds of space between the secular/present/realistic and the religious/transcendent. Puzzles and games are normally taken, in our culture, to be entirely secular. Is that a mistake? Is there or can there ever be a religious dimension to crossword creating and solving?</p>
<p>Oh that’s a fantastic question, because I think there’s both a flip answer and a serious answer to it. The flip answer is that Bible-themed crosswords are extremely popular. The former crossword editor at USA Today who got in a lot of trouble for plagiarizing crosswords publishes books of Bible crosswords, and of course you can put any content you want into a grid! The serious answer is that word games have had a mystical component for centuries.</p>
<p>Religious content in the answers is of course not what I meant! Mmmmm say more. (What about George Herbert?!)</p>
<p>Yes, George Herbert, exactly!! Word squares, especially the Sator Square (five-by-five anagram), were found all over the Roman Empire as magic amulets.</p>
<p>Because literary education and literary life in America is so forking presentist, many extremely literate and thoughtful LARB readers know el zippo about Herbert, let alone the Sator Square. Explain both briefly? And other Roman amulets?</p>
<p>The Sator Square is a five-by-five word square with a five-word Latin palindrome, SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS, which roughly translates to “The farmer Arepo works a plough.” People in the Roman Empire went nuts for this thing — there are Sator Squares in the ruins of Pompeii, and it appears carved all over for centuries — they thought of it as a magic object, like it could ward off the devil or something. Okay, feel free to jump in with a more concise Herbert explanation! But basically, Herbert’s concrete poetry like The Temple used the visual forms of the poems as well as the content to build devotional messages.</p>
<p>Anagrams too, not just shaped poems.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly. “Easter Wings” is easy to explain: the shaped poem, in the form of butterfly wings, echoes the form in its content (the poem becomes “Most thinne. / With thee”) at the center of the “wings” — and it does so for devotional purposes. (That’s shape again, not anagrams.)</p>
<p>Do you remember the first crossword you completed? Or the first one you saw?</p>
<p>Not the exact first crossword, but I definitely remember watching my mom solve every night when I was a kid, and thinking: Oh, cool, that’s a thing grown-ups do — or, to put it the other way, something that defines you as being a grown-up is the ability to do the New York Times crossword.</p>
<p>Wow, how old were you?</p>
<p>Probably eight or nine. The documentary Wordplay, about Will Shortz and the crossword puzzle tournament, came out my senior year of high school.</p>
<p>Did you see it with friends or on your own?</p>
<p>With my family, I’m sure, because we told my mom she should enter the tournament. I also wrote a little pamphlet of word games and puzzles as a senior year capstone project … so basically I have one idea over and over.</p>
<p>At that point (just before college — Princeton, right?) were you already aware of British-style cryptics?</p>
<p>Yes, actually — another family friend’s father was one of the most notorious setters in England. He had a whole Christmas cryptic newsletter.</p>
<p>Notorious? Explain. Is the newsletter in the book?</p>
<p>Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein were two of the only American subscribers to the newsletter. Yeah, I mention it (at least in a footnote I’m sure).</p>
<p>Oh, right, Sondheim! Say more if you like about the Sondheim crossword connection. (Happy 90th birthday to Sondheim!)</p>
<p>(Happy 90th!!!) So definitely a huge part of my own cruciverbal fangirling is the Sondheim connection. I’m a huge Sondheim fan, for poetry and musical reasons.</p>
<p>Yes, me too, though you are probably more knowledgeable than I. Tell our viewers at home about Sondheim and crosswords, please.</p>
<p>So Sondheim loves crosswords, but specifically cryptic crosswords. In the ’60s, he wrote a piece for New York magazine introducing Americans to British-style cryptics, essentially claiming that these intricately wordplay-fueled versions of the crossword were the only “real” crosswords.</p>
<p>Were they unknown in America until then?</p>
<p>He also wrote a whole bunch of his own cryptics and fiendishly difficult crossword-type word puzzles for New York magazine. They weren’t totally unknown but there wasn’t a major American publication that published them, so they had to trickle across the pond.</p>
<p>Can you give an example of a Sondheim clue?</p>
<p>One second, let me just grab the copy of his New York magazine puzzles. Okay, wow, I always forget how complex these are! A simple one is the clue “Entertain and wind again? (6)” for “regale” (re + gale) — but that’s like level 1.5 out of 10.</p>
<p>Send one more. I liked that one.</p>
<p>Yeah, if you’ve watched Meryl Streep and Audra McDonald and Christine Baranski sing “Ladies Who Lunch” as often as I have, you’ll love these. Okay, so here’s another: the clue is “Hot spot horas (5,7)” and the instructions tell you that it’s an anagram of two words that indicate a third word, which is the word to be entered into the grid. So the answer to the anagram is “Porthos” and “Athos,” and then the answer you enter is ARAMIS (for the three Musketeers). That’s maybe level 3.5/4 out of 10.</p>
<p>Holy rusted metal, Batman! I’m just taking that in.</p>
<p>Haha, you and me both.</p>
<p>When crosswords hit their first peak of popularity in the 1920s there was a moral panic and a media backlash, right? Because they were addictive time-wasters? Can you compare that moral panic to anything more recent?</p>
<p>Yeah exactly. The New York Times published huffy op-eds about how crosswords taught you nothing and were basically uncreative fill-in-the-blank time-wasters. And libraries got angry at patrons for hogging dictionaries and encyclopedias away from people doing “real” research, and lamented that no one was reading anymore. The tone is similar in a lot of ways to articles these days about video games. The idea of the crossword as a menace directly competing with other forms of “better” literature also feels like some stuff written about comics, though you’d know more about that.</p>
<p>Some brain science here: games like Candy Crush — which offer short-term, unpredictable, immediate rewards (and glow!), with an apparent or real element of skill and an element of chance — do things to your brain’s reward system, almost like slot machines. Do crosswords do those things? Do we know? Is there fMRI brain science on solvers?</p>
<p>There’s been a bunch of studies on crosswords and dementia, including a really cool study with H. M., the patient that the movie Memento is based on. H. M., the amnesiac, loved crosswords and would happily do the same ones over and over. Some researchers (late in H. M.’s life) got the idea to test and see if he could improve on crossword clues that he shouldn’t have been able to know anything about because they referred to events that happened after he lost his memory. Crazily enough, he did improve, though he didn’t know how he knew the answers. So crosswords helped reveal some possible links between short-term and long-term memory, or at least rote learning capacities.</p>
<p>Now that the book is out, are you treated differently in crossword circles? Or in virtual/online tournaments, if you do any?</p>
<p>I’ve started dabbling in crossword construction, as I mentioned. I can’t help myself, I love a formal experiment. The crossword community has been incredibly supportive!</p>
<p>At the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, I’ve served as a judge the past couple of years, and plan to keep doing so. I’m still in the way bottom of competitive solvers, and honestly I much prefer the judges’ room at this point.</p>
<p>I love a formal experiment too! I’m okay at New York Times Sunday crosswords, but I can’t solve a British cryptic to save my life. When I’m lucky, I get a few clues. Anything I can do to improve my showing?</p>
<p>Re: cryptics: I think I might join you in making this my new quarantine puzzle project.</p>
<p>First stop, definitely check out Alan Connor’s lively blog at the Guardian. He posts really helpful 101 guides to different types of cryptic clues. I feel like Duolingo should introduce a new language: Cryptic Crosswordese.</p>

<h3 id="george-floyd-donald-trump-hong-kong-your-tuesday-briefing">&ldquo;George Floyd, Donald Trump, Hong Kong: Your Tuesday Briefing&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/02/briefing/02ambriefing-euro-promo/02ambriefing-euro-slide-AG2K-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Demonstrators in Berlin, London and Vancouver took the streets to decry George Floyd’s death in police custody last week in Minneapolis. Activists in Chile offered advice on protection from police abuse. And in China and Iran, governments seized the opportunity to accuse the United States of hypocrisy on human rights.</p>
<p>New: A private autopsy commissioned by Mr. Floyd’s family concluded that his death was a homicide, brought about by compression of his neck and back by police officers. An earlier autopsy by the county’s medical examiner had discounted traumatic asphyxia or strangulation as a cause of death.</p>
<p>Official remarks: President Trump on Monday called the looting and violence amid the American protests “acts of domestic terror” and threatened military intervention. Several people have been killed or wounded in shootings linked to the unrest nationwide. The police used tear gas to clear protesters away so Mr. Trump could visit a church near the White House, where he posed for photos with a Bible.</p>
<p>Go deeper: Our reporters went inside a protest in Brooklyn, where New Yorkers spoke about their experiences with racism. Also, the Times’s visual investigations team reconstructed the minutes leading up to George Floyd’s death. (This video contains scenes of graphic violence.)

It comes as new clusters are emerging in places around Asia where the virus’s spread was thought to have been slowing. Singapore, long lauded for its early containment efforts, has seen its cases balloon to more than 23,000 as the virus spread in dormitories for foreign workers.</p>
<p>Wuhan is not the only place in China seeing new cases: The northern city of Shulan, near the Russian border, was declared “high-risk” on Sunday after 15 people were infected.</p>
<p>More than 100 new cases emerged in South Korea after an infected man visited bars and clubs in a Seoul nightlife district. The mayor ordered nightspots closed indefinitely.</p>
<p>Here are the latest coronavirus updates, and maps of where the virus has spread.</p>

There are six examples at 23A, 38A, 54A, 78A, 94A and 114A. After solving two I gnashed my teeth and felt terrible for not being able to come up with any of the rest on my own, based on the clue — I didn’t think my brain was working. After solving three I figured it out and the rest were gratifying.</p>
<p>My favorite, which is also the first one I “got” and the one that I shared with my now-remote friends to much glee and anxious laughter, is at 54A: “Antsy feeling when one is out of cellphone range?” Think of the second part first — NO SERVICE. What does losing service on our vital devices make us, while we’re trying to virtually keep in touch with everyone while physically touching no one? SO NERVOUS. I mean, preach, Mr. Nediger and Ms. Stark. Say it loud.</p>
<p>Another riot, which made me think of this amazing story about the famous “Mad Bluebird” image from 1983 (!) that catapulted a photographer into prosperity. (Reminder: Always license!) To “Hoot at an out-of-focus nature photograph?” is to BOO BLURRED BLUE BIRD. Again, say it aloud and you’ll get it.</p>
<p>Those two are particularly sublime and ridiculous, but all of them are quite perfect. I’ll give you halves:</p>
<p>At 23A, think HALL ALE for beer on campus, and come up with a synonym for “everyone cheer.”</p>
<p>At 78A, send a STEVEDORE to a shop owned by an operatic soprano.</p>
<p>At 94A, “landing” could also be a football score, by a DUTCH TOWN.</p>
<p>At 114A, an auditory pun with a tricky component — B CHORD is your “certain three notes”; the other half is where you’d play them, or where you’d type your virtual pleas for a hint.

I don’t know if you guys have heard this or not, but when the 2020-21 college basketball season starts, Marquette men’s basketball will have a high profile freshman named Dawson Garcia. You can click the link there and realize he’s kind of a big deal. You know what else was a big deal back in the day? The WB hit show Dawson’s Creek.</p>
<p>Much like we did for The O.C. for Sandy Cohen a few years ago, we’re going to jump in and start recapping Dawson’s Creek episodes. Why? Well, to be honest, I don’t know much about the show other than the basics, so if I’m going to run an internet blog and enjoy making pop culture references along the way, then I’d better learn a few for Dawson’s Creek/Dawson Garcia. Besides, we’ve got nothing but free time between now and whenever college sports actually do start up again thanks to the coronavirus, so what better way to occupy ourselves?</p>
<p>RELATED: If you’re looking for something to occupy yourself and end up binging The O.C., please check out our recaps of Season 1, Season 2, and the first five episodes of Season 3.</p>
<p>ALSO: If you have a catchy name for these recaps other than just “The Dawson’s Creek Recaps,” shout it out in the comments section or kick an email to <a href="mailto:anon.eagle@gmail.com">anon.eagle@gmail.com</a> or send the AE Twitter a note. We used “The Sandy Cohen Chronicles” for The O.C., but that worked since it was an actual character’s name. I don’t think “The Dawson Garcia Chronicles” works quite as well here.</p>
<p>Alright, hit it, Paula Cole!</p>
<p>Season 1, Episode 6: “Baby”</p>
<p>Written By: Joanne Waters (story) and Jon Harmon Feldman (teleplay)</p>
<p>Directed By: Steve Miner</p>
<p>Previously on Dawson’s Creek: Joey’s older sister Bessie is pregnant, and she’s not married to her black boyfriend, either. Ms. Jacobs has tried to create a boundary with Pacey, but that has failed miserably and she is now regularly sleeping with one of the students in her high school English class. However, Ms. Jacobs is looking at ending things eventually because of the public exposure risk factor.</p>
<p>As it seems so many episodes do, we open on Movie Night on Dawson’s bed. I presume that he gets as many free rentals as he wants when the shop closes at the end of the night, because my guy has four cassettes sitting on his bed for what’s up next. However, there is no next. Joey hops off the bed to start heading for home. Bessie baby is due next week, so she needs more help around the house. Hey, come on now, Bodie can help, says Dawson, and then fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinally the camera pivots and we find out that Jen is also at Movie Night. Sitting in a chair next to Dawson’s bed. You’re never going to believe this, but neither girl feels particularly comfortable staying with the other one in the room. Of course, there’s also the aspect where both of them will leave if the other one does because they don’t want to be the one that ruined Movie Night for the other one, and bang, off they both go. The obvious solution here: Dawson needs more friends.</p>
<p>Over at the Potter residence the next morning, Bodie and Bessie discuss her physical condition given that she’s 39 weeks pregnant. You’ll never believe it, but she’s having trouble being comfortable doing literally anything. Here’s some fun news: Bodie has an interview at some new French restaurant over in Hyannis today. Bessie and Joey end up sniping at each other about Joey’s enthusiasm for living with Bodie and Bessie. I’m not exactly clear as to why this happens, given that noted minor Joey Potter has to live with some responsible adult, but as we’ll see later, this is important to set up the fact that the sisters are not in perfect harmony with each other.</p>
<p>Grams cleans up Jen’s room, which includes picking up her various assortment of underpants. Colors, designs, all sorts of fun. The notoriously closeminded Grams is not a fan of what Jen wears under her clothes which are, given Jen’s history, pretty sedate. She’s also not a fan of the calendar that Jen has on her wall, which is a month-by-month collection of artistic photographs of nude males. Jen eventually wanders into all of this, and when Grams objects, Jen points out that hey, isn’t that Jesus of Nazareth dude nekkid up on that cross? I dunno about you, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen a full frontal crucifix before. Anyway, this leads to Grams asking what happened to the little girl who went to Sunday School when she visited back in the day, and Jen says she has outgrown church. Again, a very obvious setup for what comes later, although like Joey and Bessie, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a variation on this conversation.</p>
<p>Pacey has sidled up to Ms. Jacobs out in the parking lot at Capeside High School and begins making his argument that they should go on an actual date date. Yes, the 40 year old English teacher and her 15 year old boyfriend should absolutely do lots of being seen together in public. Fantastic plan, dummy. Pacey’s solution: Let’s go down to Providence! No one knows us down there! I’d just like to point out that they’re having this conversation somewhat loudly in what has to be a busy parking lot at the start of the school day. Pacey is a moron.</p>
<p>He decides to double down on his dumb as he goes on and on and on about his potential weekend plan to Dawson in the bathroom inside the school building. Hey, she didn’t actually say no out loud! After all of this, Pacey begins to check the stalls for an occupant. However, he completely halfasses this by just looking underneath the doors for feet. You’re never going to believe this, but there was someone in the stalls, but Kenny Leaverton didn’t want to get caught smoking so he had his feet up on the toilet seat! Oh, no, Pacey! He heard everything&hellip;.. because you’re dumb.</p>
<p>Dawson and Jen walk around at school, and talk about weekend plans. Dawson’s parents are off at a couples therapy retreat or whatever this weekend, so Stately Leery Manor is down to one occupant. However, Jen has more important things to discuss, namely the rumor she heard about Pacey and Ms. Jacobs. It’s not a question of who told her, but who didn’t tell her. Oh dear. Dawson tears off to find Pacey, very carefully telling Jen he won’t lie to her so let’s just pretend this conversation did not happen. Dawson and Jen post up at what I presume is Pacey’s locker, and Joey has also heard the rumor. Pacey approaches, and before he gets there, some random girl grabs him to whisper in his ear, presumably about the rumor. He seems not pleased to find out that other people have found out.</p>
<p>Joey fills in the detail about Kenny Leaverton The Smoker, and Dawson and Pacey huddle up in&hellip;&hellip; a supply closet? Well, sure, bathrooms are too dangerous now. Pacey starts throwing himself a pity party because woe is him, his life is ruined now. Yeah, way to not think about Ms. Jacobs and her 1) job and 2) potential criminal future. Smooth, dummy. Dawson has an idea, though: LEAN INTO THE RUMOR. Moping confirms it’s true! Playing it off makes it just a rumor and boom: NO PROBLEM FOR ANYONE and then it all goes away.</p>
<p>Pacey is 110% on board with Dawson’s plan, right up until he walks out of the supply closet and takes one walk down one hallway set to the tune of Insecuriosity by Andrew Dorff. What a fantastic song title for this moment. He maintains a strong front all the way to the corner and then practically collapses from the stress of trying to be cool and calm. My god, man.</p>
<p>Ms. Jacobs teaches her class about Romeo &amp; Juliet, and there’s a forbidden fruit metaphor that she’s explaining. You can go ahead and write the snickering jokes from rumor fueled high school sophomores here, because they’re all exactly what you think. Pacey coming in late to class only stokes the fire. If Ms. Jacobs didn’t hear about the rumors already, then she has probably figured it out now.</p>
<p>Pacey pouts down by the docks after school. Joey wanders up with a classic opening line: “Hey, jailbait.” Anyway, she’s there to empathize with Pacey, as she’s gone through what he’s going through. People stare and whisper about the girl who lives with her unmarried pregnant sister and black boyfriend because her dad is in jail on a drug conviction, too. I feel like that’s not quite the same as Pacey’s thing, which is something that Pacey could have actually avoided on multiple levels. Her advice for Pacey? “Pray like hell for a better story to come along.” Seems mean, actually.</p>
<p>Dawson and Jen walk home, which gives her a chance to mention that her conversations with Grams always derail because she just can’t not be smarmy to her grandmother. Anyway, Grams is at the door waiting, and dinner will be on the table at 6pm.</p>
<p>Joey also walks home, and she finds Bessie and her truck&hellip;. stuck in a pothole? I’m not completely clear exactly what the trouble is with the truck, but as it turns out, the trouble is actually Bessie’s uterus. She was on her way to the clinic because she’s pretty sure she’s in labor. With the Potter’s phone out of order at the moment, that makes the one at Dawson’s house the nearest operational phone. No, seriously, how out in the middle of nowhere is this house?</p>
<p>Anyway, Joey points out that Dawson’s house is closest, but not the most convenient. This leads to a smash cut to a wide view of the titular creek in question, as Joey rows the two of them across. Also, Bessie points out that if she doesn’t put her back into it, it’s going to be the three of them by the time they get to Dawson’s house. Joey is distracted by the boat leaking. Bessie points out that it’s not the boat that’s leaking, which is a very funny water breaking joke.</p>
<p>Dawson’s busy using the phone at his house trying to track down Pacey as the Potter women show up, and Dawson calls for an ambulance. Good news: It’s on the way! Bad news: It has to stop in Duxbury first, because of a major automobile accident. According to Bessie, that’s an hour away! Seems bad. Bessie goes on a tear about being in the middle of nowhere with one hospital and one ambulance and no doctor for 30 miles. I am now attempting to figure out where Capeside is, exactly. We’ll come back to this, as there are more clues later. Bessie demands to have the phone and we get your standard pregnant lady about to pop yelling at a person who is ostensibly there to help them bit. I wonder how long it’s going to take before someone realizes that there’s an RN living next door.</p>
<p>Dawson couldn’t get Pacey on the phone (remember, this is 1998) because he was headed to Ms. Jacobs’ house to explain what happened. He didn’t tell everyone, only Dawson. Kenny The Smoker is not his fault, except for the part where it was his fault because he yammered on before halfassedly checking the stalls. Ms. Jacobs is super pissed, obviously, since the rumor is that she committed a felony, and she goes along with Pacey’s idea to do more things that regular couples do. Except she means that it’s time for her to break up with him.</p>
<p>Jen finds a King James Bible in her bedroom, and that is not a subtle message there, Grams. A fight about theology is about to break out but there’s a knock at the door. It’s Joey, which means that we did not have to wait long for them to remember that Grams is an RN. Joey’s tactic here is&hellip;.. to demand that Grams help the baby and forget about all the sin-related reasons why she doesn’t like the entire Potter family. Grams stares at her, which is a fair reaction, I think.</p>
<p>Pacey sulks to some very sad sounding metal music playing, and as luck would have it Older Brother Officer Doug pulls up to hassle Pacey about being involved with this rumor because Doug heard that the kid involved made it all up. How dare Pacey do that to the lovely Tamara. Pacey’s response is thus: “Well, at least it’s a story about someone in the Witter family having heterosexual intercourse for once.” I am not kidding you here: This is a bad look for Pacey and 2) Doug LITERALLY PULLED A GUN ON PACEY OVER THIS ISSUE DURING THE HURRICANE LAST WEEK. Maybe cool it, dude? This is how we find out that there’s an emergency school board meeting scheduled for tonight. That was fast.</p>
<p>Dawson sells Bessie on the idea of videotaping her delivery because Bodie is “on the other side of the county right now.” Okay, so we know he went to a restaurant in Hyannis for an interview. Hyannis is kind of on the west end of Barnstable County in Massachusetts, with Barnstable County being the entirety of that long extending peninsula that extends out into the Atlantic Ocean. It’s a 65 minute drive or thereabouts from Duxbury to Chatham, which is on the far east end, so I think we can narrow Capeside’s location to in the vague area near Chatham. Or a replacement for Chatham if you prefer. The population is about 6,000, which feels about right for Capeside and it’s right on the ocean, too. This has been another thrilling installment of Dawson’s Creek Geography.</p>
<p>Bessie agrees, but only if she gets final cut on the video. Ha ha ha movie joke. Joey brings Grams in, which is good news since we left that on a big ol’ question mark. To the absolute surprise of no one, Grams is a flipping boss when it comes to doing triage nursing with a baby imminently about to arrive. Bessie is wildly unhappy with this development, but Grams even takes charge of her: “I will resist any urge to bond with you when this is over as long as you do me a favor.” “What’s that?” “Shut up.” NAILED IT. A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IS HERE AND DOING SMART MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL THINGS.</p>
<p>Pacey turns up at the&hellip;. I dunno, maybe the town courthouse? It’s a pretty fancy looking building. It’s presumably for the school board meeting, as there’s Ms. Jacobs sitting there in nicer clothes than we saw her earlier in the day. There’s also another lady with her who we don’t recognize&hellip;. and that is Ms. Jacobs’ attorney. Yeah, she’s not fooling around any more. We have to say any more, because she was absolutely fooling around with a 15 year recently. All questions go through the attorney, obviously, and we close out of here with a “Would you tell your client I’m sorry?”</p>
<p>We get a brief return to Baby Delivery to kill some time in between now and when the school board meeting starts, and Dawson is busy shooting footage of Joey sitting on the couch in a dour mood. Well, good thing that Bessie has final cut, because Dawson sucks at documentary filmmaking.</p>
<p>The school board meeting is underway, and it very much looks more like a ultra fancy town council meeting bordering on a low end appellate court hearing. So they’ve got questions for Ms. Jacobs and that goes on for a minute until Pacey wanders straight past Officer Doug in the back of the room to interrupt the proceedings. He’ll get his turn, gosh darn it, but Pacey says he can get all of them out of here now. The board members are very big fans of ending things early, so Pacey very carefully words a story about how he made every single word of everything about his relationship with Ms. Jacobs up. Considering that Kenny The Smoker heard maybe three minutes of talk, it’s not hard to convince the school board that this is the truth. For a second, I think that the school board president is attempting to set Pacey up because he asks “Do you deny the allegations?” and that is very much a question that you need know specifically know the allegations before you answer. However, it’s not a set up. Pacey says Ms. Jacobs is just his English teacher and nothing more.</p>
<p>Back to Baby Delivery, where Jen is starting to flip out about blood on a towel that’s over Bessie’s legs. Actually, I have questions about how that blood is getting on a surface that’s apparently only touching Bessie’s lower legs, too, but Grams is unconcerned with it, and tells Jen to get her head in the game. Grams is, however, very concerned with how annoying and distracting Dawson and his camera are, and she swats him out of the room. Seeing as he’s not actually doing what he told Bessie what he was going to be doing for Bodie’s benefit, I’m a big fan of this decision.</p>
<p>After a commercial break, we’ve got more Baby Delivery stuff, and Bessie and Jen tag team to demand that Grams do something with drugs to alleviate Bessie’s pain. I’m not saying they’re bad people and should feel bad, but at least one of them [coughJencough]should realize that they are in the Leery living room and not a hospital. Grams instead opts for The Lord’s Prayer. Hey, it’s not for Bessie, it’s for the baby! It’s also a distraction tactic, because once Bessie starts repeating the prayer back to Grams, Grams flips back into “OKAY PUSH” mode. Slick. She’s really good at this.</p>
<p>Dawson tracks down Joey outside. We get a question answered, as they refer to Grams as “Mrs. Ryan,” and since Jen’s last name is Lindley, Grams is Jen’s maternal grandmother. Nice to get that solved. Joey is worried about how things are going in there, because Bessie’s reactions to labor pain remind Joey of the pain that her mother went through after her chemotherapy treatments. Joey thinks this is a dumb reason for worrying, but 1) it’s definitely not, which Dawson points out, and 2) Dawson also comes through in the clutch by pointing out that Joey knew her mom needed her then, so how is this any different for Bessie? Nicely played, m’man.</p>
<p>Officer Doug catches up with Ms. Jacobs outside the hearing, as he desperately hopes that she doesn’t hold this against the whole Witter family. I presume that Doug is hoping she’ll hold something else against someone in the Witter family if you smell what The Rock is cookin’. Ms. Jacobs artfully plays off of what Doug says and compliments him on what a responsible and smart young brother he has, and then she hops in her convertible and drives off. Pacey watches her leave. A question: How is it still daylight out??!? This is a school day! It’s been hours!</p>
<p>Bessie’s baby is beginning to crown, so it’s time for one more big push. Joey turns up just at the right moment to give Bessie the psychological boost she needs to get it done. Out comes her baby, it’s a boy, and it is super disgustingly covered in baby goo. Dawson catches everything on tape, including Joey’s awkward smile. Maybe that’s just a Katie Holmes smile, though.</p>
<p>Pacey wanders around&hellip;.. up to Ms. Jacobs’ house. Odin help me. Just leave the nice lady alone now. She actually talks to him, and appreciates what he did in the meeting&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; and his response is to hope that she was just talking in the heat of the moment about the breaking up thing. WHAT THE HELL, DUDE?!? I actually shouted loudly at my television when this happened. Pacey is a colossal moron if he thinks he has any shot with Ms. Jacobs at this point, and he tries anyway. Anyway, she knows everything is going to be fine going forward, and it’s not because she’s going to beat Pacey to death to insure that’s the case. No, she’s already resigned, and she’s headed to her sister’s house in Rochester immediately. I presume this is Rochester, MA, not Rochester, NY, as she expects to be there tonight. She gives a standard “we all knew we would have to end this eventually speech” and Pacey’s request for a farewell kiss is denied. Pacey remains the absolute worst, because did I mention that this is happening OUT ON THE BEACH OUTSIDE HER HOUSE? Ugh. He does get a hug, though, so now Ms. Jacobs is dumb, too, and then she kisses him on the forehead and again: THEY ARE OUTSIDE IN PUBLIC ON THE BEACH. So so so so so so so so stupid.</p>
<p>At least we’re done with that stupid plot.</p>
<p>Grams relaxes at her kitchen table with a crossword. I wonder what happened to dinner? Jen comes in to say good night, and she actually has a nice conversation with her grandmother for once. Funny how just treating a person like a person works out well for you here and there.</p>
<p>We get a nice moment at the Potter house, with Bodie back from his interview. No word on what happened there, but also SURPRISE YOUR BABY IS HERE, MY GUY. Bessie insists that Joey hold her nephew, and the sisters agree that the baby has their mother’s eyes.</p>
<p>We wrap up with Pacey sulking on the beach some more, this time in the dark, and yep, you guessed it: He’s back at Ms. Jacobs’ house. Where there is a light on. And Ms. Jacobs is visibly turning the light off. Pacey turns around and walks the other way. Okay, look, I get that she had to pack a few things, but this is very much not at your sister’s house tonight right now. I checked: This is definitely the last time we see Ms. Jacobs in Capeside&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; THIS SEASON. [insert dramatic chipmunk GIF] The point is that this is definitely intended as the conclusion of this plot thread, as Ms. Jacobs literally turns out the light on Pacey.</p>
<p>And now to steal an idea from The Post Atomic Horror, a very good and very in-depth Star Trek podcast.</p>
<p>GOOD THING: I’m not even kidding, the best thing about this episode is absolutely 100% the end of the very stupid “Pacey has sex with a teacher” storyline. Good riddance to that rubbish. It was dragging the entire show down with its absurdity, and was, seemingly, the last remaining thread from the entirely way too sex crazed pilot episode.</p>
<p>BAD THING: Is school board member a full time job in Capeside? Just by logic of the first day of school was five episodes ago, we’re easily into October here. Yet somehow, there is an emergency school board meeting that is called, convened, and concluded, all before as Pacey puts it in an effort to get a chance to talk before Ms. Jacobs says anything, “in time for dinner.” And also it’s sunny outside when it’s over. In October. In Massachusetts. Aren’t most school boards essentially a volunteer type thing, and thus they don’t even start meetings until 7pm at the earliest because everyone involved needs to leave their actual paying job? Capeside isn’t even that big, or maybe it is because they have a TV station! It’s very unclear. I’m saying I have many questions here.
