<p>&lsquo;I think this will be a decade of family&hellip; I come from a family of four children,&rsquo; she told the publication.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A lot of mums could read this and think, &ldquo;Yeah, try having one first&rdquo;. Hopefully, I’ll have a big family, but I&rsquo;ll take it one by one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Bar Refaeli is aching for her former life of spontaneity before the coronavirus pandemic surged across the globe.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old model appeared to be in a nostalgic mood on Tuesday as she posted dozens of throwback photos of herself galavanting around the world when traveling and dining out were the norm.</p>
<p>Each photo of her Instagram Story showed an example of the things she currently is &ldquo;missing&rdquo; while self-isolating amid the global pandemic. Her Story began with several red carpet photos showcasing her more glamorous looks taken at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>

<p>But more racy snaps showed the model&rsquo;s wild side, as she is seen donning bikinis and letting loose in public.</p>
<p>One of the more risque snaps posted to her account shows the blonde beauty in a tiny bikini nearly falling off a pool float.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Falling asleep drunk on floaties,&rdquo; she captioned the pic as one of the things she&rsquo;s longing for.</p>
<p>In another pic, the Israeli model is mid-cartwheel with her legs in the air as her shirt falls over her head, exposing her bra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exposing myself in public,&rdquo; the mother of three captioned the pic.</p>
<p>Another shows her cuddled up close to her friends as she declared she misses &ldquo;hugging her friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stunner also joked that she&rsquo;s &ldquo;NOT missing heels&rdquo; as she posted a photo of herself being helped out of a car while rocking nude stilettos.</p>
<p>The Instagram Story showed Refaeli on adventures in some of the world&rsquo;s major cities, including London, Paris, Mykonos, Barcelona, San Francisco as well as her journey to the Great Wall of China. She captioned one photo writing that she &ldquo;even&rdquo; misses jet lag.</p>

<h3 id="bar-refaeli-sizzles-in-a-plunging-nude-swimsuit-in-new-photos">&ldquo;Bar Refaeli Sizzles In A Plunging Nude Swimsuit In New Photos&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bar-Refaeli-1.jpg" alt="img">
The fomer &lsquo;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&rsquo; model wowed in her swimwear.</p>
<p>Former Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue model Bar Refaeli sizzled in a new upload shared to her Instagram account this week, showing her as she flaunted her fit and toned body in a nude swimsuit. The star flashed plenty of skin in the curve-hugging look in a hue which almost matched the color of her skin.</p>
<p>The post was shared on May 29 and was made up of two sizzling photos of the Israeli supermodel as she posed for the camera.</p>
<p>The first photo showed the mom of three standing in profile next to a swimming pool with both of her hands placed on her hips.</p>
<p>Bar turned her head to the left to show off her tan and her obvious natural beauty with her long, blond hair pulled up into a ponytail.</p>
<p>The star appeared to ditch the makeup and seemingly went barefaced for her pool day. She accessorized with a pair of gold hoop earrings.</p>
<p>As for her bathing suit, the model and TV host’s look was made up of a nude ribbed material with scalloped edges along both the top and bottom. It also plunged low at the chest and featured a lace-up design that was tied with a thick, white string.</p>
<p>The one-piece had thicker straps over both shoulders with the same scalloped edge.</p>
<p>In the second photo, Bar — who earlier showed off her bikini body in a string look in the swimming pool — let her hair down as she lay on her back.</p>
<p>The model, who previously dated Leonardo DiCaprio prior to finding love with husband Adi Ezra, lay back on a gray sofa and rested her right hand on her head while she looked off into the distance. Her left hand was placed on her torso as she enjoyed some downtime next to a sunhat with a black ribbon band.</p>
<p>Bar’s latest swimwear upload has received over 33,800 likes and inspired hundreds of comments.</p>
<p>“Always beautiful,” one person said.</p>
<p>Another fan called the 34-year-old star “gorgeous” with three heart eye emoji.</p>
<p>“So pretty it hurts my brain,” another comment read with a heart eye emoji.</p>
<p>But this isn’t the only time recently that Bar has treated her fans to a good look at her swimwear.</p>
<p>It was just earlier this week that she wowed her followers once again with another set of sizzling snaps. That time, she showed plenty of skin in another ribbed number, an olive green bikini, as she lay back on a boat.

The former &lsquo;Sports Illustrated&rsquo; model sizzled in a series of new bikini shots.</p>
<p>Bar Refaeli gave fans a look at her flawless bikini body in a series of new photos shared to her Instagram account this week. The former Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue model and TV host wowed her 3 million followers on May 27. In the pic, she lied back in a ribbed green bikini seemingly taking a trip out on the water.</p>
<p>The Israeli swimwear model looked every inch the superstar in her two-piece as she soaked up the sunshine. In the first photo, Bar ly down on her side with both of her arms stretched out above her head. She bent both of her legs slightly to flash her glowing tan and toned torso.</p>
<p>The photo was shot from a low angle and was positioned to give fans a good look at her toned model body while she looked towards the sun. What appeared to be the deck of a boat and the vast blue ocean could be seen slightly blurred behind her.</p>
<p>The upload was made up of three different sizzling swimwear snaps.</p>
<p>In the second photo, Bar looked off to the right-hand side with her blond hair blowing in the breeze. The Eurovision Song Contest 2019 co-host rocked a pair of black sunglasses. She accessorized with a pair of stud earrings and a gold necklace.</p>
<p>In the third snap, the mom of two — who previously sizzled in a skimpy orange bikini — looked down as she gave fans another look at her bikini top and all-over tan.</p>
<p>Bar rocked the same bikini in all three snaps. Her two-piece was made up of an olive-colored ribbed crop top with thin straps over both of her toned shoulders. The top sat just below her chest to show off her flat tummy.</p>
<p>The star, who previously dated Leonardo DiCaprio for four years between 2005 and 2009, kept things matching as she rocked a pair of skimpy bottoms in the same ribbed material which sat below her bellybutton.</p>
<p>Bar captioned the upload, which has received over 37,000 likes, with three mermaid emoji.</p>
<p>Plenty of fans flooded the comments section with sweet and impressed messages.</p>
<p>One Instagram user called the 34-year-old model a “Gorgeous princess” with a heart eye and a red heart emoji.</p>
<p>“Wow,” another comment read with three heart-eyed faces.</p>
<p>“Wooow amazing and [spectacular] mermaid,” another person wrote.</p>
<p>But this isn’t the first time that Bar has rocked a bikini for her followers. She previously wowed fans in a plunging white scalloped-edge string bikini when she shot a gorgeous selfie during a sunny trip to the beach last year.

<p>The family have been isolating in Israel, who along with many other countries, went into lockdown in a bid to slow the rate of COVID-19.</p>
<p>On March 19, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency and announced Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions was announced.

<h3 id="bar-refaeli-aus-jedem-winkel-wunderschön">&ldquo;Bar Refaeli: Aus jedem Winkel wunderschön&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bilder.bild.de/fotos/bar-refaeli-aus-jedem-winkel-wunderschoen-201440970-70914494/Bild/4.bild.jpg" alt="img">
Supermodel Bar Refaeli (34) lässt sich in Tel Aviv derzeit von der Sonne verwöhnen. Wie das aussieht, hat sie ihren Fans jetzt mit einer Reihe von Bikini-Schnappschüssen auf Instagram demonstriert.</p>
<p>Und so viel sei gesagt: Schöner sonnt sich kaum jemand!</p>
<p>Schippert im Boot übers Meer: Model Bar Refaeli Foto: instagram/barrefaeli</p>
<p>Auf den sonnig-heißen Fotos trägt die 34-Jährige einen knappen, grünen Bikini und entspannt sich an Deck einen Bootes auf einem weich gepolsterten Liegestuhl.</p>
<p>Während zwei der drei Schnappschüsse das Gesicht, die blond-goldenen Haare und den Oberkörper des Supermodels zeigen, präsentiert Bar Refaeli auf einem anderen Bild ihren Körper in voller Pracht.</p>
<p>Auch Interessant</p>
<p>Das Foto scheint am unteren Ende der Sonnenliege aufgenommen worden zu sein, sodass die langen Beine des Models im Fokus des Bildes stehen. Bar streckt ihre Gliedmaßen von sich, präsentiert so ihre Silhouette. Trotz der Pose schafft sie es, ganz relaxt und losgelöst auszusehen. Diese Frau versteht ihr Handwerk …</p>

<p>Die Fans sind vom Anblick des sich sonnenden Models ganz entzückt, schreiben zu dem Bild: „Die schönste Badenixe, die ich kenne“ oder „Mir fehlen die Worte. Du siehst so froh aus“.</p>
<p>Gründe, um froh zu sein, hat Bar Refaeli allemal. Denn neben der israelischen Sonne wurde sie auch vom Mutterglück geküsst. Erst vor wenigen Monaten brachte die 34-Jährige ihr drittes Kind, Söhnchen David, zur Welt.
