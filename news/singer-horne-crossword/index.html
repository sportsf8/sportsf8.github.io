<p>“My grandmother ate a Snickers bar with a knife and fork, and she drank her Hennessy from a ‘Sesame Street’ mug,” Ms. Lumet said. “She had an entire drawer of false eyelashes that I thought were spiders, she had an assortment of turbans with bangs in them, and she had this endless supply of really weird grandma candy.”</p>
<p>Younger guests talked about how they connected with Ms. Horne’s legacy. For Common, it was her music; for Yance Ford, a filmmaker, it was her star turn in “The Wiz”; for BJ the Chicago Kid, it was her appearance on “The Cosby Show.”</p>
<p>Ms. Knowles did not grant interviews on her way into the event. But her mother said that Ms. Knowles had been an agent for social change since childhood. “From 12 years old she was an activist,” Ms. Knowles-Lawson said. “She started a petition at her school to get rid of a teacher that was terrible. I was very proud of her.”</p>
<p>Did the petition work? “It did not,” she said. “But it made the teacher change her attitude.”</p>
<p>Writers’ Night</p>
<p>Three nights later, it was PEN America’s turn at Town Hall, this time to dole out the organization’s literary awards.

<h3 id="belafonte-recalls-hornes-activism-as-solange-is-honored">&ldquo;Belafonte recalls Horne’s activism as Solange is honored&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.spokesman.com/photos/2019/12/07/Lena_Horne_Prize.JPG_gOZVbgn_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6" alt="img">
By Nekesa Mumbi Moody ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>
<p>Lena Horne was a fierce advocate for civil rights in her later years, but that part of her legacy is often pushed behind her glamorous image. Her good friend Harry Belafonte hopes that a new award in her honor will push that aspect of her life front and center.</p>
<p>“She had a huge burden. She was black, she was hugely popular, and she had to continually safeguard that environment of hers, the celebrity,” he said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. “Her outspokenness didn’t come until later in life.”</p>
<p>He added: “That last sparkle of life was the place where she felt most nourished. She found her voice, socially and politically, beyond the enormous notoriety she had as the most beautiful black women in the universe, and one of the great singers.”</p>
<p>The newly created Lena Horne Prize for Artists Creating Social Impact was announced last month. It was revealed Friday that Solange Knowles would be the first recipient of the prize to be awarded Feb. 28 in a ceremony at New York’s Town Hall. Besides the honor, the singer and artist will receive $100,000, which she plans to donate to the Project Row Houses in Houston, an art nonprofit dedicated to uplifting and engaging the black community through the exploration of its art, culture and history.</p>
<p>In a statement, Knowles said she was beyond humbled” to receive the award and noted that at 12, she played Glinda the Good Witch in “The Wiz,” the very role Horne played in the 1978 film.</p>
<p>“It was then that I learned about Lena’s dedicated activism and fearless integrity as a woman and groundbreaking artist,” she said. “I am honored to be receiving an award that bears her name and continue her legacy of using the arts to inspire reflection and evoke change.”</p>
<p>Horne, who died at 92 in 2010, was a pioneering entertainer. She was considered the first black actress to make waves when she signed to MGM and starred in black-audience films like “Stormy Weather.” Though she was considered one of the most glamorous stars in her heyday in the 1940s and ’50s, her opportunities were curtailed due to racism. However, she still flourished through the decades and won a Tony among other accolades.</p>
<p>Belafonte and Horne were close friends who also performed and recorded together. They also banded together due to the racism they endured. Belafonte recalled the difficulty they faced despite their immense fame in New York City, where some of the most exclusive buildings would not allow either one of them to live in the 1950s. Belafonte ended up shielding his identity and buying one of those buildings, and gave Horne the penthouse.</p>
<p>“I was very glad that I found the resources to do it,” he said. “I began to load it up with people who were quite prominent. … like Sidney Poitier, like Lena Horne, like Danny Glover, who came much later.“</p>
<p>Belafonte says Horne became more politically involved the closer she got to like-minded entertainers like himself and Paul Robeson, and wishes more entertainers of today would follow in her footsteps.</p>
<p>“That desire not to offend is all about money and it’s all about popularity as an end in itself. What’s the point in being popular if you can’t popularize things that are worth knowing about?” he said.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of great black people all over the place. My deep regret is that political power has been somewhat blurred by people turning that power into a misuse of popularity.”

<h3 id="jack-sheldon-jazz-trumpeter-and-singer-dies-at-88">&ldquo;Jack Sheldon, jazz trumpeter and singer, dies at 88&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6048924/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F93%2F3e%2Fdf243cb547b7b77dd220c2a6027f%2Fla-et-ms-jack-sheldon.jpg" alt="img">
Jack Sheldon, a jazz trumpeter, singer and bandleader who had a parallel career as an actor in television sitcoms, and whose playing, singing and stand-up comedy were heard for nearly two decades on the Merv Griffin television show, has died. He was 88.</p>
<p>His death, on Dec. 27, was announced by Cynthia Jimenez, sister of Sheldon’s longtime manager, Dianne Jimenez.</p>
<p>While Sheldon’s career spanned music, television and film, he was the first to credit his jazz trumpet playing as fuel for his far-reaching successes in the entertainment world.</p>
<p>In the ‘50s, he was one of the vital participants in the West Coast jazz movement. Performing with the likes of Art Pepper, Curtis Counce, Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker — whom he called “the James Dean of American jazz” — Sheldon insisted on spicing his playing with the dynamic energies of bebop amid the cooler, more laid-back orientation of the West Coast jazz style. And he often did so side by side in spontaneous jamming with Baker, his close friend and fellow trumpet player.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Chettie had an old ’32 Ford and a big Cadillac, and he drove real fast,” Sheldon said in a 2002 interview with Times columnist Steve Lopez. “We’d just go riding all over the place, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, any nightclub we could find, and we’d play for no money. We’d just walk in and say, ‘Can we play?’”</p>
<p>And play he did. As often as possible, in public and in the practice room. Throughout his life, Sheldon maintained his playing skills via a regimen of hard work. At 79, he still insisted that “my chops are good, so long as I practice every day.”</p>
<p>The results of that determined work habit were apparent to Southland jazz audiences for decades. Sheldon performed on a regular basis in Los Angeles clubs, usually with the small ensemble he called his California Cool Quartet, occasionally with his 18-piece big band. In November 2010, jazz critic Tony Gieske, reviewing a musical celebration of Sheldon’s 79th birthday, praised his “incomparably rich and full trumpet sound.”</p>
<p>Sheldon’s alternate career, as an actor and humorist, began to surface in the 1960s. In mid-decade, he co-starred in the CBS sitcom “The Cara Williams Show.” In the 1966-67 season, he starred in his own CBS sitcom, “Run, Buddy Run.”</p>
<p>His most visible television appearances, however, took place during the 18 years in which he appeared on “The Merv Griffin Show.” Playing in Mort Lindsey’s Orchestra, Sheldon’s participation ranged from trumpet soloing to humorous interludes in which he often assumed the role of Griffin’s comedic foil.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Merv’s really been great to me,” Sheldon told The Times in 1991. “Through him I’ve got to work with every bandleader ever known: Basie, Dorsey, Glenn Miller, even Lawrence Welk. I’ve gotten to sing with Ethel Merman and do magic with Orson Welles.”</p>
<p>Both aspects of his musical career — his trumpet playing and his unique vocal qualities — have created memorable, if strikingly different, moments. It is Sheldon’s atmospheric trumpet sound that is heard playing Johnny Mandel’s poignant theme, “The Shadow of Your Smile,” on the soundtrack of the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton classic film “The Sandpiper” (1965).</p>
<p>His jazz vocalizing provoked Times critic Zan Stewart to describe him as “one of the top jazz singers of the day … simply splendid.” And it is Sheldon’s amiably quirky voice that brings wit and humor to the “Schoolhouse Rock!” cartoons of the ‘70s via his rendering of songs such as “Conjunction Junction” and “I’m Just a Bill.”</p>
<p>Jack Sheldon was born Nov. 30, 1931, in Jacksonville, Fla. Studying trumpet as a child, he was playing professionally by the time he was in his teens. In 1947, he relocated to Los Angeles. His mother, Jen Loven, was a swimming teacher and the owner of a Hollywood swimming school where many film stars and their families learned to swim.</p>

<p>By the mid ‘50s, after serving in the Air Force, Sheldon actively participated in the burgeoning West Coast jazz scene. In addition to his performances and recordings with Wardell Gray, Herb Geller, Jimmy Giuffre, Gerry Mulligan and Art Pepper, among many others, he performed in the big bands of Benny Goodman and Stan Kenton.</p>
<p>Like many other Los Angeles-based jazz artists, he was also a busy session musician. “We all worked in the studios,” he told The Times. “That’s how we made our living, so we thought we’d be heroes like the guys in the movies, like Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart.”</p>
<p>But Sheldon’s acting career — primarily doing humorous roles in television sitcoms, as well as his long run on “The Merv Griffin Show” — was most powerfully affected by his natural gifts for humor and a capacity to improvise as freely with words as he did with notes. He also credited the influence of the comics he shared the stage with in performances at places such as the Playboy Clubs.</p>
<p>“I worked a lot with Mort Sahl and Lenny Bruce,” he recalled. “Lenny thought of himself as a jazz guy. He had the timing and all. And Mort Sahl used to hang out with all the jazz guys, too.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Sheldon played, sang or acted in dozens of films and television shows. He can be heard on more than 200 CDs and recordings, backing the likes of Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Mel Torme, Lena Horne, George Shearing and Anita O’Day, as well as leading his own Jack Sheldon Orchestra and California Cool Quartet.

<h3 id="be-open-to-whatever-comes-vanessa-williams-mentors-black-women-girls-ahead-of-spokane-concerts">&ldquo;‘Be open to whatever comes’: Vanessa Williams mentors black women, girls ahead of Spokane concerts&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.spokesman.com/photos/2019/12/21/SRX_VANESSA_WILLIAMS_1.JPG_fHTRAND_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6" alt="img">
Sandy Williams, editor of The Black Lens, says she always reaches out to notable African American figures who come to town to see if they will talk with local young people about their experiences.</p>
<p>“In a place like Spokane, you feel so removed from people who are iconic in the black community,” Williams said. Seeing them in person “makes you feel more empowered.”</p>
<p>Often times celebrities decline to make time, but Williams said she wasn’t surprised when iconic singer and actor Vanessa Williams, who first rose to fame as the first African American Miss America, quickly agreed to meet with a group of young black women and girls ahead of her Holiday Pops concert at the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox.</p>
<p>“She’s always been incredibly gracious,” said Sandy Williams, who interviewed Vanessa Williams for the December issue of her newspaper. “She’s been known for that over the years. She has a commitment to young people.”</p>
<p>Vanessa Williams told 15 girls and women from local grade schools and other parts of the community about how she worked hard, was open to new opportunities and persevered to find success.</p>
<p>“It’s always important to talk to women who identify with who I am,” said Williams, who found inspiration from the likes of singer Lena Horne and actor Diahann Carroll while growing up seeing few black figures in popular media. “If I can give a little bit of my strategy in life and help people become who they want to be, why not?”</p>
<p>At the end of her sophomore year at Syracuse University in 1983, after her theater show was canceled, Williams agreed to enter the Miss Greater Syracuse scholarship pageant and won. She later was crowned Miss New York and then became Miss America for 1984.</p>
<p>“At 20 years old, I had no intention of being Miss America,” Williams told the group of girls. “If I hadn’t taken that chance … who knows where I would have been.”</p>
<p>But while she was the reigning Miss America, a magazine published nude photos of Williams without her authorization. Williams was forced to resign her position and lost lucrative opportunities. She later found success as a recording artist and actor.</p>
<p>“The mindset is to be open to whatever comes,” Williams told a girl who asked what she tells herself each morning. “You never know what is going to be afforded to you in your life. … Be open to people that come into your life to give you new challenges.”</p>
<p>Williams also told the girls about when her mother first told her about the particular challenges women of color face.</p>
<p>“You know you’re going to have to do better than everyone else just to be considered,” Williams remembered her mother telling her in second or third grade. She added, “Being good isn’t good enough. As a woman of color it’s not enough just to get by. You’re going to have to make a splash, and you’re going to have to work hard to get noticed. People will notice you if they know that you are hungry and willing to work.”</p>
<p>When facing adversity, Williams told the women and girls to think of themselves like trees in inclement weather.</p>
<p>“There might be some snow, might break some branches. There might be rain. There might be wind. … But it doesn’t change the tree,” she said. “Figure out who you are and know that whatever comes in, tries to knock you down, tries to harm you and break you, it hasn’t changed who you are.”</p>
<p>Mentors are especially helpful for guidance and finding avenues for one’s passions, Williams said.</p>
<p>“You can always find somebody who can help you,” Williams said. “Find out what you’re really good at and get better and better, and spend the time with it. And you never know what doors will open.”</p>
<p>A number of the girls who came to meet Williams were from the Rogers High School Black Student Union. The club found out about the opportunity after Sandy Williams, The Black Lens editor, reached out to school officials.</p>
<p>Other girls found there way to the event through connections with Sandy Williams and Terrain Executive Director Ginger Ewing.</p>
<p>“I definitely haven’t had many examples or mentors who look like me,” said Sarah Torres, a 23-year-old Spokane Falls Community College fine arts student. “It was awesome to get that perspective. … I just feel more validated.”</p>
<p>Torres said she dreams of helping Spokane’s art community grow through nonprofit work, building studio spaces or addressing other needs.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a lot of potential here in the city,” she said.</p>
<p>Melissa Pirie, an 11-year-old Logan Elementary School student, said meeting Williams was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. She said she enjoys singing and dancing but harbors some fear about performing in public.</p>
<p>“I feel like it (meeting Williams) was a pep talk to go for your dreams,” Pirie said.</p>
<p>Evergreen Elementary School student Aaliyah X, 10, said she listened to William’s Christmas album before the event and was encouraged by Williams’ response to her question about what joy means to her.</p>
<p>“Joy is love,” Williams said. “It’s being open to the love that you give, the love that you receive, the love that you see around.”</p>
<p>And meeting Williams was a full-circle moment for Cecilia Moore, who saw Williams for the first time soon after she’d been crowned Miss America in 1984.</p>
<p>“I have followed her ever since,” said Moore, who drove from Hayden, Idaho, and brought her CDs from growing up for Williams to sign. “I love what she said about following your dreams: You have to put the work in.”

<h3 id="dalton-baldwin-an-eminence-among-accompanists-dies-at-87">&ldquo;Dalton Baldwin, an Eminence Among Accompanists, Dies at 87&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/26/obituaries/00Baldwin/00Baldwin-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Dalton Baldwin, an American pianist and recording artist who was acclaimed for nearly six decades as a recital accompanist to major singers, including Elly Ameling, Jessye Norman and especially the French baritone Gérard Souzay, died on Dec. 12 in Kunming, in the Yunnan Province of China. He was 87.</p>
<p>His death, a week before his 88th birthday, was announced by Ben Turman, the vice consul of the United States Consulate in Chengdu. Mr. Baldwin had recently completed three weeks of performances and coaching sessions with students in Japan and was returning from a short trip to Myanmar to visit Buddhist temples when he collapsed on a flight to Tokyo. The plane made an emergency landing in Kunming, where he was taken to a hospital and died.</p>
<p>He had performed on five continents and made more than 100 recordings over his career.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Baldwin was an eminence among accompanists, he was not fond of that word. Like many of his colleagues, he preferred to be called simply a pianist.</p>
<p>Critics affirmed that he was no mere accompanist. While consistently praising the refinement, sensitivity and technical command of his playing, they routinely described him as an equal partner to the singers he performed with.

<h3 id="richard-conrad-briefly-a-bel-canto-star-dies-at-84">&ldquo;Richard Conrad, Briefly a Bel Canto Star, Dies at 84&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/obituaries/10CONRAD/10CONRAD-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Richard Conrad, a tenor who was plucked from obscurity by the acclaimed soprano Joan Sutherland to take part in a landmark 1963 recording, and who later overcame a throat injury suffered in an assault and found a successful third act producing lesser-known operas, died on Aug. 26 at his home in Eliot, Me. He was 84.</p>
<p>The cause was heart disease, his brother, Howard Conrad, said.</p>
<p>In 1961, Mr. Conrad, then a member of Boston Camerata, an early-music ensemble, gave a splendid performance of a florid aria from Monteverdi’s “Orfeo” in a concert at the Museum of Fine Arts. It attracted the attention of Ms. Sutherland, who was singing in Boston at the time.</p>
<p>“One of the players from the Camerata concert told her, ‘There’s a guy here who sings just like you,’” Mr. Conrad recalled in an interview in 1995 with The Boston Globe. He was referring to Ms. Sutherland’s technical expertise in bel canto opera, the style that flourished during the late 18th and early 19th centuries and was characterized by long vocal lines rich with passagework and coloratura embellishments.</p>
<p>Ms. Sutherland and the conductor Richard Bonynge, her husband and frequent collaborator, invited Mr. Conrad to audition two months later. He prepared two Handel arias.
