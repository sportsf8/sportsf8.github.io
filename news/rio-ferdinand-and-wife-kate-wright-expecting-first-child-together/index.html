<p>Rio Ferdinand and wife Kate Wright have announced that they are expecting their first child together.</p>
<p>Revealing the happy news on Instagram, the couple shared a video of Ferdinand&rsquo;s three children celebrating after being told their step-mother was expecting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got our wish, another Ferdinand on route!!&rdquo; the former England defender, 41, wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to go through this whole pregnancy together and then bring our little human into this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her own post, reality star Wright, 29, said: &ldquo;The crazy house is about to get a little bit crazier.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time I watch this it makes me cry, the best reaction. Baby Ferdy, we are all so excited to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news of the pregnancy comes nine months after the couple tied the knot in September last year with a ceremony in Turkey.</p>
<p>They have been in a relationship since 2017 and got engaged a year later with the help of Ferdinand&rsquo;s three children - Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and Tia, nine - from his marriage with his late wife, Rebecca Ellison.</p>
<p>Ellison died in 2015 after being diagnosed with breast cancer for a second time. She was aged 34.</p>

Rio Ferdinand and his wife Kate joined thousands of people to demonstrate following the death of George Floyd in America, and they took Rio&rsquo;s three children to be part of the protest.</p>
<p>The couple attended the Black Lives Matter demo at Parliament Square in London on Saturday with Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia.</p>
<p>Sharing photos on their Instagram, the family of five wore face masks and carried a sign that read &lsquo;BLM.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In one photo Manchester United icon Rio stood with his arm around his wife as they stood among the protesters carrying signs.</p>
<p>Another photo showed one of his children holding up a sign with his back to the camera.</p>
<p>Rio, 41, explained to his 4.3million followers: &ldquo;Taking my family to Parliament Square today to be a part of the protest was very emotional.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The importance of supporting such a cause can not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Educating the next generation is an absolute must.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our children to have been a part of such an important protest is something that I’m sure will have a lasting effect on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;#blm #blacklivesmatter #protest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Kate, 29, explained to her followers why they made the decision to go as a family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a moving and overwhelming experience for us today,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>(Image: CREDIT Kate and Rio Ferdinand Instagram)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, we were cautious about going and taking the children, but we are so glad we made the decision to go, it’s something we will all remember for the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It felt so good to be part of the movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our kids are the future, for us it’s so important for them to understand what is happening in the world and be part of the change, we need to continue to educate ourselves and the younger generation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking one knee with thousands of protesters and having a minutes silence is a moment that will stay with me for a very long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stand united #blacklivesmatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rio and former The Only Way Is Essex star Kate married in September after going public with their relationship in 2017.</p>
<p>Fans have been delighted to see Rio find happiness again after the tragedy of losing his wife Rebecca Ellison to cancer in May 2015.</p>
<p>Thousands gathered across the country on Saturday to demonstrate against the brutal killing of Mr Floyd, despite being urged by police and ministers to stay away for fear of spreading COVID-19.</p>
<p>Protesters went down on one knee and raised a fist in the air in an expression of solidarity towards Mr Floyd, and making a stand against wider racist violence and discrimination.

<h3 id="rio-ferdinands-kids-to-his-wife-kate-youre-not-going-to-have-sex-in-lockdown-when-we-home-maybe-october">&ldquo;Rio Ferdinand&rsquo;s kids to his wife Kate: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going to have sex in lockdown when we home, maybe October&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.mid-day.com/images/2020/jun/cut-rio-kate_d.jpg" alt="img">
Former England footballer Rio Ferdinand&rsquo;s wife Kate has revealed her stepchildren are keen on having an addition to the family and keep questioning the couple on their plans. Kate, 29, who tied the knot with Rio, 41, last year is mothering the footballer&rsquo;s kids—Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and Tia, nine— from his first marriage.</p>
<p>The former reality star said the kids are having awkward conversations with her about having a baby. &ldquo;Conversations have got a bit graphic with the kids. They&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;When are you going to do it, then?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s so funny. One of them said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going to have sex in lockdown while we&rsquo;re in the house so I think you&rsquo;re going to have it in October.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m having this conversation!'&rdquo; Kate told British tabloid, The Sun.</p>
<p>And while Kate is looking forward to having a baby, she insists there is no time frame for it. &ldquo;We would like to have a baby but there&rsquo;s no set time&hellip;that&rsquo;s just part of being a parent, isn&rsquo;t it? Where is the love life? We&rsquo;re getting a little bit of time here and there, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it couple time. We&rsquo;re busy, our time together might be talking about cleaning the toilet, rather than, &lsquo;Oh, I love you so much!&rsquo; &quot; she explained.</p>

<p>Rio Ferdinand&rsquo;s children have drawn up a schedule for him and his wife Kate to conceive another child</p>
<p>The 29-year-old former reality star has revealed her stepchildren - Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia - have been quizzing the couple on when they plan to add to the family</p>
<p>10 June 2020</p>
<p>She recalled: &ldquo;Conversations have got a bit graphic with the kids. They&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;When are you going to do it, then?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s so funny. One of them said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not going to have sex in lockdown while we&rsquo;re in the house so I think you&rsquo;re going to have it in October.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;I can’t believe I&rsquo;m having this conversation!'&rdquo;</p>
<p>And whilst Kate would love to have a baby, she insists there is &ldquo;no set time&rdquo; to adding to their family.</p>
<p>She shared: &ldquo;We would like to have a baby but there&rsquo;s no set time &hellip; That&rsquo;s just part of being a parent, isn&rsquo;t it? Where is the love life?! We&rsquo;re getting a little bit of time here and there, but I wouldn&rsquo;t call it couple time. We&rsquo;re busy, our time together might be talking about cleaning the toilet, rather than, &lsquo;Oh, I love you so much!'&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former &lsquo;The Only Way Is Essex&rsquo; star admits there are times she feels &ldquo;useless&rdquo; as a parent, but she is trying to balance things as much as she can, particularly in lockdown.</p>
<p>She told The Sun on Sunday&rsquo;s Fabulous magazine: &ldquo;Sometimes I&rsquo;m great, sometimes I think I&rsquo;m useless, but that&rsquo;s just part of being parent, isn’t it? You&rsquo;re trying to clean, be a teacher, a cook, a wife. There&rsquo;s a lot to do. I think it&rsquo;s taken its toll a bit now. I’m trying to be positive, but it&rsquo;s difficult. It&rsquo;s just like normal motherhood, but times 100. You love them, you’re laughing, you’re having a great time and the next minute you just want to kill them, because they’re driving you mad.&rdquo;</p>
