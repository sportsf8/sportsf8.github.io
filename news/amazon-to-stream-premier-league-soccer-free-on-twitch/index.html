<p>Amazon will start streaming live Premier League football (soccer) games free on Twitch later this month. Twitch viewers in the UK will be able to access four matches, starting with the Crystal Palace vs. Burnley match on June 29th. Deadline reports that the Premier League streams will also include Twitch chat, so expect to see thousands of fans shouting virtually from the sidelines and spamming emoji alongside the games. Amazon will also be streaming its Premier League games on Prime Video for subscribers.</p>
<p>This is the first time that Amazon has chosen to stream Premier League games through its Twitch service, free of charge. Amazon secured the rights to stream Premier League matches in the UK for three years back in 2018, and streamed multiple simultaneous games through Prime Video during the holidays lasts year.</p>
<p>These additional four fixtures are part of the Premier League’s coronavirus restart strategy which sees rights loosened to make football more accessible during the pandemic. This has allowed broadcasters like the BBC to show games for the first time, alongside additional games airing on TV to make up for a lack of crowds in stadiums.</p>
<p>Like Sky Sports, Amazon is also working with EA Sports to provide FIFA-powered virtual crowd noise during games. The Premier League returned to TV screens in the UK last night on Sky Sports, with a choice between FIFA’s crowd noise or the ability to hear players on the pitch.

<h3 id="set-up-a-premier-league-live-stream-and-watch-the-premier-league-online-wherever-you-are">&ldquo;Set up a Premier League live stream and watch the Premier League online wherever you are&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p5RZt3bgQtxAToMo7VBoBP-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
Football is back and you can swot up on how to get a Premier League live stream set up with our viewing guide for the rest of the season. Every football fan needs to know how to watch the Premier League online as every Premiership team gets their seasons back underway.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty to play for still too, up and down the table. Well, maybe not quite so much at the very top as Liverpool should stroll to the title given how far ahead they are, but there is certainly tension and a nailbiting finish ahead for those at the bottom of the table (my own club included) and for those chasing European places. That&rsquo;s why knowing how to watch the Premier League online is going to be incredibly important from now on.</p>
<p>And while in normal times, there are some severe paywalls in place to watch matches, the unbelievable news this time around - due to the circumstances - a whole host of matches will be available to watch online FOR FREE. That means there&rsquo;ll be so many more free Premier League live stream options than ever. And with a slightly strange way of watching and taking the games in being proposed, we&rsquo;ll make sure that this page is as chock filled as it can be as we approach the restart properly.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, the top of the table does seem like a foregone conclusion - the old adage of &lsquo;anything can happen in football&rsquo; notwithstanding - with Liverpool so many points ahead and only two or three games away from wrapping it all up, but there&rsquo;s intrigue everywhere else still which will still make for enormously interesting Premier League live streams.</p>
<p>In the middle of the table, it&rsquo;s up for grabs as to who&rsquo;ll make the Champions and Europa League spots, and maybe plucky Sheffield United will hold their own among the big boys and continue their excellent season by placing in the top places. And at the bottom, there is loads to play for. I&rsquo;m conflicted here because I&rsquo;m very pleased that the Premier League is back, but this also means my beloved West Ham will probably be relegated this year - but at least now I get to watch it bathed in mid-summer sunshine&hellip; My own pessimism aside, clubs like West Ham will come out of the break with the bit between their teeth as their survival in the league is so valuable - in every way. With only 9 or 10 games to go, we&rsquo;ll soon start to see who the most likely for the drop are. Though, remember, anything can happen in football&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, you&rsquo;re here to find out how to get a Premier League live stream setup so let&rsquo;s get to it.</p>
<p>Premier League live stream: where to watch the games</p>
<p>As mentioned above briefly a whole range of games are going to be free to air - along with a few that will stick to being behind paid subscriptions. Perhaps the biggest story out of that arrangement is that BBC Sport and Amazon Prime will broadcast four live matches each. The BBC hasn&rsquo;t had any live Premier League action since its inception back in 1992; and on top of that there&rsquo;s will be extra highlights programmes on the Beeb - huzzah! Elsewhere, Sky will be making 25 of its matches free to watch live through the channel &lsquo;Pick&rsquo; and anyone with an Amazon Prime account will get a few games for free.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s exactly how it will be shared across the broadcasters:</p>
<p>BBC Sport (four live matches; free to air)</p>
<p>Amazon Prime (four live matches; free to air)</p>
<p>Sky Sports (64 live matches; 25 free to air)</p>
<p>BT Sport (20 live matches)</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a selection of the next games coming up:</p>
<p>Watford vs Leicester, Saturday, June 20th @ 12.30pm BST on BT Sport</p>
<p>Brighton vs Arsenal, Saturday, June 20th @ 3pm BST on BT Sport</p>
<p>West Ham vs Wolves, Saturday, June 20th @ 5.30pm BST on Sky Sports/Now TV</p>
<p>Bournemouth vs Crystal Palance, Saturday, June 20th @ 7:45pm BST on BBC</p>
<p>Newcastle vs Sheffield United, Sunday, June 21st @ 2pm BST on Sky Sports/Now TV</p>
<p>Aston Villa vs Chelsea, Sunday, June 21st @ 4.15pm BST on Sky Sports/Now TV</p>
<p>Get a Premier League live stream in the UK</p>
<p>Various - BBC, BT Sport, Amazon Prime, and Sky</p>
<p>For the first time in a long time, there&rsquo;s no actual simple answer to where it is best to stream the Premier League in the UK. And that&rsquo;s for one very good reason: all of them will be live and a whole host of games are going to be FREE. So, while you&rsquo;d usually have to plump for one or both of the big usual suspects in Sky Sports(or Sky Sports via Now TV), or BT Sport, the big news for the Premier League restart is that all 92 games left to be played will be broadcast on live UK TV. What&rsquo;s more, they&rsquo;ll be divided among Sky, BT, and Amazon. On top of this, the BBC will be airing a small handful of games live too - the first time in the Premier League&rsquo;s history that the competition has come to the BBC. While Sky has confirmed that 25 of its 64 games will be available on its free-to-air channel, Sky Pick, the others, however, have yet to break cover or show their hand so we are not sure yet - though expect that to change with each day that passes. If you find yourself outside the UK and want to watch the Premier League online with any of these broadcasters, then fear not, and grab a VPN to get your football hit no matter where you are.</p>
<p>How to watch the EPL in the US</p>
<p>NBC</p>
<p>US readers are still best off going to NBC. However, to see out the remainder of European football seasons the broadcaster is offering two separate packages for soccer fans. First the Matchday Pass; this will set you back $39.99 and will get you 140 exclusive live games. And, secondly, the Premier League Pass, for $64.99, which will get you, well, pretty much the whole thing - extending the coverage of live matches through to highlights, replays, analyses and more. Remember, if you&rsquo;re outside of the States and want your usual NBC coverage, check out the VPN route to gain access to the action - more details below.</p>
<p>How to live stream Premier League soccer in Canada</p>
<p>DAZN</p>
<p>Usurping SportsNet and TSN and relacing their chokehold over the Premier League action in Canada, DAZN is now the place to be for Canadian readers. The network will be showing all 380 fixtures live, and you can start off with a very tempting one-month free trial to get the ball rolling (pun intended). This will roll on to a $20-a-month or annual subscription of $150 after that month. Once again, if you happen to be outside of Canada, you can use a VPN to access it like you were back there all along.</p>
<p>How to live stream the Premier League in Australia</p>
<p>Optus Sports</p>
<p>Every single fixture will be shown on or through Optus Sports this summer so for Australian readers you have to go right to the source - which is easy if you have one of their packages already given their media reach. However, if you just want to stream the Premier League online then Australians can take advantage of monthly subscriptions to Optus Sport and get access to all the games, live. Excellent.

<p><img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/_jtQuuBAsMaWFp8YENxQnUCVEA0=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/BSDMV7G75ZGB3A7HWXV3NPCIO4.jpg" alt="img">
Juventus, led by forward Cristiano Ronaldo, faces AC Milan, led by forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic, in the second leg of their Coppa di Italia semi-final tie at Juventus Stadium in Turin, Italy, on Friday, June 12, 2020 (6/12/20). The two teams drew 1-1 in the first leg meeting at the San Siro.</p>
<p>Fans can watch this match exclusively on ESPN+. Sign up for the subscription service here.</p>
<p>The contest will be played without fans in attendance as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>
<p>What: Coppa di Italia semifinal, Leg 2</p>
<p>Who: Juventus v. AC Milan</p>
<p>When: Friday, June 12, 2020</p>

<hr>
<p>Exactly 100 days after they were meant to be played, the second legs of the Italian Cup semifinals will finally take place.</p>
<p>Juventus hosts AC Milan on Friday, and Inter Milan visits Napoli on Saturday.</p>
<p>The matches were scheduled for March 4 and 5 but were postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Soccer — and indeed the whole of the country — is coming out. Serie A will resume on June 20 but the Italian Cup will be completed the week before rather than at the end of the season as has traditionally occurred.</p>
<p>That decision was made in part as the rights for the cup matches are owned by RAI state television, which will allow fans to watch three important matches free-to-air.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at where we left off more than three months ago:</p>
<p>LATE DRAMA</p>
<p>Just as it seemed as though Milan was about to earn a precious win in the first leg, Cristiano Ronaldo scored a stoppage-time penalty to help Juventus salvage a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>Ronaldo had also won the penalty with a scissor-kick volley that hit Milan defender Davide Calabria on the arm from point-blank range.</p>
<p>Milan was left fuming as there had been an apparent foul on Zlatan Ibrahimović in the buildup.</p>
<p>“The play wouldn’t have continued if the referee had intervened then,” Milan coach Stefano Pioli said. “I am happy with the performance but disappointed with the result.”</p>
<p>Milan defender Theo Hernández was sent off in that match and so will miss the second leg. Midfielder Samuel Castillejo is also suspended for the match as is Ibrahimović, although the Sweden international is recovering from injury.</p>
<p>(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)

<h3 id="la-liga-1920-live-stream-how-to-watch-spanish-football-online-from-anywhere">&ldquo;La Liga 19/20 live stream: how to watch Spanish football online from anywhere&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MgxNxb8qBCYYVbE9n7oDNi-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
Barcelona blinked against Sevilla last week and, just like that, it&rsquo;s all square at the top of the La Liga table. Real Madrid and the Catalan side both now sit on 65 points heading into this week&rsquo;s fixtures, so it looks like another breathtaking run-in as two of Europe&rsquo;s most famous sides battle it out for title glory. Follow all the action as it happens with our guide - here&rsquo;s how to watch a La Liga live stream online from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>How to get a free La Liga live stream BeIN sports owns the rights to La Liga the US and can be watched for FREE on Sling TV as part of its World Sports trial, while UK viewers will find Premier Sports offering free La Liga action until the end of June - either via Sky or online. Not bad, huh?</p>
<p>La Liga fixtures resumed on Thursday, June 11 and matches are taking nearly every night until the end of its season. We&rsquo;re as stoked as you are to be able to watch Spanish football live again - not least because La Liga boasts some of the world&rsquo;s best players. Think Lionel Messi, Eden Hazard and Diego Costa and you&rsquo;d still only be scratching the surface.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s also home to arguably Europe&rsquo;s most exciting title race this year, with Barcelona and eternal rivals Real Madrid both looking to add to their already overflowing trophy cabinets.</p>
<p>Outside of the big two, La Liga mainstays Sevilla, Atletico Madrid and Valencia are locked in a battle for Champions League places with Real Sociedad and Getafe - so an entertaining end to the season seems guaranteed, even with matches being played behind closed doors. And at the other end of the table, Espanyol, Leganes, Mallorca, Celta Vigo and Eiber are locked in a relegation dogfight.</p>
<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s shaping up to grandstand finish for the 2019/20 Liga campaign, so make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on any of the biggest games in Spanish football - read on to discover how to watch a La Liga live stream from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Even more goals: watch a Premier League live stream</p>
<p>How to watch La Liga from outside your country</p>
<p>Further down this page, you&rsquo;ll discover how to watch La Liga football in the likes of the UK, US, Canada and Australia. It&rsquo;s even free in some places and you can generally tune in on TV or online.</p>
<p>But if you go to watch La Liga online from overseas, you&rsquo;ll quickly discover an obstacle - geo-blocking. That means you won&rsquo;t be able to watch the coverage you usually would at home, which is really annoying - especially as it&rsquo;s likely you pay for it. However, a solution exists in the form of a VPN.</p>
<p>A Virtual Private Network is perfect for this as it allows you to change your IP address so you appear to be in a completely different location (i.e. one that&rsquo;s back in your home country). And it&rsquo;s ExpressVPN that tops the lot. We can confidentially say that because we&rsquo;ve tested so many. It&rsquo;s fast, safe and super easy to download and operate. Plus, it&rsquo;s compatible on laptops, mobiles, tablets, consoles Apple TV, Smart TVs&hellip;the list goes on. Check out Express VPN and get 3 months free on an annual plan as well as 49% off the usual price. It has some handy other uses, too, like getting around website blocking in certain offices, schools and even countries. And, because of its encrypted tunnels, ExpressVPN will just generally keep you safer and more anonymous online.</p>
<p>Watch a La Liga live stream in the UK for FREE</p>
<p>This season has seen Premier Sports installed as the home of live coverage of the Spanish top flight - and that&rsquo;s no bad thing, as a deal has been cut with Sky Sports to offer certain matches on a free-to-air basis in the UK. Whether you subscribe to Sky or not, you can enjoy a FREE Premier Sports subscription for the rest of June that will over all your La Liga viewing needs. Out of the UK but want to watch your usual La Liga live stream? Just follow the VPN route as described above and you&rsquo;ll be up and running in no time.</p>
<p>How to watch a FREE La Liga live stream in the US</p>
<p>International pay-TV sports specialist BeIN Sport has the rights to broadcast La Liga Spanish football until 2024 in the US. It&rsquo;s exclusive, too, so that&rsquo;s the subscription you&rsquo;ll need if you want the legal way to watch La Liga. Subscribing also means you can watch via the BeIN Sports Connect app. BeIN Sport can be accessed via most cable providers, but can also to TV streaming services such as FuboTV and Sling. They both be tried out at no charge, and the current Sling TV FREE 7-day trial offer is especially worth considering as there are both English and Spanish language options.</p>
<p>How to watch La Liga: live stream Spanish soccer in Canada</p>
<p>Much like in the US, BeIN Sports is where Barcelona, Real Madrid and the rest of La Liga&rsquo;s teams will be shown in Canada. So that&rsquo;s the BeIN Sports Connect app on mobile. If you don&rsquo;t want to subscribe to BeIN then FuboTV is the exclusive over-the-top provider carrying the streaming service&rsquo;s La Liga soccer coverage. Of course, if you are outside Canada, you can follow the VPN route above and tune in with a BeIN or Fubo log-in all the same.</p>
<p>How to live stream La Liga soccer in Australia</p>
<p>If you fancy watching top flight Spanish football Down Under, then you&rsquo;ll need to be a subscriber to beIN Sports who has secured exclusive live coverage rights to La Liga for this season. If you&rsquo;re a Foxtel customer, you can add beIN to your package for an extra fee. No worries if you aren&rsquo;t though as you can also subscribe to beIN as a standalone subscription that can be watched on your laptop, desktop computer or mobile device. That costs $19.99 per month after you&rsquo;ve taken advantage of a FREE two week trial. That said sports streaming specialists Kayo Sports includes beIN in its package. The Basic plan costs just $25 a month and lets you stream on two screens, while Premium is a mere $35 a month for simultaneous viewing on up to three devices. Of the two, Kayo Sports Premium represents the best value as it offers multi-screen support - which means you can effectively split the price of a monthly subscription between friends or family and pay less. Kayo also lets you watch a load of other great sports, not least offering an NRL live stream for every match of the 2020 season. There&rsquo;s even a free 14-day Kayo Sports trial on offer, so you can check it out for yourself without committing a penny, and its app works across PCs, Macs, smartphones, tablets, select smart TVs and more - console support is the only obvious outlier but it&rsquo;s said to be &ldquo;coming soon&rdquo;.

Watch Now: Notable La Liga Matchups This Weekend For Title Race ( 0:55 )</p>
<p>Barcelona, with Lionel Messi starting and Luis Suarez on the bench, face Mallorca on Saturday as La Liga action returns after a three-month break due to the coronavirus pandemic in a late kickoff to beat the heat. Barca enters the day in first place with a two-point lead over Real Madrid, and a victory here would move them five points clear before Madrid&rsquo;s game on Sunday. On the other side, it&rsquo;s almost crunch time for Mallorca. The club is in the relegation zone with 25 points but with safety just a point away.</p>

<p>Storylines</p>
<p>Barcelona: All eyes will be on Messi and Luis Suarez here with both returning from injury. Messi picked up a thigh knock ahead of play resuming and has trained with the first team since Monday, which means he will probably play. Suarez picked up a knee injury in January that was going to see him miss the majority of what remained of the season, but the break allowed him time to heal and he&rsquo;ll be available for selection.</p>
<p>Mallorca: Looking at the schedule, this is a game Mallorca didn&rsquo;t expect to get anything from. Because of that, anything here is just an added bonus. What will be needed is 90 minutes of defense, constant pressure in the defensive third and holding a very deep backline. Combined with a little good fortune in attack, Mallorca could take something from this game.</p>
<p>Prediction</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s attack does the job early with clinical passing giving the team the chances it needs to win comfortably. Pick: Barca 3, Mallorca 0.</p>
<p>So who should you back in La Liga on Matchday 28? And where does all the betting value lie? Visit SportsLine now to find out which side of the money line has all the value in every La Liga match, all from the proprietary European soccer model that&rsquo;s up an eye-popping 13,800 percent.
