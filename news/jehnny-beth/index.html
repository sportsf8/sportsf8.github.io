<p>Jehnny Beth’s voice is made for chaos. With Savages, the noisy English punk group she fronted last decade, her vocals sounded defiantly pretty and powerful as they fought to rise above the group’s shadowy guitar carnage. And with John and Jehn — the dramatic, lo-fi duo she formed with her longtime partner, Johnny Hostile, in her native France — she added expressionistic voice textures that highlighted the dark guitar lines and, when she sang lyrics, her voice shone through the duskiness. On her first solo album, the chaos is entirely hers.</p>
<p>Inspired by how David Bowie crafted his final LP, Blackstar, with the knowledge that it would be his farewell so it had to be meaningful, Beth set out to make her own defining statement with To Love Is to Live. What she came up with sounds nothing like her past projects, with its open-diary lyrics and extraterrestrial electronic soundscapes that seem to blend together.</p>
<p>Best absorbed in a single, uninterrupted sitting than in pieces, the music transforms from sweet and cinematic to harsh and claustrophobic, and Beth’s voice similarly vacillates between acidic and corrosive or lush and full of yearning, in a manner that echoes Patti Smith. Her lyrics are often uncomfortably revealing, as she peels apart her feelings about love, sex, sin, femininity, masculinity, Catholic guilt, and violence and how they all define her — often on the same song. She’s a rare artist who thrives on overthinking everything (hey, she is French) and the album’s general grandiosity never feels obnoxious.</p>
<p>Beth opens the record with the words “I am naked all the time,” spoken in a deep, alien voice — as if it represents her id — and it might as well be her manifesto as she excavates her innermost thoughts in a stream of consciousness manner for the next 40 minutes. That track, “I Am,” blossoms with filmic strings that swell around her voice, as she howls, “I am young and innocent, but I’m burning inside.” That flame carries into the next track, “Innocence,” which is buttressed by a harder-hitting electronic backdrop, as she examines her self-doubt and damns the way Catholicism taught her “it’s bad form to think man is a piece of shit.” And she develops that thought later, on “I’m the Man, when she takes the opposing viewpoint and picks apart toxic masculinity, hollering, “I’m a man, there’s no bitch in town who doesn’t understand how hard my kick can be,” over slamming rhythms cowritten by Nine Inch Nails’ Atticus Ross. Those “I’m a man” proclamations spill into the background of a piano ballad, “The Rooms,” but it presents a scene in which gender roles are reversed: women act like johns picking out men to be their prostitutes. But there’s a sadness to that song, rather than some kind of allure. It’s hard to keep track of the twists and turns, but it all adds up to a unique anxiety.</p>
<p>The way she assumes other perspectives — really just different sides of herself — is what makes the record compelling. She has said that despite coming out as bisexual in the past, “Flower,” with its slow-building strip-club soundtrack, is her first love song for a woman. She sings to the woman dancing, “My skin is wide open, my heart forever frozen,” before seductively whispering, “How come I can’t get closer?” She blurs her feelings further on the next song, the hazy “We Will Sin Together,” on which she presents the album’s title in full: “To love is to live/To live is to sin/I take you down with me.”</p>
<p>The record is also capable of poignant moments when she relaxes her guard, like “Heroine,” which sports a sublime chorus and finds her singing “All I want is to be the woman you never see,” and “French Countryside,” a gorgeous love song that proves her voice can pair as beautifully with piano as with static. “All my life I’ve been hanging around the wrong places,” she croons on the latter tune, “And on my life I’m here at last telling you I am changing.” But it’s in the context of how she describes feeling like she’s in a crashing plane and the way the song contrasts the rest of the record’s pandemonium that make the words feel like more than clichés. It’s a moment of clarity, and it feels all the more stunning when juxtaposed with, “Human,” the LP’s final track and only misstep. That song returns to claustrophobic key changes and messy sax solos, as Beth describes how using the internet has ruined her (“I tried reading books but that skill eludes me now,” goes one lyric that does feel like a cliché), and even if all her points about how the web atrophies your brain are valid, it breaks the spell.</p>
<p>Before “Human” is over, though, she smartly returns to her original theme — “I am naked all the time … I am sorry for my mistakes” — and her sense of disorder and regret makes sense again. The way Beth took an inventory of her emotions, her shortcomings, and her strengths seems like a path to madness, so it’s a wonder she was able to come out on the other side of To Live Is to Love. What she does with that self-analysis next might be even more fascinating.

<h3 id="jehnny-beth-to-love-is-to-live-review--solo-savage-defiant-and-intimate">&ldquo;Jehnny Beth: To Love Is to Live review – solo Savage defiant and intimate&rdquo;</h3>

Jehnny Beth is best known as the frontwoman of Savages: the always monochromatic, post-punk four-piece whose dissonant debut album was nominated for the Mercury prize back in 2013. Beth herself grew up in the French countryside – her real name is Camille Berthomier – but moved to London in her 20s to pursue music. With Savages, who released their last record in 2016, she was electrifying – though she recently told the Guardian that the band eventually became a “prison for creativity”. The more successful they became, the more she felt caged. Now, with her debut solo album To Love Is to Live, she makes herself defiantly uncategorisable.</p>

<p>To Love&hellip; opens with a cavernous, cinematic intro, announcing “I am naked all the time,” first in a pitch-shifted growl, and later, in Beth’s own fragile, naked vocal. She sets the stage for a restless album that thrives on contrast: from delicate piano ballads to thrashing metal. The record arrives simultaneously with a collection of erotic short stories – Crimes Against Love Manifesto (C.A.L.M.) – and can be equally sensual, as with Flower, a hushed ballad dedicated to an LA pole dancer, and We Will Sin Together, where lyrics about legs parting are couched in hazy, undulating synths. But Beth hasn’t lost the aggression of her Savages persona, either: there’s the glitchy fury of How Could You (featuring Joe Talbot of Idles) and the brittle, Peaky Blinders-soundtracking I’m the Man (incidentally, Cillian Murphy also reads Beth’s poetry on a different track). Beth’s ability to glide between vulnerability and intimidation is unnerving, and adds more shades of grey to a performer who’s previously operated in black and white.

<h3 id="to-love-is-to-live-review-by-nick-hasted">&ldquo;To Love Is To Live. Review by Nick Hasted&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://theartsdesk.com/sites/default/files/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Jehnny Beth was the formidable and mysterious leader of Savages’ flinty monochrome attack, remoulding stark post-punk into gender-fluid shapes. Retiring the band after two Mercury-nominated albums, and returning to France after more than a decade of self-discovery in London, this solo debut is the product of an intense period of self-reflection, softening the carapace of her English persona to ponder innocence and rustic roots.</p>
<p>Beth’s friend PJ Harvey laughingly dismissed her poetry as “terrible”, and even Cillian Murphy’s spoken-word turn can’t redeem some po-faced portentousness, or a chilly air of theory familiar from French erotic provocateurs such as Catherine Breillat. Mostly, though, Beth digs deeper, building an artistic identity capable of both transgressive rampages and introspective quiet.</p>
<p>Ambivalence is constant, as she plays with guilt and pines for innocence. “We Will Sin Together” suggests Jean Genet-like underworld adventures beyond good and evil, but allows for simple, lusty pleasure (“All I want is your sexy eyes/Your legs parting to the skies”). “Flower” is a breathily shivering ode to an LA stripper, delicate falling leaves of guitar adding grace to its electro glide. The thrusting cyber-swagger of “I’m the Man” dives deepest into Savages territory, only to make a startling feint into Seventies boudoir balladry, like Barry White gatecrashing The Prodigy. Even cocky humour slips in, when the elusive feminine Pimpernel of “Heroine” insists: “All I want is some good use of my great body.”</p>
<p>Beth’s rediscovery of her schoolgirl studies in jazz piano and literary bent both pay off in “The Rooms”, an enigmatic vignette of secret erotic exchanges with a heavy, languid atmosphere of French provincial shadows. “The French Countryside” is a limpid piano ballad, wide open to romantic ecstasy and the past. While retaining steely strength this is a fuller self-portrait, warmed by flesh and blood, remembered family and love.

<h3 id="jehnny-beth-there-is-something-very-cool-about-irish-people">&ldquo;Jehnny Beth: ‘There is something very cool about Irish people’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4262072&amp;origw=1440" alt="img">
Bisexuality has historically been more visible in pop than anywhere else. But the number of high-profile musicians prepared to publicly identify in such terms is still relatively modest. That’s why Jehnny Beth, erstwhile leader of post-punk wrecking-balls Savages and newly minted solo artist, feels it is important to speak out about being bi.</p>
<p>“I grew up being attracted to both sexes. I didn’t have anyone who talked about it. I felt quite anxious for many years. I felt I couldn’t fit in in any sort of scenarios. And that everything I was chasing was a lie. So that’s why I mention it.”</p>
<p>So that if a young person is struggling, as she did growing up in provincial France, they might perhaps read her words and know it isn’t just them? “If I can help someone feel less alone,” nods Beth (35). “I wish I didn’t have to. It’s not really that I want to share my personal life.”</p>
<p>Has she been following the row between actor and campaigner Jameela Jamil and Father Ted writer Graham Linehan? (Jamil, who is in a relationship with musician James Blake, said in April that she identified as queer. Linehan tweeted she was guilty of “appropriation”. Jamil responded that he was a t**t. And at that the internet exploded.)</p>
<p>Beth seems unfamiliar with Linehan, his oeuvre or his take on sexual politics. But she clearly feels it is important that individuals with a public profile speak out, as Jamil is doing.</p>
<p>“There are some people who talk about it. Joe Lycett [the comedian] talking about being pansexual. It’s a little more out there than it used to be,” she says. “But it’s something that can be hard to comprehend.”</p>
<p>Beth, who is about to release a by turns cathartic, big-hearted and pummelling solo record, To Love Is to Live, is delighted to be talking to someone from Ireland. “There is something very cool about Irish people,” she says.</p>
<p>“Very down to earth – especially Irish men. I’ve found they are very…” she pauses, gathering her thoughts. “They are able to show love in a special way, in a grounded way.”</p>
<p>This interview was conducted prior to the release of blockbusting romantic drama Normal People. Heavens knows how much further Beth’s opinion of Irish men has been raised now that the Ballad of Marianne and Connell has elevated the archetypal monosyllabic GAA star into the platonic ideal of international hunkdom.</p>
<p>One of her friends, she continues, is Cillian Murphy, aka flat-capped Peaky Blinders anti-hero Tommy Shelby. There is, perhaps uncoincidentally, something very Tommy Shelby about Beth’s music, her new material in particular.</p>
<p>The songs on To Love Is to Live are highly-stylised, often deeply sensitive, yet with a whiff of violence. Consider single I’m the Man, where Beth roars the chorus against a dramatic caterwaul of guitars. It is easy to imagine it blaring in the background as a gangster in old-school headgear strides towards the camera in Tarantino-style slow motion. This is Peaky Blinders pop with the safety-catch off.</p>
<p>I’m the Man’s high-kicking oomph is accentuated by the accompanying video, overseen by Dubliner – and, yes, Peaky Blinders director – Anthony Byrne. In it Beth snarls at the camera and then menaces people eating chips and hanging outside the pub. In this weird moment in history, it makes you yearn for the days you could eat chips outside a boozer and potentially be growled at by a French post-punk pop star.</p>
<p>“I’m the man, the evil man,” she thunders. “I’m the man, the one you hate.”</p>
<p>It’s feral and irresistible. One thing Beth wants to clarify, however, is that the message of I’m the Man isn’t gendered.</p>
<p>She isn’t taking potshots at masculinity, toxic or otherwise. The point of both song and video is that within all of us are dark and untamed forces. I’m the Man is about wrestling those demons. “The song is about the balance which is in all of us. This destructive force. This desire to eat, to crash, to destroy, to beat. All the active energies. I have them too. That’s what I want to represent.”</p>
<p>She met Byrne backstage at a London gig by Idles. He was about to start on the latest season of Peaky Blinders. Beth mentioned that she knew Murphy. And so a plan came together to have the actor read A Place Above, the spoken word piece with which I’m The Man opens.</p>
<p>“See rivers of blood, the endless cruelties, the manipulations and the fears,” intones Murphy in his brooding Cork accent, over a creeping piano. “See the delusions of those succeed, their imagined self-importance, see the most powerful man raise his hand to tell us a lie.”</p>
<p>“I knew he was a fan,” says Beth. “We met a few months later. He was in London. We met at his hotel. He set up in the room. I don’t really direct him. He directed himself. He was brilliant, the way he did it. He said the text was big stuff. So he needed to do it in a quiet way. He made it very personal. It’s like you are sitting on the Tube and you look at someone else and it’s as if you have access to their mind. The way Cillian spoke, it was like having access to someone’s thoughts.”</p>
<p>Boxing</p>
<p>Beth was born Camille Berthomier and grew up in Poitiers, a city of 90,000 in west-central France. Her parents were theatre directors; one of her earliest stage experiences was playing the lead role in Ibsen’s Peer Gynt. It was also in Poitiers that she met her long-term musical collaborator, Nicolas Congé, aka Johnny Hostile.</p>
<p>As Johnny and Jehn, they released two well-received albums. Beth also appeared in a few low-budget movies: À Travers la Forêt was a thriller about mistaken identify; Sodium Babies was a vampire caper described by the Internet Movie Database as “Sin City and True Blood spiced with the pathology of Fight Club”.</p>
<p>She and Hostile, with whom she is in an open relationship, moved to London when she was 20. In 2011, she formed Savages with guitarist Gemma Thompson and bassist Ayse Hassan (Hostile declined the opportunity to join).</p>
<p>Savages were an immediate sensation. Their 2013 debut, Silence Yourself, made the UK top 20 (and the Irish Top 40) and was nominated for the Mercury Prize. A second Mercury nod followed three years later with the release of Adore Life, praised by Rolling Stone for being “driven by emotions that are almost unprecedented in the [post-punk] genre”.</p>
<p>Beth is not an artist to stand still. Savages played their last gig in 2017 (the group remain open-minded about their future). By then Beth, with Hostile in tow, had already left London for Paris, where she took up boxing and thought about a solo LP.</p>
<p>She was eager for fresh challenges and new experiences. The death of David Bowie had shaken her, caused her to question where she was going with her life. Brexit didn’t help. However, she had already packed her bags when the UK voted to give two fingers to the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Spirituality</p>
<p>“I left just before it started,” she says. “I wasn’t surprised. It’s been so long coming. The British wanted to try to be independent and [also] have some ‘play’ in Europe but not really. I’m just sad obviously. I was 15 when I went to England for the first time. I moved there properly when I was 20. I didn’t have to show any papers, didn’t have to pay anything. Thank God I got the opportunity. There are a lot of people in my situation right now who won’t have that option.”</p>
<p>Beth is speaking from France, where she is spending her lockdown. Her parents are Catholic; it has been suggested that – pauses to roll eyes – “Catholic guilt” might be part of her creative make-up.</p>
<p>“Everyone is baptised in my family,” she says, not sounding especially crippled with theological shame. “I was not. But I used to go to church as a kid with my grandma. She got me a Bible. I used to pray. I know the story of Jesus. I was raised Catholic without really being institutionalised.”</p>
<p>The muscle memory of faith helped her make the new LP, which features production from U2/ Depeche Mode collaborator Flood, Romy Madley Croft of the xx and Atticus Ross of Nine Inch Nails. She had always aspired to doing something outside Savages. And when Bowie died she was reminded that all of us, pop stars and everyday people alike, get only one chance to live our best lives.</p>
<p>Religion, she says, helped anchor her as she confronted these existential issues.</p>
<p>“Going through this record, thinking about mortality and death… I do think that without the idea of religion you don’t have a place for death to exist,” she says. “I understand a need for spirituality. I wish I could pray.”</p>
<p>She pauses. “I’m very tempted to pray.”</p>
<p>“We spend a lot of time forgetting we are going to die,” Beth continues. “When we are reminded, it’s a moment of exposure. Suddenly you feel quite vulnerable. It’s sort of frightening as much as it’s inspiring. In these moments you feel you can love more, that you can give more.</p>
<p>“Making the record, I tried to remind myself of that. I couldn’t shake the feeling of my mortality, all through doing it. I felt it was important that I do this before I died. I started to breathe again when it was finished.”</p>
<p>To Love Is to Live is released June 12.

Jehnny Beth: ‘When you’re scared it means you’re pushing in the right direction’</p>
<p>Former singer with Savages, Jehnny Beth releases her solo album To Love is to Live today. She spoke to Duncan Seaman.</p>
<p>By The Newsroom Wednesday, 10th June 2020, 11:45 am Updated Thursday, 11th June 2020, 10:08 am</p>

<p>“Yes, life has changed,” says singer and songwriter Jehnny Beth with a rueful chuckle as she contemplates her much-altered circumstances since a family emergency brought her back to France, from London, shortly before the Covid-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>She’d scheduled a world tour to correspond with the release of To Love is to Live, her first solo album since her band Savages went into hiatus in 2016, but now all travel plans are on hold.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing for me was the cancellation of the touring, and we have no idea when we are going to be able to go back,” says the 35-year-old, whose real name is Camille Berthomier. “We’re working to find different ways of maybe performing.</p>

<p>“It takes a moment to adjust, I think, because I had been preparing so much for this record. I’d spent six months working on the live set, it was exactly how I wanted it. It’s just trying to reschedule things.”</p>
<p>A useful channel for her energies has been boxing training, a hobby which Jehnny Beth took up when live work with Savages and Damon Albarn’s musical collective Gorillaz ceased. “I thank my boxing club really from the bottom of my heart for keeping us active,” she enthuses. “I’m still doing it from a distance. I wouldn’t have been able to survive without that, really. Boxing was the only thing that kept me sane. I didn’t realise but being on stage gave me an outlet for physical expression that I really needed. Boxing has the same way of working the body but also the mind. I highly recommend it.”</p>
<p>Ideas for the album began to formulate as Jehnny Beth and her partner Johnny Hostile repeatedly listened to David Bowie’s album Blackstar in the days after the singer’s death in January 2016.</p>
<p>Bowie, she says, inspired her to become a musician. “I remember being very young on school trips and having a ‘best of’ cassette of Bowie and being transformed by what I was hearing. He’s the father of us all, being able to transform and always follow his heart. Also artistically he was always an obsession, which is something similar to someone who was very influential to me, which was PJ Harvey. She gets a lot of credit for everything she’s done; but for also being versatile and able to reinvent herself in that same way that Bowie did, I think she’s very similar.</p>
<p>“Those artists are reminders that you just have to follow what you want to do, no matter how scary that sounds. When you’re scared it means you’re pushing in the right direction, in a way you haven’t explored before. I was definitely inspired by that for this record.”</p>
<p>Confronting mortality led Jehnny Beth to question many aspects of life. “Right now we’re probably all very conscious of what’s essential in our lives,” she says. “The album is where you need to regroup and think about what is essential. I think any art needs to be done out of necessity, you really carry on living if you can do that, and if you find that place, that’s where you need to go, it’s where you can create. If you have that urgency, you’re in the right place.”</p>
<p>The record, she says, reflects on the complexity of being human. “It’s quite layered, it’s how I wanted it to be. One of the first questions Atticus [Ross, Trent Reznor’s long-time collaborator who produced To Love is to Live alongside Flood] asked me before we started working together was if I wanted to do a collection of songs or an album. I always knew I wanted to make an album with a strong sense of suspense and narrative, with a multiplicity of voices that were very contrasted. That reflects what living is to me – it’s a mix of light and darkness and beauty and moments of violence, and I wanted to put all of that into the record.”</p>
<p>Questions of identity linger in many of the songs. It seems to be an area that Jehnny Beth has been further pondering in lockdown. Her fondness for Britain stemmed from childhood. “I first went on a trip to London when I was 15,” she says. “I knew some people there who were into music and every year I would go there for as long as a I could.</p>
<p>“Since a very young age I was really into English and I learned English at the age of eight when I started singing jazz standards with an incredible jazz pianist who was teaching me every Saturday. I would go to his house and he would play piano then we would swap seats and I would play piano and sing, so I learned English by singing all those jazz standards, Chet Baker and Billie Holiday.</p>
<p>“I studied English at school and I was really good at it. My teacher sent me to some people she knew in London. From the age of 15 I wanted to move to London, I had this obsession. Like a lot of teenagers, I needed to escape, I needed to find myself. And also speaking a different language gives you a lot of freedom because suddenly you can rebuild your whole identity. Language is your identity. It was an opportunity to shape and morph into whoever I wanted to be.</p>
<p>“I was fascinated by English culture. I come from France, it’s quite Latin and overemotional; what I found in Britain was a respect and distance. That national shyness is a beautiful thing. It sort of completed my education, I think. Obviously the music, the drum &amp; bass, there was so much going on in London, I felt really excited.</p>
<p>“Since meeting Johnny Hostile and doing music, I said, ‘that’s fine but I don’t want to stay here [in France], I want to go to London’, so we moved. I was 20 years old when I jumped on that boat.”</p>
<p>Now 35, she feels more comfortable being back near her roots in Poitiers. “I do now, I didn’t for years,” she says. “I was even forgetting my French, it was really pathetic for a while, but I felt really fragmented at the end of the last tour with Savages. I felt unhappy. I wasn’t really sure who those different parts of me were, which one was right, which one was me. I think I needed to regroup, I needed to go back. It was kind of unintended. At the time I was working on instinct, I wasn’t sure it was a good idea. And I miss London a lot. London is really my home, I know it like the back of my hand. I might go back at some point. I just felt that it was a good time to do it for me.”</p>
<p>The jazz influence, that was harder to define in the post-punk of Savages, is noticeable in the solo song The Rooms. “My first band was a girl jazz band and I was the singer,” Jehnny Beth says. “Then when I discovered rock ’n’ roll around 17 or 18 I thought that jazz was so old school and grinchy. I loved electric guitars, I thought ‘this is it for me’. But when I was unhappy it always came back. I just put on a Theolonius Monk record or Mingus and I felt instantly better. For me jazz is always connected to film noir of Melville or Cassavetes’ Shadows or Elevator to the Gallows (Lift To the Scaffold), that ambience is something that I wanted on the record.</p>
<p>“Part of making the record was giving no restrictions on ideas, we decided to try some improvisations with musicians&hellip;It was just the tip of the iceberg that we chose.”</p>
<p>Among Jehnny Beth’s many collaborators on To Love is to Live are Romy Madley Croft of The xx, Joe Talbot of Idles and the actor Cillian Murphy. The singer says she likes having people to bounce ideas off. “It’s hard for me to call it a solo record,” she says. “A solo record makes me think it’s written, produced and recorded by myself. I admire people who can do everything themselves, although sometimes I think it’s a bit detrimental to the music, not everybody’s Prince. But for me it’s definitely the group thing I sought the most, especially for this record. It was working with groups but also a very small amount of people each time. When I was working with Romy it was just me and her in a hotel room. It was separated in different cities as well.</p>
<p>“I really wanted to be opening the door for people to express themselves. There’s nothing worse than inviting someone in and then putting a leash on them. I like to hear real self-expression on records. All of them had complete free rein in what they wanted to do. There was a lot of conversations before; with Atticus we spoke for six months before we did any music, we wrote each other emails and we talked on the phone and then when me and Johnny Hostile went to LA for a few months and were working in the studio he would come every night and we would sit down and listen to music and then after all that, six months, he sat down and started making music.</p>
<p>“I love collaborations. The great thing about a solo record is you have the final word.”</p>
<p>In July Jehnny Beth is due to publish her first book, Crimes Against Love Memories, a collection of erotic short stories. “What I didn’t anticipate is to be labelled as someone who talks about sex, which can have some clichés around it, some preconceptions for some people,” she says. “The reason I started writing is it’s not really about sexuality, it’s about fantasies. It’s a great subject to write about because it’s the land of the imagination, it’s a place where anything can happen and you don’t have to stick to the facts, so writing becomes very fun. It was very natural for me to try to write about this. I wanted to suggest alternatives to the standards of romanticism that society imposes on us. A book is a place where you can say anything, more than a record. I think it’s a real place for freedom.”</p>
<p>As well as a radio show and TV presenting in recent months, Jehnny Beth has returned to acting in the soon-to-be released French film Kaamelott. “It was a cult comedy series that was on TV for a very long time,” she explains. “That stopped ten years ago. The main writer/director Alexandre Astier is one of the biggest and most famous and talented comedians in France. They asked me to be part of the film as one of the characters and I am the right-hand [woman] of Sting. It was an honour, it was completely bonkers,” she laughs. “The story is about King Arthur and the quest for the Grail and the Round Table. It was an amazing experience. I was dressed as a mercenary with a sword and a Mohican, it was fun. It was supposed to come out at the end of July but because of the world situation it’s going to come out at end of November.”

<h3 id="albums-out-today-jehnny-beth-chloe-x-halle-norah-jones-built-to-spill">&ldquo;Albums Out Today: Jehnny Beth, Chloe x Halle, Norah Jones, Built to Spill&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ourculturemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/june12.jpg" alt="img">
In this segment, we showcase the most notable albums out each week. Here are the albums out on June 12th, 2020:</p>
<p>Jehnny Beth, To Love is To Live</p>
<p>Jehnny Beth, the frontwoman of the English rock band Savages, has come out with her debut solo album, To Love is To Live, out now via Caroline. The album was originally slated for release back in May, but was postponed to the COVID-19 pandemic. It includes production work from the likes of Atticus Ross, Flood, and Johnny Hostile, and features musical contributions from The xx’s Romy Madley Croft, actor Cillian Murphy, and IDLES’ Joe Talbot. “When I started making this record all I could think about was the impermanence of life, that I had to do this before it’s too late,” Beth said in her announcement statement back in February, “and here I am now sitting on a train telling you that my album is coming and it’s called TO LOVE IS TO LIVE. Today those words resonate more than ever. There isn’t really anything else in life, is it?”</p>
<p>Chloe x Halle, Ungodly Hour</p>
<p>This is the second studio album and fifth release from rising R&amp;B sister duo Chloe x Halle, out now via Parkwood Entertainment. Following 2018’s The Kids Are Alright, the record was originally slated for release on June 5th but was delayed in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Speaking of the album’s title, Chloe Bailey told Teen Vogue: “We wrote this song [the title track “Ungodly Hour”] with Disclosure, and we had the best time. I forgot what I was watching, but I heard the phrase ‘ungodly hour’ and wrote it in my notes. [It] kind of stuck out to all of us, and we were like, ‘What can you say with this?’ We all came up with this sentence: ‘Love me at the ungodly hour,’ which means love me when I’m at my worst; love me when I’m not all dolled up and made up. Love me when all my insecurities are out on the table.” The album includes the singles ‘Catch Up’ and Do It’.</p>
<p>Norah Jones, Pick Me Up Off the Floor</p>
<p>Norah Jones is back with her seventh studio album, Pick Me Up Off the Floor, via Blue Note Records. The album, which started out as a collection of previously unreleased leftovers, features contributions from Jeff Tweedy of Wilco among others. It was originally set for release in May, but was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Living in this country — this world — the last few years, I think there’s an underlying sense of, ‘Lift me up. Let’s get up out of this mess and try to figure some things out,’” the singer explained. “If there’s a darkness to this album, it’s not meant to be an impending sense of doom, it feels more like a human longing for connection. Some of the songs that are personal also apply to the larger issues we’re all facing. And some of the songs that are about very specific larger things also feel quite personal.”</p>
<p>Built To Spill, Built to Spill Plays the Songs of Daniel Johnston</p>
<p>Built to Spill have released a Daniel Johnston covers album via Ernest Jenning Record Co. The band served as the late Johnston’s cover band during his final tour in 2017, and the songs on the album, which was previously postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, are derived from recordings of their sessions together. “It was pretty special for us,” frontman Doug Martsch told Rolling Stone of that experience. “Basically we wanted to get good documentation of what our rehearsals were like. It was a lot heavier than what I thought it would be.” Johnston passed away in September, when the album was in its final stages of production.</p>
<p>Other albums out today:</p>
<p>Chloe x Halle, Ungodly Hour; Kodaline, One Day at a Time; Paul Weller, On Sunset.

<h3 id="albums-liam-gallagher-jack-garratt-kodaline-orlando-weeks-jehnny-beth">&ldquo;Albums: Liam Gallagher, Jack Garratt, Kodaline, Orlando Weeks, Jehnny Beth&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.irishnews.com/picturesarchive/irishnews/irishnews/2020/06/10/111913043-ab47c9e1-9abe-482d-8163-7a0c193305e6.jpg" alt="img">
Liam Gallagher&rsquo;s latest album is MTV Unplugged</p>
<p>Liam Gallagher</p>
<p>MTV Unplugged</p>
<p>YOU can thank Noel Gallagher for this glorious recording. After he used some choice language to describe the city of Hull while on stage in the US, brother Liam pledged to perform at the city&rsquo;s Grade II listed hall. What started in spite has gifted fans a snapshot of Liam at his post-Oasis best. The frontman famously missed Oasis&rsquo;s MTV Unplugged in 1996 over a &ldquo;sore throat&rdquo;, leaving Noel to take on singing duties (and earn plaudits for breathing new life into their songs). This time around he was ready. With his voice in fine fettle, Liam tears through a set of Oasis classics bolstered by new material, including a song for his formerly estranged daughter Molly. While brother Noel started strongly post-Oasis with his High Flying Birds project, it has been Liam who has stormed ahead with two albums of solid solo material. On MTV Unplugged, Liam settles an old score, and settles it well.</p>

<p>Jack Garratt</p>
<p>Love, Death And Dancing</p>
<p>JACK Garratt was 24 when, in 2016, he won the Critics&rsquo; Choice Award at the Brits, following in the footsteps of Adele, Sam Smith and Ellie Goulding. Big boots to fill, you might think? Well, Garratt thought so too. After releasing his debut album, Phase, he disappeared from the limelight, racked with anxiety and struggling with his sudden graduation from small-time performer to headliner. The intervening four years were spent trying to cope with the fallout from those 12 months as the next big thing. Luckily, his time in the wilderness has not been in vain. Love, Death And Dancing is a more focused affair that strips back much of the decoration that distracted on his debut. Hooky choruses reminiscent of Queen are layered with tape hiss, while house beats sit alongside glitchy breakdowns. There&rsquo;s a clear sense of identity here, one that feels authentic and avoids the modish eclecticism of his debut.</p>
<p>Alex Green</p>
<p>7/10</p>
<p>Kodaline</p>
<p>One Day At A Time</p>
<p>DUBLIN band Kodaline have always aspired to the heights of Coldplay, Bon Jovi and The Script, both in their music (glossy and chart-ready) and in their appearance (neat and boy band-esque). In the Republic, three consecutive number one albums have elevated them to such heights, while their chart success in the UK has been considerable. One Day At A Time, their fourth album, continues a winning formula: a hint of folk, a swelling chorus, frontman Steve Garrigan&rsquo;s emotional vocals. If anything, Kodaline pedal back some of the electronic experimentation and vaguely activist language of 2018&rsquo;s Politics Of Living, in favour of what they do best. Each of the 10 songs starts small then builds, and builds, and builds, until it crescendos in a flurry of keys and choirs. Spend It With You is a genuinely beautiful love song carrying a delightfully simple message. Like much of the album, it&rsquo;s likely to inspire great singalongs when Kodaline return to their rightful place – the stage.</p>
<p>Alex Green</p>
<p>6/10</p>
<p>Orlando Weeks</p>
<p>A quickening</p>
<p>ORLANDO Weeks&rsquo;s debut solo album marks a big shift in his musical style from his days as frontman of indie group The Maccabees. A Quickening sees the singer ditch the band&rsquo;s upbeat guitar riffs and throwaway lyrics in favour of a much more reflective and downbeat tone. The album is about Weeks&rsquo;s experience of becoming a father, he has previously said, and it does seem to show a musician who is mellowing with age. His haunting voice is frequently accompanied by gentle piano and trumpet playing. The album&rsquo;s singles Milk Breath, Blood Sugar and Safe In Sound are richly textured with an intense yet calming sound. All three are powerful in their own right. However, the album offers little in the way of shifts in tone and many of the songs feel similar to each other. Only the track All The Things appears to be doing something different thanks to its high tempo electronic backing music. While the album contains some strong songs, when taken as a whole it verges on becoming repetitive.</p>

<p>6/10</p>
<p>Jehnny Beth</p>
<p>To Live Is To Love</p>
<p>AFTER two highly rated albums as singer with Savages - both Mercury Prize nominated - which followed two underrated ones as John and Jehn, not to mention a Gorillaz collaboration, Jehnny Beth finally goes it alone. The inspiration for To Love Is To Live came on the night David Bowie died, listening to his last album Blackstar, while the fragmented tracks on Beyonce&rsquo;s eponymous fifth solo album helped pull her free from traditional verse-chorus songwriting. First track I Am starts with her declaring &ldquo;I am naked all the time&rdquo; and rises to a crescendo of tortured synths, while Flower is less fractured, simple beats and minimal guitar, and We Will Sin Together is the most conventionally catchy. A Place Above is a 73-second spoken word introduction by Cillian Murphy to I&rsquo;m The Man, which was featured in Peaky Blinders and subverts power balances with Beth&rsquo;s distorted vocals repeating the title between interludes of woozy piano. The vocals are variously whispered, chanted and screamed but it&rsquo;s the quieter tracks - minimal piano-led ballads The Rooms and The French Countryside - that make more impact, suggesting less can be more, along with final track Human, the longest at over six minutes.</p>
