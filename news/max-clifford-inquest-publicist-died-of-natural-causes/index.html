<p>Disgraced publicist Max Clifford died of natural causes after collapsing in a prison shower, a coroner has ruled.</p>
<p>Clifford, 74, collapsed at Littlehey Prison, Cambridgeshire, where he was serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences.</p>
<p>He died at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, near Huntingdon, on 10 December 2017.</p>
<p>His inquest heard he could have received better care if his heart condition had been diagnosed sooner.</p>
<p>Clifford had complained of shortness of breath to a prison GP in July 2017 and an ultrasound of his heart was carried out two months later, the three-day hearing in Peterborough was told.</p>
<p>Image copyright PA Image caption Max Clifford was serving an eight-year prison sentence for historical sex offences</p>
<p>Assistant coroner Simon Milburn said that if the ultrasound had been referred from a general cardiologist at Hinchingbrooke to a specialist for a second opinion, it &ldquo;probably&rdquo; would have led to a diagnosis of cardiac AL amyloidosis.</p>
<p>The rare condition - caused by a build-up of abnormal proteins in organs and tissues - was not diagnosed until the days before Clifford&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ice-cold showers&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Milburn said that an earlier diagnosis would not have prolonged Clifford&rsquo;s life but could have helped &ldquo;optimise his treatment and relieve his symptoms&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cardiologists made clinical decisions &ldquo;based on the evidence and symptoms [they] saw at the time&rdquo;, he said.</p>
<p>A post-mortem examination recorded the cause of death as congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>The coroner has asked Prof Jonathan Townend, a consultant cardiologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, to carry out a review of Clifford&rsquo;s cardiac care.</p>

<p>His daughter Louise had earlier raised her father&rsquo;s complaints about &ldquo;ice-cold showers and cold cells&rdquo;, and claimed &ldquo;his dying months lacked humanity and dignity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A statement read out after the inquest said a &ldquo;second opinion&rdquo; of his condition &ldquo;should have been sought&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This would have led to improved treatment and comfort and allowed Max to make arrangements for the last few months of his life,&rdquo; the family&rsquo;s solicitor Neil Cronin said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was taken away from him.&rdquo;

Image copyright PA Image caption Max Clifford was serving an eight-year prison sentence for historical sex offences when he died</p>
<p>Conditions at a prison where disgraced publicist Max Clifford was held did not have any impact on his health or his death, an inquest has heard.</p>
<p>Clifford, 74, was serving eight years for sex offences when he collapsed at HMP Littlehey, in Cambridgeshire. He died of congestive heart failure on 10 December 2017, two days later.</p>
<p>His family has claimed cold conditions at the jail hastened his death.</p>
<p>But the Ministry of Justice said there was &ldquo;no evidence of this&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The pre-inquest review hearing in Huntingdon was told Clifford had claimed prisoners were &ldquo;locked up for 23 hours per day and forced to have freezing cold showers&rdquo; and that &ldquo;only enhanced prisoners could have a jumper&rdquo; as a privilege.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cold conditions at the jail hastened his death, his family has claimed</p>
<p>Barrister Kimberley Aiken, representing Clifford&rsquo;s family, said: &ldquo;The conditions within Littlehey were known to be pretty shocking and the family have concerns that any gentleman of Mr Clifford&rsquo;s age and infirmity would have had their death hastened by the conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgina Wolfe, for the Ministry of Justice, told the hearing: &ldquo;Not only is there no evidence of this but there&rsquo;s no evidence this had any impact on Mr Clifford&rsquo;s health and how he came by his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Aiken conceded Clifford &ldquo;would have died in any event&rdquo;, adding: &ldquo;Though perhaps not on that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would perhaps have been able to go home and have some family time - if the family&rsquo;s suspicions are correct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An earlier hearing in January was told the PR guru&rsquo;s medical cause of death was congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>It said an underlying factor was cardiac AL amyloidosis - a &ldquo;rare&rdquo;, serious condition caused by a build-up of abnormal proteins in organs and tissues.</p>
<p>In 2014, Clifford was investigated as part of Operation Yewtree and eventually jailed after being convicted of eight indecent assaults on women and young girls.</p>
<p>He continued to protest his innocence and an appeal against his sentence was due in 2018.</p>
<p>A date for the full inquest has yet to be set.

<p>The daughter of the disgraced publicist Max Clifford has told an inquest his &ldquo;dying months lacked humanity and dignity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Clifford, 74, collapsed at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire where he was serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences.</p>
<p>He died at Hinchingbrooke Hospital near Huntingdon on 10 December 2017.</p>
<p>In a statement read to the coroner in Peterborough, Louise Clifford said: &ldquo;I could see that he was fading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Clifford said her father first mentioned &ldquo;feeling tight-chested and unable to take a deep breath&rdquo; five months before his death.</p>
<p>A consultant cardiologist told her the right side of her father&rsquo;s heart was &ldquo;stiff and shiny&rdquo; and recommended an MRI scan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could see him getting more and more frail,&rdquo; Ms Clifford said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would complain to me daily about the ice-cold showers and cold cell and what a shock to the system it was each time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Clifford said the &ldquo;severity of his condition wasn&rsquo;t established&rdquo; and that &ldquo;his dying months lacked humanity and dignity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image copyright PA Media Image caption Clifford&rsquo;s daughter Louise said she could &ldquo;see him fading&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clifford was jailed in May 2014 for a string of indecent assaults on women and young girls. His conviction was upheld after his death.</p>
<p>A report by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Prisons noted chronic problems with the heating and boiler system at Littlehey Prison.</p>
<p>However, Simon Milburn, assistant coroner for Cambridgeshire, said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no detail in terms of precise timings, locations, temperatures, anything of that nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr Ann Coxon, Clifford&rsquo;s physician, told the inquest that the publicist could not brush his teeth as he was so breathless in the weeks before his death.</p>
<p>Describing a visit to see Clifford in prison in September 2017, Dr Coxon said: &ldquo;Just looking at how somebody had gone from playing tennis in May to walking with a shuffle, starting to become breathless from conversation, that&rsquo;s a very rapid deterioration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him dying in front of my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clifford had communicated to her through his lawyers because he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t want other people visiting him to know he was sick&rdquo;, describing the situation as &ldquo;Chinese whispers&rdquo;, the hearing was told.</p>
<p>The inquest continues.

Celebrity publicist Max Clifford was given wrongly labelled medication in prison and failed to take a “significant quantity” of tablets to treat his heart condition before he died, a report has found.</p>
<p>He went into cardiac arrest and died on 10 December 2017, after being treated for suspected heart failure.</p>
<p>Clifford, 74, had been serving an eight-year sentence at HMP Littlehey for historical sex offences against girls and women.</p>

<p>A report by the prisons and probation ombudsman said he was one of three prisoners to die of natural causes in the jail that weekend, although there were no similarities between the deaths.</p>
<p>When Clifford arrived at HMP Littlehey in 2014, tests showed he had a history of prostate cancer and was on prescribed medication for high blood pressure, but three years later a review revealed suspected heart failure.</p>

<p>The watchdog said that Clifford was sent for tests and given heart failure drugs, but then “started avoiding some medication because of its side-effects”.</p>
<p>His condition worsened but the disgraced publicist refused an urgent CT scan appointment on 7 December because of a legal visit.</p>
<p>The following morning, Clifford told a nurse he had collapsed in the shower and a GP asked the prison to call an emergency ambulance.</p>
<p>But the watchdog found that an “urgent but non-emergency ambulance” was called at 12.45pm instead, and did not arrive until 3pm.</p>
<p>The ombudsman said it was “concerned that there was both a delay in calling for an ambulance, and that an emergency ambulance was not called”.</p>

<p>Richard Pickering, the deputy prisons and probation ombudsman, said Clifford’s health issues had previously been managed appropriately.</p>
<p>“However, there was confusion with his medication being incorrectly labelled on at least two occasions, and it was clear that Mr Clifford was not taking his medication as prescribed,” he added.</p>
<p>“We are concerned that Mr Clifford was given incorrectly labelled medication on at least two occasions, and that staff did not monitor his medication compliance adequately at other times.”</p>
<p>In October 2017, Clifford spotted a labelling mistake himself and returned a box of tablets after “nearly passing out” when he took one.</p>
<p>The medication had been labelled as a 2mg dose when in fact they were four times stronger.</p>
<p>Clifford was conscious when he arrived at Hinchingbrooke hospital after his collapse in December but his condition deteriorated and he required resuscitation twice before suffering a fatal cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>A post-mortem examination recorded the cause of death as congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>The report was written in November 2018 but was published after an inquest earlier this month found Clifford had died of natural causes.</p>
<p>The trust that provides healthcare at HMP Littlehey said the coroner had accepted its action plan and evidence of implementation.</p>
<p>Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said it would “continue to share learning and implement our findings to ensure our care is of a high standard”.

<h3 id="max-clifford-failed-to-take-proper-medication-before-death">&ldquo;Max Clifford &lsquo;failed to take proper medication before death&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5462d7ec700606773d6676c09390c722caf292c/0_13_4450_2669/master/4450.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=94330762a1abf8e3ef90242d223ded80" alt="img">
Disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford did not always take his medication at the “correct doses, if at all” before he died of heart failure, a prison doctor has told an inquest.</p>
<p>Clifford, 74, collapsed at Littlehey prison in Cambridgeshire, where he was serving an eight-year sentence for historical sex offences. He died at Hinchingbrooke hospital near Huntingdon on 10 December 2017. Dr Monica Chambers, who works as a GP at the prison, told an inquest in Peterborough: “Mr Clifford wasn’t always taking his medications at the correct doses, if at all.”</p>
<p>She said: “Prisoners are the same as the rest of the population. Many people hate taking tablets, many people are wary of taking tablets, many people do not like the side-effects.” She did not comment on whether this would have affected Clifford’s health.</p>
<p>Asked about the quality of the prison’s healthcare by Kimberley Aiken-Barre, representing Clifford’s family, Chambers said: “I think that our sick patients get a much better standard of healthcare than anybody does on the outside.” Asked further about conditions for Clifford, she said: “I believe Mr Clifford had a superb mattress, a very comfortable mattress, I don’t know how he managed to get that.”</p>
<p>GPs visit the prison weekly, she said, with prisoners allocated the same doctor each week for continuity.</p>

<p>Clifford first reported shortness of breath on 26 July 2017, she told Monday’s hearing, and was referred to a cardiologist at Hinchingbrooke after analysis of his blood samples.</p>
<p>The hospital wrote to the prison to say it had established that his “heart failure came on gradually; there wasn’t a sudden event”, and embarked on further investigations, Chambers said. He was prescribed drugs including to prevent his heart from going into an abnormal rhythm, she said.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of cardiac AL amyloidosis – a rare, serious condition caused by a build-up of abnormal proteins in organs and tissues – was reached by 6 December after Clifford was referred to a gastroenterologist, the inquest heard. It came after he had complained of further symptoms including “increased lethargy”, Dr Chambers added.</p>
<p>She said she referred Clifford to hospital on 8 December 8 2017 after colleagues raised concerns about his health and she visited him in his cell, as he was too unwell to go to the prison’s healthcare unit.</p>
<p>“He said he had fallen whilst in the shower that morning,” she said. “I noticed his blood pressure was low.”</p>
<p>She said he was short of breath and needed help to put his trousers on before an ambulance took him to hospital, where he died two days later. A postmortem examination recorded his cause of death as congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>Further underlying factors were given as cardiac AL amyloidosis, and plasma cell neoplasm, in which the body makes too many plasma cells.</p>
<p>Simon Milburn, assistant coroner for Cambridgeshire, said during the opening of the hearing that Clifford’s death “could not have been prevented” but that the inquest would examine “whether there were missed opportunities to provide an earlier diagnosis”. Dr Chambers said Clifford had missed one hospital appointment, which he had been told about at short notice, as it clashed with an appointment to see his legal team.</p>
<p>She said details of hospital appointments could not be given to prisoners far in advance, adding: “It’s one of the most frequent ways of escaping from prison so they’re told at late notice.”</p>
<p>Milburn said a cardiac MRI had been considered for Clifford but that “he didn’t feel he could tolerate the claustrophobia of the MRI tunnel” .</p>
<p>Aiken-Barre attempted to ask a witness, another prison GP, about the impact of a lack of heating in Clifford’s cell. Milburn halted the line of questioning, telling her: “I’m struggling to see the evidence or the relevance of this.” Clifford’s family had previously said he had complained of cold showers in prison.</p>
<p>The hearing, scheduled for five days, continues.

<p>Disgraced publicist Max Clifford was given wrongly-labelled medication at least twice in prison before he died, a report has found.</p>
<p>Clifford, 74, died two years ago while serving an eight-year sentence at Littlehey Prison in Cambridgeshire for historical sex offences.</p>
<p>The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman said inmates should be monitored more closely to ensure medicine was taken.</p>
<p>The prison&rsquo;s healthcare provider said it had implemented a plan to improve.</p>
<p>The report, written in November 2018, was published after an inquest into Clifford&rsquo;s death concluded he had died of natural causes.</p>
<p>On one occasion Clifford became dizzy after taking a mislabelled tablet four times the intended strength, the report said.</p>
<p>He told staff he realised their error because of the effects of taking the 8mg tablet of a heart medication that was labelled as 2mg.</p>
<p>Image copyright PA Media Image caption Max Clifford died of natural causes, an inquest concluded</p>
<p>After Clifford&rsquo;s death, &ldquo;a significant quantity&rdquo; of prescription medicine was found unused in his cell, said deputy ombudsman Richard Pickering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are concerned that Mr Clifford was given incorrectly labelled medication on at least two occasions, and that staff did not monitor his medication compliance adequately at other time,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>He also raised concerns at a delay in transferring Clifford to hospital, because staff called an urgent ambulance instead of the emergency one the GP requested.</p>
<p>The report recommends that prison pharmacy services be reviewed to avoid medication errors, staff ensure patients take their medication and respond with greater urgency to emergency situations.</p>
<p>Clifford died on 10 December 2017 at Hinchingbrooke Hospital, near Huntingdon, where he was taken after collapsing in the shower.</p>
<p>His inquest heard he could have received better care if his heart condition had been diagnosed sooner.</p>
<p>A post-mortem examination recorded the cause of death as congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which provides healthcare at HMP Littlehey, said the coroner had accepted its action plan and evidence of implementation.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NINTCHDBPICT000372276690.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
PAEDOPHILE publicist Max Clifford died in a &ldquo;freezing&rdquo; jail where showers were &ldquo;cold as ice&rdquo;, new evidence from prison inspectors suggests.</p>
<p>The findings, detailed in an upcoming report on Littlehey prison, look set to bolster claims by Clifford&rsquo;s family that the conditions in which he was held contributed to his death.</p>
<p>1 Max Clifford was kept in freezing conditions that contributed to his death, a new prison report suggests Credit: AFP</p>
<p>Clifford was a celebrity publicist who in 2014 was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault on four girls and women aged 15 to 19.</p>
<p>He was still serving an eight-year sentence at the prison in Cambridgeshire when he died aged 74 in December 2017, two days after suffering a heart attack.</p>
<p>The report, to be published in the coming weeks, will detail freezing temperatures brought about by broken boilers in the jail, the Times reported.</p>
<p>Daughter Louise Clifford said the findings reiterated complaints made by her father when he was alive.</p>
<p>“He said the water in the showers was like ice,&rdquo; she told the Times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prisoner in the cell next to him was sleeping in his clothes because it was so cold.”</p>
<p>A report into conditions at Littlehey published in June of last year said that the prison &ldquo;urgently required&rdquo; investment because the prison was operating &ldquo;below acceptable standards&rdquo;.</p>
<p>INQUEST SET TO RESUME</p>
<p>At a pre-inquest hearing in January, barrister Kimberley Aiken, speaking on behalf of the family, told a coroner: “The family have concerns that any gentleman of Mr Clifford’s age and infirmity would have had their death hastened by the conditions.”</p>
<p>Acting for the Ministry of Justice, Georgina Wolfe said: &ldquo;Not only is there no evidence of this but there&rsquo;s no evidence this had any impact on Mr Clifford&rsquo;s health and how he came by his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aiken acknowledged Clifford would have died &ldquo;in any event&rdquo;, but added &ldquo;perhaps not on that day&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would perhaps have been able to go home and have some family time - if the family&rsquo;s suspicions are correct,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>An inquest into Clifford&rsquo;s death is due to resume before the end of the year.</p>
