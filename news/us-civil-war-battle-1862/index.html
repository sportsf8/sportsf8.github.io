<p>MOST OF THE consequential battles of the American Civil War were fought in the 95-mile sphere that separated the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, and the Union capital of Washington, DC. Names like Antietam, Chancellorsville, and Bull Run have dominated American historical memory, but the scope of the conflict beyond these famous battlefields tends to get shoved to the back of the traditional analysis of how the North ground out its victory, and how the conflict remade the landscape.</p>
<p>Megan Kate Nelson has made an invaluable contribution to broadening our understanding of the Civil War in her riveting new book, The Three-Cornered War: The Union, the Confederacy, and Native Peoples in the Fight for the West. She has looked far to the West to explore the undertold story of the war in the deserts and mountains of the New Mexico territory (modern-day Arizona and New Mexico). The evocative title of her book comes from a soldier’s observation that what was playing out in New Mexico was, in fact, a “three-cornered war” between Union, Confederacy, and Native peoples.</p>
<p>Nelson has discovered letters, diaries, and records in Southwestern archives — far away from the traditional repositories of Civil War materials — that tell the story of this period as it was experienced by the people who were there. She uses these primary records to vividly bring the reader into this “forbidding landscape, with rolling deserts breaking suddenly into volcanic ranges and mesas” where a soldier could feel the “effects of the elevation, and of the semi-aridity of the climate.”</p>
<p>The first reaction to Nelson’s narrative is likely surprise — the Civil War really reached the lands of chili peppers and cacti? And the answer is not just yes, but that fighting in the desert was quite important from a strategic perspective. The Southwest was a gateway to both ocean ports and gold mines and its exploitation could swing the balance of victory or defeat. The Confederacy’s eastern ports were under blockade and it saw an opportunity in the West: it shared a border with New Mexico territory, which was part of the Union. In 1861, a Texas legislator named John R. Baylor led 300 Confederate troops into the New Mexico territory. This was the first Confederate invasion of Union territory — two years before Gettysburg — and Confederate Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin saw it as “opening a pathway to the Pacific.”</p>
<p>In February 1862, Jefferson Davis proclaimed the establishment of the Confederate Arizona Territory in what is today southern New Mexico and southern Arizona. Though it was thousands of miles from the Confederate capital of Richmond, the leadership considered this conquest important for, as Nelson calls, “Confederate manifest destiny” and ultimately to grow their “empire of slavery.” In early 1862 — coinciding with Confederate victories in the East — Confederate troops commanded by Henry Hopkins Sibley went on to capture Albuquerque and Santa Fe.</p>
<p>The Union wanted to repulse the Confederate invasion of New Mexico. The task fell to Colonel Edward Canby, who took command of the Department of New Mexico after his commander resigned to support the Confederacy. He had under his command “weathered men with experience fighting in high desert conditions” as well as new recruits from New Mexico and from Colorado. The famed frontiersman Kit Carson organized a cavalry unit made up largely of Hispano militiamen.</p>
<p>Nelson chronicles the frontier battles that were fought between Union and Confederate forces, culminating with the Battle of Glorieta Pass along the Santa Fe Trail on March 26–28, 1862, a series of rolling skirmishes with neither side prevailing until the end. A group of Union soldiers pursued a flanking maneuver, marching along a narrow path until they were above the Confederate wagon train. Hundreds of Union soldiers</p>
<p>began to run down through the trees and rocks, following mule trails that were used to bring wood to Johnson’s Ranch. The Texan sergeant made it to the cannon but was only able to fire two rounds at the mesa before Union soldiers overran his position. The Texans guarding the wagon train scattered into the woods.</p>
<p>That moment marked the end of the Confederate campaign for New Mexico; the Union soldiers drove off the Confederates’ mules and horses and after picking through the Confederate wagons for souvenirs they lit the wagons ablaze and watched, in the words of one Coloradan, until every wagon was a “smoldering heap of ruins.”</p>
<p>In the arid landscape, this loss of supplies would doom the Confederate forces. They had “mismanaged time, supplies, and natural resources in an unforgiving theater of war,” and as they retreated through the desert, their vision of Confederate manifest destiny “had evaporated like a desert mirage.” As much as they had been defeated by Union forces, Nelson shows that the vast landscape had helped defeat them — there simply was no way for them to maintain a supply route and there was little out there to forage. As the Confederates were forced into a retreat, they “left behind soldiers who were too sick or weak or dehydrated to go on.” As one Texan wrote, they eagerly awaited finding a creek or stream, their “lips black and parched, and throats swelled and dry, and breath hot and voice husky.”</p>
<p>The beauty of northern New Mexico that later attracted poets, painters, and high-dollar haciendas had been inhospitable to the Confederates seeking to occupy it. Sibley wrote that his Confederate troops left with an “irreconcilable detestation of the country and the people.” By August 1862, Canby’s Union forces had effectively retaken Confederate Arizona.</p>
<p>In a way that few military history books do, Nelson pays careful attention to the story of civilians caught in this war. She tells the story of Edward Canby’s wife Louisa, a frontier nurse, who was in Santa Fe when Confederate troops marched in. Though her husband was battling the Confederates, she did not hesitate to care for their wounded.</p>
<p>The fighting had an unexpected political outcome. After the repulsion of the Confederate invasion, “Anglo settlement of the region was once again possible,” as Nelson notes. Abraham Lincoln wrote in December 1862 that he was interested in the “immense mineral resources of some of those Territories” which could be used to help pay for an expensive war. And this opened up the “three-cornered war” — the victorious Union troops turned their energies toward a vicious campaign against Native peoples. Kit Carson led the troops he had organized into battle against the Mescaleros. The orders he proceeded under were that “[a]ll Indian men of that tribe are to be killed whenever and wherever you can find them.”</p>
<p>Nelson masterfully tells the story of this campaign from the vantage point of the Native peoples. She tells the story of Chiricahua Apache chief Mangas Coloradas, who fought off incursions from Confederate and Union forces into his territory. The story of his capture and execution is heart-wrenching. Nelson also tells the story of Juanita, a Navajo weaver who struggles to survive the incursions of the Union forces into the Navajo homeland, was captured and forcibly deported on the “Long Walk” from the Navajo homeland to a reservation in central New Mexico. In a lasting stain on his legacy and reputation, Kit Carson and his men pursued a brutal campaign against the Chiracahuas and Navajos “without mercy as part of his service to the Union.” They scoured the landscape looking for Navajo villages and then set them ablaze.</p>
<p>The Three-Cornered War is a major accomplishment in expanding our understanding of the scope of the Civil War, and linking it to the histories of Native peoples and the American West. This is a story about the Union emerging victorious — and paving the way for further development of the American West under the Homestead Act and the completion of a transcontinental railroad in 1869. But the Union victory does not have the same moral clarity that it has in the East. In New Mexico, the Union campaign “simultaneously embraced slave emancipation and Native extermination in order to secure an American empire of liberty.” The righteous campaign of morality that freed the slaves in the South was not the same in the West, where the Union forces emerged from an early victory against the Confederate forces to pursue a campaign of extermination of Native peoples.</p>
<p>Nelson’s book is also a timely reminder that the Civil War in the Southwest was not just an interesting tidbit in the history of the American West — it was part and parcel of the Confederate objective of creating an “empire of slavery” that expanded to the West. Though the Confederate presence in Arizona was short-lived, it cast a long shadow. In the early 1960s, the United Daughters of the Confederacy paid for a “Memorial to Arizona Confederate Troops” placed on the grounds of the Arizona State Capitol. Today, the monument stands alongside monuments to Arizona’s heroes including the Navajo Codetalkers and the Granite Mountain Hotshots. It is past time to move this monument to a museum — as Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs asked this week. As Nelson shows, the Confederates came to Arizona to expand slavery. Nelson has preserved the history of that conflict so that future generations can understand the complexities of that conflict — but there is no historical need for a monument whose purpose was to cast glory on the Confederate legacy.</p>
<p>The story of the war across this vast landscape is breathtaking in its scale, and Nelson has told it with a careful eye for detail and intriguing characters. The narrative can, at times, be challenging to follow, with the lens moving back and forth between a wide cast and no less than nine key protagonists, but the richness of the story more than makes up for that. The book should be read not only by Civil War buffs and students of the American West, but by anyone who wishes to gain a deeper appreciation of American history that goes beyond the traditional lens. It is a masterful synthesis of military and social history in one of the overlooked chapters of the American Civil War.</p>

As protests against systemic racism and police brutality continue, Confederate monuments across the nation have been defaced with spray paint, toppled by crowds and even officially removed.</p>
<p>The weathered, oxidized surfaces of these monuments seemingly suggest that the battle over slavery is a distant chapter in American history. But until May 31, the United States government was still paying out a Civil War pension, reports Michael M. Phillips for the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Irene Triplett, who died last month at the age of 90, received a check for $73.13 every month. Her father, Mose Triplett, served as a private in the Confederate Army before deserting and shifting his allegiances to the Union, according to Ian Shapira of the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Mose’s defection likely saved his life, reports Blake Stilwell for Military.com: He decided to switch sides after falling ill shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg, a July 1863 clash in which 92 percent of his former unit perished.</p>
<p>Triplett died in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, of complications from a broken hip, a relative tells the Post. She suffered from cognitive impairments that qualified her for a pension as the helpless child of a veteran, per the Journal.</p>
<p>“Just like the Confederate monuments issue, which is blowing up right now, I think this is a reminder of the long reach of slavery, secession and the Civil War,” Stephanie McCurry, a historian at Columbia University, tells the Post. “It reminds you of the battle over slavery and its legitimacy in the United States.”</p>
<p>The fact that Triplett was receiving a Civil War pension in 2020 owed much to the advanced age of her father, who was 83 when his second wife, 34-year-old Elida Hall, gave birth to their daughter in 1930. Such pairings were fairly common during the Great Depression, as Civil War veterans’ pensions offered financial security to younger women willing to take care of aging husbands, according to the Journal. Mose died in 1938 at age 92, reported Curt Mills for U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2016. Elida died in 1967.</p>
<p>Mose enlisted in the Confederate Army in 1862, serving in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment before transferring to the 26th North Carolina Infantry Regiment, according to the Journal. As his regiment marched through the Shenandoah River Valley to Gettysburg, Mose came down with a fever and was admitted to the hospital. He ran away from the infirmary just days before 734 of the 800 men in his unit were killed, wounded or captured in battle.</p>
<p>In 1864, Mose joined the Union Army’s 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry, nicknamed “Kirk’s Raiders” after commander Colonel George Washington Kirk.</p>
<p>Living in North Carolina after the war proved tenuous for Mose, as locals who still harbored fondness for the Confederacy “despised” all former Kirk’s Raiders, reports the Journal. Perhaps in response to this animosity, Mose kept pet rattlesnakes and often sat on the porch with a pistol resting in his lap.</p>
<p>In a 2014 story for the Journal, Phillips wrote that Triplett had a difficult childhood. She was beaten by both her teachers and parents; at school, peers teased her for being the daughter of a “traitor,” a relative recalled.</p>
<p>After her mother died in 1967, Triplett lived in a series of nursing homes. She made friends, chewed tobacco, and became known for her laughter and buoyant demeanor, reports the Post.</p>
<p>The last two veterans of the Civil War died in the 1950s at more than 100 years old, according to U.S. News. The last Confederate widow, Maudie Hopkins, died in 2008 at age 93, while the last Union widow, Gertrude Janeway, died in 2003 at age 93.

Daughter of private who fought for both sides and had children in his 80s lived for years in a North Carolina nursing home</p>
<p>The last person to receive a US government pension from the American civil war has died.</p>
<p>Confederate statue to be removed from Virginia&rsquo;s Monument Avenue Read more</p>
<p>Irene Triplett was 90 when she died last Sunday in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Her father, Mose Triplett, fought for the Confederacy and the Union in the civil war, which began in 1861 and ended with the defeat of the slave power in 1865. He applied for his Union pension 20 years after the war and in 1930, when his daughter was born, he was 83.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, which spoke to Irene Triplett for a story in 2014, reported that she died “from complications following surgery for injuries from a fall, according to the nursing home where she lived”.</p>
<p>Dennis St Andrew, a commander of the North Carolina Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, told the Journal Triplett was “a part of history”.</p>
<p>“You’re talking to somebody whose father was in the civil war,” he said. “Which is mind-bending.”</p>
<p>But to Stephanie McCurry, a historian of the civil war and Reconstruction era at Columbia University in New York, Triplett’s death acquired a deeper resonance by occurring in the midst of national civil unrest over the killing by Minneapolis police of George Floyd, an African American man.</p>
<p>“Just like the Confederate monuments issue, which is blowing up right now, I think this is a reminder of the long reach of slavery, secession and the civil war,” she told the Washington Post. “It reminds you of the battle over slavery and its legitimacy in the United States.”</p>
<p>Each month, Triplett collected $73.13 from the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), a total of $877.56 a year. Her father earned the sum by defecting north in 1863 after missing the battle of Gettysburg, the turning point of the war.</p>
<p>“Pvt Triplett enlisted in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry Regiment in May 1862,” the Journal reported, citing Confederate records which showed he was then 16.</p>
<p>And Triplett “transferred to the 26th North Carolina Infantry Regiment early the following year”, “fell ill as his regiment marched north” then “ran away from the hospital … while his unit suffered devastating losses at Gettysburg”.</p>
<p>A deserter, Triplett “made his way to Tennessee and, in 1864, enlisted in … the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry”, Kirk’s Raiders, which “carried out a campaign of sabotage against Confederate targets”.</p>
<p>Mose Triplett was unsurprisingly not popular in post-war North Carolina but eventually, in 1924, still childless, he married a second time. He was nearly 80. His new wife, Elida Hall, was 34. As the Journal put it, “such an age difference wasn’t rare, especially during the Great Depression when civil war veterans found themselves with both a pension and a growing need for care.”</p>
<p>Triplett and Hall had five children but only two survived: Irene, who like her mother suffered from mental disabilities, and Everette, a son born when Mose Triplett was 87. As the Journal wrote in 2014, “Irene and Everette Triplett were born in tough country during tough times. The forested hills ran with white lightning from illegal stills. Ms Triplett said she didn’t drink moonshine, but she got hooked on tobacco in first grade.”</p>
<p>“I dipped snuff in school, and I chewed tobacco in school,” Triplett said then. “I raised homemade tobacco. I chewed that, too. I chewed it all.”</p>
<p>In 1938, aged 92, Mose Triplett attended a reunion at Gettysburg. In his remarks, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt referred to the Gettysburg Address, delivered in November 1863: “Lincoln spoke in solace for all who fought upon this field; and the years have laid their balm upon their wounds. Men who wore the blue and men who wore the gray are here together, a fragment spared by time.”</p>

<p>Housed in the Confederate camp, Triplett reportedly kept quiet about the double service that placed him in rarefied company. The Victorian journalist and explorer Henry Morton Stanley, for example, also fought for both sides.</p>

<p>Triplett died shortly afterwards. His gravestone, in Wilkes county, says only: “He was a civil war soldier.”</p>
<p>In 1943, Irene and her mother moved to the Wilkes county poor house. In 1960, they moved to a care home. Elida Hall died in 1967. Everette Triplett died in 1996. Irene lived on, her care paid for by Medicaid and the civil war pension.</p>
<p>The Journal reported that though Irene “saw little of her relatives … a pair of civil war buffs visited and sent her money to spend on Dr Pepper and chewing tobacco”.</p>
<p>Jamie Phillips, the home’s activities director, told the Post Triplett liked gospel music, cream cheese cheeseballs and laughing.</p>
<p>“A lot of people were interested in her story,” Phillips said, “but she’d always deflect the conversation to something different going on in the news.”

Part of the land to be saved is situated at a portion of the “Bloody Ravine” — where action took place in the battle’s morning segment. The Confederates were on one side of the ravine and Union troops on the other, “shooting over the ravine and on its slopes,” Hudson explained. The forces pushed each other back and forth with large numbers of men killed on each side. Ultimately, that portion of the battle was unresolved until the Confederates withdrew, Hudson explained.

<h3 id="7-reasons-ulysses-s-grant-was-one-of-americas-most-brilliant-military-leaders">&ldquo;7 Reasons Ulysses S. Grant Was One of America’s Most Brilliant Military Leaders&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTcyNDk4NTM5MDQ0MjgzNDc1/ulysses-s-grant-gettyimages-658412268.jpg" alt="img">
In March 1864, Ulysses S. Grant went to Washington, D.C., to receive his commission from Abraham Lincoln as lieutenant general in command of all the Union armies. After several years of frustration with a parade of unsuitable commanders, the president had finally found the man who would defeat Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia and thus effectively end the Civil War. The choice was surprising to many who had known Grant in former days. Ten years before, in April 1854, Captain Grant had submitted his resignation under a cloud.</p>
<p>In one of history’s unexpected developments, the military profession Grant “had always disliked,” in the words of his biographer Bruce Catton, ultimately “turned out to be the calling made for him.” How did an ambivalent soldier who had been away from the army for several years—and who had drifted during that interval from one civilian occupation to another in search of elusive success—end up leading a vast force to victory and saving the Union?</p>
<p>Grant’s predecessors in command of the Union Army were far more accomplished in military art and science. Winfield Scott, whose experience dated back to the War of 1812, had led the army since 1841. George B. McClellan, who replaced the aging Scott early in the Civil War, was an able administrator who organized the Army of the Potomac. In the 1850s, McClellan had studied the Crimean War at first hand as a member of an official delegation of American observers. Henry W. Halleck, the author of Elements of Military Art &amp; Science, was regarded as a master theoretician.</p>
<p>READ MORE: The Key Way West Point Prepared Ulysses S. Grant for the Civil War</p>
<p>Yet McClellan and Halleck both proved reluctant to take decisive action in the field. After the Battle of Shiloh, it took the latter almost a month to advance 20 miles south to attack the vital Confederate railroad junction at Corinth, Mississippi. Lincoln grew so frustrated with McClellan’s inaction that he responded to the general’s October 1862 request for more horses with an exasperated telegram: “I have just read your despatch about sore tongued and fatiegued [sic] horses. Will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigue anything?”</p>
<p>By contrast, Grant had never been an enthusiastic student of military art and science. Even his fiercely loyal lieutenant William T. Sherman doubted Grant’s “knowledge of grand strategy, and of books of science and history.” He told his friend precisely that in a March 1864 letter, in which he also concluded that Grant’s triumph owed in large measure to his fundamental “common-sense” and to his “chief characteristic,” an unshakeable “faith” in victory. That faith was justified by a serendipitous combination of qualities that enabled Grant to become one of the most extraordinary military leaders in American history.</p>

<p>He didn’t let up.</p>
<p>Grant didn’t go in much for doctrine, but he brought a relentlessly aggressive approach to warfare. He always favored activity and forward movement to standing still. Even in victory, he would be frustrated by subordinates’ failure to pursue the retreating enemy.</p>
<p>In his memoirs, he records an incident that reveals his philosophy. In 1863, Union General William Rosecrans refused an order to advance to meet an enemy force while Grant was laying siege to Vicksburg, the key to controlling the Mississippi River, because Rosecrans claimed that doing so would violate the “military maxim ‘not to fight two decisive battles at the same time.’” Grant was singularly unimpressed: “If true,” he observes, “the maxim was not applicable in this case. It would be bad to be defeated in two decisive battles fought the same day, but it would not be bad to win them.”</p>
<p>When, in the summer of 1864, Grant informed the cautious Halleck, back in Washington, of his refusal to disengage Lee and withdraw troops to quell draft resistance in the North, Lincoln responded in language that encapsulated Grant’s tenacious approach: “I have seen your despatch expressing your unwillingness to break your hold where you are. Neither am I willing. Hold on with a bull-dog gripe [sic], and chew &amp; choke, as much as possible.”</p>
<p>READ MORE: How Lincoln and Grant&rsquo;s Partnership Won the Civil War</p>
<p>He was fearless.</p>
<p>Sherman told his fellow officer James Harrison Wilson, “I am a damned sight smarter man than Grant; I know a great deal more about war, military history, strategy, and grand tactics than he does; I know more about organization, supply, and administration and about everything else than he does; but I’ll tell you where he beats me and where he beats the world. He don’t care a damn for what the enemy does out of his sight, but it scares me like hell!”</p>
<p>Grant’s refusal to be paralyzed by imagining what the enemy was doing owed to an epiphany early in the war when he was leading a regiment for the first time, in pursuit of Confederate Colonel Thomas Harris in Missouri. “As we approached the brow of the hill from which it was expected we could see Harris’ camp, and possibly find his men ready formed to meet us, my heart kept getting higher and higher until it felt to me as though it was in my throat,” Grant recalls in his memoirs. But when he had the good fortune to find the camp abandoned, Grant’s “heart resumed its place.” He learned the vital lesson that his adversary “had been as much afraid of me as I had been of him&hellip; From that event to the close of the war, I never experienced trepidation upon confronting an enemy, though I always felt more or less anxiety.”</p>

<p>He brushed off setbacks.</p>
<p>In April 1862, during the bloody two-day Battle of Shiloh, Grant did not share his colleagues’ bleak view. Sherman was demoralized by the first day’s fighting, while Don Carlos Buell, who arrived with reinforcements in the midst of the battle, advised retreat. Grant refused: “The distant rear of an army engaged in battle is not the best place from which to judge correctly what is going on in front,” he asserts in his memoirs. By the next day, he continues, “we had now become the attacking party. The enemy was driven back all day, as we had been the day before, until finally he beat a precipitate retreat.” In May 1864, after fighting to a costly stalemate in his first battle with Robert E. Lee, at the Wilderness, in Virginia, Grant surprised and delighted the Union Army of the Potomac by not retreating, as they had done so many times before under different commanders. “Most of us thought…that the next day we should recross the river,” a captain in a Massachusetts regiment remembered, “but when the order came, ‘By the left flank, march!’ we found that Grant was not made that way, and we must continue the fight.” Sherman likewise celebrated Grant’s decision: “When Grant cried ‘Forward!’ after the battle of the Wilderness, I said: ‘This is the grandest act of his life; now I feel that the rebellion will be crushed.’ I wrote him, saying it was a bold order to give, and&hellip;it showed the mettle of which he was made.”</p>

<p>He believed in success—but didn’t romanticize the means to achieving it.</p>
<p>What Sherman called Grant’s “simple faith in success” proved infectious. His confidence and determination made others believe in themselves as well: “when you have completed your best preparations, you go into battle without hesitation&hellip;no doubts, no reserve,” Sherman wrote to Grant. “I tell you that it was this that made us act with confidence. I knew wherever I was that you thought of me, and if I got in a tight place you would come—if alive.”</p>
<p>But Grant was no mystic, nor was he reckless. His confidence was rooted in an unswerving sense of purpose, an unflappable nature, an ability to delegate responsibility as opposed to micromanaging, and knowledge gained by cool and careful observation over the years. In the Mexican War, he studied two commanders in action: Winfield Scott and Zachary Taylor, whose nicknames—“Old Fuss and Feathers” and “Old Rough and Ready”—encapsulate their antithetical styles. From Taylor, who always “put his meaning so plainly there could be no mistaking it,” Grant learned the importance of clear and direct communication.</p>
<p>It was in Mexico, while serving as regimental quartermaster and involving himself in as many battles as he could, that Grant had learned the decidedly unromantic aspects of war: the ingenuity required to feed and supply an army, the hazards of poor camp sanitation, the value of different kinds of expertise and the unequivocal brutality of combat. In the last year of the Civil War, as casualties mounted and the horrors of trench warfare accumulated in the Battles of Cold Harbor and Petersburg, Grant remained fixed in his purpose to destroy Lee’s army.</p>

<p>He synthesized information quickly.</p>
<p>In addition to being a gifted writer, Grant was an expert listener—“at his best,” one staff officer suggested, in “sudden emergencies.” Faced with a new situation, as he was on arriving in the besieged city of Chattanooga in late 1863, Grant sat “as silent as the sphinx” while officers delivered their reports, according to an eyewitness. Then, after firing “whole volleys of questions,” he proceeded to write out a series of dispatches. The biographer William McFeely explains the significance of this episode: Grant’s “orders and telegrams&hellip;demonstrated a grasp of the whole of the Western Theater of the war. From the disjointed reports he had been given, he put together a coherent picture of the terrain of an area new to him, and of the vast confused array of men who contended for it.”</p>
<p>He had a gift for seeing the &lsquo;lay of the land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grant’s memory for terrain was photographic. One staff officer observed that after one hard look at a map, “he could follow its features without referring to it again. Besides, he possessed an almost intuitive knowledge of topography, and never became confused as to the points of the compass.” This gift was complemented by superb horsemanship, which allowed Grant to see for himself as much of the battlefield as possible.</p>
<p>In the Eastern Theater, which he studied for only eight weeks, Grant revealed a thorough grasp of the strategic situation. He decided to leave executive command of the Army of the Potomac to George G. Meade in order to give himself time to manage an extensive area of operations stretching from New England to New Mexico, from Minnesota to Mississippi. “Wherever Lee goes,” he ordered Meade, “there you will go also.” Keeping Lee’s army engaged, Grant unleashed Philip Sheridan’s cavalry on the Shenandoah Valley, the breadbasket of the Confederacy, and freed Sherman to march through the South destroying railroads, supplies—and morale.</p>

<p>He never lost sight of the bigger picture.</p>
<p>Yet none of this would have been possible had Grant not also comprehended the war’s larger political context and harmonized his efforts on the battlefield with the aims of the Lincoln administration. As the latter enlarged from preservation of the Union to the freeing of enslaved persons in the Confederacy with the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, Grant’s policies and vision likewise evolved. His way of prosecuting the war and securing the peace revealed a sure understanding of the war’s political stakes—and of the fact that the South’s best hope of victory was to sap the political will of the North by prolonging the war.</p>
<p>For Grant, who as a young man had fought in the Mexican War, a conflict in which he did not believe, the Civil War was a war of principle. At the conclusion of his memoirs, he sums it up with his customary lucidity when he describes the Confederate cause as “one of the worst for which a people ever fought, and one for which there was the least excuse.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OIOONLNVNBFGHIGXBK4CZLOGTU&amp;w=1440" alt="img">

<p>On Sunday, Irene Triplett died at Accordius Health, a long-term-care facility in Wilkesboro, N.C., at the age of 90. A relative said she’d broken her hip a few days earlier and died of complications. She never married, and her only brother had died in 1996.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Triplett’s story is a powerful reminder that the Civil War wasn’t that long ago, said Columbia University historian Stephanie McCurry. “Just like the Confederate monuments issue, which is blowing up right now, I think this is a reminder of the long reach of slavery, secession and the Civil War,” she said. “It reminds you of the battle over slavery and its legitimacy in the United States.”</p>
<p>Many more widows and children of other long-ago soldiers are still alive. According to VA, there are 33 surviving spouses and 18 children receiving pension benefits related to the 1898 Spanish-American War.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Triplett’s status as a Civil War pensioner began gaining attention in 2011, when the Wilkes Genealogical Society in Wilkes County, N.C., displayed her photograph on its quarterly publication and featured her in a story. The article noted she was one of only two people in the country still reaping a Civil War pension.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>One of the piece’s researchers, Jerry Orton, of Syracuse, N.Y., a member of the Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, first discovered that Triplett was earning the benefit in the late 1980s, after he’d embarked on a research project on surviving widows and children of Civil War soldiers. He’d gotten her name from the Veterans Administration. Eventually, he traveled to North Carolina and interviewed her about her life.</p>
<p>“Irene could not recall much of her childhood and has no recollection of Mose,” the historical society’s article said. “She has virtually no memories of fun, presents, friends, neighbors or such, as they lived so isolated, and she had to work on the farm each day, where they primarily raised chicken[s] and kept some hogs and cows as well.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In 2013, an Associated Press story reported that more than $40 billion a year was being spent to compensate veterans and survivors from the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan war. Then the wire service dropped this nugget: “The Civil War payments are going to two children of veterans — one in North Carolina and one in Tennessee — each for $876 per year.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But the AP story didn’t name Triplett or the Tennessee recipient. That’s when the tabloid Daily Mail got involved, identifying Triplett for the first time in a major news publication. The headline: “EXCLUSIVE: Revealed, America’s last living link to the Civil War.”</p>
<p>Relying partly on military records, Orton’s research for the genealogical society and an interview with her nephew, the Daily Mail piece included a photo of Triplett and painted a colorful portrait of her father: Mose first joined a Confederate regiment in North Carolina in 1862, then defected to the Union Army in 1864. He once held a rattlesnake around his neck and sported a Wyatt Earp-style mustache that extended below his chin. He sat on his porch and shot acorns out of trees.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The next year, the Wall Street Journal published its own story on Triplett, a lengthy front-pager that recounted how Mose chose to abandon the Confederacy at exactly the right time — just as he and his regiment were marching through the Shenandoah River Valley on their way to Gettysburg, Pa. The Journal noted that Mose went to a hospital in Danville, Va., with a fever and that state records said he “deserted” on June 26, 1863.</p>
<p>For his future daughter, the timing of his decision could not have been more significant. About a week later, of the 800 men in Mose’s Confederate regiment, 734 died at the Battle of Gettysburg, the Journal said.</p>
<p>On Aug. 1, 1864, Mose joined the 3rd North Carolina Mounted Infantry, known as “Kirk’s Raiders,” a regiment that laid waste to Confederate depots, railroads and bridges.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Four months after the war ended in 1865, Mose was discharged, and he eventually moved back to his native North Carolina, settling on farmland in Wilkes County. Twenty years later, the Journal article said, he applied for his Civil War pension. He and his first wife, Mary, had no children.</p>
<p>After Mary died in the 1920s, Mose married Elida Hall. He was 78. She was 27. Their 1924 marriage, according to the Journal, was rough. They lost three babies. Then Irene was born on Jan. 9, 1930, but had mental disabilities, according to the newspaper. She was 8 when her father died on July 18, 1938, at the age of 92. His headstone reads: “He was a Civil War soldier.”</p>
<p>When the Journal interviewed Triplett, she said her teachers beat her with an oak paddle, and her parents also hit her.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Other children teased her about her father, “the traitor,” one of her relatives told the newspaper. She dropped out of sixth grade. According to the Journal, she and her mother lived for years in a county “poorhouse,” which was infested with rats and mice, before she and her mother later moved into a private nursing home.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“I didn’t care for neither one [of my parents], to tell you the truth about it,” she said. “I wanted to get away from both of them. I wanted to get me a house and crawl in it all by myself.”</p>
<p>After her mother died in 1967, Triplett eventually found her own friends at various nursing homes, especially at her most recent stay at Accordius Health. She chewed tobacco from her pouch of Star tobacco. She loved watching the news on television and reporting back to other residents about the latest goings-on.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Jamie Phillips, the home’s activities director, said she spent most days with her playing bingo and watching her use a red Solo cup as her spittoon. She loved gospel music. Listening to the Bill Withers song, “Lean on Me.” Cream cheese cheeseballs. Fried potatoes and onions. Fried chicken and pinto beans. Laughing. This is what she was known for.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Even if you tripped or dropped something, she’d laugh,” Phillips said. “She was set off by anything. I never saw her angry. Everything was funny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if anyone asked her about her father or, in the aftermath of all the news stories, why she was getting a Civil War pension check, she’d demur. “A lot of people were interested in her story,” Phillips said, “but she’d always deflect the conversation to something different going on in the news.”</p>
