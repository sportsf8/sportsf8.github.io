<h3 id="swiss-covid-app-startet-in-die-pilotphase">&ldquo;Swiss-Covid-App startet in die Pilotphase&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.computerworld.ch/img/1/4/9/3/3/1/3/corona-app-Geralt-Pixabay_w1200_h629.jpg" alt="img">
Die Swiss-Covid-App, mit der enge Kontakte zwecks Pandemiebekämpfung zurückverfolgt werden sollen, tritt in die Pilotphase.</p>
<p>Die schon in der Entwicklungsphase vieldiskutierte Swiss-Covid-App ist bereit. Während der Pilotphase soll die Funktionsweise der Smartphone-App getestet werden. Teile der Bevölkerung bleiben skeptisch. Bei ihnen muss der Bund noch einiges an Aufklärung leisten.</p>
<p>Gleich vier Experten gaben am Montagnachmittag am regelmässigen Point de Presse des Bundes Auskunft zu den Themen Rückverfolgung von Corona-Fällen - genannt Contact-Tracing - und zur Schweizer App - genannt Proximity-Tracing- oder Swiss-Covid-App. Alle machten deutlich: Die App sei als technisches Hilfsmittel zur Bekämpfung des Coronavirus nützlich, werde aber nicht der Heilsbringer sein.</p>
<p>«Es gibt keinen Beweis, dass man mit einer App die Epidemie stoppen kann», sagte Marcel Salathé, Leiter der bundeseigenen Expertengruppe «Digital epidemiology». Wenn aber rund 60 Prozent der Bevölkerung die App benutzten und sich an die Quarantäne-Anweisungen hielten, könne die Reproduktionszahl unter 1 gehalten werden.</p>
<p>Notwendige Begleitmassnahmen</p>
<p>Das analoge Contact-Tracing funktioniere im Moment nur suboptimal, sagte Daniel Koch, Delegierter des Bundesamts für Gesundheit (BAG) für Covid-19. «Wir müssen besser wissen, wer wann wo war.» In Restaurants und Bars ist die Angabe der Kontaktdaten freiwillig. Koch wünscht sich, dass mehr Personen mitmachen.</p>
<p>Die Swiss-Covid-App sei nicht das einzige Mittel, auf das man sich verlassen könne. Es handle sich dabei lediglich um ein nützliches Instrument. Auf keinen Fall sollten Personen, welche die App installiert haben, auf weitere Massnahmen verzichten. Die normalen Abstands- und Hygieneregeln seien weiterhin einzuhalten.

An NHS support sign is shown through the crown logo on the gates to Ascot Racecourse on April 08, 2020 in Ascot, England.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service (NHS) is considering a major U-turn on its new coronavirus contract-tracing app, just days after launching it on the Isle of Wight amid concerns that it doesn&rsquo;t work as it&rsquo;s intended to.</p>
<p>Contact-tracing apps are a way for governments to monitor the spread of coronavirus in a population. Around the world, states are using them to alert people when they have been in close contact with an infected person.</p>
<p>Countries are having to choose whether to build &ldquo;centralized&rdquo; contact-tracing apps, where data is stored on a government server, or &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; apps, where data is processed on the handset itself. The initial version of the NHS app is based on a centralized framework, so the data can be kept on an NHS database. The centralized approach allows researchers to access the data and NHSX to tweak the app over time as necessary.</p>
<p>However, the NHS&rsquo;s digital innovation arm, NHSX, has awarded a £3.8 million contract to Zuhlke Engineering, a Switzerland-headquartered IT firm with an office in London, to &ldquo;investigate&rdquo; switching the app onto the global standard proposed by Apple and Google.</p>
<p>In the contract, it states that Zuhlke Engineering should &ldquo;investigate the complexity, performance and feasibility of implementing native Apple and Google contact tracing APIs (application programming interfaces) within the existing proximity mobile application and platform.&rdquo; The contract started on May 5 and runs until November 10.</p>
<p>The story was first reported by The Financial Times newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both Zuhlke and Pivotal have been working on the project with NHSX to date, and both have just renewed contracts for the next phase,&rdquo; an NHSX spokesperson told CNBC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The suggestion this means we are moving away from the centralized model is without foundation. We&rsquo;ve been working with Apple and Google throughout the app&rsquo;s development and it&rsquo;s quite right and normal to continue to refine the app.&rdquo;

Green or red light: China virus app is ticket to everywhere</p>
<p>People must show their status on an app that determines whether they are a coronavirus threat</p>
<p>By Ludovic Ehret / AFP, BEIJING</p>
<p>To enter many offices, restaurants, parks or malls in China nowadays, people must show their status on an app that determines whether they are a coronavirus threat.</p>
<p>There is often a moment of tension before opening the app on arriving at a location.</p>
<p>A green light lets you in anywhere. A yellow light could send you into home confinement. The dreaded red light throws a person into a strict two-week quarantine at a hotel.</p>

<p>Such controversial use of technology has raised alarm in Europe as countries including Britain, France and Switzerland look into launching their own apps to trace infections.</p>
<p>But use has mushroomed across China, where the government keeps a close eye on the population and collects troves of personal data. Many Chinese people say they are happy to cooperate for the greater good.</p>
<p>“We are in a special context with this epidemic, so divulging my movements doesn’t bother me,” said Debora Lu, a 30-year-old Shanghai resident.</p>

<p>“Human life is more important.”</p>
<p>TRAVEL PASS</p>
<p>There is more than one tracking app in China.</p>
<p>People on May 2 wear face masks as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 coronavirus as they use a phone app to scan a code required to prove their health and travel status before being allowed to enter a shopping mall in Beijing. Photo: AFP</p>
<p>An app by the State Council, China’s cabinet, uses GPS locations shared by telecommunications companies — the kind of data sharing that might not be permissible in Western democracies.</p>
<p>It allows authorities to look back at someone’s travel history in the previous 14 days and see if they visited areas considered high risk or were exposed to anyone with COVID-19.</p>
<p>The app appears to have had some glitches. The health code of many foreigners in China inexplicably turned yellow one day last month. When an AFP reporter encountered a similar issue more recently, the app turned green again after he turned it off and on several times.</p>
<p>Other applications do not use GPS data but rely on a host of alternative information.</p>
<p>Beijing has a “Health Kit” program that displays whether people have taken a train or plane, passed a road checkpoint into the city or have been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Police, health authorities and neighborhood committees that are ubiquitous in the communist-ruled country feed information into the software.</p>
<p>Otherwise, all the apps basically work in the same way. After downloading the app, users enter their name, identity card number, telephone number and sometimes a photo. The program then gives the person a colored health code.</p>
<p>The apps have become a necessity for travel in China, to book train or plane tickets or enter many public places, though not all establishments require them, such as supermarkets.</p>
<p>GIVING UP PRIVACY</p>
<p>Beijing’s city government insists the apps “are only used in the fight against the epidemic” and have access to just surnames and the last two digits of ID numbers.</p>
<p>“There is a difference between Chinese and Western culture,” said Cui Xiaohui, a professor at the big data analysis and AI research center at the University of Wuhan — the city where the virus first emerged late last year.</p>
<p>“Most Chinese people are ready to sacrifice a little bit of their private life if it is really for their health,” Cui said.</p>
<p>Li Song, a 37-year-old actor, agrees.</p>
<p>“We are already super-connected and there is no debate on the use of geolocation,” said Li, a Shanghai resident whose app was red when he returned from a trip to France and turned green once his two-week quarantine ended.</p>
<p>It is not so simple in European democracies.</p>
<p>The Swiss government’s original plans to roll out an app were thwarted by parliament, which decided it needed a proper legal basis to press ahead.</p>
<p>If approved, the Swiss app will be optional and no personal data or location information will be used, the government says.</p>
<p>In France, the StopCovid app being developed would allow users who become sick to anonymously alert people they may have come across. It would not use GPS location technology.</p>
<p>Britain is also trialling a new phone app to identify localized outbreaks.</p>
<p>“China doesn’t have specific laws or regulations yet on the protection of personal data,” said Zhou Lina, a professor specializing in data protection at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.</p>
<p>But the country has other legislation, including a cybersecurity law passed in 2017, that partially covers the issue and curbs abuses by companies online.</p>
<p>These laws would not stop authorities from accessing personal data however, said Jeremy Daum, senior research fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, noting that police have “enormous power” to collect information.</p>
<p>“Government access to information is not held to the same standards and the law assumes that internal checks are sufficient to stop government abuses,” Daum said.

<h3 id="swiss-soldiers-fight-covid-19-armed-with-bluetooth-app">&ldquo;Swiss soldiers fight COVID-19 armed with Bluetooth app&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NX7NeaceiJkW9qwVsNt3ig--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/5c768ef96f2d76f996620fff8ee8d9d10c387467.jpg" alt="img">
Chamblon (Switzerland) (AFP) - Swiss army conscripts are taking the fight to the coronavirus pandemic by field-testing a Bluetooth-based smartphone app aimed at stopping a resurgence of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The rapidly-created app traces people who have inadvertently crossed paths with someone infected with the virus.</p>
<p>It uses wireless technology with each phone registering the others it has come into close proximity with for a sustained period of time.</p>
<p>For the field test, the infantry recruits went through a normal day: physical training, theoretical study and shooting at targets 300 metres away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we did before was lab tests. Now we&rsquo;re gathering data on how this app performs in real life,&rdquo; Simon Rosch, a software engineer with smartphone app developers Ubique, told AFP.</p>
<p>The military base makes a good testing ground because, unlike civilians, soldiers are still allowed to congregate in numbers in close proximity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are isolated from the rest of the population inside their barracks at Chamblon, overlooking Lake Neuchatel in western Switzerland.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking the chain -</li>
</ul>
<p>If an app user tests positive for the virus, a coded message is sent to others who might have been exposed to that person, with information as to what they should do next.</p>
<p>The aim is to break the chains of transmission and thereby suppress any spread of the virus as lockdown restrictions are gradually lifted.</p>
<p>Ubique, which developed Switzerland&rsquo;s main weather app, started working on the new tool only a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>They then joined forces with experts from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL) university, which had produced similar ideas.</p>
<p>EPFL does the security, research and Bluetooth tests while Ubique builds that knowledge into the app and comes up with the design and user experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m pretty positive about this becoming operational &ndash; and it will help,&rdquo; Rosch said during the test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a magic solution that can make the problem disappear but it&rsquo;s a good thing that can support us.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy questions -</li>
</ul>
<p>Sitting in a military briefing room armed with a laptop, Alfredo Sanchez went through the first data sets from the field test.</p>
<p>A soldier was designated as if he had tested positive for the virus, and his contacts were then traced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in the evaluation phase. The results will mean we will make some adjustments,&rdquo; said Sanchez, a project manager in the EPFL IT department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an idea that started in Asia using GPS, which is a bit more invasive because it tracks exactly where people were,&rdquo; he told AFP.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was created to find a solution that is much more respectful of privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because Bluetooth signal cannot travel far, app users must be close to pick up the digital handshake between devices.</p>
<p>It does not matter whereabouts that connection takes place, so no location data is gathered, and the process is anonymous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have the name of the person or the phone number. The app sends a message saying you were in contact on a certain date with a person who tested positive,&rdquo; said Sanchez.</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-peak control -</li>
</ul>
<p>Switzerland believes it now has the virus under manageable control after more than 1,400 people died in the Alpine nation and 30,000 tested positive.</p>
<p>Matthias Egger, the government&rsquo;s COVID-19 scientific task force head, told a press conference in Bern on Friday that two surveys now showed around 60 percent of the population would use the app &ndash; a high level of reach that would make it very effective.</p>
<p>Rosch said: &ldquo;The chances that you detect something get higher the more people have it installed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A May 11 roll-out date has been floated, to coincide with Switzerland reopening its schools and restaurants.</p>
<p>But it is dependent on a government green light &ndash; plus tech giants Apple and Google releasing a new software building block that will facilitate such apps.</p>
<p>Sanchez said any software compatibility adjustments could then be finished by late May or early June.</p>
<p>For now, the as-yet unnamed app is referred to as the Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing project &ndash; or the more &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; robot-sounding DP3T for short.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth contacts are stored for 14 days on users&rsquo; phones, rather than on a central server.</p>
<p>Soldier Colin Galligani, 20, has the test app on his mobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I check my phone regularly to see if I get a message and see if someone is infected,&rdquo; he said after target practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the information that EPFL gathers here, they can work on that so they can apply it to civilians.&rdquo;
