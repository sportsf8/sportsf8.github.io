<p>Draymond Green had some choice words about the Phoenix Suns and star Devin Booker during a recent appearance as an NBA analyst on TNT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good for him. It&rsquo;s not good for his career,&rdquo; Green said. &ldquo;&hellip; They gotta get Book out of Phoenix. I need my man to go somewhere where he can play great basketball all the time and win, because he&rsquo;s that type of player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[RELATED: Draymond emphatically believes KD is the best scorer ever]</p>
<p>After the NBA announced on Sunday that Green would face a $50,000 fine for tampering with his comments, the Suns&rsquo; Twitter account decided to have some fun with the situation while sharing a highlight video of Booker.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got at least 50(k) reasons why we love @DevinBook pic.twitter.com/5vLqvwqSLW — Phoenix Suns (@Suns) August 9, 2020</p>
<p>Green never has been one to shy away from speaking his mind, and also already has gone back and forth with longtime media nemesis Charles Barkley during other appearances on TNT&rsquo;s NBA coverage.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised if Draymond is a little more careful with his words going forward during his on-camera appearances.</p>

<h3 id="draymond-green-fined-for-booker-comments-suns-social-takes-aim">&ldquo;Draymond Green fined for Booker comments, Suns social takes aim&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://arizonasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/draymond-green.jpg" alt="img">
Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green is paying the price for his words about Phoenix Suns’ Devin Booker.</p>
<p>The NBA announced Sunday that Green would be fined $50,000 for his comments on TNT’s Inside the NBA on Friday about getting Booker out of Phoenix.</p>
<p>“It’s not good for him, it’s not good for his career … I need my man to go somewhere where he can play great basketball all the time and win,” Green said on the show Friday.</p>
<p>The Suns social media team didn’t let Green off the hook for his actions.</p>
<p>The team’s Twitter account posted a highlight reel of Devin Booker with the caption, “We’ve got at least 50(k) reasons why we love @DevinBook.”</p>
<p>Green’s comments raised eyebrows about the possibility of tampering, something that the NBA has attempted to crack down on since the start of the 2019-2020 season. The league’s also taken a stricter stance on salary cap circumvention and free agency timing rules.</p>
<p>Host Ernie Johnson asked Green if he was tampering after the comment. Green momentarily paused before saying, “Maybe,” and stuttering to an explanation.</p>
<p>Phoenix is currently 5-0 in the NBA bubble as they vie for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>The Suns are off Sunday but will be scoreboard watching with a tight race for the eighth seed. The Memphis Grizzlies and San Antonio Spurs are narrowly ahead of Phoenix in the standings and have a chance to put a little distance between them with wins.</p>

<h3 id="phoenix-stunning-nba-world-with-red-hot-restart">&ldquo;Phoenix stunning NBA world with red-hot restart&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nba.com/images/cms/2020-08/GettyImages-1227968731.jpg?w=1045&amp;h=588" alt="img">
ORLANDO — A week before the NBA shut down the season, the Suns were walloped by 16 points, courtesy of the team with the worst record and only eight healthy players, the stripped-down Warriors, and in Phoenix no less.</p>
<p>After that game, Suns forward Mikal Bridges said dismally: &ldquo;I think you just go home, look yourself in the mirror and see if you really want this, if you really want to win and if you really want to contribute.”</p>
<p>A week after the NBA restart, the Suns are the only undefeated team in Orlando and find themselves in the playoff conversation. And so: After beating Miami to stay spotless at 5-0, guard Ricky Rubio said encouragingly: “We’re hungry, thirsty and hoping to go 8-0.”</p>
<p>Well: What a difference a week makes, especially when that week stretches four months, no? It tells the tale of two Suns, one that was being eclipsed and the other beaming, and given a second chance, Phoenix is breathing new life in a most improbable situation.</p>
<p>“I think this bubble situation was made for us and we’re taking advantage of it,” said guard Devin Booker.</p>
<p>Phoenix moves to 5-0 during the NBA restart in Orlando with a win over the Heat.</p>
<p>Let’s put this into context: This is the Suns’ longest winning streak in six years, which says plenty about where the Suns have been and maybe where they’re going. Obviously, this is the most consecutive wins in the career of Booker, at 23 the youngest player to score 7,000 points, who provided the biggest shot in Orlando with a buzzer-beater over the Clippers.</p>
<p>Coming into this reboot at 26-39 and five games out of eighth place, the Suns had no shot of pulling out a playoff spot unless they either ran the table in the seeded schedule or came close. Well, both are in play; they’re two games behind Memphis for eighth place and a half-game behind the Blazers for ninth and firmly in contention for a play-in game for the playoffs.</p>
<p>Upcoming are remaining games with Oklahoma City, Philly and Dallas. Those three teams have already clinched playoff spots and might rest some of their starters against Phoenix; the Sixers will definitely be without Ben Simmons, who left the campus to undergo knee surgery. And yet it still won’t be easy for the Suns; they’ll need the Grizzlies, Blazers and Spurs to cooperate by losing a few games to raise the possibility of a Suns uprising.</p>
<p>“We’re far from perfect,” said coach Monty Williams. “I’m glad we have the record we have here in the bubble, but have a lot of work to do to overcome the obstacle in front of us.”</p>
<p>What exactly has gotten into the Suns? Along with the Wizards, they were mainly an afterthought in the restart as the teams with the worst records in the East and West. Washington has already faded as expected and simply playing out the schedule. The Suns refused to follow the script.</p>
<p>With a young rotation and a coach in his first year in Phoenix, the Suns were on a rebuilding schedule — which seems constant in Phoenix — and in a best-case scenario would make a leap next season. And that was indeed the case when the season was halted by coronavirus. But there’s been scant evidence of growth in restart wins over the Clippers, Wizards, Mavericks, Pacers and Heat.</p>
<p>“These guys have had an offseason to think about the first 65 games and think about where they needed to grow,” said Williams. “I’m excited for the guys. They’ve put in the work.”</p>
<p>They’ll need to pick up the pace to escape their own history. A series of bungled front-office decisions put Phoenix on a constant and frustrating treadmill to nowhere, haunted mostly by wasted draft picks. They only have Booker, who’s averaging 28 points, to show for constant trips to the draft lottery over the last decade. That includes taking Josh Jackson at four over point guard De’Aaron Fox. Had the Suns taken Fox, he and Booker would’ve been a young backcourt tandem for the future and Phoenix wouldn’t have had to give away TJ Warren last summer to pay for Rubio. Warren is scorching for the Pacers right now and fresh off a 39-point game, just days after scoring 51.</p>
<p>Because of that misery, the Suns are constantly battling perception problems, which lately caused Draymond Green, a new addition to the TNT broadcasting team, to demand the Suns reroute Booker to a contender, saying, “It’s not good for him, not good for his career.”

<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/07/31/PPHX/c4ea06a8-1572-49b7-bdb1-a2cf5d70e415-USATSI_14655346.jpg?crop=3413,1920,x0,y172&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1801&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Mikal Bridges is doing more than scoreboard watching in the Orlando Bubble.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been cheering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking to friends today, funny way, I&rsquo;m a big Sixers fan today,&rdquo; the Philadelphia native said. &ldquo;Rooting for them today. Kind of weird for me to say, but it looks like I&rsquo;m rooting for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bridges&rsquo; hometown 76ers didn&rsquo;t come through for him and the Phoenix Suns, though.</p>
<p>Portland outlasted Philadelphia, 124-121, Sunday to stay in that coveted ninth place in the Western Conference and moved a full game ahead of the Suns.</p>
<p>Toronto beating Memphis, 108-99, helps Phoenix, which trail the eighth-place Grizzlies by 1-1/2 games, but San Antonio pushing past New Orleans,122-113, puts the Spurs a half game ahead of the Suns as they have a slightly better winning percentage.</p>
<p>New Orleans and Sacramento have been eliminated from playoff contention.</p>
<p>As intriguing and important as those games are, the Suns (31-39) remain focused on doing their part to stay in playoff contention as they look to stay unbeaten in the bubble Monday against Oklahoma City (43-26), which beat Washington,121-103, Sunday.</p>
<p>The 11:30 a.m. game will played at The Field House on ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex with Phoenix being the &ldquo;home&rdquo; team on the neutral floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s watching, but that can&rsquo;t be the focus,&rdquo; Suns coach Monty Williams said after a film session and &lsquo;really, really light&rsquo; practice Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, we have to prepare for a really good Oklahoma City team. We can only control how we prepare and how we work and execute. That&rsquo;s the deal. We&rsquo;re trying to put ourselves in a position to reach that ultimate goal, but we can&rsquo;t do that unless we take care of where we are right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wizards are 0-6 in the bubble with their first loss coming against Phoenix that started this five-game winning streak, its longest since the 2014-15 season.</p>
<p>The Suns have had the mindset they have to go 8-0 to make the playoffs. They&rsquo;re three wins away from achieving the first part of that equation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We said coming into this that we&rsquo;re fine with being an under-the-radar team,&rdquo; Suns All-Star Devin Booker said. &ldquo;That we were going to come in here and work hard and try to get wins. So far, so good. We&rsquo;ve had the right approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Suns have to play their final three games in four days as they face Philadelphia on Tuesday before closing out their seeding schedule Thursday against Dallas.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re young, hungry and energized, but even Williams knows his players have to take care of themselves on multiple levels to play at a maximum level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to be smart with our legs,&rdquo; Williams said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve talked to the guys this whole trip about preparation. Hydration. Sleep. Food. Getting off your feet. We&rsquo;ve got to adhere to that, but we&rsquo;ve got to keep the same focus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A play-in tournament is guaranteed in the West as Game 1 will be Aug. 15 at 11:30 a.m..</p>
<p>If the ninth-place team wins, it will force a decisive Game 2 at 1:30 p.m. Aug. 16 with the winner earning the eighth and final playoff seed.</p>
<p>Both games will be played at The Field House.</p>
<p>If the ninth place team loses Game 1, the eighth place team will get the final playoff spot.</p>
<p>Whoever winds up with the eighth seed will play the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round of the playoffs that starts Aug. 17.</p>
<p>The Suns are looking to earn that matchup and return to the postseason for the first time since 2010.</p>
<p>They need to keep winning and need others to lose, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve really been trying to take care of things on our end,&rdquo; Suns rookie Cam Johnson said. &ldquo;Coming in, we needed a little bit of help. So right now, we are fans of some other teams, as weird as it may be.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="western-conference-standings-suns-hope-stays-alive-with-memphis-loss">&ldquo;Western Conference standings: Suns hope stays alive with Memphis loss&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://arizonasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/nba-western-conference-bubble-standings.jpg" alt="img">
The Phoenix Suns are officially the hottest team in the NBA bubble. They entered Orlando with eight games to make up 2.5 games on the ninth seed to earn a play-in spot.</p>
<p>But Phoenix would have to surpass the Blazers, Spurs, Pelicans and Kings. The Suns would have to be within 4.0 games of the eighth seed to earn a play-in opportunity, and the Memphis Grizzlies sat 6.0 games ahead of them when play in the Disney World bubble began.</p>
<p>More than halfway through their journey, the Suns find themselves right in the thick of things.</p>
<p>Memphis lost its first four games and starting power forward Jaren Jackson Jr. before picking up a huge win on Friday over the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Grizzlies lost to the Toronto Raptors Sunday 108-99.</p>
<p>If Memphis wins one of their last two games, Phoenix cannot beat them in the standings.</p>
<p>The Suns are the only team in the Western Conference without a loss thus far.</p>
<p>Because teams played an unequal number of games before the coronavirus suspended the season, the first tiebreakers for teams will be winning percentage.</p>
<p>From there, the regular NBA tiebreakers, which are listed on this article below the standings, will be enforced.</p>
<p>If the Suns can win the No. 9 seed, they would need to beat the No. 8 seed twice in two games to earn the final playoff spot in the Western Conference, earning them a chance to face the Los Angeles Lakers, who locked up the top seed.</p>
<p>NBA Western Conference No. 8 seed standings</p>
<p>Place Team Record Winning percentage Games Back 8 Memphis Grizzlies 33-38 .465 — 9 Portland Trail Blazers 33-39 .458 0.5 10 San Antonio Spurs 31-38 .449 1.0 11 Phoenix Suns 31-39 .443 1.5 12 New Orleans Pelicans 30-40 .429 Eliminated 13 Sacramento Kings 29-41 .414 Elminated</p>
<p>NBA tiebreaker guidelines</p>
<p>Via NBA.com:</p>
<p>a. Two Teams Tied. In the case of a tie in regular-season records involving only two teams, the following criteria will be utilized in the following order:</p>
<p>(1) Better winning percentage in games against each other.</p>
<p>(2) Division winner (this criterion is applied regardless of whether the tied teams are in the same division).</p>
<p>(3) Better winning percentage against teams in own division (only if tied teams are in same division).</p>
<p>(4) Better winning percentage against teams in own conference.</p>
<p>(5) Better winning percentage against teams eligible for playoffs in own conference (including teams that finished the regular season tied for a playoff position).</p>
<p>(6) Better winning percentage against teams eligible for playoffs in opposite conference (including teams that finished the regular season tied for a playoff position).</p>
<p>(7) Better net result of total points scored less total points allowed against all opponents (“point differential”).</p>
<p>b. More Than Two Teams Tied. In the case of a tie in regular-season records involving more than two teams, the following criteria will be utilized in the following order:</p>
<p>(1) Division winner (this criterion is applied regardless of whether the tied teams are in the same division).</p>

Phoenix Suns legend Paul Westphal has been diagnosed with brain cancer.</p>
<p>ESPN Insider Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted Westphal’s longtime friend Mike Lupica revealed the news.</p>
<p>“With his permission, I am letting the basketball world know he has just been diagnosed with brain cancer,” Lupica said in a tweet. “Specifically, glioblastoma. Please pray for my friend, No. 44.”</p>
<p>Westphal was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame last year.</p>
<p>Westphal is a five-time NBA All-Star and played the best basketball of his career in Phoenix.</p>
<p>He came to the Valley in 1975 in a trade with the Boston Celtics for Charlie Scott.</p>
<p>Westphal went on to average 20 points per game in all five of his seasons with the Suns from 1976-80.</p>
<p>In three of his five seasons in the Valley, Westphal made First Team All-NBA and was also Second Team All-NBA for the 1977-78 season.</p>
<p>Following his career as a player, Westphal went on to be an assistant coach and later the head coach for the Suns. In four seasons as the team’s head coach, he tallied a 191-88 record.</p>
<p>He also coached for the Seattle Supersonics and Sacramento Kings.</p>
<p>Westphal was inducted into the Suns’ Ring of Honor in 1998 and is also a member of the USC Hall of Fame and Pac-12 Hall of Honor.</p>
