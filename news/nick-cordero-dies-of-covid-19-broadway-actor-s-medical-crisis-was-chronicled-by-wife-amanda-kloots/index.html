<p>Broadway actor Nick Cordero has died after complications with COVID-19. The actor, who received a Tony nomination for his role in Bullets Over Broadway and appeared in productions of Waitress, A Bronx Tale and Rock of Ages was 41.</p>
<p>Cordero, who appeared as Victor Lugo in the CBS drama Blue Bloods and appeared in the Zach Braff-directed Going in Style, died Sunday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles where he’d been treated for COVID-19 for 95 days. His wife, Amanda Kloots, who has provided an alternately hopeful and heartbreaking social media chronicle of his medical journey, confirmed his death on Instagram.</p>
<p>“God has another angel in heaven now,” Kloots wrote. “My darling husband passed away this morning. He was surrounded in love by his family, singing and praying as he gently left this earth.”</p>

<p>Read her entire statement below.</p>
<p>⠀</p>
<p>She continued, “I am in disbelief and hurting everywhere. My heart is broken as I cannot imagine our lives without him. Nick was such a bright light. He was everyone’s friend, loved to listen, help and especially talk. He was an incredible actor and musician. He loved his family and loved being a father and husband. Elvis and I will miss him in everything we do, everyday.”</p>
<p>After he was diagnosed with what was thought to be pneumonia in late March, Cordero’s right leg was amputated as a result of COVID-19 complications and he underwent a tracheostomy. For weeks he was in an induced coma, and even after awakening was too weak to move, communicating “yes” or “no” only through eye movement.</p>
<p>Just last week, Kloots told CBS This Morning today that her husband would likely need a double lung transplant to fully recover, but conceded that “a lot of things would have to line up in order for Nick to be a candidate” for the transplants.</p>
<p>In telling Cordero’s story, Kloots built a large and devoted social media following, with nearly 400,000 Instagram followers across the country and world offering daily encouragement, often by singing and dancing to Cordero’s music at 3 pm each afternoon and sending videos that Kloots would post on her page.</p>
<p>“Well, luckily, I have amazing support right now,” Kloots told CBS This Morning last week. “I’m living with my family and, you know, I came home the other day really feeling, you know, just kind of exhausted and sad. And I let it out. I screamed and I cried in front of my parents. … You have to have those days. You have to break down. That’s only natural. You know, I am a strong person, but even strong people break. And that’s okay. You have to break down so that you can build yourself up again.”</p>
<p>Cordero was born in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on September 17, 1978. He attended Ryerson University in Toronto before performing in the rock band Lovemethod.</p>
<p>Before landing roles in the aforementioned Bullets Over Broadway, Waitress and the musical version of A Bronx Tale, Cordero played Tony in a production of Tony n’ Tina’s Wedding. He also stepped into the starring role in the Off Broadway rock musical The Toxic Avenger based on the superhero. His also starred as Orin Scrivello in a production of Little Shop of Horrors.</p>
<p>Cordero is survived by his wife and their one-year-old son Elvis Eduardo.</p>

Amanda Kloots is defending her work ethic amid her husband&rsquo;s battle with the coronavirus, saying on Instagram she wanted to &ldquo;address negativity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since her husband, Nick Cordero, has been diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier this year, Kloots has been keeping her followers updated on her his health journey.</p>
<p>While she didn&rsquo;t detail the negativity she received, she told her Instagram followers that she&rsquo;s a proud business owner of a fitness company and has worked hard to care for her family and pay her bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never have to apologize for that,&rdquo; she said of supporting her family. &ldquo;No woman should have to apologize for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little PSA: My husband has been in the ICU for 91 days. We don&rsquo;t know if he will make it. I pray every single day of my life that he does, but, if he does make it, I don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;ll be able to work again, if he&rsquo;ll ever be able to work again,&rdquo; Kloots said on her Instagram stories.</p>
<p>She said she loves being a female entrepreneur, creating products she believes in and helping people achieve a healthier, positive lifestyle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot in my life that is uncertain right now. I have a family, I have bills. I have no idea what Nick&rsquo;s hospital bills are going to be. I haven&rsquo;t even tried to wrap my head around that yet, but I have a mortgage, I have a car payment, I have a son that is one years old that I want to send to college one day, or at least give him whatever I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nick Cordero has a &lsquo;99% chance&rsquo;:of needing a double lung transplant, wife Amanda Kloots says</p>
<p>She continued: &ldquo;So I will work, I will continue to work, I will continue to create and I&rsquo;ll continue to try to share that with people and I hope and pray that you support me in that and not only me, any woman that is trying to work for her family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During an appearance on &ldquo;CBS This Morning&rdquo; Thursday, Kloots shared Cordero&rsquo;s latest health updates with Gayle King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ultimate goal is to get him to be a candidate for a double lung transplant,&rdquo; Kloots said, explaining to King that he may need the procedure. &ldquo;We think that that is most likely the possibility, a 99% chance that he would be needing that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She continued, &ldquo;In order to live the kind of life that I know my husband would want to live, that is a long road away and a lot of things would have to line up for Nick to be a candidate for that.&rdquo;</p>

Amanda Kloots has had many difficult days over the past three months, as her husband, Broadway star Nick Cordero, has remained hospitalized in the ICU, battling complications from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But even after standing by as he faced surgery, several close calls and a constant roller coaster of good news followed by bad, this week she experienced one of the toughest days so far — not simply because of Cordero’s condition, but also because of the complicated feelings it stirred up for her concerning her own faith.</p>
<p>“I had a hard day today. I cried all day basically,” Kloots shared in a series of posts to her Instagram stories late Monday night. “I got mad today too. I got mad at God. I’m praying and I have people all over the world praying. I said to my mom and dad, ‘why can’t He throw us a bone. I’m sorry but I’m mad at him right now.’”</p>
<p>She added that she “felt bad” right after expressing that, but she also recognized that those feelings “needed to come out.”</p>
<p>Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha</p>
<p>“Believing in God doesn’t mean you can’t question what is happening. Why things happen?” she wrote. “Why my prayers aren’t being answered in my time. I was taught that it is OK to question things in life. I think, in being brave enough to say it out loud, (it) actually acknowledges the fear that you have deep down inside you. And, of course, I have it. It’s impossible not to.”</p>
<p>Especially considering all that she’s seen her husband go through since he contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Cordero, 41, was hospitalized in March at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and the following month, his right leg was amputated after developing dangerous blood clots during treatment. He’s suffered repeated lung infections, and he has had to fight off blood infections that have caused lingering blood pressure problems for the actor.</p>
<p>And so, considering the strain of it all, on Monday, she “broke big time” — “at home, at the hospital in front of doctors and while sitting next to Nick. I couldn’t keep it together.”</p>
<p>But her fans and followers on Instagram are used to seeing the fitness guru somehow beaming with optimism despite it all — and they’ll soon see that again.</p>
<p>“So how do you overcome it and stay positive?” she mused. “I acknowledge the day I had. It’s OK. It’s OK to cry, to get mad and say it’s not fair. I will keep my faith and keep asking for miracles. I will put my armor back on and walk taller tomorrow. I will do the best I can do and make myself as big as I can.”</p>
<p>That’s a vow to herself, to Cordero and to everyone following their story.</p>
<p>“This, these 89 days now, have been tough,” she added. “I broke today. I’ll be back tomorrow.”

(CNN) Amanda Kloots spoke at length on Instagram on Wednesday evening, answering questions about her husband, actor Nick Cordero.</p>
<p>Kloots, a dancer and fitness instructor, said that although her husband is not able to speak as he remains in ICU on a ventilator, he does communicate with his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t really even move you guys, that&rsquo;s how weak he is,&rdquo; she said on her Instagram stories. &ldquo;He looks up, he looks down, he looks left and right. And he answers yes and no questions, a yes is looking up a no is looking down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordero has been hospitalized for more than two months due to complications from Covid-19.</p>
<p>Kloots was candid about her husband&rsquo;s uphill battle and said the past two days had been &ldquo;all over the place,&rdquo; due to Cordero&rsquo;s fluctuating blood pressure. She also said that he had lost 65 pounds while in the hospital and &ldquo;his muscles are definitely atrophying.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200523112239-02-nick-cordero-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Broadway actor Nick Cordero&rsquo;s wife, Amanda Kloots, says her husband has a new infection.</p>
<p>Cordero remains on a ventilator and has been hospitalized for 85 days due to complications from coronavirus. He has battled a series of virus-related complications since he was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in March. He also had to have his leg amputated after issues with blood clotting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nick is profoundly weak. Imagine how you feel getting the flu and how it can take your body a full week to recover. Now imagine how Nicks body feels, all that he has gone through and how long it will take him to recover. This will take time, a long time,&rdquo; Kloots wrote on Instagram. &ldquo;He interacts with his eyes, answering questions by looking up for yes and down for no. When he is alert he can also move his jaw. I have been doing passive physical therapy on him to help in any way I can to get him stronger, to keep his joints moving and engage his muscles. He cannot move his body yet. He has had some minor blood infections that are causing little blood pressure issues although those are under control. His vent settings are getting better and his numbers are trending in a better direction. He is relatively stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on to write, &ldquo;Is this defeating? Sometimes it is, I won&rsquo;t lie. I wish I would walk into his room and he was able to give me a big smile and hold my hand. But instead of feeling defeated, I turn to feeling determined! I give him any and all energy I can. I tell him goals that the doctors would like to see. I insist that he CAN do this! People may look at me like I&rsquo;m crazy. They may think that I don&rsquo;t fully understand his condition because I&rsquo;m smiling and singing in his room everyday. I&rsquo;m just not going to mope around and feel sad for myself or him. That is not what Nick would want me to do. That is not my personality. I fight and I will continue to fight for Nick every single day. With God on our side anything can happen!&rdquo;

L’acteur qui a été vu dans les séries “Blue Bloods” et “New York Unité Spéciale” s’est éteint le 05 juillet 2020. Nick Cordero avait contracté le Coronavirus et a été placé sous respirateur artificiel jusqu’à ce qu’il rende l’âme.</p>
<p>Sa femme est dévastée. Sur son compte Instagram, elle lui a rendu hommage en postant une photo de Nick Cordero en noir et blanc, suivi d’un message émouvant.</p>
<p>SON ÉTAT DE SANTÉ, INQUIÉTANT</p>
<p>L’acteur canadien a été testé positif au Coronavirus, une nouvelle qui a attristé les fans mais surtout son épouse, Amanda Kloots. En mois d’avril 2020, elle a fait une annonce sur le site Buzzfeed afin de prier pour son mari. En effet, il s’est avéré que l’état de Nick s’est aggravé.</p>
<p>Le père d’Elvis était très faible et a été contraint d'être mis sous respirateur artificiel. De peur de la contamination, sa famille n’a pas eu le droit de lui rendre visite.</p>
<p>“Je ne suis pas autorisée à lui rendre visite et je ne peux rien faire pour l’aider (…) Il est très faible. Il se bat comme un champion mais c’est très grave. S’il-vous-plait restez chez vous”,</p>
<p>a-t-elle annoncé.</p>
<p>L’HOMMAGE DE SA FEMME</p>
<p>La lueur d’espoir de l’épouse du défunt s’est envolée en apprenant que Nick Cordero est décédé, trois mois après son hospitalisation.</p>
<p>Le monde du cinéma a subi une perte, c’est aussi le cas de sa famille. C’était avec un grand regret qu’Amanda Kloots a annoncé la mauvaise nouvelle le 06 juillet 2020, sur Instagram.</p>
<p>“Dieu a maintenant un autre ange dans le ciel. Mon mari chéri est décédé ce matin. Il était entouré d&rsquo;amour par sa famille, chantant et priant alors qu&rsquo;il quittait doucement cette terre”,</p>
<p>a-t-elle écrit, avant de conclure par un dernier adieu disant :</p>
<p>“Je t&rsquo;aimerai pour toujours et toujours mon doux homme.”</p>
<p>Dans son message, la mère d’Elvis a non seulement rendu hommage à son défunt mari, mais elle a aussi tenu à remercier le médecin qui s’est occupé de Nick durant son séjour à l&rsquo;hôpital, ainsi que les fans pour leur soutien.</p>
<p>ELLE A ÉTÉ INVITÉE À DIRE “AU REVOIR” À SON MARI</p>
<p>Les “adieu” et les “au revoir”, Amanda Kloots ne les ont pas faits, pas avant qu’elle soit sûre que son mari est décédé. En effet, la star de Broadway a été invitée de dire “au revoir” à Nick Cordero alors que celui-ci se battait encore à l&rsquo;hôpital. Mais, sa femme avait encore de l’espoir qu’un jour, son mari irait mieux.

Her husband has been in hospital in Los Angeles for 84 days battling COVID-19.</p>
<p>And in her daily update on his condition via her Instagram, Amanda Kloots said Wednesday the Broadway actor has developed &lsquo;a little bit of a new infection&rsquo;.</p>
<p>However, the fitness instructor shared her video that doctors &lsquo;got it under control and they&rsquo;re switching some things out. They don&rsquo;t think it will be any kind of issue for the progress that we&rsquo;re hopefully making day by day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Daily update: Speaking about husband Nick Cordero&rsquo;s COVID-19 battle, Amanda Kloots said Wednesday he had developed &lsquo;a little bit of a new infection&rsquo; but doctors &lsquo;got it under control</p>
<p>Kloots went on: &lsquo;He was pretty much alert and had a good day with numbers so that&rsquo;s good. We just kind of need slow, steady, stable days.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kloots and Cordero married in September 2017 and their son Elvis was born on June 10, 2019.</p>
<p>Cordero was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with pneumonia in March and has been in intensive care ever since.</p>
<p>Doctors had to amputate his right leg due to complications from the coronavirus and the Rock of Ages and Waitress star has lots 65lbs and suffered major lung damage during his hospitalization.</p>
<p>Progress: &lsquo;He was pretty much alert and had a good day with numbers so that&rsquo;s good. We just kind of need slow, steady, stable days,&rsquo; Kloots shared on her Instagram Story</p>
<p>Complications: Broadway actor Cordero, 41, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center with pneumonia in March and has been in intensive care ever since. Doctors had to amputate his right leg due to complications from the coronavirus and he&rsquo;s suffered major lung damage</p>
<p>Devoted couple: Kloots and Cordero married in September 2017 and their son Elvis was born on June 10, 2019. They&rsquo;re pictured in August last year in New York</p>
<p>Being bedridden and hooked up to machines for so long has caused his muscles to atrophy leaving him unable to move or speak and only able to communicate using his eyes.</p>
<p>Last week, Kloots explained that even when he recovers sufficiently to be able to leave hospital it will still be a long road to recovery for her husband who could face having to spend up to a year in a rehab facility.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, Kloots thanked all those who had sent letters and cards for Nick.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I read every single one of them to him,&rsquo; she told her Instagram followers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was so kind of you to take the time out of your day to write a handwritten note to Nick to cheer him on.&rsquo;</p>
