<p>Clare County Council has called for &ldquo;responsible behaviour&rdquo; over the bank holiday weekend after videos were posted to social media showing crowds of young people in Kilkee.</p>
<p>The council issued the appeal in a statement after, it said, &ldquo;footage emerged on social media that appears to show people gathering in Kilkee in contravention of Covid-19 public health guidelines&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It said the pandemic had not gone away and it was &ldquo;vital we all continue to adhere to physical distancing and other public health guidelines&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A local councillor condemned what he called &ldquo;truly shocking&rdquo; behaviour following last night&rsquo;s gathering.</p>
<p>Fianna Fáil&rsquo;s Cillian Murphy said he had been living in the town for over 30 years and &ldquo;cannot ever remember this sort of behaviour on anything like this scale before&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said he had been up since 6.30am &ldquo;dealing with the consequences&rdquo;. This included litter, smashed glass and vandalised shelters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By 8am the worst of it was sorted but it really had to be seen to be believed,&rdquo; he said in a statement posted on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a number of videos from last night posted publicly on other social media feeds and the behaviour on display is truly shocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been on to the gardaí this morning asking for a significant allocation of extra resources, up to and including, the public order unit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cllr Murphy added: &ldquo;I can only ask that parents know where their teenage children are at all times this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you are in Kilkee, the parents of a teenager and didn&rsquo;t know where they were last night, then this post is for you. pic.twitter.com/j80IHXilFJ — Cllr. Cillian Murphy (@Tri2bResponsibl) August 2, 2020</p>
<p>Chief executive of Clare County Council, Pat Dowling, said: &ldquo;Young people must remember that anyone can contract the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Furthermore, anyone not adhering to the guidelines risks transmitting the virus to more vulnerable members of their families and communities, for whom the consequences may be dire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be no repeat occurrence of the scenes shown on social media, in Kilkee or anywhere else in Co Clare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clean-up was undertaken to remove empty cans, plastic bags and other waste from the area at Kilkee.</p>
<p>Gardaí in Kilrush confirmed to RTÉ that nine people had been arrested for public order offences in Kilkee, Co Clare over the course of yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Two male youths were released and will be dealt with by way of the Youth Diversion Programme. Two men and one woman have been dealt with by way of adult caution.</p>
<p>One man was released without charge.</p>
<p>Three men have since been charged and are due to appear before Kilrush District Court (sitting in Ennis) on 15 September next.</p>

Nine people were arrested for public order offences following scenes of rowdiness in the west Clare seaside town of Kilkee.</p>
<p>Three men were charged and are due to appear before Kilrush District Court (sitting in Ennis) on 15th September 2020.</p>
<p>Two male youths were released and will be dealt with by way of the Youth Diversion Programme.</p>
<p>Two men and one woman have been dealt with by way of adult caution and one man was released without charge. All nine were detained for a time at the local garda station.</p>
<p>Hundreds of young people gathered at the harbour in Kilkee on Saturday night, leaving behind them a trail of destruction.</p>
<p>Cllr Cillian Murphy said he had never seen such a level of antisocial behaviour in 30 years living in the town.</p>
<p>“Council workers were out from 6.30am on Sunday morning cleaning up the mess, with smashed bottles, empty cans and plastic bags everywhere along the sea front.</p>
<p>“By 8am they had the worst of it sorted but it really had to be seen to be believed,” he said.</p>
<p>About 300 teenagers gathered in the town on Saturday night. Footage posted on social media app TikTok shows them packed into the bandstand. None were observing social distancing or wearing masks.</p>
<p>Cllr Murphy said those involved were a mixture of locals and teenagers whose families were holidaying in the town.</p>
<p>Kilkee on Saturday night, like a lot of seaside resorts in Ireland, was “packed”, he explained.</p>
<p>“We are absolutely rammed to the doors. We have a lot of people who would not normally be in Ireland during the summer and are coming here. A lot of these teenagers would be going abroad.”</p>
<p>He said Saturday night’s events happened while the Department of Education was “jumping through hoops” to get children back to school in September.</p>
<p>“We have a whole bunch of school-going kids caring not one whit. There is parental responsibility not being taken here.</p>
<p>“There are young kids, they are out late and there is a lot of alcohol involved. There is a bigger question to be asked as to how people behave when they are on holidays.”</p>
<p>Clare County Council has appealed to all members of the public to act responsibly this August bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The bandstand at Kilkee was closed on Sunday night to avoid a repeat of what happened on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Council chief executive Pat Dowling said young people must remember that they too can contract the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, anyone not adhering to the guidelines risks transmitting the virus to more vulnerable members of their families and communities, for whom the consequences may be dire,” he added.</p>
<p>“There must be no repeat occurrence of the scenes shown on social media, in Kilkee or anywhere else in Co Clare.”

A mass gathering held in Kilkee into the early hours of Sunday morning has prompted Clare County Council and locals to appeal to younger members of the public to follow advice issued from the HSE in relation to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Dozens of youngsters gathered in Kilkee on Saturday night and into the early hours of Sunday morning packing into the Bandstand located at the beach.</p>
<p>Footage posted on social media first flagged the crowds with locals expressing concern over the disregard for social distancing.</p>
<p>Empty cans, plastic bags and other waste were removed as part of a Clare County Council clean-up on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>In a statement to The Clare Echo, Chief Executive of the local authority, Pat Dowling emphasised that COVID-19 has not gone away. “Young people must remember that anyone can contract the virus. Furthermore, anyone not adhering to the guidelines risks transmitting the virus to more vulnerable members of their families and communities, for whom the consequences may be dire.</p>
<p>Dowling added, “There must be no repeat occurrence of the scenes shown on social media, in Kilkee or anywhere else in County Clare”.</p>
<p>Kilkee representative, Cllr Cillian Murphy (FF) stated on Sunday afternoon, “I’m living in Kilkee for over 30 years and I cannot ever remember this sort of behaviour on anything like this scale before.</p>
<p>“I have been up since 6:30 this morning dealing with the consequences of last nights ‘event’, helping our ground crew pick up the litter, smashed glass, tidying up the vandalized shelters etc. By 8am they had the worst of it sorted but it really had to be seen to be believed. I have seen a number of videos from last night posted publicly on other social media feeds and the behaviour on display is truly shocking,” the county councillor added.</p>
<p>Cllr Murphy has requested Gardaí for extra resources including the public order unit to avoid repeat scenarios. “I can only ask that parents know where their teenage children are at all times this evening”.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the activity on Saturday night, the bandstand in Kilkee and its surrounds will be closed off from 6pm on Sunday evening. Damage was caused to the bandstand during the so-called event.

<h3 id="bank-holiday-weekend-cannot-become-a-washout-for-kilkee">&ldquo;Bank Holiday weekend cannot become a washout for Kilkee&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.clareecho.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/kilkee-beach.jpg" alt="img">
Council officials are determined that one of the busiest weekends of the year for Kilkee will not become a washout.</p>
<p>A temporary bathing notice was issued for four Clare beaches on Tuesday afternoon, Kilkee, Quilty, White Strand Doonbeg and White Strand Miltown Malbay. Increased bacterial levels as a result of run-off from the catchment area following heavy rainfall prompted the announcement of the do not swim notice.</p>
<p>With the temporary prohibition on swimming becoming an almost annual event in Kilkee, it drew criticism from Cllr Ian Lynch (IND) at Tuesday’s meeting of the West Clare Municipal District. “Every year Kilkee gets hit, it has been a tough season for tourism and now they have this again. Is it down to the pumping station? Every year it is a problem and Kilkee gets shut down. Hundreds of people here on staycation, now they can’t access the water, it is probably more people than ever here on holiday”.</p>
<p>Senior executive engineer with the West Clare Municipal District, Alan Kennelly acknowledged that there was an issue with water pumping and noted that the issuing of the ban is to protect the status as a Blue Flag beach. Better pumps may be required as a long-term solution, he said. “The issues are going back through the years when there is heavy rain that the pumps flood up. Hopefully a sample will be done prior to the weekend and that the week is not lost yet”.</p>
<p>He added, “I know it is a very busy weekend and it may not be a washout”.</p>
<p>Lynch was annoyed with the recurring nature of the problem at Kilkee. “We might escape the Bank Holiday weekend but we have to do something to make sure it doesn’t happen again. We can’t control the weather, even the Healy-Raes can’t do that. Every year it is an issue for Kilkee,” he commented.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, the do not swim notice remained in place for the four beaches.

<p>Gardai were forced to break up a massive party of 200 teenagers &ldquo;drinking and not adhering to any social distancing&rdquo; this evening in North Dublin.</p>
<p>Local residents in Santry had made multiple calls to the local Garda station as the youths recklessly partied with no consideration for the Covid-19 health guidelines.</p>
<p>The shocking discovery comes after widespread condemnation of a similar party in Kilkee in Co Clare.</p>
<p>Gardai confiscated mountains of cans and bottles from the kids before dispersing them after a stern warning about the obvious risks of such a large gathering.</p>
<p>The full Garda statement read: &ldquo;On 01/08/20, The Community Policing Team from Santry Garda Station responded to calls from local residents of a large gathering of youths in the vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gardai located the party at a local underpass with approximately 200 teenagers drinking and not adhering to any social distancing or health advice as per HSE guidelines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Below is a sample of the Alcohol abandoned by the youths. Gardai attempted to engage with these youths and advise of the potential health ramifications for them, their families and the wider community of large gatherings such as these during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Garda Siochana continue to work with all in the community to ensure a safter and healthier future for all.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/0014e9e1-1600.jpg" alt="img">
Clare County Council has advised against swimming or bathing at a number of beaches in the west of the county.</p>
<p>Bathers are being advised not to swim at the popular Lahinch beach while a temporary prohibition on swimming is in place at Spanish Point and at White Strand in Miltown Malbay.</p>
<p>A ban on swimming is in place at Kilkee and at the front beach in Quilty.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;do not swim&rdquo; advisory and ban on bathing is as a result of elevated bacterial levels in the bathing waters at these locations.</p>
<p>The news has been met with disappointment in west and north Clare.</p>
<p>Ellie Byrne from Kilkee said that the ban is a huge disappointment for both locals and visitors.</p>
<p>She said that Kilkee is facing into the busiest weekend of the year for tourism and to have the swimming ban in place is a huge disappointment.</p>
<p>Kilkee Beach</p>
<p>Ms Byrne added that it is very frustrating for locals that this is the third year in a row that a swimming ban has been put in place in Kilkee.</p>
<p>Hazel Walker from NevSail Watersports said that the ban is having a big impact on their business.</p>
<p>They provide water-based classes and wet gear to both children and adults from the seafront in Kilkee.</p>
<p>Hazel said: &ldquo;We should have all this equipment out on the water but as you can see its not happening because of the ban. We have lost roughly 50% of our business due to the ban and we have moved our classes to Carrigaholt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cathal Brodie, Environmental Scientist with Clare County Council said that the elevated bacteria levels was due to very heavy rain in the area in the last number of days which washed in water from the catchment.</p>
<p>He said that the advisory and prohibitions are in place for public health reasons and that the water quality is being continually monitored. He said that the analysis by the Council in conjunction with the HSE will dictate when the prohibitions will be lifted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &ldquo;do not swim&rdquo; notices have been lifted at a number of beaches in north Dublin.</p>
<p>Notices were lifted at Skerries South Beach, Loughshinny and Rush South Beach after the results of samples taken earlier in the week were received by Fingal County Council.</p>
<p>The beaches were returned to an &ldquo;excellent status&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, Met Éireann says the weather will remain unsettled during the bank holiday weekend with &ldquo;further showers or spells of rain until early next week&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The forecaster added: &ldquo;Current indications suggest it will become drier and warmer later in the week though.&rdquo;

A TEMPORARY swimming ban has been put in place in Kilkee and Quilty’s front beach due to increased bacteriel levels in the bathing water.</p>
<p>Clare County Council, on the advice of the HSE has put in place the prohibition, which will remain in place until further notice.</p>
<p>Also, due to increased bacterial levels in the bathing water at White Strand in Doonbeg and White Strand in Miltown, the council is also advising people to not swim at these locations until further notice.</p>
<p>The risk from increased bacterial levels is a result of run-off from the catchment area after heavy rainfall.</p>
