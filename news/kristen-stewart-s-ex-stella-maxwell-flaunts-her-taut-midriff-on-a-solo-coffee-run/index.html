<p>&lsquo;Hi pet parents, we know walking our pooches is necessary so urging everyone to do so safely and practice social distancing,&rsquo; she wrote to her five million Instagram followers.</p>
<p>She added: &lsquo;There is a great article on akc.org about walking your dog safely at this time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The bombshell, who became an official angel for the brand in 2015, and the Twilight actress ended their two-year on/off love again last summer.</p>
<p>Stewart has been dating screenwriter Dylan Meyer, who&rsquo;s written for projects such as Netflix&rsquo;s film XOXO starring Sarah Hyland, since they were first spotted kissing in August.</p>
<p>A month prior, fans speculated Kristen and Stella would rekindle after they were seen packing on the PDA on a yacht off the Amalfi Coast in July.

Kristen Stewart has been with her girlfriend, screenwriter Dylan Meyer, since late last summer. Their relationship followed what appeared to be Stewart&rsquo;s on-again status with her ex, Stella Maxwell, but Meyer and Stewart have been going strong since they first got together last year. The Charlie&rsquo;s Angels star turned 30 on Thursday, and Meyer celebrated by posting the couple&rsquo;s first Instagram photo on her grid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s my absolute favorite persons birthday and I’m wishing everyone the volume of beautiful feeling I feel toward her,&rdquo; Meyer wrote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a short ride on this earth, spend your time with someone that inspires you to be the best version of yourself and lights your shit on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meyer and Stewart have kept things pretty private since they started dating, but back in August 2019 a source told E! that the two are pretty smitten with each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kristen is spending time with Dylan and very happy about it,&rdquo; the source said. &ldquo;She was seeing Stella for a little bit while it worked, but now she has moved on with Dylan.&rdquo; The source added hints that this relationship might be for the long haul: &ldquo;Kristen isn&rsquo;t holding back at all and loves being with her,&rdquo; the source shares. &ldquo;They are moving quickly and always together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stewart has been fairly open in the past about her feelings for the people she&rsquo;s dated in the. In an interview with Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar UK in 2017, Stewart got a little personal about her relationships and addressed her sexuality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been deeply in love with everyone I&rsquo;ve dated,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you think I was faking it? I&rsquo;ve always really embraced a duality. And really, truly, believed in it and never felt confused or struggling. I just didn&rsquo;t like getting made fun of.&rdquo;</p>

Ricky Gervais has confirmed he won’t be bringing back The Office.</p>
<p>Gervais, who played office manager David Brent in the series, said we wouldn’t be seeing the characters again as the magic just wouldn’t be the same a second time around.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ll ever bring back the old favourites. People think they want more, but they don’t,” Gervais told The Sun.</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>Related: Netflix responds to reports that it will be losing The Office</p>
<p>“They just want the feeling they had when they saw it for the first time. David Brent at 60 is too sad.”</p>
<p>The Office ran for two series and two Christmas specials, from 2001-2003, and spawned a feature film, David Brent: Life on the Road, which followed Brent as he travelled around the country living his dream of being a rock star.</p>
<p>Ray BurmistonNetflix</p>
<p>However, Gervais said he would be interested in making a third season of After Life.</p>
<p>“For the first time ever, I’ve wanted to do a third season of something,” he said. “[After Life] is my favourite ensemble I’ve ever done.</p>
<p>“It’s the richest world I’ve created, it’s not just a comedy about being in an office or an extra. So I’ve started thinking about it, but we have to see how season two goes down.</p>
<p>“If people say: ‘This is the worst show’ then I won’t do one. It has to be a wanted encore from Netflix and the public for me to do it.”</p>
<p>After Life‘s first series is currently available to stream on Netflix UK. The show’s second series will premiere on April 24.</p>
