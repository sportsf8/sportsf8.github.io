<p>Webster says that the term bragging rights is “a good reason to talk with pride about something you have done.”</p>
<p>As a young boy onward it seemed that life on the farm was based always on competing for that defined right. It didn’t matter if it was who was the strongest to who could skip a flat stone across a space of water and causing the most skips. If you did the most you then had the right to brag if so desired. I feel safe in saying this went on from daylight until dusk.</p>
<p>I feel it was due to a farmer’s life mostly. Most all a farmer does is manual labor of some sort and of a skill most always was needed to move the job along quicker. From weeding tobacco beds to tossing bales of hay. The jobs were greatly needed but let’s face it the jobs took up a lot of hours. Hours that became boring and mundane in nature. That was unless the task was turned into a competition in some way or form. For example look at setting tobacco. You set on the transplanter with a bunch of plants to go into the ground. All the person really had to do was take a plant put it in the finger that put it into the ground then grab another plant. Over and over until the day ended or the patch was completely set. Think about it. Boring! But if a person counted how many plants went through their hands in a minute, well the one who put the most plants in the ground was the fastest. Wouldn’t the two on the setter come out even? Not if you get in too big of a hurry and missed your turn. This could and did go on all day and the best got to boast.</p>
<p>This could be for a group such as a hay crew to see how many bales of hay they could move from the field into the hay mow. When talking to other guys from other crews the numbers were matched and a winner would be declared in most cases. Sometimes convincing the other person you were faster didn’t happen and it stayed a tie. From the start of the day on we would match each other as to how much, how long, or how fast.</p>
<p>This would also spill over to a farmer and his crops or produce from their gardens. How many bushel to the acre of corn, or pounds of tobacco per acre. I have seen huge tomatoes on the front porch at a farmer’s house or a very large potato so any visitor could see the monster you had grown in your garden. It also allowed anyone who thought they could out do it to bring it on. For at least until the next growing season the top producer had earned the right to tell of his ability to outgrow all others. Not all would brag but I have seen quite a few that if someone brought up how well you had done they would just smile real big and nod their heads to confirm it.</p>
<p>But of all the contests for the bragging rights around here it was who could cut tobacco the fastest. Cutting tobacco was a talent that not all could excel at. It seemed in each neighborhood there would be one or two that could and would put the stalks of tobacco on the sticks so quickly and accurately and show little or no effort that they earned a lot of praise from all the rest.</p>
<p>I feel I have cut with some of these men in the same patch. I didn’t say I was cutting beside them. I want to name some I have witnessed but am afraid I would miss someone.</p>
<p>The story I will relay is of a man before my time and can only tell what I was told. In I think the 40’s there was a young man named Mel Ott from around Felicity that they said was the fastest. One day a retired man said I don’t believe you to be the fastest and I am betting you 50 dollars that you can’t drop your own sticks and cut 1,000 sticks of tobacco in an eight hour day. Mel said I will take your bet but I’m being paid by the stick, so no matter what the outcome I still want to be paid what I earn by the stick. The man said it’s a bet. So the next day many folks other than the other cutters and the man who bet showed up and watched Mel. He didn’t cut 1,000 sticks but instead he cut over 1,250 sticks approximately as I’ve been told. Now a thousand sticks in a day is the measuring stick for a very good cutter and what Mel did was a land mark for a new standard. I believe this to be true as the bet was carried out on my dad’s farm and he is the one who told me this. Dad wasn’t a man to bet but he loved a great contest. He said besides, he got more tobacco cut that day than he had all fall. From that time forward Mel Ott held the bragging rights if he wanted to brag but I never heard him boast. However if ask he would smile and nod his head yes.</p>
<p>For a million bragging rights and to make a day move faster and with some added interest it served their purpose then and I assume they still do. I have tried many times to win at a challenge of the best and can say sometimes I did. Also it is safe to say many times I didn’t but almost every time I enjoyed the chance to take on the challenge. When it came to lifting I could win most times. I could even lift the front end of a Volkswagen and carry it in a half circle and never lost that challenge. But remember that strength doesn’t take the need for talent or skills. Just big muscles to lift. But it helped the day pass a little easier and made it more interesting.</p>

<h3 id="lost-sense-of-smell-may-be-peculiar-clue-to-coronavirus-infection">&ldquo;Lost Sense of Smell May Be Peculiar Clue to Coronavirus Infection&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/science/22virus-smell1/22virus-smell1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
A mother who was infected with the coronavirus couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odor of kitty litter.</p>
<p>Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection.</p>
<p>On Friday, British ear, nose and throat doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread. The published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings.</p>
<p>“We really want to raise awareness that this is a sign of infection and that anyone who develops loss of sense of smell should self-isolate,” Prof. Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, wrote in an email. “It could contribute to slowing transmission and save lives.”

<h3 id="can-a-crossword-be-racist">&ldquo;Can a crossword be racist?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thespinoff.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-74854287.jpg" alt="img">
When Hannah Yang complained about a racist clue in the daily paper, she was reminded of the prevalence of casual racism in New Zealand.</p>
<p>I’d never seen a racist clue before.</p>
<p>It appeared one morning when I sat down in our break room to look at the day’s cryptic crossword (yes, this is a thing we do at our workplace, don’t judge us). There it was, right up the top. Seven across: a racist clue.</p>
<p>For context, cryptic clues (as the name might suggest) aren’t to be read literally. They’re cryptic in the sense that they contain hidden instructions (such as “solve this anagram”) which lead you to the correct answer. Nevertheless, “Chink, i.e. Chinese leader concerned with evildoing” is a plainly racist clue, regardless of what other meanings it is also capable of supporting.</p>
<p>So, finding the offending clue, well, offensive, I sent a message to the Dominion Post and suggested that an apology in the next issue might be appropriate. The response was sadly predictable. While the paper didn’t “think racism – in any form – is acceptable”, it also thought this clue was just “ a very unfortunate combination of words rather than an outbreak of racism”. “Chink” was a synonym for the clue’s answer, “crevice”, was the explanation given by the puzzle company, which provides crossword puzzles to all the Stuff papers. It wasn’t meant to be racist. The Dominion Post wouldn’t be publishing an apology.</p>
<p>But racism doesn’t disappear for lack of intent. A clue like “chink” is racist even if the newspaper didn’t intend to be racist because the word “chink” within close proximity of the word “Chinese” carries a distinct, offensive meaning regardless of cryptic context. So, it’s not an unfortunate combination of words rather than racism; it’s an unfortunate combination of words and racism.</p>
<p>The belief that accidental racism can’t happen is part of why casual racism is so insidious: people don’t think it’s a problem, so it persists precisely because of this. In the meantime, statements like “we don’t think racism is acceptable” are stripped of their meaning. Asserting zero tolerance for racism doesn’t count for much if your very definition of “racism – in any form” excludes self-evident forms of racism.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility for a racist clue appearing in your paper doesn’t mean you admit the paper is racist. It’s a matter of being grown-up, acknowledging harm was caused, and rectifying that harm by making it clear where your organisation stands on the issue. And reasonable people will give you credit for that.</p>
<p>But the Dominion Post was not moved. It told me that while the Post has a “proud record of correcting and/or apologising”, there wouldn’t be one on this occasion. My complaint was the only one they’d received, it said, and it would be “counter-productive” to apologise as it would “only get more people looking for it”.</p>
<p>As the Human Rights Commission’s Give Nothing to Racism campaign underlines, however, most people who experience racism don’t complain. The fact that this clue might otherwise have been left undiscussed doesn’t diminish the problem – it’s part of the problem.</p>
<p>As for being counter-productive, a friend of mine made the excellent point that drawing attention to the issue is the point of an apology. “Casual racism needs to be corrected publicly so people learn. [Otherwise] casual racism slips past and, like you said, is more insidious,” they said.</p>
<p>So when it comes to racism, we have a collective duty as a society.</p>
<p>If we’ve had experiences, we should share them, and share them civilly. Well-meaning people won’t realise why it’s problematic to tell a person of Asian appearance “Your English is very good!” unless we talk about it. Honest and kind-hearted people won’t know that they unintentionally but routinely ignore the one non-white person in the group, unless we talk about it. Ordinary and empathetic people, through no fault of their own, simply won’t begin to understand how paralysing it can be when you can’t tell anymore whether that person who didn’t look at you in the meeting was racist or if you’re just over-thinking it – unless we talk about it.</p>
<p>And all this we have to talk about civilly, because no one will listen to what we say if they sense even a whiff of anger.</p>
<p>Conversely, if we ever find ourselves listening, then we should bravely and humbly acknowledge that experience and seek to learn from it. I say “bravely” because I realise that doing so is difficult. No one wants to be told that something they did was racist. Certainly nobody wants to be told that they are racist. And so, in our selfish desire to be right and to convince ourselves that we were right all along, we confuse the calling out of racism with a personal attack on our character.</p>
<p>Finally, if we ever find ourselves bystanders, then we should always call out racism for what it is, because every unintentionally prejudiced statement that goes uncorrected, every misguided and ignorant comment swept under the rug, is another contributor to the collective, subconscious mindset that tells us “Chink, i.e. Chinese leader concerned with evildoing” is not racist.</p>
<p>And I still have no idea what the hell “concerned with evildoing” has to do with “crevice”.</p>
<p>Update (17/10/19): I am happy to say that since the publication of this article, the Dominion Post has apologised to me, assured me that an apology will be printed in the next day’s paper, and promised to learn from this. This is a very heartening response, and I hope it demonstrates the power of frank and open dialogue around difficult issues such as racism.

<h3 id="opinion--does-anyone-have-a-clue-about-how-to-fight-back-against-trumps-racism">&ldquo;Opinion | Does Anyone Have a Clue About How to Fight Back Against Trump’s Racism?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/26/opinion/26edsallWeb/26edsallWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Take “The Trump Effect: An Experimental Investigation of the Emboldening Effect of Racially Inflammatory Elite Communication” published earlier this month by four political scientists.</p>
<p>The authors, Benjamin Newman, Jennifer Merolla, Sono Shah, Loren Collingwood and Karthick Ramakrishnan, all at the University of California-Riverside, and Danielle Casarez Lemi of SMU, wrote:</p>
<p>We find that exposure to racially inflammatory statements by Trump caused those with high levels of prejudice to be more likely to perceive engagement in prejudiced behavior as socially acceptable.</p>
<p>In other words, if the president of the United States denigrates Muslims, or Hispanics, or African-Americans, then anyone can.</p>
<p>Significantly, Newman, Merolla and their colleagues determined that</p>
<p>“the magnitude of this effect is enhanced when exposure to inflammatory speech by Trump is coupled with information that other political elites tacitly condone his speech,” as leading Republicans have done through their continuing acquiescence.</p>
<p>While Trump’s rhetoric improved his prospects in 2016, Merolla wrote by email, in 2020 the result may be mixed:</p>
<p>When individuals experience feelings of anger in relation to the political environment, they are more likely to participate in politics so I suspect that it did help drive increased turnout. However, his rhetoric has also led to increased anger on the other side of the aisle, so it has also likely driven higher turnout on the left, especially during the 2018 midterm election.</p>
<p>A forthcoming paper by Desmond King and Rogers M. Smith, political scientists at Oxford and the University of Pennsylvania, “White Protectionism in America,” makes a strong case that Trump, unlike his Republican predecessors in the White House, has gone far beyond rhetoric and token gestures to substantively address the concerns of his anti-immigrant and socially conservative supporters.</p>
<p>King and Smith catalog in great detail Trump’s success putting in place policies</p>
<p>favored by racially conservative Americans but with a new focus on active white protection, rather than simply colorblind efforts to constrain positive governmental actions. Trump has fanned the anger of many white supporters convinced that post-1970 federal policies have unjustly favored people of color.</p>
<p>Trump has fueled this anger and solidified his support among “his anti-immigrant and socially conservative supporters,” combating this “alleged white victimization,” King and Smith argue, by requiring:</p>
<p>protectionist measures including tolerating racial profiling in policing and reversing some extant civil rights policies; subverting others through deregulation or neglect; and favoring measures which go beyond colorblindness, such as stop-and-frisk practices and demands for identification triggered by racial and ethnic identities, as well as anti-Muslim immigration restrictions.</p>
<p>In an email, Smith wrote that he and King “can’t estimate how effective the white protectionist message will be for Trump,” but</p>
<p>You don’t need to specialize in quantitative analyses of elections to know that the cult of personality Trump has inspired means that he is a far more effective voice for this view than anyone else in American politics. Having him at the top of the ticket this time around has to help in advancing white protectionist messages and policies successfully.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at some of the Democratic and liberal thinking focused on undermining Trump’s divide-and-conquer strategy.

<p><img src="https://s2982.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-of-crossword-puzzle.jpg" alt="img">
We know there’s a puzzle craze right now, and for good reason. People are turning to activities to do at home that pass time, occupy minds, and soothe harried souls. Crossword puzzles can do all that and more. What makes crossword puzzles so amazing is their structure: a meeting of minds across time and space. The constructor has set a challenge for you, hoping you will best them. And you can. Like any skill, crosswords have a learning curve. With a little practice, the filling in of the final square is as satisfying as snapping the last piece into a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>Crossword puzzle books are a perfect way to get into cruciverbalism. We all need activities that get us away from screens and devices. Working through all the puzzles in a book is the analog version of completing all the levels in a video game. So let’s wear down some pencils.</p>
<p>Getting to Know Your Puzzles</p>
<p>Crosswords come in generic and artisanal varieties. The books you can often find among the magazines at grocery stores likely have puzzles that were generated almost entirely without human hands and minds. Computers can scour dictionaries for words to fill a given grid, then populate the puzzle with standard clues for each word. They are technically puzzles, but a thin gruel at best.</p>
<p>The artisanal varieties are written by real humans! The grid may be filled by hand or with the aid of computers, and the clues are as original as can be. There are, of course, only so many ways to clue some of the words, like OLEO and EPEE, that show up in crosswords a lot due to the patterns of the English language. But crossword constructors put real humanity into what they write, imbuing the puzzles with their own sense of wordplay, humor, and pop culture sensibilities. Many constructors incorporate themes into their puzzles. Themes arise from the long answers scattered throughout the puzzle that have a uniting element, ranging from puns, spoonerisms, homophones, and more.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this means that crossword solvers will develop tastes, the same way readers do with authors. Any puzzle worth its salt includes the puzzle constructor’s name, and taking note of names allows solvers to develop favorites. If you know any name associated with crossword puzzles, it’s likely to be Will Shortz, the editor (though not the constructor) of The New York Times crossword puzzle. There are heaps of crossword puzzle books from the Gray Lady that range from reliable to classic. You don’t need me to recommend them any more than you need me to tell you to check out that Shakespeare guy if you’re in the mood for a play.</p>

<p>The Puzzling Caveat</p>
<p>The other reason I’m skirting around The New York Times in my recommendations is because I think it’s worth shining the spotlight elsewhere. The world of crosswords and the Times puzzle in particular, like other realms historically dominated by straight white men, has come under increasing scrutiny for allowing bigotry to continue largely unchecked.</p>
<p>This does also explain the relative dearth of racial, gender, and sexual diversity in the following list of crossword books. Change is afoot, but it’s slow. I want to also recognize the exciting things in the more indie crossword world, and encourage budding solvers to also check out the Inkubator, Queer Qrosswords, and Women of Letters. I also love the puzzles from The New Yorker and USA Today, both of which have diverse, exciting rosters of constructors who write fresh, fun puzzles.</p>
<p>All that said, there are still countless great crossword books out there, perfect for a low-tech afternoon with a comfy seat and a sharp pencil.</p>
<p>Getting Started</p>
<p>Start small! Matt Gaffney is a prolific and excellent constructor, who has brought puzzles to a small size if you’re strapped for time or just learning how crosswords work.</p>
<p>Puzzles are often given a day of the week to denote difficulty. Mondays are the easiest, Saturdays are the hardest, and Sundays are bigger than the rest. This book by Stanley Newman is set to Tuesday difficulty.</p>
<p>If Tuesdays are tough, you can always try a book of Monday-level crosswords edited by Peter Gordon.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a book of puzzles you could actually fit in your pocket, try this book by Patrick Berry. If you like these, you’ll want to seek out more of his puzzles; he’s one of the greats!</p>
<p>Getting Thematic</p>
<p>A great feature of crossword puzzle books is their ability to buck editorial standards requiring clean language in a newspaper or magazine. Francis Heaney took full advantage of that for his book of bawdy and irreverent puzzles.</p>
<p>Brendan Emmet Quigley is one of my very favorite constructors in the game. I wouldn’t suggest actually being drunk to solve these puzzles. You will need your wits about you.</p>
<p>Erik Agard, the editor of the aforementioned USA Today crossword, is another absolute favorite constructor of mine. So far he has published one book of his original creations, all themed on food.</p>
<p>Classic Classics</p>
<p>Merl Reagle was a singular talent among crossword constructors and his funny Sunday-sized puzzles (meaning 21 squares by 21 squares as opposed to the daily size of 15 x 15) are prized by people looking to solve a larger grid and get to know a constructor whose sense of humor is clever, unexpected, and delightful.</p>
<p>Maura Jacobson is another of the all-time greats. If you’ve seen the crossword documentary Wordplay (and if you haven’t, get on it!), you’ve seen footage from the annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. Maura’s puzzles were always gems at that competition, as were the puzzles she wrote for New York Magazine.</p>
<p>Appreciating History</p>
<p>Ben Tausig runs the stellar crossword subscription service American Values Club Crossword and has also compiled a book to teach the history of the puzzle while solving puzzles.</p>
<p>This line of crossword puzzle compendiums is a great way to get to know a variety of constructors. Simon &amp; Schuster’s first ever published book was also the first ever published book of crossword puzzles, so these collections are keeping up with history.</p>
<p>New York magazine has reliably great puzzles, but this book also captures an amazing piece of history: a cryptic crossword from the magazine’s first issue, written by Broadway living legend Stephen Sondheim. Cryptic crosswords are a style more popular in the UK than the U.S., and have their own idiosyncratic rules for cluing.</p>
<p>Bonus Content</p>
<p>There have been a number of nonfiction books published about the history of crosswords and crossword culture. This particular sub-genre got an update this year, with this new book about puzzle people by Adrienne Raphel.</p>
<p>I truly believe in using internet searches or a crossword dictionary to solve. It’s not cheating; it’s learning. You’ll be amazed at how your reliance on outside help will diminish over time. Nonetheless, it’s dangerous to go alone. Take this!

<h3 id="the-brainiest-hitter">&ldquo;The Brainiest Hitter&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/7MTTXvYG4-Zz_tS40Xa7YLmesCo=/0x43:2000x1085/960x500/media/img/2020/03/DIS_Pappu_SketchVottoHomePage/original.jpg" alt="img">
It must bother him, too, that he now doesn’t know when he’ll get a chance to improve on last year’s performance, though when we caught up in mid-March, he told me this wasn’t the main thing on his mind. “I’m not thinking about baseball right now, if I’m honest,” he told me a few days after MLB suspended its season indefinitely because of the coronavirus pandemic. He’d gone home to his native Toronto. “I’m just trying to take it moment by moment and look after the people closest to me.”</p>
<p>What does it mean to be considered the most intelligent hitter in baseball during an era when sabermetrics—popularized by Moneyball, the book and the Brad Pitt movie—dominates? With team analytics departments constantly feeding players data, today’s hitter, even one who’s not aided by stolen signs and banging trash cans, knows more about what to expect from a pitcher than ever before. “Joey reads the research himself, which is why it feels like he anticipates your questions,” offers the baseball-analytics writer Eno Sarris, who’s had a number of intricate conversations with Votto about the game they both love—and love to study. “He’s not willing to talk out of his butt.”</p>
<p>Since high school in Toronto, where he grew up the son of a sommelier mother and chef father, Votto has been a student of Ted Williams. He still takes Williams’s treatise, The Science of Hitting, on the road with him, and in an American Masters documentary about the man, Votto was the lone active player featured, shown holding the book lovingly and extolling its greatness.</p>
<p>When Votto tries to capture his own genius, though he’d never use that word, he speaks of having a “plan.” “Coming up with a simple answer to a complicated event—that’s my goal at every at-bat,” he said. “To have simple ideas and repeat them over and over. I’ve got my swing built, I’ve got the plan laid out, and now let’s be natural.”</p>
<p>That description may sound as boilerplate as the advice in a CEO’s memoir, or like the makings of a Buddhist koan (my favorite Joey-ism in the latter category: “The swing should be built around you, not you built around the swing”). But in practice, it means figuring out what kind of pitch—fastball, curveball, slider—is coming next, based on what pitches came before, and who’s throwing. It means avoiding balls out of the strike zone and also avoiding balls in the strike zone that he really can’t connect with. It means a million other small things. Teams these days will move three players to the right side of the infield to handicap left-handed hitters like Votto. In 2017, the Chicago Cubs not only shifted the infield but used a four-man outfield to try to stop him. Votto recalculated, not by going to the left, but with a hard shot so tightly tracing the right-field line that it eluded the extra manpower stacked on that side of the field. “Joey Votto right now is ungodly,” Joe Maddon, then the Cubs’ manager, marveled after the game.

<h3 id="a-hard-fall-unmasked-an-unusual-condition-that-had-caused-her-pain-for-years">&ldquo;A hard fall unmasked an unusual condition that had caused her pain for years&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3XAU6BSUA4I6VEU2MTX2OSBKO4.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
“I thought, ‘This is weird,’ ” said Holland, 71, a retired administrative assistant who lives in suburban Maryland.</p>
<p>For years, Holland’s doctors had disagreed about what was wrong with her hip. She had undergone a slew of scans, plus painful biopsies of her hip bones. Her doctors had prescribed cortisone injections and months of physical therapy to treat what most concluded was osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But when she sought an explanation for the reason that her March 2017 fall had relieved pain so severe it disrupted her sleep, an X-ray suggested an alarming possibility: a cancer recurrence.</p>
<p>The cause proved to be far less ominous. Holland would learn that the problem had been clearly visible years earlier on an MRI, but its identity and significance were missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a happy camper,&rdquo; Holland said of the surgery that corrected her problem. &ldquo;I had thought I was going to be crippled for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shadow of recurrence</p>
<p>In 2009, Holland, then 61, was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. She underwent a lumpectomy followed by radiation, which appeared successful in eradicating the cancer.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The pain in her upper left leg and hip joint started two years later. Both her oncologist and internist worried it might mean that her cancer had returned and spread to her bones. They ordered a variety of tests, including CT and bone scans, followed by biopsies of her hip bones.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>After the tests found nothing significant, Holland began months of physical therapy for a condition her internist decided was trochanteric bursitis, inflammation of the fluid-filled sac near the hip joint. The condition, a common cause of hip pain, often improves with rest, physical therapy and sometimes anti-inflammatory drugs. Holland tried all three; none seemed to help.</p>
<p>Her internist then administered two cortisone shots. Each worked for about two months. Holland, a former gymnast and gymnastics coach who teaches water exercise classes, felt increasingly hobbled by worsening pain that radiated down her leg.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In November 2013, she underwent an MRI scan of her hip. The report noted the presence of “calcified/ossified bodies” in her left hip, which had been detected on an earlier CT scan. The radiologist also noted fluid surrounding her left hip joint, which was “suspicious for an underlying synovitis,” inflammation of the tissue that lines joints and can result from certain diseases including rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The radiologist concluded that the most likely cause of Holland’s hip pain was not bursitis but rather degenerative osteoarthritis, a common problem in which the protective cartilage around bones wears down over time.</p>
<p>A month before the MRI, Holland had undergone a long-planned partial replacement of her right knee to repair an injury she had suffered years earlier. She had hoped the knee operation might lessen her hip pain.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“My knee felt great,” she recalled. “But the hip did not change. That was a real disappointment.”</p>
<p>By 2015, she had developed pain in a second location: her lower back. Holland consulted an orthopedic spine specialist who told her he thought her hip pain was caused by sciatica, an irritation of the sciatic nerve that runs from the hip down the back of the leg. Her lower back pain, he concluded, was the result of mild spondylolisthesis, which can result from the overextension that occurs in gymnastics. He recommended that Holland receive potentially risky corticosteroid injections in her spine to control her hip pain.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Holland never received those epidural nerve block injections; her insurance company wanted her to try physical therapy first. For the next year, she went to PT faithfully. She also received professional massages, which she deemed “a tremendous help” by improving her mobility and decreasing pain.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But Holland said she worried that this was all that could be done. She was taking anti-inflammatory drugs on a daily basis and still had trouble sleeping because of the pain. Her gait was off and she sometimes walked hunched over.</p>
<p>“It seemed like my orthopedists were guessing: ‘Is it her hip? Her back? Her knee?’ ” she recalled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is&rsquo;</p>
<p>A week after she fell, Holland returned to the first orthopedist, who had performed her knee operation, and told him about her inexplicable improvement.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>She hoped the episode might provide clues about what to do next.</p>
<p>The doctor ordered X-rays and told her she appeared to have a large “loose body near her sciatic nerve.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>He referred her to a third orthopedist for possible removal of the unidentified object, which was the size of a robin’s egg.</p>
<p>The specialist told her he wouldn’t operate. “He said, ‘I don’t know what it is,’ ” Holland remembered. If it was a malignant tumor, he said, surgery could cause it to spread.</p>
<p>Instead, he sent her to a fourth specialist, orthopedic oncologist Felasfa Wodajo of Virginia Cancer Specialists. (Orthopedic oncologists treat both benign and malignant diseases of the musculoskeletal system.)</p>
<p>“She’s very memorable,” Wodajo said. He described Holland as “a great historian” of her case who came armed with scans and medical records.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>To Wodajo, Holland’s symptoms and test results did not suggest osteoarthritis. Her joints showed no sign of the degeneration commonly seen in arthritis and she seemed much too active.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Most telling was Holland’s recent X-ray, which showed several dozen small white flecks that resembled pieces of popcorn scattered around her hip joint, along with the large nodule in her left buttock. Wodajo said he immediately knew what was wrong.</p>
<p>“If you’ve never seen it before, I’m not sure it would jump out at you,” he said. But as an orthopedic oncologist, he sees the uncommon condition three or four times a year. Wodajo told Holland her hip pain was caused by primary synovial chondromatosis.</p>
<p>Holland said she remembers asking two questions: Is it cancerous and can you fix it? His answer to the first question was no and the second was yes. Holland said she promptly burst into tears.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Synovial chondromatosis is a disorder of unknown cause that can result in severe disability. Most commonly seen in men in their 50s, it is not inherited. It occurs when the synovium grows abnormally, generating small nodules composed of cartilage, some no larger than a grain of rice. These pellet-like bodies can become loose inside joints, where they can roll around, damaging the cartilage that covers the joint. In Holland’s case, her fall had dislodged a large calcified body that was pressing on her sciatic nerve.</p>
<p>Those “calcified/ossified bodies” the radiologist flagged in Holland’s 2013 MRI were hallmarks of the condition.</p>
<p>“On that MRI it’s glaringly obvious,” Wodajo said. Because the radiologist did not specialize in orthopedic cases, he noted, it appears their significance was missed.</p>
<p>Holland’s history of cancer may have complicated her diagnosis, Wodajo said, because doctors were focused on determining whether her cancer had returned.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“That’s very common,” he said, referring to “people with a history of cancer who turn out to have something unrelated.”</p>
<p>Treatment of synovial chondromatosis, which often recurs, involves surgery that is typically performed arthroscopically through a small incision. But in Holland’s case, that was not possible: Her disease was too extensive.</p>
<p>“I told her we’d have to dislocate her hip, which is not a trivial thing,” Wodajo recalled.</p>
<p>Holland underwent surgery in July 2017 at Inova Fairfax Hospital. She spent one night in the hospital, less time than initially expected, and then recuperated at home. A week later, she was largely pain-free.</p>
<p>So far, the disorder has not recurred.</p>
<p>Holland regards Wodajo as her “hero” and says she wishes she hadn’t wasted years marked by anxiety and pain chasing a diagnosis that could have been made much earlier.</p>
<p>She hopes her experience will dissuade doctors from resorting to the catchall arthritis diagnosis “if they don’t know what’s wrong.”</p>
<p>“What if I hadn’t fallen, what would have happened?” she asked. “I think about that all the time.”
