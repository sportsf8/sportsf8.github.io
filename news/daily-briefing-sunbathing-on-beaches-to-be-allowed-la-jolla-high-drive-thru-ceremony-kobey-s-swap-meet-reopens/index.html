<p>DAILY BRIEFING – Sunbathing on beaches to be allowed, La Jolla High drive-thru ceremony, Kobey’s Swap Meet reopens</p>
<p>Beachgoers crowd Pacific Beach last summer. / Photo by Thomas Melville slideshow</p>
<p>A round-up of news, community, and business briefs from sdnews.com highlighting what’s happening in our community.</p>
<p>Saturday, May 30</p>
<p>BEACHES OPEN FOR SITTING JUNE 2</p>
<p>Starting June 2, people will be allowed to sit and lounge at local beaches provided they maintain physical distancing or wear a face covering when close to others, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced.</p>
<p>Sitting on the beach will be allowed for sunbathing and relaxing with towels and chairs if you do it with people in your own household. However, no activities such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Also, all piers and parking lots will remain closed.</p>
<p>All beach communities agreed to ease this restriction starting June 2, but cities can decide if they want to proceed later and how the guideline is going to be enforced.</p>
<p>BLENDERS EYEWEAR PROVIDES SUNGLASSES</p>
<p>Pacific Beach-based Blenders Eyewear will outfit more than 300 FedEx Express workers across the county, offering workers one of five select sunglasses. The Blenders Eyewear team donates sunglasses to the region’s 300-plus FedEx Express workers to thank them for their continued support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>After re-purposing its production to create and then donate 10,000 safety goggles to Southern California hospitals, plus 20,000 pairs to Direct Relief – in addition to a month-long fundraiser for the international aid organization – Blenders wanted to do more to help those at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, visit BlendersEyewear.com.</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT UPDATE</p>
<p>The San Diego Workforce Partnership releases a weekly email update to serve as a one-stop-shop on employment figures and analysis specific to our region’s workforce in regards to impacts associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>488 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10 (up from 482 last week).</p>
<p>73,617 total reported employees affected since March 10 (up from 72,446 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,692 in the hospitality and restaurant and bar industries. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership, although the full impact to employees and the region’s economy is still unknown.</p>
<p>260 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: New unemployment claims in California have held steady at a little over 200,000 for the last three weeks. For context, that’s about twice the pre-COVID-19 record. San Diego County’s official unemployment rate was the highest ever recorded last month at 15%, and we believe the current rate is higher, as about 40% of unemployment claims made since the onset of COVID-19 were submitted after April 12, when unemployment was last measured.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORS PROPOSE EVICTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION</p>
<p>Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Greg Cox, co-chairs of the County’s COVID-19 Subcommittee, are proposing the County of San Diego extend its moratorium on evictions for both residents and small businesses for one additional month. The Board of Supervisors will vote on the policy extension Tuesday, June 2.</p>
<p>“We are proposing extending San Diego County’s eviction moratorium for residents and small businesses through June 30th,” said Cox and Fletcher in a statement. “Our region is slowly recovering from the severe economic damage caused by the pandemic. Although more businesses are reopening, it is going to take time for merchants and their employees who have been out of work to rebuild their bank accounts enough to pay their rent. This will give residential and commercial renters more time to get back on their feet. But we are encouraging renters to pay as much rent as they can and set-up a payment program with their landlords.”</p>
<p>The original moratorium policy and resolution is set to expire Sunday, May 31. This moratorium extension only affects the unincorporated areas. If the extension is passed by supervisors, the resolution will continue to ensure protections provided retroactively to March 4, when Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency.</p>
<p>UC SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE VIRTUAL COMMENCEMENT</p>
<p>The university will host a virtual commencement for its School of Medicine Sunday, May 31 at 10 a.m. which can be viewed at medschool.ucsd.edu/Commencement2020. Keynote commencement speaker will be Mona Hanna-Attisha, MD, the pediatrician, scientist and activist who discovered high levels of lead in the blood of children living in Flint, Mich. and led efforts to publicize and address the source, a contaminated local water supply.</p>
<p>Approximately 132 graduates will receive their medical degrees. Of those, 11 will also receive Masters of Advanced Studies and six will also receive PhDs. The majority of these newly minted doctors will move on to residency programs in 26 different states and almost every specialty, such as emergency medicine, psychiatry.</p>
<p>ROCK THRIFT STORE REOPENED</p>
<p>The Rock Thrift Store at 3603 Camino Del Rio has reopened its doors after weeks of being closed due to COVID-19 by State and County regulations for non-essential businesses. Rock Thrift will be open to the public daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Patrons can shop or drop donations off. Everyone will be asked to abide by County regulations in order to keep the store, staff and customers safe. This includes wearing a mask, keeping six feet apart and following signage posted.</p>
<p>“I’m most excited to reopen Rock Thrift so we can go back to engaging and serving more of the community and spreading the love and hope of Christ,” said Brenda Swain, store manager.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional retail aspect of the store, the Rock Thrift Store also provides vouchers to individuals and families in need, through first responders, that may have been evacuated due to a fire, domestic violence and other crises. In a time where COVID-19 has created a multitude of needs for individuals and families across San Diego, the Rock Thrift store is eager to have it’s doors open to exchange those vouchers for much-needed clothing and household items. For store hours, donation guidelines and more information, visit rockthriftstore.com</p>
<p>URGENT NEED FOR BLOOD DONATIONS</p>
<p>The American Red Cross has an urgent need for blood donations to prevent another blood shortage as hospitals resume surgical procedures and patient treatments that were temporarily paused earlier this spring in response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Healthy individuals who are feeling well are asked to make an appointment to donate in the weeks and months ahead by downloading the free Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any Alexa Echo device.</p>

<p>U.S. REP. PETERS URGES RESTRAINT IN REOPENING</p>
<p>Congressman Scott Peters (CA-52), who recently heard from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and a key member of the Trump Administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, issued the following statement after a conference call organized for members of the New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>“Many states across the country began to expand their plans to re-open over Memorial Day weekend. With every state creating their own timeline and guidance, I asked Dr. Fauci about the spectrum of criteria being used by states, and what steps can be taken in places where the virus is still strongly present,” continued Peters of Fauci, “He explained that ‘hot spot’ areas like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago and other places where the number of cases continues to climb need to exercise extra-special caution as they look to re-open. He emphasized that phases in re-opening are crucial and should be used gradually instead of allowing all preventative practices to slide away at once. He also doubled down on the importance of everyone wearing a face covering when out to prevent the virus from spreading, and underscored that those who know they’ve been exposed must quarantine and get tested.”</p>
<p>Fauci also filled in lawmakers on various national COVID-19 treatment developments, including the progress being made in vaccine research and production. According to the NIAID director, the rollout of a vaccine is expected to come sometime between late summer and early winter 2021, with a goal to have enough doses for everyone.</p>
<p>Peters serves the 52nd District of California, which covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chairman.</p>
<p>Friday, May 22</p>
<p>MBHS PLANS SUMMER GRADUATION</p>
<p>“Like Point Loma, we are hopeful we will be able to hold summer graduation in July/August on the field,” said Mission Bay High School principal Ernest S. Remillard. “We are planning a senior celebration on May 29.”</p>
<p>The principal said students will receive all of their class of 2020 items (cap, gown, honor cords, IB Sash, 2020 yard sign, and more). “We will also be collecting any MBHS school items the kids have,” he said. “After dropping off, the kids and families will drive down Lee Street to a senior celebration, to include a DJ, party lighting, congratulations signs, MBHS staff waving to students, images of students projected throughout, and more.”</p>
<p>Added Remillard, “Students and families will need to remain in their cars throughout the event. We have encouraged students/families to decorate their cars for the event. We will be videoing the evening. Then on June 9, a video with student images and footage from the night will be posted on our website, district website, and social media platform. This will be a class of 2020 recognition.”</p>
<p>PB DUCK DIVE RESURFACES</p>

We look forward to continuing to grow the market as regulations are lifted safely over the coming months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmers market reopened May 19 after being on hiatus due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>DIAPER DRIVES FOR NEEDY FAMILIES</p>
<p>Miracle Babies, a nonprofit organization that supports families with critically ill babies in local neonatal intensive care units, is hosting a series of diaper drive-through events for local families.</p>
<p>The diaper donations will be open to all San Diego families in need during this difficult time. Parents will be asked to display diaper size needed on their dashboard as they drive into the parking lot to limit contact. If families currently have a baby in the NICU, parents can write “NICU NOW” on their dashboard for a care package. Diapers will be loaded directly into families’ vehicle for a no-contact experience.</p>
<p>“After seeing how many families turned out for our first diaper drive donation, we knew we had to make this a re-occurring event,” said Marianela Camarillo, chief operations officer of Miracle Babies. “We saw firsthand how many families are in need of diapers, so we decided to host a series of diaper drive-through events throughout San Diego County as a way to support parents during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>The diaper drive-throughs will provide registered parents with diapers and Miracle Babies will hold events throughout the county. Upcoming events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saturday, May 23 from 10 a.m. to noon at the National City Library, 1401 National City Blvd.</p>

<p>Starting May 26, San Diegans can pick up items on hold at 11 library locations during limited hours. The pickup service will restore access to 2.9 million physical materials in the San Diego Public Library’s collection to library patrons for the first time since libraries were closed in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also prioritizes the health and safety of patrons and employees, while allowing San Diegans to pick up materials at designated locations.</p>
<p>“We’re flattening the curve, and as San Diegans continue to do the right thing we will expand and restore neighborhood services in a safe and responsible way,” said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. “We know San Diegans love and miss their libraries, so we’re excited to offer contact-free pickup to provide access to millions of books and other materials while implementing safeguards to protect employees and patrons.”</p>
<p>Starting May 26, pickup service will be available Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at the following locations: Carmel Valley, College-Rolando, La Jolla/Riford, Logan Heights, Mira Mesa, Mission Hills-Hillcrest/Knox, Mission Valley, Point Loma/Hervey, Rancho Bernardo, San Ysidro and Valencia Park/Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Patrons with existing holds will be notified by email when their materials are available. The San Diego Public Library will begin accepting new holds for pickup on June 1.</p>
<p>“The pickup service is an important first step in the library’s return to full service,” said library director Misty Jones. “While our libraries have been physically closed, patrons have been using our online resources in record numbers. However, we’ve heard from many people who prefer physical books, and this pickup service allows them to access some of the resources they’ve been missing.”</p>
<p>Patrons will need to present a valid library card or library card number to pick up their materials. Library facilities will not be open to the public and will not accept returns at this time. Due dates on items currently checked out have been extended to June 12.</p>
<p>JUNGLE JAVA IN OB CLOSING</p>
<p>“We are so happy and proud that we could keep Jungle Java going for a few more years,” said the coffee shop’s operator for the past three years, Danielle Hargis. “It’s a lovely place that has many memories thanks to the amazing people that worked there threw the years and the wonderful people who came to enjoy the sun, the plants and the tasty treats. Thank you so very much. Be safe. Be well.”</p>
<p>Concerning why she’s closing Hargis said: “It was a mix of a lot of things. It was hard to keep social distancing in a place where people gather. I don’t know how to reopen when people can’t socialize.”</p>
<p>Hargis added she was uncertain she could keep the coffee and plant shop at 5047 Newport Ave. on an even keel financially. “I didn’t think I’d have the numbers to keep the place open,” she said. “Also, my lease is up. It was just a business move.”</p>
<p>Jungle Java has a mobile cart food license and has been selling smoothies along with teas, coffees, and plants. Asked what she’ll do now, Hargis replied, “I’m taking a break. I don’t know if I’ll be successful in getting a job in my industry. Hopefully, I’ll stick with small-business, hopefully, work with agriculture.”</p>
<p>GASLAMP QUARTER BLOOMING WITH MURALS</p>
<p>Several Gaslamp businesses that temporarily shuttered in light of the stay-at-home order covered their windows with plywood during the shutdown. Now, as the neighborhood begins to reopen, flowers have begun to bloom on the boarded-up shops.</p>
<p>“As city lights have dimmed worldwide, these murals offer a sense of brightness for the Gaslamp and surrounding neighborhoods,” said Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter Association.</p>
<p>The pop-up urban art installation is the brainchild of Sean Warner, the Downtown San Diego Partnership’s director of placemaking. Warner hired local artists — including PANDR, Ladies Who Paint, Elliot Shuessler and Visual Gallery + Design — to create compelling images of hope, resilience and strength for storefronts in the Gaslamp, Quarter, the Downtown Core and East Village.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL SUMMER SCHOOL AT LA JOLLA HIGH</p>
<p>LJHS announced that summer school this year will go from Monday, June 22 to Thursday, July 31.</p>
<p>Summer School for 2020 will be taking place virtually using district-issued Chromebooks and Edgenuity online courses. Students will complete all work at home and will not be reporting to a school site.</p>
<p>Counselors have already pre-enrolled any students into summer school who currently have an “F” this semester, or have an “F” on their transcript. A summer school online registration and opt-out form will be sent to all enrolled students after May 25.</p>
<p>If a student does not have a district-issued computer, they may go to Clairemont, Hoover, Lincoln, or San Diego high schools from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Device Exchange and Distribution Centers at those schools. Any district student or family member may go to the center closest to their house to receive a new device or exchange a broken device. If your child would like to remediate a “D” grade, have them contact their counselor by Wednesday, May 27.</p>
<p>LJ COAST WALK TRAIL REPAIRS FUNDED</p>
<p>“With all your help and generous contributions, Friends of Coast Walk Trail has raised enough funds to complete the needed trail repairs starting Monday, June 1,” said Brenda Fake, neighborhood nonprofit spokesperson. “To safely complete these repairs and mitigate cost overruns, the trail will be partially closed for pedestrian/bike traffic starting:</p>
<p>June 1-5 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Cave Store to Prospect Bench just above the bridge;</p>
<p>June 8-12 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Prospect Bench to Coast Walk parking.</p>
<p>To help with community communication and outreach Friends of Coast Walk Trail is seeking trail ambassador volunteers to assist in redirecting pedestrians and providing project information during the day when repairs are being done.</p>
<p>The expected volunteer time commitment would be in 2- or 4- hour shifts to sit at one of two ends of the trail repair area. During this time, trail ambassadors will redirect pedestrians/bike traffic to an alternative entrance to the trail as well as a great opportunity to inform the public about the project. Friends of Coast Walk Trail will provide a comfortable chair, water, safety vest, masks, and information about the repair project.</p>
<p>“This a great opportunity to make a difference and support our local community with this project. Plus it’s a chance to meet other like-minded people,” said Fake. “We will be outlining appropriate social distancing guidelines and ask each volunteer to please wear a mask.” To volunteer, no later than May 30 at 5 p.m., email [email protected].</p>
<p>ONLINE COMMEMORATION FOR MEMORIAL DAY</p>
<p>The USS Midway Museum, Mt. Soledad National Memorial and Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Foundations, will all be holding Memorial Day differently this year due to the ongoing pandemic. Each location will hold approximately 15-minute commemorations that will be streamed live on Memorial Day from 9 to 10 a.m. at sandiegomemorialdaylive.com. The simulcast will flow from Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery to the Mt. Soledad National Memorial to the Miramar National Cemetery to the USS Midway Museum and briefly back to the Miramar National Cemetery for the conclusion. Public spectators will not be permitted at any of the commemoration locations.</p>
<p>“The importance of ensuring public health in the fight again Covid-19 will prevent normal Memorial Day commemorations from being held around San Diego this year,” said David Koontz, Midway Museum marketing director. “However, it is important to continue to honor those who have given their lives in service to the nation as members of the U.S. Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>Added Koontz,” Not only will this simulcast honor those military members who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, but it will also express appreciation to those front line heroes of today in the battle against the coronavirus.”</p>

<p>MISSION BAY COACH DENNIS PUGH DIES</p>
<p>Dennis Pugh, a long-time baseball and football coach at Mission Bay High School, died Friday night, May 15 in his home. He was in his 31st season as head coach of Mission Bay baseball after returning in 2017 following a 10-year stint as head baseball coach at Cal State San Marcos.</p>

<p>His most-notable player at Mission Bay High was running back Arian Foster, who went on to play in the NFL for the Houston Texans, gaining 6,527 yards, playing in four Pro Bowls and was first-team All-Pro in 2010. Pugh is survived by his wife, Marilyn.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA ART &amp; WINE FESTIVAL CANCELED</p>
<p>The La Jolla Art &amp; Wine Festival has spent the last several weeks monitoring the current situations and conferring with public health officials, and while it is still unclear what our new normal will be for this coming fall, it has been decided the LJAWF will be postponed to 2021.</p>
<p>While this decision was not easily made, it is the responsibility of the LJAWF to be good stewards to our local schools and its fundraising mission for them, said organizers. With the amount of uncertainty for the future and a thorough analysis of our planning timeline, the best efforts of the LJAWF team should now be spent on the 2021 event, promoters said.</p>
<p>LJAWF will return to Downtown La Jolla on Saturday, Oct. 9 and Sunday, Oct. 10, 2021. Guests can expect even more prestigious art, international wine, craft beer, and family-friendly fun then than ever before.</p>
<p>In the meantime, LJAWF wishes you and your families good health and well-being. If you would like to support the underfunded programs such as art, music, science, physical education, technology and on-site medical care at all La Jolla public schools, visit ljawf.com to make a donation.</p>

<p>MAY IS SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH</p>
<p>Now is the perfect time to talk about the latest innovations happening around the world’s most common cancer. Mattew Hangauer, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology School of Medicine at UC San Diego, has received $50,000 from The Skin Cancer Foundation, provided by the Ashley Trenner Research Grant Award, for his project “Targeting Immunotherapy-Tolerant Melanoma Persister Cells.”</p>
<p>Hangauer’s research focuses on how tumor cells evade cancer therapies, with a primary focus on melanoma. He aims to specifically understand how residual melanoma cells survive immunotherapy, and how those cells can be therapeutically targeted, in hopes of preventing any relapses. Little has been known about this area of research thus far and he hopes to increase the number of advanced melanoma patients who experience long-lasting responses to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>This spring, The Skin Cancer Foundation has been awarded a combined total of $125,000 in grants to three researchers. The funds encourage innovation in prevention, early detection and treatment of skin cancer. The Foundation’s Research Grants program has helped young doctors and investigators with funding for studies that have led to lifesaving breakthroughs. Hangauer’s project is made possible due to funding provided by Karen and Bob Trenner.</p>

<p>MTS APPOINTS FEMALE CEO</p>
<p>The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System board of directors has appointed the organization&rsquo;s first female CEO, in the wake of the sudden death last weekend of former CEO Paul Jablonski. Sharon Cooney, whose appointment was unanimously approved by the MTS board, takes over after holding a variety of high-level posts at the transit agency including deputy CEO, director of government affairs, director of planning and chief of staff.</p>
<p>“I am honored that the board expressed confidence in me,” Cooney said. “I think the board also understands that Mr. Jablonski assembled one of the best staffs in the entire country. I am lucky to have been mentored by one of the nation&rsquo;s most respected transit leaders and to have a group of professionals that are absolutely dedicated to advancing public transit in San Diego. We are all ready to take on the challenges today and into the future.”</p>
<p>Jablonski died at age 67 and had a transit career spanning four decades. He had worked at the MTS for 16 years.</p>
<p>WOMEN’S APPAREL RETAILER SUES STATE</p>
<p>San Diego’s largest family of designer consignment shops, My Sister&rsquo;s Closet, My Sister&rsquo;s Attic and Well Suited, will pursue legal action against the State of California after losing more than $1.5 million due to closures in Arizona and California. Owner and founder Ann Siner, who has a store location in the Costa Verde Center at 8610 Genesee Ave. in La Jolla, claims her shops have been the target of harassment by police officers who recently walked into one of her stores not wearing masks demanding her stores be shut down, with the only option being selling her merchandise curbside.</p>
<p>Siner said she has since brought several racks of clothing outside the store hoping it will attract customers, but that business model just doesn’t work. “How do you sell clothing, accessories, furniture, art, jewelry, handbags at the curb?” asked Siner. “It doesn’t work, but yet it’s okay for hundreds of shoppers to pour inside packed Target, Walmart, Home Depot, and other big-box stores by the hour. They are killing small businesses in California and they just don’t care.”</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT</p>
<p>According to the Workforce Partnership, since March 10 there have been:</p>
<p>470 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10, 2020 (up from 449 last week)</p>
<p>68,537 total reported employees affected (up from 67,379 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,391 in the Hospitality and Restaurant &amp; Bar sectors. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership. The full impact to employees and the region’s economy is higher as not all employers submit WARN notices.</p>
<p>215 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: California unemployment insurance claims fell by a third last week, to 214,028. This is still 85% above the pre-COVID record and four times the past decade’s average weekly claims, but the decrease is welcome, and we hope to see it continue this week and next as counties across the state enter Phase 2 of the reopening plan.</p>
<p>SD ZOO BEGINS ONLINE KIDS VIDEO SERIES</p>

<p>CITY LAUNCHES BETTER BY BIKE EFFORT</p>
<p>To celebrate National Bike Month in May and to highlight work to improve bicycling infrastructure, the City of San Diego is launching Better By Bike, an outreach and education effort aimed at encouraging more residents to consider commuting by bicycle. The City’s Climate Action Plan calls for an increase in commuter bicycling opportunities, especially in communities near major transit stops.</p>
<p>During May, the City is teaming up with the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition for the Love to Ride 25-day bicycling challenge, with events like the Family Week ride and New Cyclist Week.</p>
<p>People are urged to ride solo or with family members to comply with physical distancing guidelines; indoor rides on stationary bikes are also counted toward participation. Prize drawings will be held each week of the challenge.</p>
<p>“With so many San Diegans staying home to help stop the spread of Covid-19, more people are also hopping on their bikes for exercise and to run essential errands, or just to feel connected while maintaining distance,” said chief sustainability officer Cody Hooven. “We hope this becomes a new habit for people as they realize you don’t need to be an athlete or expert cyclist to commute by bicycle. For your health and the health of our environment, it really is better to go by bike when you can.”</p>
<p>According to Caltrans, traffic volume on roads statewide is down an average of 35% compared to this time last year. Meanwhile, bicycling is up 55% over expected volumes during the first week of May in cities across the southwestern part of the United States, according to data posted by Eco-Counter.</p>
<p>Last month, in response to requests from residents, commuter bikeways within city limits were reopened, including the State Route 56 bikeway and the San Diego River bikeway connecting Mission Valley and Ocean Beach. The City recently launched a Slow Streets program to allow more space for residents who are walking or bicycling in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To sign up for the Love to Ride 25-day challenge, visit lovetoride.net/sandiegocounty. Participants who sign up and log their rides online may be eligible for prizes, including new Brooklyn Bicycle cruiser, cycling gear and more. Share photos of your ride on social media using the hashtag #BetterByBike. Learn more about the City’s bicycling program by visiting sandiego.gov/bicycling.</p>

<p>CITY REPAVING ONE OF ITS BUSIEST STREETS</p>
<p>Taking advantage of reduced traffic due to the pandemic, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 12 ordered the repaving of the main stretch of North Harbor Drive leading to the San Diego International Airport – one of the busiest streets in the City. Faulconer was joined this morning by City Council member Mark Kersey, chair of the Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, to announce the project.</p>
<p>“First impressions are important, and the first thing most people see when they come to San Diego is the bumpy ride as they leave the San Diego International Airport,” Faulconer said. “This stretch of road is so busy that there’s never really a convenient time to make repairs, so we’re taking advantage of the reduced traffic from the statewide stay-at-home order to overhaul and improve this major thoroughfare for the first time in two decades.”</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the City began repaving 3.3 miles along North Harbor Drive between Ash Street to Nimitz Boulevard in both directions. In addition, the project includes buffered bike lanes through striping modifications. Traffic along North Harbor Drive has been reduced by 50 percent as a result of COVID-19. The paving project is expected to be completed in three weeks.</p>
<p>“During this crisis, San Diego International Airport has remained open as a critical piece of the nation’s transportation infrastructure,” said Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “And Harbor Drive is a critical artery helping people get to and from the airport. So we’re excited to see the City moving forward with plans to rehabilitate this roadway.”</p>
<p>REP. PETERS WORKING VIRTUALLY</p>
<p>Congressman Peters continues to work via teleconferencing for California’s 52nd district carrying out his legislative duties remotely while following public health guidance.</p>
<p>“The way we keep people safe and get our economy moving again is through testing, tracing, and treatment,&rdquo; said Peters.“Hearing from the Federal Trade Commission gave us important information to consider as we construct and coordinate innovative systems to allow for safe re-opening.</p>
<p>“While technology can be used to bolster testing and contact tracing efforts, we must work diligently with the tech community to monitor the rollout of any tools aimed at helping track the spread of the virus,” continued Peters. “Regulations will need to be implemented to prevent the abuse of any personal data gathered, and the public’s vigilance will be critical in protecting individuals’ sensitive information online. We should utilize technology in a way that helps our cause in preventing spread, but that doesn’t exploit Americans’ right to privacy, too.”</p>
<p>Added Peters: “According to public health experts, we are going to need $46.5 billion to get adequate testing up and running, with an additional 180,000 people to expand the contact tracing workforce. Robust testing, in tandem with proper contact tracing, will be essential to re-open the economy, and appropriately applied technology will be an important tool to help us do just that.”</p>
<p>The 52nd District of California covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chair.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA ON-RAMP CLOSURES POSTPONED</p>
<p>The daytime lane closure previously scheduled to take place today, May 12, on southbound Interstate 5 (I-5) has been postponed. The lane closure planned for the I-5 on-ramp from Genesee Avenue also has been postponed. Additional notice will be provided once the work is rescheduled.</p>
<p>When the closures take place, crews will install permanent signage for the new auxiliary lane that will connect Genesee Avenue with La Jolla Village Drive.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of the work, closures can be postponed at any time without notice. View closure updates at ShiftSanDiego.com, Facebook.com/MidCoastTrolley, or Twitter.com/MidCoastTrolley.</p>
<p>CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE CONSIDERS NOVEMBER BALLOT PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The City Council’s Rules Committee tomorrow will discuss 17 proposed measures and decide which of them merit further consideration for placement on the November 2020 ballot. Nine of the measures were submitted by individual San Diegans, four by local advocacy groups, and four by City officials, including Council members, the City Attorney, the City Auditor, and the Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The ideas include removing the coastal height limit in the Sports Arena area, implementing ranked-choice voting in San Diego’s general elections, and updating the City’s contracting policies to remain eligible for state grant funding.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many ideas coming from engaged members of our community,” Council president and Rules Committee chair Georgette Gómez said. “I look forward to discussing these proposals with my committee colleagues, and also hearing from the public which ones should be advanced to the ballot.”</p>
<p>Those measures that the committee advances for additional analysis will return to the Rules Committee to be considered for review by the full City Council.</p>

<p>PLHS GRAD IS A DUAL STUDENT-ATHLETE</p>
<p>Being a full-time student, playing a sport, and working is already hard enough. Imagine attending two colleges and being a full-time student at both. That’s a total of 24 units in a semester while playing a sport, and working on top of that. You have to be extremely disciplined and dedicated to being a dual athlete.</p>
<p>Savannah Ames is a dual student-athlete on San Diego Mesa College’s softball team. Ames, a Point Loma High School alumni, attends both San Diego Mesa College and Point Loma Nazarene University. Ames majors in communications and plans on graduating from PLNU in the fall of 2020. She carries a GPA over 3.0 at both colleges, PLNU 3.4 GPA, and Mesa 3.8 GPA.</p>
<p>UNCLAIMED MONEY AT CITY OF SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>Anyone who has done business with the City of San Diego in the past three years, including paying business taxes, could be owed money. Check amounts range from $1 to $22,000. The City regularly receives returned checks that are undeliverable based on the address on file. Checks that remain uncashed after six months become unclaimed monies.</p>
<p>The unclaimed monies report is available at sandiego.gov/finance/unclaimed and is updated quarterly. There is no charge to search the data or to file a claim. Since this time last year, the City returned $368,000 to 119 recipients who were listed on the unclaimed monies report, meaning 29% of the unclaimed monies were returned by the City. The average claim was $3,091.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 1,700 accounts with more than $660,000 in unclaimed monies belonging to people or businesses that have not received money owed to them because of refunds or vendor payments. Payees have approximately one year to claim their money after it’s been added to the unclaimed monies report. The last day to submit a claim for checks issued prior to April 1, 2019, is Thursday, June 18. To submit a claim, print and complete the Request for Unclaimed Monies form.</p>
<p>NEW POP-UP BRUNCH AT OB EATERY</p>
<p>A just-launched pop-up eatery has brought a new take-out brunch option to Ob. Called Loco Lopez and run by chef Richard Lopez, is operating Wednesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. out of the same Sunset Cliffs Boulevard space as Sundara Indian Kitchen, which has remained open throughout this shelter-at-home phase. With restaurants likely limited in their reopening capacity, Sundara co-founder Adam Lowe said the 38-seat eatery will likely continue to focus on its take-out business even after the dine-in ban is lifted.</p>
<p>Lowe approached Lopez with the offer to share the kitchen. The chef previously worked at Sundara, and has cooked in fine-dining restaurants as well as local hotels like the Hotel del Coronado.</p>
<p>Seeing a void in the to-go brunch market, Lopez created a menu of takeout-friendly dishes that includes a breakfast burrito wrapped in a cheese-crusted tortilla, a doughnut grilled cheese served with serrano jam, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs accompanied by house chips.</p>
<p>Though it’s starting as a pop-up, the chef says he’s hoping to make Loco Lopez permanent, either in the Sundara space or elsewhere. He’ll continue to expand the menu and is planning to eventually offer mimosas, micheladas, beer, and wine.</p>

<p>NEEDY FAMILIES TO RECEIVE FOOD FROM UNION VOLUNTEERS</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego in partnership with the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, will host mass “drive-through” food distributions for San Diego families and seniors in need at SDCCU Stadium (formerly Qualcomm) every Saturday in May from 9 a.m. until all of the food is gone.

The distribution is first-come, first-served for 1,100 vehicles starting at 9 a.m. on May 16, 23 and 30. The San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council is a community of more than 200,000 working families standing together.</p>
<p>SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARN LESS STATE FUNDS WOULD CAUSE ‘HARM’</p>
<p>San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten and Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner issued a joint statement in response to the Department of Finance’s preliminary estimates on the California State budget and the need for federal relief:</p>
<p>“A 20 percent reduction in state funds to public education, which would be about $2,700 less per student, would cause irreparable harm to children,” the superintendents said. “California already spends significantly less on public education than other large states. Moreover, reopening school facilities in a safe manner this fall will also require more funding.</p>
<p>“Our efforts to enhance the quality of distance learning and provide a safety net to students and families during this public health crisis have been comprehensive and responsive to student’s needs,” continued their joint release. “With approximately 240,000 devices and close to 18 million meals provided in Los Angeles and San Diego, the immediate challenges posed by Covid-19 have significantly increased costs for our schools.”</p>
<p>Noted both superintendents: “Implicit in every budget are a series of choices, which are made more difficult when the dollars are scarce. But they are still choices that elected officials in Sacramento must make and the consequences will have an impact on an entire generation of children. This generation has a right to an education, and a 20% reduction in state school spending would deny students this right. Simply put, that level of spending reduction would make it impossible for schools to safely reopen this fall.”</p>

<p>GARNET BUILDING IN PB SELLS FOR NEARLY $2 MILLION</p>
<p>A prominent freestanding 4,500-square-foot building that has a John Lennon mural painted on the side across from Chase Bank at 1020 Garnet Ave. in Pacific Beach was sold for $1.9 million.</p>

<p>“Pacific Beach continues to evolve as a dynamic neighborhood and ideal location for investors in San Diego. Coastal pockets have historically been able to weather downturns better than other submarkets, and I think PB will continue to be a great area to invest in,” said Pyke.</p>
<p>The sale adds to a steady increase of activity in the PB area for Pyke and Campbell. Over the past year, the team secured leases with F45 at 1245 Garnet Ave., Fritzy’s Roller Skate Shop at The Promenade at Pacific Beach; sourced new leases with Yoga Box, PB Training, and San Diego Sliders Co. at 909 Grand Ave.; and advised retail client QWENCH Juice Bar on its first San Diego location at 4462 Mission Blvd.</p>

<p>WHAT’S RED TIDE AND WHY DOES IT SMELL?</p>
<p>Bioluminescence expert Michael Latz, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said the current red tide, which stretches from Baja California to Los Angeles, is due to aggregations of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra, a species well known for its bioluminescent displays. Each microscopic cell contains some “sunscreen,” giving it a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>On sunny days, the organisms swim toward the surface where they concentrate, resulting in the intensified coloration of the water – and the reason for the term &ldquo;red tide.&rdquo; At night, when the phytoplankton are agitated by waves or other movement in the water, they emit a dazzling neon blue glow.</p>
<p>The ocean along San Diego County is still brown in color, but now the sulfury odor is intense. The strong odor has reached about 1 ½ miles inland. There is also foam, indicating the breakdown of protein and other organic material. There are also reports of fish kills along beaches and in lagoons and harbors. The breakdown of the red tide by microbes results in low oxygen conditions that are deleterious to some animals.</p>
<p>Is the water safe for surfing/swimming? In some areas such as the Mediterranean, Lingulodinium polyedra produces yessotoxin, a compound that acts as a neurotoxin, but local populations do not produce yessotoxin. However, some people are sensitive to inhaling air associated with the red tide, so the organisms must be producing other compounds that can affect human health. In general, during a red tide, there is lots of dissolved and particulate matter in the water with associated enhanced microbial activity. It is a personal choice whether to go in the water, but there is no public health warning associated with the red tide.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL RELIEF TEAMS SUPPLYING SD FOOD BANK</p>
<p>San Diego-based International Relief Teams is providing the Jacobs &amp; Cushman San Diego Food Bank with more than $90,000 worth of canned goods to help meet the increased demand for food assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Donated canned goods include black beans, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and tuna totaling more than 121,000 cans. The food will be delivered in two large truckloads on May 7-8.</p>
<p>“IRT is dedicated to helping families in need. We know that many San Diego families are suffering right now because of the shutdown, and we wanted to help ensure that they can access the food they need. We have partnered with the San Diego Food Bank for many years and we are proud to support their extraordinary response to this pandemic,” said Barry La Forgia, International Relief Teams’ executive director.</p>
<p>ILLUMINA DONATES $1 MILLION TO SD SCHOOLS, FRONTLINE WORKERS</p>
<p>The Illumina Corporate Foundation has directed the $1 million gift to The San Diego Foundation COVID-19 Community Fund, which was created to provide resources to low-income workers, families and vulnerable communities most affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Illumina’s donation directs $700,000 to the San Diego Unified School District to help K-12 distance learning and $300,000 to support frontline healthcare workers, food security and small business programs. The COVID-19 Community Response Fund has raised over $10.8 million.</p>
<p>“We are proud to call San Diego home and are dedicated to supporting impactful relief efforts in our hometown. From individuals to communities, from companies to countries, we are finding ways to support each other and address the pandemic together,” said Sam Samad, senior vice president/CFO of Illumina. “One of the brightest silver linings of this time is the amount of innovation in service to others.”</p>
<p>As San Diego families and students transition to distance learning provided by SDUSD, access to reliable internet and technology are essential. Illumina’s donation will support K-12 distance learning programs for students without internet access, as well as science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the support of Illumina, we have worked to guarantee all students in San Diego have what they need to continue their educational journey and pursue their dreams,” SDUSD Superintendent Cindy Marten said. “Illumina’s donation to the San Diego Foundation will allow us to continue to provide our families the technology and services they need to access information and to continue learning now and into the future. We are very thankful for our long-standing partnership with Illumina.”</p>
<p>Illumina is the biggest and highest-valued biotech company in San Diego County. Its mission is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. The company is working to put an end to the spread of COVID-19 by making DNA sequencing accessible around the world.</p>
<p>SD POET LAUREATE INVITES PUBLIC TO SHARE PANDEMIC REFLECTIONS</p>
<p>As residents continue to follow stay-at-home orders, the City of San Diego’s Commission for Arts and Culture and San Diego’s first Poet Laureate, Ron Salisbury, invite the public to participate in San Diego Poetry Together: A Poetic Response to the Pandemic.</p>
<p>The challenge is a way to engage the public through the literary arts and use poetry as an outlet to creatively express and share their feelings about the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is a difficult time for many and the literary arts often give us a way to express what we may not be able to clearly articulate when interacting with others,” said Salisbury. “In this case, we are encouraging everyone to use the written word to share their experiences.”</p>
<p>During May, participants can submit original work based on writing prompts posted on the San Diego Poetry Together webpage. Participants can submit written and spoken word entries. Salisbury will select several poems that will be shared publicly and posted to the web page.</p>

<p>FEEDING SAN DIEGO PURCHASES 125 TRUCKLOADS OF FOOD FOR HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego has purchased 125 truckloads of food since March 14 to meet a countywide surge in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. The organization normally purchases approximately 24 truckloads in an entire year.</p>
<p>The increased reliance on purchased food is helping the organization to meet the needs of the nearly one out of every eight San Diegans struggling with hunger prior to the COVID-19 crisis, but also thousands of newly affected residents as San Diego’s unemployment rate reaches 25%. The increased demand comes at a time when Feeding San Diego has experienced a 30 percent decline in donations from local grocery stores due to high consumer demand.</p>
<p>“We are experiencing a tremendous surge in people facing hunger across San Diego County right now, with an estimated 40 percent facing food insecurity for the first time,” said Vince Hall, CEO of Feeding San Diego. “The wave of children, families and seniors in need isn&rsquo;t slowing down — and neither are we because no San Diegan should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. We are grateful to the thousands of San Diegans who have generously donated to Feeding San Diego during this unprecedented crisis. Our donors from across this generous community make our work possible every day.”</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego offers no-touch, drive-through food assistance at hundreds of sites throughout San Diego County. The organization’s food finder map has become a valuable resource to the community and can be found at feedingsandiego.org/find-food. Additional community resources are accessible by calling 2-1-1 or visiting 211sandiego.org.</p>
<p>ROCK CHURCH DELIVERS MEALS IN COVID-19 HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Rock Church in Point Loma has put out the “bat signal” and local restaurants and delivery services have answered the call to band together and bring hunger relief to frontline hospital heroes and first responders. So far, 3,680 meals have been delivered to 13 hospitals throughout San Diego County.</p>
<p>Meals were delivered recently by Rock Church pastor Miles McPherson, a former Chargers player, along with former NFL Hall-of-Fame wide receiver Andre Reed. The pair delivered 50 meals to the San Diego Police Department and 50 meals to the San Diego 911 Call Center.</p>
<p>“I had no idea what an act of service being a 911 dispatcher does to keep people safe,” said Reed. “The SDPD is a huge piece to our San Diego community. After visiting them, I truly have an added respect for our police force, another set of frontline heroes to serve with the Rock Church and pastor Miles.”</p>
<p>The church has been working with Grub Hub to coordinate deliveries and restaurants including Los Primos, Toast, Lola 55, Neighborhood House Association, Beignet Belly, Chick-fil-A and California Pizza Kitchen, which have signed on for the task. Among the 13 hospitals are Sharp Grossmont, Sharp Memorial, Sharp Chula Vista, Sharp Coronado, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, UCSD Hillcrest, UCSD LaJolla, Scripps La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Chula Vista, VA Hospital in Ja Jolla, Palomar Poway and Palomar Escondido.</p>

<p>NIH GRANT ADVANCES RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>The Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at University of California San Diego has received a five-year, $54.7 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health. The new grant is the third such award since ACTRI opened in 2010, bringing total funding support to approximately $144 million.</p>
<p>“The first CTSA laid the foundation for transforming our institution. It built the early infrastructure that would help change the way we thought about moving discoveries from the lab to the clinic,” said Gary S. Firestein, MD, founding director of ACTRI and dean and associate vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “The second CTSA focused on making ACTRI the hub for clinical research and clinical trials at UC San Diego.”</p>
<p>The latest CTSA, said Firestein, will refine the fundamental work of the past decade and provide new resources that will launch a new wave of discovery and transformation.</p>
<p>The new funding will also be used to continue a scholar program supporting young faculty members establishing careers, expand ACTRI’s “Game Center,” a program that uses virtual reality games to train investigators in team science and create new mentoring programs in grant-writing, the financial lifeblood of research.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,400 ongoing clinical trials at UC San Diego Health, involving an estimated 7,000 participants in active treatment. Approximately 250 new trials begin each year, including most recently COVID-19-related trials investigating an antiviral drug, an arthritis drug and a medication for hypertension.</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO PARTICIPATE IN MAY 6 MUSIC FEST</p>
<p>San Diego International Airport will join more than 20 airports from across North America for the JetStream Music Festival, an online celebration of local music. Hosted by Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas, the free, multi-hour livestream will take place at 3 p.m. on May 6 on San Diego International Airport’s Facebook Live.</p>
<p>Each airport will feature a musician local to their city in support of the creative community during the COVID-19 crisis. San Diego will feature Nico Hueso, a San Diego polyglot and frequent SAN Arts Program performance artist. Hueso is a classically trained violist who has performed around the world in symphony orchestras, music festivals and master classes. He will perform a 10-minute set which will include original music.</p>
<p>“San Diego International Airport is excited to join other airports around the nation to showcase the arts in this innovative and collaborative way,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “While many people may not be visiting our terminals during this time, participation in JetStream provides us another outlet to foster positive relationships and support the community through the arts.”</p>
<p>SAN started the Arts Program in 2002 with a mission to surprise and delight travelers with presentations of the highest caliber, and to showcase San Diego’s rich cultural community. Within the terminals, the Arts Program includes visual arts, performing arts, film, and more.</p>

<p>MAYOR URGES SAN DIEGANS TO CONTINUE TO USE BEACHES RESPONSIBLY</p>
<p>Eyeing a sunny weekend forecast, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 1 joined with San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit and Parks and Recreation Department director Andy Field to remind San Diegans of what City resources are now open, and that physical distancing and face-covering mandates continue to be in effect.</p>
<p>What can and can’t be done under the new rules:</p>
<p>BEACHES</p>
<p>On the sand:</p>
<p>Run and walk.</p>
<p>No stopping, sitting, lying down.</p>
<p>In the ocean you can:</p>
<p>Swim.</p>
<p>Surf.</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>And kayak.</p>
<p>In the bays you can:</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>Kayak.</p>

<p>NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS</p>
<p>Parks are open for passive use.</p>

<p>Sitting with your family.</p>
<p>Parking lots remain closed.</p>
<p>GOLF COURSES</p>
<p>City of San Diego golf courses reopened with physical distancing and face-covering mandates.</p>
<p>FACIAL COVERINGS NOW REQUIRED AT AIRPORT</p>
<p>Per the California Health and Safety Code sections 101040, 120175, and 120175.5 (b), facial coverings are now required at San Diego International Airport (SAN) for all passengers, visitors, tenants, contractors, and employees while on airport property. The mandate is to help curb the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>As stated by the County of San Diego Health Officer, persons with a medical or mental health condition, or developmental disability that prevents wearing a face covering, shall be exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Public Health, a cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>
<p>The airport has placed red tape markings on floors at security checkpoints, airline ticket counters, and concession areas to adhere to six-foot social distancing rules. All airport users are also encouraged to comply with social distancing requirements and follow CDC guidelines to stop the spread of germs which include washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>“SAN’s top priority is the health and safety of all airport users,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “We’ve taken many steps to help curb the spread of COVID-19 and appreciate all airport users adhering to the local and state health orders.”</p>
<p>SDIA offers nonstop service to more than 70 destinations in the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. In operation since 1928, the airport celebrated more than 90 years of service to the San Diego region in 2018. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has managed the airport since 2003. The Airport Authority plans for and provides air transportation services to the region with safe, effective facilities that exceed customer expectations. For more information, visit san.org.</p>
<p>AMTRAK CELEBRATES 49TH ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>Today, Amtrak celebrated its 49th anniversary. For almost five decades, Amtrak has taken U.S. passenger rail customers where they need and want to go. Formally known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak consolidated the services of more than a dozen railroads into a truly national system when it first started. And, while observing this anniversary during an unprecedented time in history, Amtrack continues to provide a vital service to its customers, many of whom are medical professionals and first responders.</p>

<p>CONGRESSMAN PETERS SIGNS LETTER URGING GREATER MENTAL HEALTH, SUICIDE PREVENTION, DURING PANDEMIC</p>
<p>On May 1, Rep. Scott Peters joined 49 of his colleagues in sending a letter to House leadership urging for increased support prioritizing the mental health of the American public during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The bipartisan group of lawmakers requested greater investment in mental health resources and suicide prevention efforts given the unprecedented public health crisis and growing cases of economic insecurity – two stressors linked to mental health challenges and heightened risk of suicide.</p>
<p>The letter advocated for the incorporation of critical provisions in future coronavirus response and recovery packages. This would help address the mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, like enhanced funding for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and inclusion of the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act, which would assist emergency departments to develop better suicide risk protocols.</p>
<p>“We must support our nation’s system of crisis response services, fortify our emergency departments to adequately respond to self-harm, and prepare schools to address the mental health needs of children upon their return in the fall,” the legislators wrote.</p>
<p>MAY IS BICYCLE SAFETY MONTH</p>
<p>For bicycle safety month, Circulate San Diego is encouraging people walking, driving, or riding their bikes to look out for one another while practicing social-distancing.</p>
<p>While shelter-in-place orders are in effect, San Diegans still need to get to essential jobs, run errands, or go outside to exercise. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer unveiled his slow streets initiative this week to make it easier for San Diegans to travel safely while social distancing.</p>
<p>Faulconer’s slow streets initiative includes closing segments of Diamond Street, Adams Avenue, and Howard Street to through vehicular traffic to allow for social distancing for people walking and bicycling. He also announced improvements to pedestrian crosswalk buttons and the re-opening of state Route 56 Bikeway, Rose Creek Bikeway, Rose Canyon Bikeway and the state Route 52 Bikeway.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, San Diegans are finding that bicycling is a great way to travel to an essential job, to access essential needs, and exercise,” Maya Rosas, director of policy at Circulate San Diego said. “It’s important for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians to keep you and your family safe by remaining aware of your surroundings even though there is less vehicular traffic.”</p>
<p>Circulate San Diego has created a webpage with bike-friendly resources to encourage residents to get out and bike, safely and comfortably at circulatesd.org/may_is_bike_month.</p>

<p>A round-up of news, community, and business briefs from sdnews.com highlighting what’s happening in our community.</p>
<p>Saturday, May 30</p>
<p>BEACHES OPEN FOR SITTING JUNE 2</p>
<p>Starting June 2, people will be allowed to sit and lounge at local beaches provided they maintain physical distancing or wear a face covering when close to others, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced.</p>
<p>Sitting on the beach will be allowed for sunbathing and relaxing with towels and chairs if you do it with people in your own household. However, no activities such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Also, all piers and parking lots will remain closed.</p>
<p>All beach communities agreed to ease this restriction starting June 2, but cities can decide if they want to proceed later and how the guideline is going to be enforced.</p>
<p>BLENDERS EYEWEAR PROVIDES SUNGLASSES</p>
<p>Pacific Beach-based Blenders Eyewear will outfit more than 300 FedEx Express workers across the county, offering workers one of five select sunglasses. The Blenders Eyewear team donates sunglasses to the region’s 300-plus FedEx Express workers to thank them for their continued support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>After re-purposing its production to create and then donate 10,000 safety goggles to Southern California hospitals, plus 20,000 pairs to Direct Relief – in addition to a month-long fundraiser for the international aid organization – Blenders wanted to do more to help those at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, visit BlendersEyewear.com.</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT UPDATE</p>
<p>The San Diego Workforce Partnership releases a weekly email update to serve as a one-stop-shop on employment figures and analysis specific to our region’s workforce in regards to impacts associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>488 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10 (up from 482 last week).</p>
<p>73,617 total reported employees affected since March 10 (up from 72,446 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,692 in the hospitality and restaurant and bar industries. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership, although the full impact to employees and the region’s economy is still unknown.</p>
<p>260 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: New unemployment claims in California have held steady at a little over 200,000 for the last three weeks. For context, that’s about twice the pre-COVID-19 record. San Diego County’s official unemployment rate was the highest ever recorded last month at 15%, and we believe the current rate is higher, as about 40% of unemployment claims made since the onset of COVID-19 were submitted after April 12, when unemployment was last measured.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORS PROPOSE EVICTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION</p>
<p>Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Greg Cox, co-chairs of the County’s COVID-19 Subcommittee, are proposing the County of San Diego extend its moratorium on evictions for both residents and small businesses for one additional month. The Board of Supervisors will vote on the policy extension Tuesday, June 2.</p>
<p>“We are proposing extending San Diego County’s eviction moratorium for residents and small businesses through June 30th,” said Cox and Fletcher in a statement. “Our region is slowly recovering from the severe economic damage caused by the pandemic. Although more businesses are reopening, it is going to take time for merchants and their employees who have been out of work to rebuild their bank accounts enough to pay their rent. This will give residential and commercial renters more time to get back on their feet. But we are encouraging renters to pay as much rent as they can and set-up a payment program with their landlords.”</p>
<p>The original moratorium policy and resolution is set to expire Sunday, May 31. This moratorium extension only affects the unincorporated areas. If the extension is passed by supervisors, the resolution will continue to ensure protections provided retroactively to March 4, when Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency.</p>
<p>UC SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE VIRTUAL COMMENCEMENT</p>
<p>The university will host a virtual commencement for its School of Medicine Sunday, May 31 at 10 a.m. which can be viewed at medschool.ucsd.edu/Commencement2020. Keynote commencement speaker will be Mona Hanna-Attisha, MD, the pediatrician, scientist and activist who discovered high levels of lead in the blood of children living in Flint, Mich. and led efforts to publicize and address the source, a contaminated local water supply.</p>
<p>Approximately 132 graduates will receive their medical degrees. Of those, 11 will also receive Masters of Advanced Studies and six will also receive PhDs. The majority of these newly minted doctors will move on to residency programs in 26 different states and almost every specialty, such as emergency medicine, psychiatry.</p>
<p>ROCK THRIFT STORE REOPENED</p>
<p>The Rock Thrift Store at 3603 Camino Del Rio has reopened its doors after weeks of being closed due to COVID-19 by State and County regulations for non-essential businesses. Rock Thrift will be open to the public daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Patrons can shop or drop donations off. Everyone will be asked to abide by County regulations in order to keep the store, staff and customers safe. This includes wearing a mask, keeping six feet apart and following signage posted.</p>
<p>“I’m most excited to reopen Rock Thrift so we can go back to engaging and serving more of the community and spreading the love and hope of Christ,” said Brenda Swain, store manager.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional retail aspect of the store, the Rock Thrift Store also provides vouchers to individuals and families in need, through first responders, that may have been evacuated due to a fire, domestic violence and other crises. In a time where COVID-19 has created a multitude of needs for individuals and families across San Diego, the Rock Thrift store is eager to have it’s doors open to exchange those vouchers for much-needed clothing and household items. For store hours, donation guidelines and more information, visit rockthriftstore.com</p>
<p>URGENT NEED FOR BLOOD DONATIONS</p>

<p>U.S. REP. PETERS URGES RESTRAINT IN REOPENING</p>
<p>Congressman Scott Peters (CA-52), who recently heard from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and a key member of the Trump Administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, issued the following statement after a conference call organized for members of the New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>“Many states across the country began to expand their plans to re-open over Memorial Day weekend. With every state creating their own timeline and guidance, I asked Dr. Fauci about the spectrum of criteria being used by states, and what steps can be taken in places where the virus is still strongly present,” continued Peters of Fauci, “He explained that ‘hot spot’ areas like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago and other places where the number of cases continues to climb need to exercise extra-special caution as they look to re-open. He emphasized that phases in re-opening are crucial and should be used gradually instead of allowing all preventative practices to slide away at once. He also doubled down on the importance of everyone wearing a face covering when out to prevent the virus from spreading, and underscored that those who know they’ve been exposed must quarantine and get tested.”</p>
<p>Fauci also filled in lawmakers on various national COVID-19 treatment developments, including the progress being made in vaccine research and production. According to the NIAID director, the rollout of a vaccine is expected to come sometime between late summer and early winter 2021, with a goal to have enough doses for everyone.</p>
<p>Peters serves the 52nd District of California, which covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chairman.</p>

<p>MBHS PLANS SUMMER GRADUATION</p>
<p>“Like Point Loma, we are hopeful we will be able to hold summer graduation in July/August on the field,” said Mission Bay High School principal Ernest S. Remillard. “We are planning a senior celebration on May 29.”</p>
<p>The principal said students will receive all of their class of 2020 items (cap, gown, honor cords, IB Sash, 2020 yard sign, and more). “We will also be collecting any MBHS school items the kids have,” he said. “After dropping off, the kids and families will drive down Lee Street to a senior celebration, to include a DJ, party lighting, congratulations signs, MBHS staff waving to students, images of students projected throughout, and more.”</p>
<p>Added Remillard, “Students and families will need to remain in their cars throughout the event. We have encouraged students/families to decorate their cars for the event. We will be videoing the evening. Then on June 9, a video with student images and footage from the night will be posted on our website, district website, and social media platform.

<p>DIAPER DRIVES FOR NEEDY FAMILIES</p>
<p>Miracle Babies, a nonprofit organization that supports families with critically ill babies in local neonatal intensive care units, is hosting a series of diaper drive-through events for local families.</p>
<p>The diaper donations will be open to all San Diego families in need during this difficult time. Parents will be asked to display diaper size needed on their dashboard as they drive into the parking lot to limit contact. If families currently have a baby in the NICU, parents can write “NICU NOW” on their dashboard for a care package. Diapers will be loaded directly into families’ vehicle for a no-contact experience.</p>
<p>“After seeing how many families turned out for our first diaper drive donation, we knew we had to make this a re-occurring event,” said Marianela Camarillo, chief operations officer of Miracle Babies. “We saw firsthand how many families are in need of diapers, so we decided to host a series of diaper drive-through events throughout San Diego County as a way to support parents during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>The diaper drive-throughs will provide registered parents with diapers and Miracle Babies will hold events throughout the county. Upcoming events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saturday, May 23 from 10 a.m. to noon at the National City Library, 1401 National City Blvd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday, May 31 from 10 a.m. to noon at Scripps Health Campus, 10140 Campus Point Ct. These events require participants to register, email [email protected] to sign up or volunteer.</p>

<p>CITY LIBRARIES BEGIN CONTACT-FREE PICKUP</p>
<p>Starting May 26, San Diegans can pick up items on hold at 11 library locations during limited hours. The pickup service will restore access to 2.9 million physical materials in the San Diego Public Library’s collection to library patrons for the first time since libraries were closed in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also prioritizes the health and safety of patrons and employees, while allowing San Diegans to pick up materials at designated locations.</p>
<p>“We’re flattening the curve, and as San Diegans continue to do the right thing we will expand and restore neighborhood services in a safe and responsible way,” said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. “We know San Diegans love and miss their libraries, so we’re excited to offer contact-free pickup to provide access to millions of books and other materials while implementing safeguards to protect employees and patrons.”</p>
<p>Starting May 26, pickup service will be available Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at the following locations: Carmel Valley, College-Rolando, La Jolla/Riford, Logan Heights, Mira Mesa, Mission Hills-Hillcrest/Knox, Mission Valley, Point Loma/Hervey, Rancho Bernardo, San Ysidro and Valencia Park/Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Patrons with existing holds will be notified by email when their materials are available. The San Diego Public Library will begin accepting new holds for pickup on June 1.</p>
<p>“The pickup service is an important first step in the library’s return to full service,” said library director Misty Jones. “While our libraries have been physically closed, patrons have been using our online resources in record numbers. However, we’ve heard from many people who prefer physical books, and this pickup service allows them to access some of the resources they’ve been missing.”</p>
<p>Patrons will need to present a valid library card or library card number to pick up their materials. Library facilities will not be open to the public and will not accept returns at this time. Due dates on items currently checked out have been extended to June 12.</p>
<p>JUNGLE JAVA IN OB CLOSING</p>
<p>“We are so happy and proud that we could keep Jungle Java going for a few more years,” said the coffee shop’s operator for the past three years, Danielle Hargis. “It’s a lovely place that has many memories thanks to the amazing people that worked there threw the years and the wonderful people who came to enjoy the sun, the plants and the tasty treats. Thank you so very much. Be safe. Be well.”</p>
<p>Concerning why she’s closing Hargis said: “It was a mix of a lot of things. It was hard to keep social distancing in a place where people gather. I don’t know how to reopen when people can’t socialize.”</p>
<p>Hargis added she was uncertain she could keep the coffee and plant shop at 5047 Newport Ave. on an even keel financially. “I didn’t think I’d have the numbers to keep the place open,” she said. “Also, my lease is up. It was just a business move.”</p>
<p>Jungle Java has a mobile cart food license and has been selling smoothies along with teas, coffees, and plants. Asked what she’ll do now, Hargis replied, “I’m taking a break. I don’t know if I’ll be successful in getting a job in my industry. Hopefully, I’ll stick with small-business, hopefully, work with agriculture.”</p>
<p>GASLAMP QUARTER BLOOMING WITH MURALS</p>
<p>Several Gaslamp businesses that temporarily shuttered in light of the stay-at-home order covered their windows with plywood during the shutdown. Now, as the neighborhood begins to reopen, flowers have begun to bloom on the boarded-up shops.</p>
<p>“As city lights have dimmed worldwide, these murals offer a sense of brightness for the Gaslamp and surrounding neighborhoods,” said Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter Association.</p>
<p>The pop-up urban art installation is the brainchild of Sean Warner, the Downtown San Diego Partnership’s director of placemaking. Warner hired local artists — including PANDR, Ladies Who Paint, Elliot Shuessler and Visual Gallery + Design — to create compelling images of hope, resilience and strength for storefronts in the Gaslamp, Quarter, the Downtown Core and East Village.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL SUMMER SCHOOL AT LA JOLLA HIGH</p>
<p>LJHS announced that summer school this year will go from Monday, June 22 to Thursday, July 31.</p>
<p>Summer School for 2020 will be taking place virtually using district-issued Chromebooks and Edgenuity online courses. Students will complete all work at home and will not be reporting to a school site.</p>
<p>Counselors have already pre-enrolled any students into summer school who currently have an “F” this semester, or have an “F” on their transcript. A summer school online registration and opt-out form will be sent to all enrolled students after May 25.</p>
<p>If a student does not have a district-issued computer, they may go to Clairemont, Hoover, Lincoln, or San Diego high schools from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Device Exchange and Distribution Centers at those schools. Any district student or family member may go to the center closest to their house to receive a new device or exchange a broken device. If your child would like to remediate a “D” grade, have them contact their counselor by Wednesday, May 27.</p>
<p>LJ COAST WALK TRAIL REPAIRS FUNDED</p>
<p>“With all your help and generous contributions, Friends of Coast Walk Trail has raised enough funds to complete the needed trail repairs starting Monday, June 1,” said Brenda Fake, neighborhood nonprofit spokesperson. “To safely complete these repairs and mitigate cost overruns, the trail will be partially closed for pedestrian/bike traffic starting:</p>
<p>June 1-5 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Cave Store to Prospect Bench just above the bridge;</p>
<p>June 8-12 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Prospect Bench to Coast Walk parking.</p>
<p>To help with community communication and outreach Friends of Coast Walk Trail is seeking trail ambassador volunteers to assist in redirecting pedestrians and providing project information during the day when repairs are being done.</p>
<p>The expected volunteer time commitment would be in 2- or 4- hour shifts to sit at one of two ends of the trail repair area. During this time, trail ambassadors will redirect pedestrians/bike traffic to an alternative entrance to the trail as well as a great opportunity to inform the public about the project. Friends of Coast Walk Trail will provide a comfortable chair, water, safety vest, masks, and information about the repair project.</p>
<p>“This a great opportunity to make a difference and support our local community with this project. Plus it’s a chance to meet other like-minded people,” said Fake. “We will be outlining appropriate social distancing guidelines and ask each volunteer to please wear a mask.” To volunteer, no later than May 30 at 5 p.m., email [email protected].</p>
<p>ONLINE COMMEMORATION FOR MEMORIAL DAY</p>
<p>The USS Midway Museum, Mt. Soledad National Memorial and Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Foundations, will all be holding Memorial Day differently this year due to the ongoing pandemic. Each location will hold approximately 15-minute commemorations that will be streamed live on Memorial Day from 9 to 10 a.m. at sandiegomemorialdaylive.com. The simulcast will flow from Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery to the Mt. Soledad National Memorial to the Miramar National Cemetery to the USS Midway Museum and briefly back to the Miramar National Cemetery for the conclusion. Public spectators will not be permitted at any of the commemoration locations.</p>
<p>“The importance of ensuring public health in the fight again Covid-19 will prevent normal Memorial Day commemorations from being held around San Diego this year,” said David Koontz, Midway Museum marketing director. “However, it is important to continue to honor those who have given their lives in service to the nation as members of the U.S. Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>Added Koontz,” Not only will this simulcast honor those military members who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, but it will also express appreciation to those front line heroes of today in the battle against the coronavirus.”</p>

<p>MISSION BAY COACH DENNIS PUGH DIES</p>
<p>Dennis Pugh, a long-time baseball and football coach at Mission Bay High School, died Friday night, May 15 in his home. He was in his 31st season as head coach of Mission Bay baseball after returning in 2017 following a 10-year stint as head baseball coach at Cal State San Marcos.</p>

<p>LA JOLLA ART &amp; WINE FESTIVAL CANCELED</p>
<p>The La Jolla Art &amp; Wine Festival has spent the last several weeks monitoring the current situations and conferring with public health officials, and while it is still unclear what our new normal will be for this coming fall, it has been decided the LJAWF will be postponed to 2021.</p>
<p>While this decision was not easily made, it is the responsibility of the LJAWF to be good stewards to our local schools and its fundraising mission for them, said organizers. With the amount of uncertainty for the future and a thorough analysis of our planning timeline, the best efforts of the LJAWF team should now be spent on the 2021 event, promoters said.</p>

<p>MAY IS SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH</p>
<p>Now is the perfect time to talk about the latest innovations happening around the world’s most common cancer. Mattew Hangauer, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology School of Medicine at UC San Diego, has received $50,000 from The Skin Cancer Foundation, provided by the Ashley Trenner Research Grant Award, for his project “Targeting Immunotherapy-Tolerant Melanoma Persister Cells.”</p>
<p>Hangauer’s research focuses on how tumor cells evade cancer therapies, with a primary focus on melanoma. He aims to specifically understand how residual melanoma cells survive immunotherapy, and how those cells can be therapeutically targeted, in hopes of preventing any relapses. Little has been known about this area of research thus far and he hopes to increase the number of advanced melanoma patients who experience long-lasting responses to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>This spring, The Skin Cancer Foundation has been awarded a combined total of $125,000 in grants to three researchers. The funds encourage innovation in prevention, early detection and treatment of skin cancer. The Foundation’s Research Grants program has helped young doctors and investigators with funding for studies that have led to lifesaving breakthroughs. Hangauer’s project is made possible due to funding provided by Karen and Bob Trenner.</p>

<p>MTS APPOINTS FEMALE CEO</p>
<p>The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System board of directors has appointed the organization&rsquo;s first female CEO, in the wake of the sudden death last weekend of former CEO Paul Jablonski. Sharon Cooney, whose appointment was unanimously approved by the MTS board, takes over after holding a variety of high-level posts at the transit agency including deputy CEO, director of government affairs, director of planning and chief of staff.</p>
<p>“I am honored that the board expressed confidence in me,” Cooney said. “I think the board also understands that Mr. Jablonski assembled one of the best staffs in the entire country. I am lucky to have been mentored by one of the nation&rsquo;s most respected transit leaders and to have a group of professionals that are absolutely dedicated to advancing public transit in San Diego. We are all ready to take on the challenges today and into the future.”</p>
<p>Jablonski died at age 67 and had a transit career spanning four decades. He had worked at the MTS for 16 years.</p>
<p>WOMEN’S APPAREL RETAILER SUES STATE</p>
<p>San Diego’s largest family of designer consignment shops, My Sister&rsquo;s Closet, My Sister&rsquo;s Attic and Well Suited, will pursue legal action against the State of California after losing more than $1.5 million due to closures in Arizona and California. Owner and founder Ann Siner, who has a store location in the Costa Verde Center at 8610 Genesee Ave. in La Jolla, claims her shops have been the target of harassment by police officers who recently walked into one of her stores not wearing masks demanding her stores be shut down, with the only option being selling her merchandise curbside.</p>
<p>Siner said she has since brought several racks of clothing outside the store hoping it will attract customers, but that business model just doesn’t work. “How do you sell clothing, accessories, furniture, art, jewelry, handbags at the curb?” asked Siner. “It doesn’t work, but yet it’s okay for hundreds of shoppers to pour inside packed Target, Walmart, Home Depot, and other big-box stores by the hour. They are killing small businesses in California and they just don’t care.”</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT</p>
<p>According to the Workforce Partnership, since March 10 there have been:</p>
<p>470 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10, 2020 (up from 449 last week)</p>
<p>68,537 total reported employees affected (up from 67,379 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,391 in the Hospitality and Restaurant &amp; Bar sectors. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership. The full impact to employees and the region’s economy is higher as not all employers submit WARN notices.</p>
<p>215 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: California unemployment insurance claims fell by a third last week, to 214,028. This is still 85% above the pre-COVID record and four times the past decade’s average weekly claims, but the decrease is welcome, and we hope to see it continue this week and next as counties across the state enter Phase 2 of the reopening plan.</p>
<p>SD ZOO BEGINS ONLINE KIDS VIDEO SERIES</p>

<p>CITY LAUNCHES BETTER BY BIKE EFFORT</p>
<p>To celebrate National Bike Month in May and to highlight work to improve bicycling infrastructure, the City of San Diego is launching Better By Bike, an outreach and education effort aimed at encouraging more residents to consider commuting by bicycle. The City’s Climate Action Plan calls for an increase in commuter bicycling opportunities, especially in communities near major transit stops.</p>
<p>During May, the City is teaming up with the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition for the Love to Ride 25-day bicycling challenge, with events like the Family Week ride and New Cyclist Week.</p>
<p>People are urged to ride solo or with family members to comply with physical distancing guidelines; indoor rides on stationary bikes are also counted toward participation. Prize drawings will be held each week of the challenge.</p>
<p>“With so many San Diegans staying home to help stop the spread of Covid-19, more people are also hopping on their bikes for exercise and to run essential errands, or just to feel connected while maintaining distance,” said chief sustainability officer Cody Hooven. “We hope this becomes a new habit for people as they realize you don’t need to be an athlete or expert cyclist to commute by bicycle. For your health and the health of our environment, it really is better to go by bike when you can.”</p>
<p>According to Caltrans, traffic volume on roads statewide is down an average of 35% compared to this time last year. Meanwhile, bicycling is up 55% over expected volumes during the first week of May in cities across the southwestern part of the United States, according to data posted by Eco-Counter.</p>
<p>Last month, in response to requests from residents, commuter bikeways within city limits were reopened, including the State Route 56 bikeway and the San Diego River bikeway connecting Mission Valley and Ocean Beach. The City recently launched a Slow Streets program to allow more space for residents who are walking or bicycling in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To sign up for the Love to Ride 25-day challenge, visit lovetoride.net/sandiegocounty. Participants who sign up and log their rides online may be eligible for prizes, including new Brooklyn Bicycle cruiser, cycling gear and more. Share photos of your ride on social media using the hashtag #BetterByBike. Learn more about the City’s bicycling program by visiting sandiego.gov/bicycling.</p>

<p>CITY REPAVING ONE OF ITS BUSIEST STREETS</p>
<p>Taking advantage of reduced traffic due to the pandemic, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 12 ordered the repaving of the main stretch of North Harbor Drive leading to the San Diego International Airport – one of the busiest streets in the City. Faulconer was joined this morning by City Council member Mark Kersey, chair of the Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, to announce the project.</p>
<p>“First impressions are important, and the first thing most people see when they come to San Diego is the bumpy ride as they leave the San Diego International Airport,” Faulconer said. “This stretch of road is so busy that there’s never really a convenient time to make repairs, so we’re taking advantage of the reduced traffic from the statewide stay-at-home order to overhaul and improve this major thoroughfare for the first time in two decades.”</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the City began repaving 3.3 miles along North Harbor Drive between Ash Street to Nimitz Boulevard in both directions. In addition, the project includes buffered bike lanes through striping modifications. Traffic along North Harbor Drive has been reduced by 50 percent as a result of COVID-19. The paving project is expected to be completed in three weeks.</p>
<p>“During this crisis, San Diego International Airport has remained open as a critical piece of the nation’s transportation infrastructure,” said Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “And Harbor Drive is a critical artery helping people get to and from the airport. So we’re excited to see the City moving forward with plans to rehabilitate this roadway.”</p>
<p>REP. PETERS WORKING VIRTUALLY</p>
<p>Congressman Peters continues to work via teleconferencing for California’s 52nd district carrying out his legislative duties remotely while following public health guidance.</p>
<p>“The way we keep people safe and get our economy moving again is through testing, tracing, and treatment,&rdquo; said Peters.“Hearing from the Federal Trade Commission gave us important information to consider as we construct and coordinate innovative systems to allow for safe re-opening.</p>
<p>“While technology can be used to bolster testing and contact tracing efforts, we must work diligently with the tech community to monitor the rollout of any tools aimed at helping track the spread of the virus,” continued Peters. “Regulations will need to be implemented to prevent the abuse of any personal data gathered, and the public’s vigilance will be critical in protecting individuals’ sensitive information online. We should utilize technology in a way that helps our cause in preventing spread, but that doesn’t exploit Americans’ right to privacy, too.”</p>
<p>Added Peters: “According to public health experts, we are going to need $46.5 billion to get adequate testing up and running, with an additional 180,000 people to expand the contact tracing workforce. Robust testing, in tandem with proper contact tracing, will be essential to re-open the economy, and appropriately applied technology will be an important tool to help us do just that.”</p>
<p>The 52nd District of California covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chair.</p>

<p>CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE CONSIDERS NOVEMBER BALLOT PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The City Council’s Rules Committee tomorrow will discuss 17 proposed measures and decide which of them merit further consideration for placement on the November 2020 ballot. Nine of the measures were submitted by individual San Diegans, four by local advocacy groups, and four by City officials, including Council members, the City Attorney, the City Auditor, and the Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The ideas include removing the coastal height limit in the Sports Arena area, implementing ranked-choice voting in San Diego’s general elections, and updating the City’s contracting policies to remain eligible for state grant funding.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many ideas coming from engaged members of our community,” Council president and Rules Committee chair Georgette Gómez said. “I look forward to discussing these proposals with my committee colleagues, and also hearing from the public which ones should be advanced to the ballot.”</p>
<p>Those measures that the committee advances for additional analysis will return to the Rules Committee to be considered for review by the full City Council.</p>

<p>PLHS GRAD IS A DUAL STUDENT-ATHLETE</p>
<p>Being a full-time student, playing a sport, and working is already hard enough. Imagine attending two colleges and being a full-time student at both. That’s a total of 24 units in a semester while playing a sport, and working on top of that. You have to be extremely disciplined and dedicated to being a dual athlete.</p>
<p>Savannah Ames is a dual student-athlete on San Diego Mesa College’s softball team. Ames, a Point Loma High School alumni, attends both San Diego Mesa College and Point Loma Nazarene University. Ames majors in communications and plans on graduating from PLNU in the fall of 2020. She carries a GPA over 3.0 at both colleges, PLNU 3.4 GPA, and Mesa 3.8 GPA.</p>
<p>UNCLAIMED MONEY AT CITY OF SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>Anyone who has done business with the City of San Diego in the past three years, including paying business taxes, could be owed money. Check amounts range from $1 to $22,000. The City regularly receives returned checks that are undeliverable based on the address on file. Checks that remain uncashed after six months become unclaimed monies.</p>
<p>The unclaimed monies report is available at sandiego.gov/finance/unclaimed and is updated quarterly. There is no charge to search the data or to file a claim. Since this time last year, the City returned $368,000 to 119 recipients who were listed on the unclaimed monies report, meaning 29% of the unclaimed monies were returned by the City. The average claim was $3,091.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 1,700 accounts with more than $660,000 in unclaimed monies belonging to people or businesses that have not received money owed to them because of refunds or vendor payments. Payees have approximately one year to claim their money after it’s been added to the unclaimed monies report. The last day to submit a claim for checks issued prior to April 1, 2019, is Thursday, June 18. To submit a claim, print and complete the Request for Unclaimed Monies form.</p>
<p>NEW POP-UP BRUNCH AT OB EATERY</p>
<p>A just-launched pop-up eatery has brought a new take-out brunch option to Ob. Called Loco Lopez and run by chef Richard Lopez, is operating Wednesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. out of the same Sunset Cliffs Boulevard space as Sundara Indian Kitchen, which has remained open throughout this shelter-at-home phase. With restaurants likely limited in their reopening capacity, Sundara co-founder Adam Lowe said the 38-seat eatery will likely continue to focus on its take-out business even after the dine-in ban is lifted.</p>
<p>Lowe approached Lopez with the offer to share the kitchen. The chef previously worked at Sundara, and has cooked in fine-dining restaurants as well as local hotels like the Hotel del Coronado.</p>
<p>Seeing a void in the to-go brunch market, Lopez created a menu of takeout-friendly dishes that includes a breakfast burrito wrapped in a cheese-crusted tortilla, a doughnut grilled cheese served with serrano jam, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs accompanied by house chips.</p>
<p>Though it’s starting as a pop-up, the chef says he’s hoping to make Loco Lopez permanent, either in the Sundara space or elsewhere. He’ll continue to expand the menu and is planning to eventually offer mimosas, micheladas, beer, and wine.</p>

<p>NEEDY FAMILIES TO RECEIVE FOOD FROM UNION VOLUNTEERS</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego in partnership with the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, will host mass “drive-through” food distributions for San Diego families and seniors in need at SDCCU Stadium (formerly Qualcomm) every Saturday in May from 9 a.m. until all of the food is gone. Teachers, construction workers, nurses, grocery workers and more are mobilizing donations, volunteering and providing logistical support. The distribution is first-come, first-served for 1,100 vehicles starting at 9 a.m. on May 16, 23 and 30. The San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council is a community of more than 200,000 working families standing together.</p>
<p>SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARN LESS STATE FUNDS WOULD CAUSE ‘HARM’</p>
<p>San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten and Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner issued a joint statement in response to the Department of Finance’s preliminary estimates on the California State budget and the need for federal relief:</p>
<p>“A 20 percent reduction in state funds to public education, which would be about $2,700 less per student, would cause irreparable harm to children,” the superintendents said. “California already spends significantly less on public education than other large states. Moreover, reopening school facilities in a safe manner this fall will also require more funding.</p>
<p>“Our efforts to enhance the quality of distance learning and provide a safety net to students and families during this public health crisis have been comprehensive and responsive to student’s needs,” continued their joint release. “With approximately 240,000 devices and close to 18 million meals provided in Los Angeles and San Diego, the immediate challenges posed by Covid-19 have significantly increased costs for our schools.”</p>
<p>Noted both superintendents: “Implicit in every budget are a series of choices, which are made more difficult when the dollars are scarce. But they are still choices that elected officials in Sacramento must make and the consequences will have an impact on an entire generation of children. This generation has a right to an education, and a 20% reduction in state school spending would deny students this right. Simply put, that level of spending reduction would make it impossible for schools to safely reopen this fall.”</p>

<p>DUCK DIVE, CITY TACOS, REOPENING IN PACIFIC BEACH</p>

<p>GARNET BUILDING IN PB SELLS FOR NEARLY $2 MILLION</p>
<p>A prominent freestanding 4,500-square-foot building that has a John Lennon mural painted on the side across from Chase Bank at 1020 Garnet Ave. in Pacific Beach was sold for $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Brian Pyke and Allison Campbell of Retail Insite represented the seller and buyer. The seller is Tanya Blane and the buyer has requested anonymity. The new owner has plans to reposition this building currently occupied by Five Guys.</p>
<p>“Pacific Beach continues to evolve as a dynamic neighborhood and ideal location for investors in San Diego. Coastal pockets have historically been able to weather downturns better than other submarkets, and I think PB will continue to be a great area to invest in,” said Pyke.</p>
<p>The sale adds to a steady increase of activity in the PB area for Pyke and Campbell. Over the past year, the team secured leases with F45 at 1245 Garnet Ave., Fritzy’s Roller Skate Shop at The Promenade at Pacific Beach; sourced new leases with Yoga Box, PB Training, and San Diego Sliders Co. at 909 Grand Ave.; and advised retail client QWENCH Juice Bar on its first San Diego location at 4462 Mission Blvd.</p>

<p>WHAT’S RED TIDE AND WHY DOES IT SMELL?</p>
<p>Bioluminescence expert Michael Latz, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said the current red tide, which stretches from Baja California to Los Angeles, is due to aggregations of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra, a species well known for its bioluminescent displays. Each microscopic cell contains some “sunscreen,” giving it a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>On sunny days, the organisms swim toward the surface where they concentrate, resulting in the intensified coloration of the water – and the reason for the term &ldquo;red tide.&rdquo; At night, when the phytoplankton are agitated by waves or other movement in the water, they emit a dazzling neon blue glow.</p>
<p>The ocean along San Diego County is still brown in color, but now the sulfury odor is intense. The strong odor has reached about 1 ½ miles inland. There is also foam, indicating the breakdown of protein and other organic material. There are also reports of fish kills along beaches and in lagoons and harbors. The breakdown of the red tide by microbes results in low oxygen conditions that are deleterious to some animals.</p>
<p>Is the water safe for surfing/swimming? In some areas such as the Mediterranean, Lingulodinium polyedra produces yessotoxin, a compound that acts as a neurotoxin, but local populations do not produce yessotoxin. However, some people are sensitive to inhaling air associated with the red tide, so the organisms must be producing other compounds that can affect human health. In general, during a red tide, there is lots of dissolved and particulate matter in the water with associated enhanced microbial activity. It is a personal choice whether to go in the water, but there is no public health warning associated with the red tide.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL RELIEF TEAMS SUPPLYING SD FOOD BANK</p>
<p>San Diego-based International Relief Teams is providing the Jacobs &amp; Cushman San Diego Food Bank with more than $90,000 worth of canned goods to help meet the increased demand for food assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Donated canned goods include black beans, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and tuna totaling more than 121,000 cans. The food will be delivered in two large truckloads on May 7-8.</p>
<p>“IRT is dedicated to helping families in need. We know that many San Diego families are suffering right now because of the shutdown, and we wanted to help ensure that they can access the food they need. We have partnered with the San Diego Food Bank for many years and we are proud to support their extraordinary response to this pandemic,” said Barry La Forgia, International Relief Teams’ executive director.</p>
<p>ILLUMINA DONATES $1 MILLION TO SD SCHOOLS, FRONTLINE WORKERS</p>
<p>The Illumina Corporate Foundation has directed the $1 million gift to The San Diego Foundation COVID-19 Community Fund, which was created to provide resources to low-income workers, families and vulnerable communities most affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Illumina’s donation directs $700,000 to the San Diego Unified School District to help K-12 distance learning and $300,000 to support frontline healthcare workers, food security and small business programs. The COVID-19 Community Response Fund has raised over $10.8 million.</p>
<p>“We are proud to call San Diego home and are dedicated to supporting impactful relief efforts in our hometown. From individuals to communities, from companies to countries, we are finding ways to support each other and address the pandemic together,” said Sam Samad, senior vice president/CFO of Illumina. “One of the brightest silver linings of this time is the amount of innovation in service to others.”</p>
<p>As San Diego families and students transition to distance learning provided by SDUSD, access to reliable internet and technology are essential. Illumina’s donation will support K-12 distance learning programs for students without internet access, as well as science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the support of Illumina, we have worked to guarantee all students in San Diego have what they need to continue their educational journey and pursue their dreams,” SDUSD Superintendent Cindy Marten said. “Illumina’s donation to the San Diego Foundation will allow us to continue to provide our families the technology and services they need to access information and to continue learning now and into the future. We are very thankful for our long-standing partnership with Illumina.”</p>
<p>Illumina is the biggest and highest-valued biotech company in San Diego County. Its mission is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. The company is working to put an end to the spread of COVID-19 by making DNA sequencing accessible around the world.</p>
<p>SD POET LAUREATE INVITES PUBLIC TO SHARE PANDEMIC REFLECTIONS</p>
<p>As residents continue to follow stay-at-home orders, the City of San Diego’s Commission for Arts and Culture and San Diego’s first Poet Laureate, Ron Salisbury, invite the public to participate in San Diego Poetry Together: A Poetic Response to the Pandemic.</p>
<p>The challenge is a way to engage the public through the literary arts and use poetry as an outlet to creatively express and share their feelings about the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is a difficult time for many and the literary arts often give us a way to express what we may not be able to clearly articulate when interacting with others,” said Salisbury. “In this case, we are encouraging everyone to use the written word to share their experiences.”</p>
<p>During May, participants can submit original work based on writing prompts posted on the San Diego Poetry Together webpage. Participants can submit written and spoken word entries. Salisbury will select several poems that will be shared publicly and posted to the web page.</p>

<p>“We have decided to open as some of the grocery items will be allowed and more vendors are ready to return,” said Sara Berns, executive director of Discover PB. “We will still need to depend on a couple of volunteers to maintain the crowd.

<p>Added Berns, “We need people to enter and shop and move on, basically. We will be restricted to capacity.

<p>Feeding San Diego has purchased 125 truckloads of food since March 14 to meet a countywide surge in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. The organization normally purchases approximately 24 truckloads in an entire year.</p>
<p>The increased reliance on purchased food is helping the organization to meet the needs of the nearly one out of every eight San Diegans struggling with hunger prior to the COVID-19 crisis, but also thousands of newly affected residents as San Diego’s unemployment rate reaches 25%. The increased demand comes at a time when Feeding San Diego has experienced a 30 percent decline in donations from local grocery stores due to high consumer demand.</p>
<p>“We are experiencing a tremendous surge in people facing hunger across San Diego County right now, with an estimated 40 percent facing food insecurity for the first time,” said Vince Hall, CEO of Feeding San Diego. “The wave of children, families and seniors in need isn&rsquo;t slowing down — and neither are we because no San Diegan should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. We are grateful to the thousands of San Diegans who have generously donated to Feeding San Diego during this unprecedented crisis. Our donors from across this generous community make our work possible every day.”</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego offers no-touch, drive-through food assistance at hundreds of sites throughout San Diego County. The organization’s food finder map has become a valuable resource to the community and can be found at feedingsandiego.org/find-food. Additional community resources are accessible by calling 2-1-1 or visiting 211sandiego.org.</p>
<p>ROCK CHURCH DELIVERS MEALS IN COVID-19 HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Rock Church in Point Loma has put out the “bat signal” and local restaurants and delivery services have answered the call to band together and bring hunger relief to frontline hospital heroes and first responders. So far, 3,680 meals have been delivered to 13 hospitals throughout San Diego County.</p>
<p>Meals were delivered recently by Rock Church pastor Miles McPherson, a former Chargers player, along with former NFL Hall-of-Fame wide receiver Andre Reed. The pair delivered 50 meals to the San Diego Police Department and 50 meals to the San Diego 911 Call Center.</p>
<p>“I had no idea what an act of service being a 911 dispatcher does to keep people safe,” said Reed. “The SDPD is a huge piece to our San Diego community. After visiting them, I truly have an added respect for our police force, another set of frontline heroes to serve with the Rock Church and pastor Miles.”</p>
<p>The church has been working with Grub Hub to coordinate deliveries and restaurants including Los Primos, Toast, Lola 55, Neighborhood House Association, Beignet Belly, Chick-fil-A and California Pizza Kitchen, which have signed on for the task. Among the 13 hospitals are Sharp Grossmont, Sharp Memorial, Sharp Chula Vista, Sharp Coronado, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, UCSD Hillcrest, UCSD LaJolla, Scripps La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Chula Vista, VA Hospital in Ja Jolla, Palomar Poway and Palomar Escondido.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA LAW FIRM OFFERING PRO BONO PLANNING TO HEALTHCARE WORKERS</p>
<p>Blanchard, Krasner &amp; French, a law firm with offices in La Jolla and Reno, Nev., is offering remote, pro bono estate planning services to essential healthcare workers, and their spouses, who reside in the San Diego region. It is being done in gratitude for their work on the front lines of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Recipients of pro bono services will be assessed via an application on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>
<p>In particular, the attorneys at Blanchard, Krasner &amp; French are volunteering time to remotely offer stop-gap estate plans for three items: wills, durable powers of attorney for assets, and advance health care directives. Those interested can learn more about eligibility and apply for consideration. The completed questionnaire should be filled out and returned via email to [email protected] by May 11. Applicants must also be available for a half-hour consultation with an attorney on May 15.</p>
<p>NIH GRANT ADVANCES RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>The Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at University of California San Diego has received a five-year, $54.7 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health. The new grant is the third such award since ACTRI opened in 2010, bringing total funding support to approximately $144 million.</p>
<p>“The first CTSA laid the foundation for transforming our institution. It built the early infrastructure that would help change the way we thought about moving discoveries from the lab to the clinic,” said Gary S. Firestein, MD, founding director of ACTRI and dean and associate vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “The second CTSA focused on making ACTRI the hub for clinical research and clinical trials at UC San Diego.”</p>
<p>The latest CTSA, said Firestein, will refine the fundamental work of the past decade and provide new resources that will launch a new wave of discovery and transformation.</p>
<p>The new funding will also be used to continue a scholar program supporting young faculty members establishing careers, expand ACTRI’s “Game Center,” a program that uses virtual reality games to train investigators in team science and create new mentoring programs in grant-writing, the financial lifeblood of research.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,400 ongoing clinical trials at UC San Diego Health, involving an estimated 7,000 participants in active treatment. Approximately 250 new trials begin each year, including most recently COVID-19-related trials investigating an antiviral drug, an arthritis drug and a medication for hypertension.</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO PARTICIPATE IN MAY 6 MUSIC FEST</p>
<p>San Diego International Airport will join more than 20 airports from across North America for the JetStream Music Festival, an online celebration of local music. Hosted by Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas, the free, multi-hour livestream will take place at 3 p.m. on May 6 on San Diego International Airport’s Facebook Live.</p>
<p>Each airport will feature a musician local to their city in support of the creative community during the COVID-19 crisis. San Diego will feature Nico Hueso, a San Diego polyglot and frequent SAN Arts Program performance artist. Hueso is a classically trained violist who has performed around the world in symphony orchestras, music festivals and master classes. He will perform a 10-minute set which will include original music.</p>
<p>“San Diego International Airport is excited to join other airports around the nation to showcase the arts in this innovative and collaborative way,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “While many people may not be visiting our terminals during this time, participation in JetStream provides us another outlet to foster positive relationships and support the community through the arts.”</p>
<p>SAN started the Arts Program in 2002 with a mission to surprise and delight travelers with presentations of the highest caliber, and to showcase San Diego’s rich cultural community. Within the terminals, the Arts Program includes visual arts, performing arts, film, and more.</p>

<p>MAYOR URGES SAN DIEGANS TO CONTINUE TO USE BEACHES RESPONSIBLY</p>
<p>Eyeing a sunny weekend forecast, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 1 joined with San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit and Parks and Recreation Department director Andy Field to remind San Diegans of what City resources are now open, and that physical distancing and face-covering mandates continue to be in effect.</p>
<p>What can and can’t be done under the new rules:</p>
<p>BEACHES</p>
<p>On the sand:</p>
<p>Run and walk.</p>
<p>No stopping, sitting, lying down.</p>
<p>In the ocean you can:</p>
<p>Swim.</p>
<p>Surf.</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>And kayak.</p>
<p>In the bays you can:</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>Kayak.</p>
<p>Boating.</p>
<p>No swimming.</p>
<p>NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS</p>
<p>Parks are open for passive use.</p>
<p>Walking.</p>
<p>Jogging.</p>
<p>Hiking.</p>
<p>Sitting with your family.</p>
<p>Parking lots remain closed.</p>
<p>GOLF COURSES</p>
<p>City of San Diego golf courses reopened with physical distancing and face-covering mandates.</p>
<p>FACIAL COVERINGS NOW REQUIRED AT AIRPORT</p>
<p>Per the California Health and Safety Code sections 101040, 120175, and 120175.5 (b), facial coverings are now required at San Diego International Airport (SAN) for all passengers, visitors, tenants, contractors, and employees while on airport property. The mandate is to help curb the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>As stated by the County of San Diego Health Officer, persons with a medical or mental health condition, or developmental disability that prevents wearing a face covering, shall be exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Public Health, a cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>
<p>The airport has placed red tape markings on floors at security checkpoints, airline ticket counters, and concession areas to adhere to six-foot social distancing rules. All airport users are also encouraged to comply with social distancing requirements and follow CDC guidelines to stop the spread of germs which include washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>“SAN’s top priority is the health and safety of all airport users,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “We’ve taken many steps to help curb the spread of COVID-19 and appreciate all airport users adhering to the local and state health orders.”</p>
<p>SDIA offers nonstop service to more than 70 destinations in the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. In operation since 1928, the airport celebrated more than 90 years of service to the San Diego region in 2018. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has managed the airport since 2003. The Airport Authority plans for and provides air transportation services to the region with safe, effective facilities that exceed customer expectations. For more information, visit san.org.</p>
<p>AMTRAK CELEBRATES 49TH ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>Today, Amtrak celebrated its 49th anniversary. For almost five decades, Amtrak has taken U.S. passenger rail customers where they need and want to go. Formally known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak consolidated the services of more than a dozen railroads into a truly national system when it first started. And, while observing this anniversary during an unprecedented time in history, Amtrack continues to provide a vital service to its customers, many of whom are medical professionals and first responders.</p>

<p>CONGRESSMAN PETERS SIGNS LETTER URGING GREATER MENTAL HEALTH, SUICIDE PREVENTION, DURING PANDEMIC</p>
<p>On May 1, Rep. Scott Peters joined 49 of his colleagues in sending a letter to House leadership urging for increased support prioritizing the mental health of the American public during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The bipartisan group of lawmakers requested greater investment in mental health resources and suicide prevention efforts given the unprecedented public health crisis and growing cases of economic insecurity – two stressors linked to mental health challenges and heightened risk of suicide.</p>
<p>The letter advocated for the incorporation of critical provisions in future coronavirus response and recovery packages. This would help address the mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, like enhanced funding for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and inclusion of the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act, which would assist emergency departments to develop better suicide risk protocols.</p>
<p>“We must support our nation’s system of crisis response services, fortify our emergency departments to adequately respond to self-harm, and prepare schools to address the mental health needs of children upon their return in the fall,” the legislators wrote.</p>
<p>MAY IS BICYCLE SAFETY MONTH</p>
<p>For bicycle safety month, Circulate San Diego is encouraging people walking, driving, or riding their bikes to look out for one another while practicing social-distancing.</p>
<p>While shelter-in-place orders are in effect, San Diegans still need to get to essential jobs, run errands, or go outside to exercise. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer unveiled his slow streets initiative this week to make it easier for San Diegans to travel safely while social distancing.</p>
<p>Faulconer’s slow streets initiative includes closing segments of Diamond Street, Adams Avenue, and Howard Street to through vehicular traffic to allow for social distancing for people walking and bicycling. He also announced improvements to pedestrian crosswalk buttons and the re-opening of state Route 56 Bikeway, Rose Creek Bikeway, Rose Canyon Bikeway and the state Route 52 Bikeway.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, San Diegans are finding that bicycling is a great way to travel to an essential job, to access essential needs, and exercise,” Maya Rosas, director of policy at Circulate San Diego said. “It’s important for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians to keep you and your family safe by remaining aware of your surroundings even though there is less vehicular traffic.”</p>
<p>Circulate San Diego has created a webpage with bike-friendly resources to encourage residents to get out and bike, safely and comfortably at circulatesd.org/may_is_bike_month.</p>

<p>A round-up of news, community, and business briefs from sdnews.com highlighting what’s happening in our community.</p>
<p>Saturday, May 30</p>
<p>BEACHES OPEN FOR SITTING JUNE 2</p>
<p>Starting June 2, people will be allowed to sit and lounge at local beaches provided they maintain physical distancing or wear a face covering when close to others, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced.</p>
<p>Sitting on the beach will be allowed for sunbathing and relaxing with towels and chairs if you do it with people in your own household. However, no activities such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Also, all piers and parking lots will remain closed.</p>
<p>All beach communities agreed to ease this restriction starting June 2, but cities can decide if they want to proceed later and how the guideline is going to be enforced.</p>
<p>BLENDERS EYEWEAR PROVIDES SUNGLASSES</p>
<p>Pacific Beach-based Blenders Eyewear will outfit more than 300 FedEx Express workers across the county, offering workers one of five select sunglasses. The Blenders Eyewear team donates sunglasses to the region’s 300-plus FedEx Express workers to thank them for their continued support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>After re-purposing its production to create and then donate 10,000 safety goggles to Southern California hospitals, plus 20,000 pairs to Direct Relief – in addition to a month-long fundraiser for the international aid organization – Blenders wanted to do more to help those at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, visit BlendersEyewear.com.</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT UPDATE</p>
<p>The San Diego Workforce Partnership releases a weekly email update to serve as a one-stop-shop on employment figures and analysis specific to our region’s workforce in regards to impacts associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>488 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10 (up from 482 last week).</p>
<p>73,617 total reported employees affected since March 10 (up from 72,446 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,692 in the hospitality and restaurant and bar industries. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership, although the full impact to employees and the region’s economy is still unknown.</p>
<p>260 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: New unemployment claims in California have held steady at a little over 200,000 for the last three weeks. For context, that’s about twice the pre-COVID-19 record. San Diego County’s official unemployment rate was the highest ever recorded last month at 15%, and we believe the current rate is higher, as about 40% of unemployment claims made since the onset of COVID-19 were submitted after April 12, when unemployment was last measured.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORS PROPOSE EVICTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION</p>
<p>Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Greg Cox, co-chairs of the County’s COVID-19 Subcommittee, are proposing the County of San Diego extend its moratorium on evictions for both residents and small businesses for one additional month. The Board of Supervisors will vote on the policy extension Tuesday, June 2.</p>
<p>“We are proposing extending San Diego County’s eviction moratorium for residents and small businesses through June 30th,” said Cox and Fletcher in a statement. “Our region is slowly recovering from the severe economic damage caused by the pandemic. Although more businesses are reopening, it is going to take time for merchants and their employees who have been out of work to rebuild their bank accounts enough to pay their rent. This will give residential and commercial renters more time to get back on their feet. But we are encouraging renters to pay as much rent as they can and set-up a payment program with their landlords.”</p>
<p>The original moratorium policy and resolution is set to expire Sunday, May 31. This moratorium extension only affects the unincorporated areas. If the extension is passed by supervisors, the resolution will continue to ensure protections provided retroactively to March 4, when Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency.</p>
<p>UC SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE VIRTUAL COMMENCEMENT</p>
<p>The university will host a virtual commencement for its School of Medicine Sunday, May 31 at 10 a.m. which can be viewed at medschool.ucsd.edu/Commencement2020. Keynote commencement speaker will be Mona Hanna-Attisha, MD, the pediatrician, scientist and activist who discovered high levels of lead in the blood of children living in Flint, Mich. and led efforts to publicize and address the source, a contaminated local water supply.</p>
<p>Approximately 132 graduates will receive their medical degrees. Of those, 11 will also receive Masters of Advanced Studies and six will also receive PhDs. The majority of these newly minted doctors will move on to residency programs in 26 different states and almost every specialty, such as emergency medicine, psychiatry.</p>
<p>ROCK THRIFT STORE REOPENED</p>
<p>The Rock Thrift Store at 3603 Camino Del Rio has reopened its doors after weeks of being closed due to COVID-19 by State and County regulations for non-essential businesses. Rock Thrift will be open to the public daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Patrons can shop or drop donations off. Everyone will be asked to abide by County regulations in order to keep the store, staff and customers safe. This includes wearing a mask, keeping six feet apart and following signage posted.</p>
<p>“I’m most excited to reopen Rock Thrift so we can go back to engaging and serving more of the community and spreading the love and hope of Christ,” said Brenda Swain, store manager.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional retail aspect of the store, the Rock Thrift Store also provides vouchers to individuals and families in need, through first responders, that may have been evacuated due to a fire, domestic violence and other crises. In a time where COVID-19 has created a multitude of needs for individuals and families across San Diego, the Rock Thrift store is eager to have it’s doors open to exchange those vouchers for much-needed clothing and household items. For store hours, donation guidelines and more information, visit rockthriftstore.com</p>
<p>URGENT NEED FOR BLOOD DONATIONS</p>
<p>The American Red Cross has an urgent need for blood donations to prevent another blood shortage as hospitals resume surgical procedures and patient treatments that were temporarily paused earlier this spring in response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Healthy individuals who are feeling well are asked to make an appointment to donate in the weeks and months ahead by downloading the free Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any Alexa Echo device.</p>

<p>U.S. REP. PETERS URGES RESTRAINT IN REOPENING</p>
<p>Congressman Scott Peters (CA-52), who recently heard from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and a key member of the Trump Administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, issued the following statement after a conference call organized for members of the New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>“Many states across the country began to expand their plans to re-open over Memorial Day weekend. With every state creating their own timeline and guidance, I asked Dr. Fauci about the spectrum of criteria being used by states, and what steps can be taken in places where the virus is still strongly present,” continued Peters of Fauci, “He explained that ‘hot spot’ areas like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago and other places where the number of cases continues to climb need to exercise extra-special caution as they look to re-open. He emphasized that phases in re-opening are crucial and should be used gradually instead of allowing all preventative practices to slide away at once. He also doubled down on the importance of everyone wearing a face covering when out to prevent the virus from spreading, and underscored that those who know they’ve been exposed must quarantine and get tested.”</p>
<p>Fauci also filled in lawmakers on various national COVID-19 treatment developments, including the progress being made in vaccine research and production. According to the NIAID director, the rollout of a vaccine is expected to come sometime between late summer and early winter 2021, with a goal to have enough doses for everyone.</p>
<p>Peters serves the 52nd District of California, which covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chairman.</p>

<p>The principal said students will receive all of their class of 2020 items (cap, gown, honor cords, IB Sash, 2020 yard sign, and more). “We will also be collecting any MBHS school items the kids have,” he said. “After dropping off, the kids and families will drive down Lee Street to a senior celebration, to include a DJ, party lighting, congratulations signs, MBHS staff waving to students, images of students projected throughout, and more.”</p>
<p>Added Remillard, “Students and families will need to remain in their cars throughout the event. We have encouraged students/families to decorate their cars for the event. We will be videoing the evening. Then on June 9, a video with student images and footage from the night will be posted on our website, district website, and social media platform. This will be a class of 2020 recognition.”</p>

<p>DIAPER DRIVES FOR NEEDY FAMILIES</p>
<p>Miracle Babies, a nonprofit organization that supports families with critically ill babies in local neonatal intensive care units, is hosting a series of diaper drive-through events for local families.</p>
<p>The diaper donations will be open to all San Diego families in need during this difficult time. Parents will be asked to display diaper size needed on their dashboard as they drive into the parking lot to limit contact. If families currently have a baby in the NICU, parents can write “NICU NOW” on their dashboard for a care package. Diapers will be loaded directly into families’ vehicle for a no-contact experience.</p>
<p>“After seeing how many families turned out for our first diaper drive donation, we knew we had to make this a re-occurring event,” said Marianela Camarillo, chief operations officer of Miracle Babies. “We saw firsthand how many families are in need of diapers, so we decided to host a series of diaper drive-through events throughout San Diego County as a way to support parents during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>The diaper drive-throughs will provide registered parents with diapers and Miracle Babies will hold events throughout the county. Upcoming events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saturday, May 23 from 10 a.m. to noon at the National City Library, 1401 National City Blvd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday, May 31 from 10 a.m. to noon at Scripps Health Campus, 10140 Campus Point Ct. These events require participants to register, email [email protected] to sign up or volunteer.</p>

</ul>
<p>CITY LIBRARIES BEGIN CONTACT-FREE PICKUP</p>
<p>Starting May 26, San Diegans can pick up items on hold at 11 library locations during limited hours. The pickup service will restore access to 2.9 million physical materials in the San Diego Public Library’s collection to library patrons for the first time since libraries were closed in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also prioritizes the health and safety of patrons and employees, while allowing San Diegans to pick up materials at designated locations.</p>
<p>“We’re flattening the curve, and as San Diegans continue to do the right thing we will expand and restore neighborhood services in a safe and responsible way,” said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. “We know San Diegans love and miss their libraries, so we’re excited to offer contact-free pickup to provide access to millions of books and other materials while implementing safeguards to protect employees and patrons.”</p>
<p>Starting May 26, pickup service will be available Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at the following locations: Carmel Valley, College-Rolando, La Jolla/Riford, Logan Heights, Mira Mesa, Mission Hills-Hillcrest/Knox, Mission Valley, Point Loma/Hervey, Rancho Bernardo, San Ysidro and Valencia Park/Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Patrons with existing holds will be notified by email when their materials are available. The San Diego Public Library will begin accepting new holds for pickup on June 1.</p>
<p>“The pickup service is an important first step in the library’s return to full service,” said library director Misty Jones. “While our libraries have been physically closed, patrons have been using our online resources in record numbers. However, we’ve heard from many people who prefer physical books, and this pickup service allows them to access some of the resources they’ve been missing.”</p>
<p>Patrons will need to present a valid library card or library card number to pick up their materials. Library facilities will not be open to the public and will not accept returns at this time. Due dates on items currently checked out have been extended to June 12.</p>
<p>JUNGLE JAVA IN OB CLOSING</p>
<p>“We are so happy and proud that we could keep Jungle Java going for a few more years,” said the coffee shop’s operator for the past three years, Danielle Hargis. “It’s a lovely place that has many memories thanks to the amazing people that worked there threw the years and the wonderful people who came to enjoy the sun, the plants and the tasty treats. Thank you so very much. Be safe. Be well.”</p>
<p>Concerning why she’s closing Hargis said: “It was a mix of a lot of things. It was hard to keep social distancing in a place where people gather. I don’t know how to reopen when people can’t socialize.”</p>
<p>Hargis added she was uncertain she could keep the coffee and plant shop at 5047 Newport Ave. on an even keel financially. “I didn’t think I’d have the numbers to keep the place open,” she said. “Also, my lease is up. It was just a business move.”</p>
<p>Jungle Java has a mobile cart food license and has been selling smoothies along with teas, coffees, and plants. Asked what she’ll do now, Hargis replied, “I’m taking a break. I don’t know if I’ll be successful in getting a job in my industry. Hopefully, I’ll stick with small-business, hopefully, work with agriculture.”</p>
<p>GASLAMP QUARTER BLOOMING WITH MURALS</p>
<p>Several Gaslamp businesses that temporarily shuttered in light of the stay-at-home order covered their windows with plywood during the shutdown. Now, as the neighborhood begins to reopen, flowers have begun to bloom on the boarded-up shops.</p>
<p>“As city lights have dimmed worldwide, these murals offer a sense of brightness for the Gaslamp and surrounding neighborhoods,” said Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter Association.</p>
<p>The pop-up urban art installation is the brainchild of Sean Warner, the Downtown San Diego Partnership’s director of placemaking. Warner hired local artists — including PANDR, Ladies Who Paint, Elliot Shuessler and Visual Gallery + Design — to create compelling images of hope, resilience and strength for storefronts in the Gaslamp, Quarter, the Downtown Core and East Village.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL SUMMER SCHOOL AT LA JOLLA HIGH</p>
<p>LJHS announced that summer school this year will go from Monday, June 22 to Thursday, July 31.</p>
<p>Summer School for 2020 will be taking place virtually using district-issued Chromebooks and Edgenuity online courses. Students will complete all work at home and will not be reporting to a school site.</p>
<p>Counselors have already pre-enrolled any students into summer school who currently have an “F” this semester, or have an “F” on their transcript. A summer school online registration and opt-out form will be sent to all enrolled students after May 25.</p>
<p>If a student does not have a district-issued computer, they may go to Clairemont, Hoover, Lincoln, or San Diego high schools from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Device Exchange and Distribution Centers at those schools. Any district student or family member may go to the center closest to their house to receive a new device or exchange a broken device. If your child would like to remediate a “D” grade, have them contact their counselor by Wednesday, May 27.</p>
<p>LJ COAST WALK TRAIL REPAIRS FUNDED</p>
<p>“With all your help and generous contributions, Friends of Coast Walk Trail has raised enough funds to complete the needed trail repairs starting Monday, June 1,” said Brenda Fake, neighborhood nonprofit spokesperson. “To safely complete these repairs and mitigate cost overruns, the trail will be partially closed for pedestrian/bike traffic starting:</p>
<p>June 1-5 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Cave Store to Prospect Bench just above the bridge;</p>
<p>June 8-12 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Prospect Bench to Coast Walk parking.</p>
<p>To help with community communication and outreach Friends of Coast Walk Trail is seeking trail ambassador volunteers to assist in redirecting pedestrians and providing project information during the day when repairs are being done.</p>
<p>The expected volunteer time commitment would be in 2- or 4- hour shifts to sit at one of two ends of the trail repair area. During this time, trail ambassadors will redirect pedestrians/bike traffic to an alternative entrance to the trail as well as a great opportunity to inform the public about the project. Friends of Coast Walk Trail will provide a comfortable chair, water, safety vest, masks, and information about the repair project.</p>
<p>“This a great opportunity to make a difference and support our local community with this project. Plus it’s a chance to meet other like-minded people,” said Fake. “We will be outlining appropriate social distancing guidelines and ask each volunteer to please wear a mask.” To volunteer, no later than May 30 at 5 p.m., email [email protected].</p>
<p>ONLINE COMMEMORATION FOR MEMORIAL DAY</p>
<p>The USS Midway Museum, Mt. Soledad National Memorial and Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Foundations, will all be holding Memorial Day differently this year due to the ongoing pandemic. Each location will hold approximately 15-minute commemorations that will be streamed live on Memorial Day from 9 to 10 a.m. at sandiegomemorialdaylive.com. The simulcast will flow from Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery to the Mt. Soledad National Memorial to the Miramar National Cemetery to the USS Midway Museum and briefly back to the Miramar National Cemetery for the conclusion. Public spectators will not be permitted at any of the commemoration locations.</p>
<p>“The importance of ensuring public health in the fight again Covid-19 will prevent normal Memorial Day commemorations from being held around San Diego this year,” said David Koontz, Midway Museum marketing director. “However, it is important to continue to honor those who have given their lives in service to the nation as members of the U.S. Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>Added Koontz,” Not only will this simulcast honor those military members who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, but it will also express appreciation to those front line heroes of today in the battle against the coronavirus.”</p>

<p>LA JOLLA ART &amp; WINE FESTIVAL CANCELED</p>
<p>The La Jolla Art &amp; Wine Festival has spent the last several weeks monitoring the current situations and conferring with public health officials, and while it is still unclear what our new normal will be for this coming fall, it has been decided the LJAWF will be postponed to 2021.</p>

With the amount of uncertainty for the future and a thorough analysis of our planning timeline, the best efforts of the LJAWF team should now be spent on the 2021 event, promoters said.</p>

<p>MAY IS SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH</p>
<p>Now is the perfect time to talk about the latest innovations happening around the world’s most common cancer. Mattew Hangauer, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology School of Medicine at UC San Diego, has received $50,000 from The Skin Cancer Foundation, provided by the Ashley Trenner Research Grant Award, for his project “Targeting Immunotherapy-Tolerant Melanoma Persister Cells.”</p>
<p>Hangauer’s research focuses on how tumor cells evade cancer therapies, with a primary focus on melanoma. He aims to specifically understand how residual melanoma cells survive immunotherapy, and how those cells can be therapeutically targeted, in hopes of preventing any relapses. Little has been known about this area of research thus far and he hopes to increase the number of advanced melanoma patients who experience long-lasting responses to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>This spring, The Skin Cancer Foundation has been awarded a combined total of $125,000 in grants to three researchers. The funds encourage innovation in prevention, early detection and treatment of skin cancer. The Foundation’s Research Grants program has helped young doctors and investigators with funding for studies that have led to lifesaving breakthroughs. Hangauer’s project is made possible due to funding provided by Karen and Bob Trenner.</p>

<p>MTS APPOINTS FEMALE CEO</p>
<p>The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System board of directors has appointed the organization&rsquo;s first female CEO, in the wake of the sudden death last weekend of former CEO Paul Jablonski. Sharon Cooney, whose appointment was unanimously approved by the MTS board, takes over after holding a variety of high-level posts at the transit agency including deputy CEO, director of government affairs, director of planning and chief of staff.</p>
<p>“I am honored that the board expressed confidence in me,” Cooney said. “I think the board also understands that Mr. Jablonski assembled one of the best staffs in the entire country. I am lucky to have been mentored by one of the nation&rsquo;s most respected transit leaders and to have a group of professionals that are absolutely dedicated to advancing public transit in San Diego. We are all ready to take on the challenges today and into the future.”</p>
<p>Jablonski died at age 67 and had a transit career spanning four decades. He had worked at the MTS for 16 years.</p>
<p>WOMEN’S APPAREL RETAILER SUES STATE</p>
<p>San Diego’s largest family of designer consignment shops, My Sister&rsquo;s Closet, My Sister&rsquo;s Attic and Well Suited, will pursue legal action against the State of California after losing more than $1.5 million due to closures in Arizona and California. Owner and founder Ann Siner, who has a store location in the Costa Verde Center at 8610 Genesee Ave. in La Jolla, claims her shops have been the target of harassment by police officers who recently walked into one of her stores not wearing masks demanding her stores be shut down, with the only option being selling her merchandise curbside.</p>
<p>Siner said she has since brought several racks of clothing outside the store hoping it will attract customers, but that business model just doesn’t work. “How do you sell clothing, accessories, furniture, art, jewelry, handbags at the curb?” asked Siner. “It doesn’t work, but yet it’s okay for hundreds of shoppers to pour inside packed Target, Walmart, Home Depot, and other big-box stores by the hour. They are killing small businesses in California and they just don’t care.”</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT</p>
<p>According to the Workforce Partnership, since March 10 there have been:</p>
<p>470 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10, 2020 (up from 449 last week)</p>
<p>68,537 total reported employees affected (up from 67,379 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,391 in the Hospitality and Restaurant &amp; Bar sectors. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership. The full impact to employees and the region’s economy is higher as not all employers submit WARN notices.</p>
<p>215 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: California unemployment insurance claims fell by a third last week, to 214,028. This is still 85% above the pre-COVID record and four times the past decade’s average weekly claims, but the decrease is welcome, and we hope to see it continue this week and next as counties across the state enter Phase 2 of the reopening plan.</p>
<p>SD ZOO BEGINS ONLINE KIDS VIDEO SERIES</p>

<p>CITY LAUNCHES BETTER BY BIKE EFFORT</p>
<p>To celebrate National Bike Month in May and to highlight work to improve bicycling infrastructure, the City of San Diego is launching Better By Bike, an outreach and education effort aimed at encouraging more residents to consider commuting by bicycle. The City’s Climate Action Plan calls for an increase in commuter bicycling opportunities, especially in communities near major transit stops.</p>
<p>During May, the City is teaming up with the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition for the Love to Ride 25-day bicycling challenge, with events like the Family Week ride and New Cyclist Week.</p>
<p>People are urged to ride solo or with family members to comply with physical distancing guidelines; indoor rides on stationary bikes are also counted toward participation. Prize drawings will be held each week of the challenge.</p>
<p>“With so many San Diegans staying home to help stop the spread of Covid-19, more people are also hopping on their bikes for exercise and to run essential errands, or just to feel connected while maintaining distance,” said chief sustainability officer Cody Hooven. “We hope this becomes a new habit for people as they realize you don’t need to be an athlete or expert cyclist to commute by bicycle. For your health and the health of our environment, it really is better to go by bike when you can.”</p>
<p>According to Caltrans, traffic volume on roads statewide is down an average of 35% compared to this time last year. Meanwhile, bicycling is up 55% over expected volumes during the first week of May in cities across the southwestern part of the United States, according to data posted by Eco-Counter.</p>
<p>Last month, in response to requests from residents, commuter bikeways within city limits were reopened, including the State Route 56 bikeway and the San Diego River bikeway connecting Mission Valley and Ocean Beach. The City recently launched a Slow Streets program to allow more space for residents who are walking or bicycling in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To sign up for the Love to Ride 25-day challenge, visit lovetoride.net/sandiegocounty. Participants who sign up and log their rides online may be eligible for prizes, including new Brooklyn Bicycle cruiser, cycling gear and more. Share photos of your ride on social media using the hashtag #BetterByBike. Learn more about the City’s bicycling program by visiting sandiego.gov/bicycling.</p>

<p>CITY REPAVING ONE OF ITS BUSIEST STREETS</p>
<p>Taking advantage of reduced traffic due to the pandemic, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 12 ordered the repaving of the main stretch of North Harbor Drive leading to the San Diego International Airport – one of the busiest streets in the City. Faulconer was joined this morning by City Council member Mark Kersey, chair of the Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, to announce the project.</p>
<p>“First impressions are important, and the first thing most people see when they come to San Diego is the bumpy ride as they leave the San Diego International Airport,” Faulconer said. “This stretch of road is so busy that there’s never really a convenient time to make repairs, so we’re taking advantage of the reduced traffic from the statewide stay-at-home order to overhaul and improve this major thoroughfare for the first time in two decades.”</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the City began repaving 3.3 miles along North Harbor Drive between Ash Street to Nimitz Boulevard in both directions. In addition, the project includes buffered bike lanes through striping modifications. Traffic along North Harbor Drive has been reduced by 50 percent as a result of COVID-19. The paving project is expected to be completed in three weeks.</p>
<p>“During this crisis, San Diego International Airport has remained open as a critical piece of the nation’s transportation infrastructure,” said Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “And Harbor Drive is a critical artery helping people get to and from the airport. So we’re excited to see the City moving forward with plans to rehabilitate this roadway.”</p>
<p>REP. PETERS WORKING VIRTUALLY</p>
<p>Congressman Peters continues to work via teleconferencing for California’s 52nd district carrying out his legislative duties remotely while following public health guidance.</p>
<p>“The way we keep people safe and get our economy moving again is through testing, tracing, and treatment,&rdquo; said Peters.“Hearing from the Federal Trade Commission gave us important information to consider as we construct and coordinate innovative systems to allow for safe re-opening.</p>
<p>“While technology can be used to bolster testing and contact tracing efforts, we must work diligently with the tech community to monitor the rollout of any tools aimed at helping track the spread of the virus,” continued Peters. “Regulations will need to be implemented to prevent the abuse of any personal data gathered, and the public’s vigilance will be critical in protecting individuals’ sensitive information online. We should utilize technology in a way that helps our cause in preventing spread, but that doesn’t exploit Americans’ right to privacy, too.”</p>
<p>Added Peters: “According to public health experts, we are going to need $46.5 billion to get adequate testing up and running, with an additional 180,000 people to expand the contact tracing workforce. Robust testing, in tandem with proper contact tracing, will be essential to re-open the economy, and appropriately applied technology will be an important tool to help us do just that.”</p>
<p>The 52nd District of California covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chair.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA ON-RAMP CLOSURES POSTPONED</p>
<p>The daytime lane closure previously scheduled to take place today, May 12, on southbound Interstate 5 (I-5) has been postponed. The lane closure planned for the I-5 on-ramp from Genesee Avenue also has been postponed. Additional notice will be provided once the work is rescheduled.</p>
<p>When the closures take place, crews will install permanent signage for the new auxiliary lane that will connect Genesee Avenue with La Jolla Village Drive.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of the work, closures can be postponed at any time without notice. View closure updates at ShiftSanDiego.com, Facebook.com/MidCoastTrolley, or Twitter.com/MidCoastTrolley.</p>
<p>CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE CONSIDERS NOVEMBER BALLOT PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The City Council’s Rules Committee tomorrow will discuss 17 proposed measures and decide which of them merit further consideration for placement on the November 2020 ballot. Nine of the measures were submitted by individual San Diegans, four by local advocacy groups, and four by City officials, including Council members, the City Attorney, the City Auditor, and the Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The ideas include removing the coastal height limit in the Sports Arena area, implementing ranked-choice voting in San Diego’s general elections, and updating the City’s contracting policies to remain eligible for state grant funding.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many ideas coming from engaged members of our community,” Council president and Rules Committee chair Georgette Gómez said. “I look forward to discussing these proposals with my committee colleagues, and also hearing from the public which ones should be advanced to the ballot.”</p>
<p>Those measures that the committee advances for additional analysis will return to the Rules Committee to be considered for review by the full City Council.</p>

<p>PLHS GRAD IS A DUAL STUDENT-ATHLETE</p>
<p>Being a full-time student, playing a sport, and working is already hard enough. Imagine attending two colleges and being a full-time student at both. That’s a total of 24 units in a semester while playing a sport, and working on top of that. You have to be extremely disciplined and dedicated to being a dual athlete.</p>
<p>Savannah Ames is a dual student-athlete on San Diego Mesa College’s softball team. Ames, a Point Loma High School alumni, attends both San Diego Mesa College and Point Loma Nazarene University. Ames majors in communications and plans on graduating from PLNU in the fall of 2020. She carries a GPA over 3.0 at both colleges, PLNU 3.4 GPA, and Mesa 3.8 GPA.</p>
<p>UNCLAIMED MONEY AT CITY OF SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>Anyone who has done business with the City of San Diego in the past three years, including paying business taxes, could be owed money. Check amounts range from $1 to $22,000. The City regularly receives returned checks that are undeliverable based on the address on file. Checks that remain uncashed after six months become unclaimed monies.</p>
<p>The unclaimed monies report is available at sandiego.gov/finance/unclaimed and is updated quarterly. There is no charge to search the data or to file a claim. Since this time last year, the City returned $368,000 to 119 recipients who were listed on the unclaimed monies report, meaning 29% of the unclaimed monies were returned by the City. The average claim was $3,091.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 1,700 accounts with more than $660,000 in unclaimed monies belonging to people or businesses that have not received money owed to them because of refunds or vendor payments. Payees have approximately one year to claim their money after it’s been added to the unclaimed monies report. The last day to submit a claim for checks issued prior to April 1, 2019, is Thursday, June 18. To submit a claim, print and complete the Request for Unclaimed Monies form.</p>
<p>NEW POP-UP BRUNCH AT OB EATERY</p>
<p>A just-launched pop-up eatery has brought a new take-out brunch option to Ob. Called Loco Lopez and run by chef Richard Lopez, is operating Wednesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. out of the same Sunset Cliffs Boulevard space as Sundara Indian Kitchen, which has remained open throughout this shelter-at-home phase. With restaurants likely limited in their reopening capacity, Sundara co-founder Adam Lowe said the 38-seat eatery will likely continue to focus on its take-out business even after the dine-in ban is lifted.</p>
<p>Lowe approached Lopez with the offer to share the kitchen. The chef previously worked at Sundara, and has cooked in fine-dining restaurants as well as local hotels like the Hotel del Coronado.</p>
<p>Seeing a void in the to-go brunch market, Lopez created a menu of takeout-friendly dishes that includes a breakfast burrito wrapped in a cheese-crusted tortilla, a doughnut grilled cheese served with serrano jam, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs accompanied by house chips.</p>
<p>Though it’s starting as a pop-up, the chef says he’s hoping to make Loco Lopez permanent, either in the Sundara space or elsewhere. He’ll continue to expand the menu and is planning to eventually offer mimosas, micheladas, beer, and wine.</p>

<p>NEEDY FAMILIES TO RECEIVE FOOD FROM UNION VOLUNTEERS</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego in partnership with the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, will host mass “drive-through” food distributions for San Diego families and seniors in need at SDCCU Stadium (formerly Qualcomm) every Saturday in May from 9 a.m. until all of the food is gone. Teachers, construction workers, nurses, grocery workers and more are mobilizing donations, volunteering and providing logistical support. The distribution is first-come, first-served for 1,100 vehicles starting at 9 a.m. on May 16, 23 and 30. The San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council is a community of more than 200,000 working families standing together.</p>
<p>SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARN LESS STATE FUNDS WOULD CAUSE ‘HARM’</p>
<p>San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten and Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner issued a joint statement in response to the Department of Finance’s preliminary estimates on the California State budget and the need for federal relief:</p>
<p>“A 20 percent reduction in state funds to public education, which would be about $2,700 less per student, would cause irreparable harm to children,” the superintendents said. “California already spends significantly less on public education than other large states. Moreover, reopening school facilities in a safe manner this fall will also require more funding.</p>
<p>“Our efforts to enhance the quality of distance learning and provide a safety net to students and families during this public health crisis have been comprehensive and responsive to student’s needs,” continued their joint release. “With approximately 240,000 devices and close to 18 million meals provided in Los Angeles and San Diego, the immediate challenges posed by Covid-19 have significantly increased costs for our schools.”</p>
<p>Noted both superintendents: “Implicit in every budget are a series of choices, which are made more difficult when the dollars are scarce. But they are still choices that elected officials in Sacramento must make and the consequences will have an impact on an entire generation of children. This generation has a right to an education, and a 20% reduction in state school spending would deny students this right. Simply put, that level of spending reduction would make it impossible for schools to safely reopen this fall.”</p>
<p>Friday, May 8</p>
<p>DUCK DIVE, CITY TACOS, REOPENING IN PACIFIC BEACH</p>

<p>GARNET BUILDING IN PB SELLS FOR NEARLY $2 MILLION</p>
<p>A prominent freestanding 4,500-square-foot building that has a John Lennon mural painted on the side across from Chase Bank at 1020 Garnet Ave. in Pacific Beach was sold for $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Brian Pyke and Allison Campbell of Retail Insite represented the seller and buyer. The seller is Tanya Blane and the buyer has requested anonymity. The new owner has plans to reposition this building currently occupied by Five Guys.</p>
<p>“Pacific Beach continues to evolve as a dynamic neighborhood and ideal location for investors in San Diego. Coastal pockets have historically been able to weather downturns better than other submarkets, and I think PB will continue to be a great area to invest in,” said Pyke.</p>
<p>The sale adds to a steady increase of activity in the PB area for Pyke and Campbell. Over the past year, the team secured leases with F45 at 1245 Garnet Ave., Fritzy’s Roller Skate Shop at The Promenade at Pacific Beach; sourced new leases with Yoga Box, PB Training, and San Diego Sliders Co. at 909 Grand Ave.; and advised retail client QWENCH Juice Bar on its first San Diego location at 4462 Mission Blvd.</p>

<p>WHAT’S RED TIDE AND WHY DOES IT SMELL?</p>
<p>Bioluminescence expert Michael Latz, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said the current red tide, which stretches from Baja California to Los Angeles, is due to aggregations of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra, a species well known for its bioluminescent displays. Each microscopic cell contains some “sunscreen,” giving it a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>On sunny days, the organisms swim toward the surface where they concentrate, resulting in the intensified coloration of the water – and the reason for the term &ldquo;red tide.&rdquo; At night, when the phytoplankton are agitated by waves or other movement in the water, they emit a dazzling neon blue glow.</p>
<p>The ocean along San Diego County is still brown in color, but now the sulfury odor is intense. The strong odor has reached about 1 ½ miles inland. There is also foam, indicating the breakdown of protein and other organic material. There are also reports of fish kills along beaches and in lagoons and harbors. The breakdown of the red tide by microbes results in low oxygen conditions that are deleterious to some animals.</p>
<p>Is the water safe for surfing/swimming? In some areas such as the Mediterranean, Lingulodinium polyedra produces yessotoxin, a compound that acts as a neurotoxin, but local populations do not produce yessotoxin. However, some people are sensitive to inhaling air associated with the red tide, so the organisms must be producing other compounds that can affect human health. In general, during a red tide, there is lots of dissolved and particulate matter in the water with associated enhanced microbial activity. It is a personal choice whether to go in the water, but there is no public health warning associated with the red tide.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL RELIEF TEAMS SUPPLYING SD FOOD BANK</p>
<p>San Diego-based International Relief Teams is providing the Jacobs &amp; Cushman San Diego Food Bank with more than $90,000 worth of canned goods to help meet the increased demand for food assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Donated canned goods include black beans, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and tuna totaling more than 121,000 cans. The food will be delivered in two large truckloads on May 7-8.</p>
<p>“IRT is dedicated to helping families in need. We know that many San Diego families are suffering right now because of the shutdown, and we wanted to help ensure that they can access the food they need. We have partnered with the San Diego Food Bank for many years and we are proud to support their extraordinary response to this pandemic,” said Barry La Forgia, International Relief Teams’ executive director.</p>
<p>ILLUMINA DONATES $1 MILLION TO SD SCHOOLS, FRONTLINE WORKERS</p>
<p>The Illumina Corporate Foundation has directed the $1 million gift to The San Diego Foundation COVID-19 Community Fund, which was created to provide resources to low-income workers, families and vulnerable communities most affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Illumina’s donation directs $700,000 to the San Diego Unified School District to help K-12 distance learning and $300,000 to support frontline healthcare workers, food security and small business programs. The COVID-19 Community Response Fund has raised over $10.8 million.</p>
<p>“We are proud to call San Diego home and are dedicated to supporting impactful relief efforts in our hometown. From individuals to communities, from companies to countries, we are finding ways to support each other and address the pandemic together,” said Sam Samad, senior vice president/CFO of Illumina. “One of the brightest silver linings of this time is the amount of innovation in service to others.”</p>
<p>As San Diego families and students transition to distance learning provided by SDUSD, access to reliable internet and technology are essential. Illumina’s donation will support K-12 distance learning programs for students without internet access, as well as science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the support of Illumina, we have worked to guarantee all students in San Diego have what they need to continue their educational journey and pursue their dreams,” SDUSD Superintendent Cindy Marten said. “Illumina’s donation to the San Diego Foundation will allow us to continue to provide our families the technology and services they need to access information and to continue learning now and into the future. We are very thankful for our long-standing partnership with Illumina.”</p>
<p>Illumina is the biggest and highest-valued biotech company in San Diego County. Its mission is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. The company is working to put an end to the spread of COVID-19 by making DNA sequencing accessible around the world.</p>
<p>SD POET LAUREATE INVITES PUBLIC TO SHARE PANDEMIC REFLECTIONS</p>
<p>As residents continue to follow stay-at-home orders, the City of San Diego’s Commission for Arts and Culture and San Diego’s first Poet Laureate, Ron Salisbury, invite the public to participate in San Diego Poetry Together: A Poetic Response to the Pandemic.</p>
<p>The challenge is a way to engage the public through the literary arts and use poetry as an outlet to creatively express and share their feelings about the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is a difficult time for many and the literary arts often give us a way to express what we may not be able to clearly articulate when interacting with others,” said Salisbury. “In this case, we are encouraging everyone to use the written word to share their experiences.”</p>
<p>During May, participants can submit original work based on writing prompts posted on the San Diego Poetry Together webpage. Participants can submit written and spoken word entries. Salisbury will select several poems that will be shared publicly and posted to the web page.</p>
<p>Deadlines and participation guidelines are available by visiting <a href="http://www.sandiego.gov/blog/san-diego-poet-laureate">www.sandiego.gov/blog/san-diego-poet-laureate</a>.</p>
<p>BBB SEEKS NOMINATIONS FOR TORCH AWARDS FOR ETHICS PROGRAMS</p>
<p>Better Business Bureau is seeking public nominations to recognize companies as part of the annual Torch Awards for Ethics program. The event celebrates businesses that positively impact the community, keeping ethics and integrity at the forefront of operations.</p>
<p>Now is an especially important time to highlight businesses that take strides to strengthen the marketplace through trust and ethical business practices.

<p>PB FARMERS MARKET TO REOPEN MAY 19</p>
<p>“We have decided to open as some of the grocery items will be allowed and more vendors are ready to return,” said Sara Berns, executive director of Discover PB. “We will still need to depend on a couple of volunteers to maintain the crowd. The biggest issue is there are very strict rules the public needs to adhere to, i.e. no eating on-site, one person per family/group can shop, no sitting, etc.”</p>
<p>Added Berns, “We need people to enter and shop and move on, basically. We will be restricted to capacity. We really need people to comply or we will be shut down and it will be very difficult to recover again. Thank you for your support of the PB Tuesday Farmers&rsquo; Market. See you in two weeks.”</p>

<p>FEEDING SAN DIEGO PURCHASES 125 TRUCKLOADS OF FOOD FOR HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego has purchased 125 truckloads of food since March 14 to meet a countywide surge in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. The organization normally purchases approximately 24 truckloads in an entire year.</p>
<p>The increased reliance on purchased food is helping the organization to meet the needs of the nearly one out of every eight San Diegans struggling with hunger prior to the COVID-19 crisis, but also thousands of newly affected residents as San Diego’s unemployment rate reaches 25%. The increased demand comes at a time when Feeding San Diego has experienced a 30 percent decline in donations from local grocery stores due to high consumer demand.</p>
<p>“We are experiencing a tremendous surge in people facing hunger across San Diego County right now, with an estimated 40 percent facing food insecurity for the first time,” said Vince Hall, CEO of Feeding San Diego. “The wave of children, families and seniors in need isn&rsquo;t slowing down — and neither are we because no San Diegan should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. We are grateful to the thousands of San Diegans who have generously donated to Feeding San Diego during this unprecedented crisis. Our donors from across this generous community make our work possible every day.”</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego offers no-touch, drive-through food assistance at hundreds of sites throughout San Diego County. The organization’s food finder map has become a valuable resource to the community and can be found at feedingsandiego.org/find-food. Additional community resources are accessible by calling 2-1-1 or visiting 211sandiego.org.</p>
<p>ROCK CHURCH DELIVERS MEALS IN COVID-19 HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Rock Church in Point Loma has put out the “bat signal” and local restaurants and delivery services have answered the call to band together and bring hunger relief to frontline hospital heroes and first responders. So far, 3,680 meals have been delivered to 13 hospitals throughout San Diego County.</p>
<p>Meals were delivered recently by Rock Church pastor Miles McPherson, a former Chargers player, along with former NFL Hall-of-Fame wide receiver Andre Reed. The pair delivered 50 meals to the San Diego Police Department and 50 meals to the San Diego 911 Call Center.</p>
<p>“I had no idea what an act of service being a 911 dispatcher does to keep people safe,” said Reed. “The SDPD is a huge piece to our San Diego community. After visiting them, I truly have an added respect for our police force, another set of frontline heroes to serve with the Rock Church and pastor Miles.”</p>
<p>The church has been working with Grub Hub to coordinate deliveries and restaurants including Los Primos, Toast, Lola 55, Neighborhood House Association, Beignet Belly, Chick-fil-A and California Pizza Kitchen, which have signed on for the task. Among the 13 hospitals are Sharp Grossmont, Sharp Memorial, Sharp Chula Vista, Sharp Coronado, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, UCSD Hillcrest, UCSD LaJolla, Scripps La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Chula Vista, VA Hospital in Ja Jolla, Palomar Poway and Palomar Escondido.</p>

<p>NIH GRANT ADVANCES RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>The Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at University of California San Diego has received a five-year, $54.7 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health. The new grant is the third such award since ACTRI opened in 2010, bringing total funding support to approximately $144 million.</p>
<p>“The first CTSA laid the foundation for transforming our institution. It built the early infrastructure that would help change the way we thought about moving discoveries from the lab to the clinic,” said Gary S. Firestein, MD, founding director of ACTRI and dean and associate vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “The second CTSA focused on making ACTRI the hub for clinical research and clinical trials at UC San Diego.”</p>
<p>The latest CTSA, said Firestein, will refine the fundamental work of the past decade and provide new resources that will launch a new wave of discovery and transformation.</p>
<p>The new funding will also be used to continue a scholar program supporting young faculty members establishing careers, expand ACTRI’s “Game Center,” a program that uses virtual reality games to train investigators in team science and create new mentoring programs in grant-writing, the financial lifeblood of research.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,400 ongoing clinical trials at UC San Diego Health, involving an estimated 7,000 participants in active treatment. Approximately 250 new trials begin each year, including most recently COVID-19-related trials investigating an antiviral drug, an arthritis drug and a medication for hypertension.</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO PARTICIPATE IN MAY 6 MUSIC FEST</p>
<p>San Diego International Airport will join more than 20 airports from across North America for the JetStream Music Festival, an online celebration of local music. Hosted by Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Austin, Texas, the free, multi-hour livestream will take place at 3 p.m. on May 6 on San Diego International Airport’s Facebook Live.</p>
<p>Each airport will feature a musician local to their city in support of the creative community during the COVID-19 crisis. San Diego will feature Nico Hueso, a San Diego polyglot and frequent SAN Arts Program performance artist. Hueso is a classically trained violist who has performed around the world in symphony orchestras, music festivals and master classes. He will perform a 10-minute set which will include original music.</p>
<p>“San Diego International Airport is excited to join other airports around the nation to showcase the arts in this innovative and collaborative way,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “While many people may not be visiting our terminals during this time, participation in JetStream provides us another outlet to foster positive relationships and support the community through the arts.”</p>
<p>SAN started the Arts Program in 2002 with a mission to surprise and delight travelers with presentations of the highest caliber, and to showcase San Diego’s rich cultural community. Within the terminals, the Arts Program includes visual arts, performing arts, film, and more.</p>

<p>MAYOR URGES SAN DIEGANS TO CONTINUE TO USE BEACHES RESPONSIBLY</p>
<p>Eyeing a sunny weekend forecast, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 1 joined with San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit and Parks and Recreation Department director Andy Field to remind San Diegans of what City resources are now open, and that physical distancing and face-covering mandates continue to be in effect.</p>
<p>What can and can’t be done under the new rules:</p>
<p>BEACHES</p>
<p>On the sand:</p>
<p>Run and walk.</p>
<p>No stopping, sitting, lying down.</p>
<p>In the ocean you can:</p>
<p>Swim.</p>
<p>Surf.</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>And kayak.</p>
<p>In the bays you can:</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>Kayak.</p>
<p>Boating.</p>
<p>No swimming.</p>
<p>NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS</p>
<p>Parks are open for passive use.</p>
<p>Walking.</p>
<p>Jogging.</p>
<p>Hiking.</p>
<p>Sitting with your family.</p>
<p>Parking lots remain closed.</p>
<p>GOLF COURSES</p>
<p>City of San Diego golf courses reopened with physical distancing and face-covering mandates.</p>
<p>FACIAL COVERINGS NOW REQUIRED AT AIRPORT</p>
<p>Per the California Health and Safety Code sections 101040, 120175, and 120175.5 (b), facial coverings are now required at San Diego International Airport (SAN) for all passengers, visitors, tenants, contractors, and employees while on airport property. The mandate is to help curb the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>As stated by the County of San Diego Health Officer, persons with a medical or mental health condition, or developmental disability that prevents wearing a face covering, shall be exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Public Health, a cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>
<p>The airport has placed red tape markings on floors at security checkpoints, airline ticket counters, and concession areas to adhere to six-foot social distancing rules. All airport users are also encouraged to comply with social distancing requirements and follow CDC guidelines to stop the spread of germs which include washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>“SAN’s top priority is the health and safety of all airport users,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “We’ve taken many steps to help curb the spread of COVID-19 and appreciate all airport users adhering to the local and state health orders.”</p>
<p>SDIA offers nonstop service to more than 70 destinations in the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. In operation since 1928, the airport celebrated more than 90 years of service to the San Diego region in 2018. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has managed the airport since 2003. The Airport Authority plans for and provides air transportation services to the region with safe, effective facilities that exceed customer expectations. For more information, visit san.org.</p>
<p>AMTRAK CELEBRATES 49TH ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>Today, Amtrak celebrated its 49th anniversary. For almost five decades, Amtrak has taken U.S. passenger rail customers where they need and want to go. Formally known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak consolidated the services of more than a dozen railroads into a truly national system when it first started. And, while observing this anniversary during an unprecedented time in history, Amtrack continues to provide a vital service to its customers, many of whom are medical professionals and first responders.</p>

<p>CONGRESSMAN PETERS SIGNS LETTER URGING GREATER MENTAL HEALTH, SUICIDE PREVENTION, DURING PANDEMIC</p>
<p>On May 1, Rep. Scott Peters joined 49 of his colleagues in sending a letter to House leadership urging for increased support prioritizing the mental health of the American public during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The bipartisan group of lawmakers requested greater investment in mental health resources and suicide prevention efforts given the unprecedented public health crisis and growing cases of economic insecurity – two stressors linked to mental health challenges and heightened risk of suicide.</p>
<p>The letter advocated for the incorporation of critical provisions in future coronavirus response and recovery packages. This would help address the mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, like enhanced funding for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and inclusion of the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act, which would assist emergency departments to develop better suicide risk protocols.</p>
<p>“We must support our nation’s system of crisis response services, fortify our emergency departments to adequately respond to self-harm, and prepare schools to address the mental health needs of children upon their return in the fall,” the legislators wrote.</p>
<p>MAY IS BICYCLE SAFETY MONTH</p>
<p>For bicycle safety month, Circulate San Diego is encouraging people walking, driving, or riding their bikes to look out for one another while practicing social-distancing.</p>
<p>While shelter-in-place orders are in effect, San Diegans still need to get to essential jobs, run errands, or go outside to exercise. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer unveiled his slow streets initiative this week to make it easier for San Diegans to travel safely while social distancing.</p>
<p>Faulconer’s slow streets initiative includes closing segments of Diamond Street, Adams Avenue, and Howard Street to through vehicular traffic to allow for social distancing for people walking and bicycling. He also announced improvements to pedestrian crosswalk buttons and the re-opening of state Route 56 Bikeway, Rose Creek Bikeway, Rose Canyon Bikeway and the state Route 52 Bikeway.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, San Diegans are finding that bicycling is a great way to travel to an essential job, to access essential needs, and exercise,” Maya Rosas, director of policy at Circulate San Diego said. “It’s important for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians to keep you and your family safe by remaining aware of your surroundings even though there is less vehicular traffic.”</p>
<p>Circulate San Diego has created a webpage with bike-friendly resources to encourage residents to get out and bike, safely and comfortably at circulatesd.org/may_is_bike_month.</p>

<p>A round-up of news, community, and business briefs from sdnews.com highlighting what’s happening in our community.</p>
<p>Saturday, May 30</p>
<p>BEACHES OPEN FOR SITTING JUNE 2</p>
<p>Starting June 2, people will be allowed to sit and lounge at local beaches provided they maintain physical distancing or wear a face covering when close to others, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced.</p>
<p>Sitting on the beach will be allowed for sunbathing and relaxing with towels and chairs if you do it with people in your own household. However, no activities such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Also, all piers and parking lots will remain closed.</p>
<p>All beach communities agreed to ease this restriction starting June 2, but cities can decide if they want to proceed later and how the guideline is going to be enforced.</p>
<p>BLENDERS EYEWEAR PROVIDES SUNGLASSES</p>
<p>Pacific Beach-based Blenders Eyewear will outfit more than 300 FedEx Express workers across the county, offering workers one of five select sunglasses. The Blenders Eyewear team donates sunglasses to the region’s 300-plus FedEx Express workers to thank them for their continued support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>After re-purposing its production to create and then donate 10,000 safety goggles to Southern California hospitals, plus 20,000 pairs to Direct Relief – in addition to a month-long fundraiser for the international aid organization – Blenders wanted to do more to help those at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, visit BlendersEyewear.com.</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT UPDATE</p>
<p>The San Diego Workforce Partnership releases a weekly email update to serve as a one-stop-shop on employment figures and analysis specific to our region’s workforce in regards to impacts associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>488 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10 (up from 482 last week).</p>
<p>73,617 total reported employees affected since March 10 (up from 72,446 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,692 in the hospitality and restaurant and bar industries. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership, although the full impact to employees and the region’s economy is still unknown.</p>
<p>260 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: New unemployment claims in California have held steady at a little over 200,000 for the last three weeks. For context, that’s about twice the pre-COVID-19 record. San Diego County’s official unemployment rate was the highest ever recorded last month at 15%, and we believe the current rate is higher, as about 40% of unemployment claims made since the onset of COVID-19 were submitted after April 12, when unemployment was last measured.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORS PROPOSE EVICTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION</p>
<p>Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Greg Cox, co-chairs of the County’s COVID-19 Subcommittee, are proposing the County of San Diego extend its moratorium on evictions for both residents and small businesses for one additional month. The Board of Supervisors will vote on the policy extension Tuesday, June 2.</p>
<p>“We are proposing extending San Diego County’s eviction moratorium for residents and small businesses through June 30th,” said Cox and Fletcher in a statement. “Our region is slowly recovering from the severe economic damage caused by the pandemic. Although more businesses are reopening, it is going to take time for merchants and their employees who have been out of work to rebuild their bank accounts enough to pay their rent. This will give residential and commercial renters more time to get back on their feet. But we are encouraging renters to pay as much rent as they can and set-up a payment program with their landlords.”</p>
<p>The original moratorium policy and resolution is set to expire Sunday, May 31. This moratorium extension only affects the unincorporated areas. If the extension is passed by supervisors, the resolution will continue to ensure protections provided retroactively to March 4, when Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency.</p>
<p>UC SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE VIRTUAL COMMENCEMENT</p>
<p>The university will host a virtual commencement for its School of Medicine Sunday, May 31 at 10 a.m. which can be viewed at medschool.ucsd.edu/Commencement2020. Keynote commencement speaker will be Mona Hanna-Attisha, MD, the pediatrician, scientist and activist who discovered high levels of lead in the blood of children living in Flint, Mich. and led efforts to publicize and address the source, a contaminated local water supply.</p>
<p>Approximately 132 graduates will receive their medical degrees. Of those, 11 will also receive Masters of Advanced Studies and six will also receive PhDs. The majority of these newly minted doctors will move on to residency programs in 26 different states and almost every specialty, such as emergency medicine, psychiatry.</p>
<p>ROCK THRIFT STORE REOPENED</p>
<p>The Rock Thrift Store at 3603 Camino Del Rio has reopened its doors after weeks of being closed due to COVID-19 by State and County regulations for non-essential businesses. Rock Thrift will be open to the public daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Patrons can shop or drop donations off. Everyone will be asked to abide by County regulations in order to keep the store, staff and customers safe. This includes wearing a mask, keeping six feet apart and following signage posted.</p>
<p>“I’m most excited to reopen Rock Thrift so we can go back to engaging and serving more of the community and spreading the love and hope of Christ,” said Brenda Swain, store manager.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional retail aspect of the store, the Rock Thrift Store also provides vouchers to individuals and families in need, through first responders, that may have been evacuated due to a fire, domestic violence and other crises. In a time where COVID-19 has created a multitude of needs for individuals and families across San Diego, the Rock Thrift store is eager to have it’s doors open to exchange those vouchers for much-needed clothing and household items. For store hours, donation guidelines and more information, visit rockthriftstore.com</p>
<p>URGENT NEED FOR BLOOD DONATIONS</p>
<p>The American Red Cross has an urgent need for blood donations to prevent another blood shortage as hospitals resume surgical procedures and patient treatments that were temporarily paused earlier this spring in response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Healthy individuals who are feeling well are asked to make an appointment to donate in the weeks and months ahead by downloading the free Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any Alexa Echo device.</p>

<p>In a continued effort to sustain residents impacted by feelings of loneliness and isolation during the COVID-19 stay-at-home order, the City of San Diego has expanded its AgeWell Social Calls Program to offer comfort to San Diegans of all ages, including those who only speak Spanish.</p>
<p>“The AgeWell Social Calls Program already offers invaluable comfort to seniors ages 55 and older,” said volunteer, internship and work readiness program manager Kristina Fraijo. “Now, thanks to our expanded program, younger residents and members of our Spanish-speaking communities will also be able to benefit from compassionate, live conversations on a weekly basis.”</p>

<p>Curry said an artist, Rob Tobin, has been chosen for the project. “His specialty is community art, which is ideal for this project as we want the entire PB community involved in the beautification of our rec center,” said Curry urging people to observe examples of Tobin’s art at artistrobtobin.com.</p>

<p>U.S. REP. PETERS URGES RESTRAINT IN REOPENING</p>
<p>Congressman Scott Peters (CA-52), who recently heard from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and a key member of the Trump Administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, issued the following statement after a conference call organized for members of the New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>“Many states across the country began to expand their plans to re-open over Memorial Day weekend. With every state creating their own timeline and guidance, I asked Dr. Fauci about the spectrum of criteria being used by states, and what steps can be taken in places where the virus is still strongly present,” continued Peters of Fauci, “He explained that ‘hot spot’ areas like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago and other places where the number of cases continues to climb need to exercise extra-special caution as they look to re-open. He emphasized that phases in re-opening are crucial and should be used gradually instead of allowing all preventative practices to slide away at once. He also doubled down on the importance of everyone wearing a face covering when out to prevent the virus from spreading, and underscored that those who know they’ve been exposed must quarantine and get tested.”</p>
<p>Fauci also filled in lawmakers on various national COVID-19 treatment developments, including the progress being made in vaccine research and production. According to the NIAID director, the rollout of a vaccine is expected to come sometime between late summer and early winter 2021, with a goal to have enough doses for everyone.</p>
<p>Peters serves the 52nd District of California, which covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chairman.</p>

<p>The principal said students will receive all of their class of 2020 items (cap, gown, honor cords, IB Sash, 2020 yard sign, and more). “We will also be collecting any MBHS school items the kids have,” he said. “After dropping off, the kids and families will drive down Lee Street to a senior celebration, to include a DJ, party lighting, congratulations signs, MBHS staff waving to students, images of students projected throughout, and more.”</p>
<p>Added Remillard, “Students and families will need to remain in their cars throughout the event. We have encouraged students/families to decorate their cars for the event. We will be videoing the evening. Then on June 9, a video with student images and footage from the night will be posted on our website, district website, and social media platform. This will be a class of 2020 recognition.”</p>

<p>DIAPER DRIVES FOR NEEDY FAMILIES</p>
<p>Miracle Babies, a nonprofit organization that supports families with critically ill babies in local neonatal intensive care units, is hosting a series of diaper drive-through events for local families.</p>
<p>The diaper donations will be open to all San Diego families in need during this difficult time. Parents will be asked to display diaper size needed on their dashboard as they drive into the parking lot to limit contact. If families currently have a baby in the NICU, parents can write “NICU NOW” on their dashboard for a care package. Diapers will be loaded directly into families’ vehicle for a no-contact experience.</p>
<p>“After seeing how many families turned out for our first diaper drive donation, we knew we had to make this a re-occurring event,” said Marianela Camarillo, chief operations officer of Miracle Babies. “We saw firsthand how many families are in need of diapers, so we decided to host a series of diaper drive-through events throughout San Diego County as a way to support parents during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>The diaper drive-throughs will provide registered parents with diapers and Miracle Babies will hold events throughout the county. Upcoming events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saturday, May 23 from 10 a.m. to noon at the National City Library, 1401 National City Blvd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday, May 31 from 10 a.m. to noon at Scripps Health Campus, 10140 Campus Point Ct. These events require participants to register, email [email protected] to sign up or volunteer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CITY LIBRARIES BEGIN CONTACT-FREE PICKUP</p>
<p>Starting May 26, San Diegans can pick up items on hold at 11 library locations during limited hours. The pickup service will restore access to 2.9 million physical materials in the San Diego Public Library’s collection to library patrons for the first time since libraries were closed in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also prioritizes the health and safety of patrons and employees, while allowing San Diegans to pick up materials at designated locations.</p>
<p>“We’re flattening the curve, and as San Diegans continue to do the right thing we will expand and restore neighborhood services in a safe and responsible way,” said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. “We know San Diegans love and miss their libraries, so we’re excited to offer contact-free pickup to provide access to millions of books and other materials while implementing safeguards to protect employees and patrons.”</p>
<p>Starting May 26, pickup service will be available Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at the following locations: Carmel Valley, College-Rolando, La Jolla/Riford, Logan Heights, Mira Mesa, Mission Hills-Hillcrest/Knox, Mission Valley, Point Loma/Hervey, Rancho Bernardo, San Ysidro and Valencia Park/Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Patrons with existing holds will be notified by email when their materials are available. The San Diego Public Library will begin accepting new holds for pickup on June 1.</p>
<p>“The pickup service is an important first step in the library’s return to full service,” said library director Misty Jones. “While our libraries have been physically closed, patrons have been using our online resources in record numbers. However, we’ve heard from many people who prefer physical books, and this pickup service allows them to access some of the resources they’ve been missing.”</p>
<p>Patrons will need to present a valid library card or library card number to pick up their materials. Library facilities will not be open to the public and will not accept returns at this time. Due dates on items currently checked out have been extended to June 12.</p>
<p>JUNGLE JAVA IN OB CLOSING</p>
<p>“We are so happy and proud that we could keep Jungle Java going for a few more years,” said the coffee shop’s operator for the past three years, Danielle Hargis. “It’s a lovely place that has many memories thanks to the amazing people that worked there threw the years and the wonderful people who came to enjoy the sun, the plants and the tasty treats. Thank you so very much. Be safe. Be well.”</p>
<p>Concerning why she’s closing Hargis said: “It was a mix of a lot of things. It was hard to keep social distancing in a place where people gather. I don’t know how to reopen when people can’t socialize.”</p>
<p>Hargis added she was uncertain she could keep the coffee and plant shop at 5047 Newport Ave. on an even keel financially. “I didn’t think I’d have the numbers to keep the place open,” she said. “Also, my lease is up. It was just a business move.”</p>
<p>Jungle Java has a mobile cart food license and has been selling smoothies along with teas, coffees, and plants. Asked what she’ll do now, Hargis replied, “I’m taking a break. I don’t know if I’ll be successful in getting a job in my industry. Hopefully, I’ll stick with small-business, hopefully, work with agriculture.”</p>
<p>GASLAMP QUARTER BLOOMING WITH MURALS</p>
<p>Several Gaslamp businesses that temporarily shuttered in light of the stay-at-home order covered their windows with plywood during the shutdown. Now, as the neighborhood begins to reopen, flowers have begun to bloom on the boarded-up shops.</p>
<p>“As city lights have dimmed worldwide, these murals offer a sense of brightness for the Gaslamp and surrounding neighborhoods,” said Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter Association.</p>
<p>The pop-up urban art installation is the brainchild of Sean Warner, the Downtown San Diego Partnership’s director of placemaking. Warner hired local artists — including PANDR, Ladies Who Paint, Elliot Shuessler and Visual Gallery + Design — to create compelling images of hope, resilience and strength for storefronts in the Gaslamp, Quarter, the Downtown Core and East Village.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL SUMMER SCHOOL AT LA JOLLA HIGH</p>
<p>LJHS announced that summer school this year will go from Monday, June 22 to Thursday, July 31.</p>
<p>Summer School for 2020 will be taking place virtually using district-issued Chromebooks and Edgenuity online courses. Students will complete all work at home and will not be reporting to a school site.</p>
<p>Counselors have already pre-enrolled any students into summer school who currently have an “F” this semester, or have an “F” on their transcript. A summer school online registration and opt-out form will be sent to all enrolled students after May 25.</p>
<p>If a student does not have a district-issued computer, they may go to Clairemont, Hoover, Lincoln, or San Diego high schools from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Device Exchange and Distribution Centers at those schools. Any district student or family member may go to the center closest to their house to receive a new device or exchange a broken device. If your child would like to remediate a “D” grade, have them contact their counselor by Wednesday, May 27.</p>
<p>LJ COAST WALK TRAIL REPAIRS FUNDED</p>
<p>“With all your help and generous contributions, Friends of Coast Walk Trail has raised enough funds to complete the needed trail repairs starting Monday, June 1,” said Brenda Fake, neighborhood nonprofit spokesperson. “To safely complete these repairs and mitigate cost overruns, the trail will be partially closed for pedestrian/bike traffic starting:</p>
<p>June 1-5 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Cave Store to Prospect Bench just above the bridge;</p>
<p>June 8-12 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Prospect Bench to Coast Walk parking.</p>
<p>To help with community communication and outreach Friends of Coast Walk Trail is seeking trail ambassador volunteers to assist in redirecting pedestrians and providing project information during the day when repairs are being done.</p>
<p>The expected volunteer time commitment would be in 2- or 4- hour shifts to sit at one of two ends of the trail repair area. During this time, trail ambassadors will redirect pedestrians/bike traffic to an alternative entrance to the trail as well as a great opportunity to inform the public about the project. Friends of Coast Walk Trail will provide a comfortable chair, water, safety vest, masks, and information about the repair project.</p>
<p>“This a great opportunity to make a difference and support our local community with this project. Plus it’s a chance to meet other like-minded people,” said Fake. “We will be outlining appropriate social distancing guidelines and ask each volunteer to please wear a mask.” To volunteer, no later than May 30 at 5 p.m., email [email protected].</p>
<p>ONLINE COMMEMORATION FOR MEMORIAL DAY</p>
<p>The USS Midway Museum, Mt. Soledad National Memorial and Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Foundations, will all be holding Memorial Day differently this year due to the ongoing pandemic. Each location will hold approximately 15-minute commemorations that will be streamed live on Memorial Day from 9 to 10 a.m. at sandiegomemorialdaylive.com. The simulcast will flow from Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery to the Mt. Soledad National Memorial to the Miramar National Cemetery to the USS Midway Museum and briefly back to the Miramar National Cemetery for the conclusion. Public spectators will not be permitted at any of the commemoration locations.</p>
<p>“The importance of ensuring public health in the fight again Covid-19 will prevent normal Memorial Day commemorations from being held around San Diego this year,” said David Koontz, Midway Museum marketing director. “However, it is important to continue to honor those who have given their lives in service to the nation as members of the U.S. Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>Added Koontz,” Not only will this simulcast honor those military members who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, but it will also express appreciation to those front line heroes of today in the battle against the coronavirus.”</p>

<p>LA JOLLA ART &amp; WINE FESTIVAL CANCELED</p>
<p>The La Jolla Art &amp; Wine Festival has spent the last several weeks monitoring the current situations and conferring with public health officials, and while it is still unclear what our new normal will be for this coming fall, it has been decided the LJAWF will be postponed to 2021.</p>
<p>While this decision was not easily made, it is the responsibility of the LJAWF to be good stewards to our local schools and its fundraising mission for them, said organizers. With the amount of uncertainty for the future and a thorough analysis of our planning timeline, the best efforts of the LJAWF team should now be spent on the 2021 event, promoters said.</p>

<p>MAY IS SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH</p>
<p>Now is the perfect time to talk about the latest innovations happening around the world’s most common cancer. Mattew Hangauer, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology School of Medicine at UC San Diego, has received $50,000 from The Skin Cancer Foundation, provided by the Ashley Trenner Research Grant Award, for his project “Targeting Immunotherapy-Tolerant Melanoma Persister Cells.”</p>
<p>Hangauer’s research focuses on how tumor cells evade cancer therapies, with a primary focus on melanoma. He aims to specifically understand how residual melanoma cells survive immunotherapy, and how those cells can be therapeutically targeted, in hopes of preventing any relapses. Little has been known about this area of research thus far and he hopes to increase the number of advanced melanoma patients who experience long-lasting responses to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>This spring, The Skin Cancer Foundation has been awarded a combined total of $125,000 in grants to three researchers. The funds encourage innovation in prevention, early detection and treatment of skin cancer. The Foundation’s Research Grants program has helped young doctors and investigators with funding for studies that have led to lifesaving breakthroughs. Hangauer’s project is made possible due to funding provided by Karen and Bob Trenner.</p>

<p>MTS APPOINTS FEMALE CEO</p>
<p>The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System board of directors has appointed the organization&rsquo;s first female CEO, in the wake of the sudden death last weekend of former CEO Paul Jablonski. Sharon Cooney, whose appointment was unanimously approved by the MTS board, takes over after holding a variety of high-level posts at the transit agency including deputy CEO, director of government affairs, director of planning and chief of staff.</p>
<p>“I am honored that the board expressed confidence in me,” Cooney said. “I think the board also understands that Mr. Jablonski assembled one of the best staffs in the entire country. I am lucky to have been mentored by one of the nation&rsquo;s most respected transit leaders and to have a group of professionals that are absolutely dedicated to advancing public transit in San Diego. We are all ready to take on the challenges today and into the future.”</p>
<p>Jablonski died at age 67 and had a transit career spanning four decades. He had worked at the MTS for 16 years.</p>
<p>WOMEN’S APPAREL RETAILER SUES STATE</p>
<p>San Diego’s largest family of designer consignment shops, My Sister&rsquo;s Closet, My Sister&rsquo;s Attic and Well Suited, will pursue legal action against the State of California after losing more than $1.5 million due to closures in Arizona and California. Owner and founder Ann Siner, who has a store location in the Costa Verde Center at 8610 Genesee Ave. in La Jolla, claims her shops have been the target of harassment by police officers who recently walked into one of her stores not wearing masks demanding her stores be shut down, with the only option being selling her merchandise curbside.</p>
<p>Siner said she has since brought several racks of clothing outside the store hoping it will attract customers, but that business model just doesn’t work. “How do you sell clothing, accessories, furniture, art, jewelry, handbags at the curb?” asked Siner. “It doesn’t work, but yet it’s okay for hundreds of shoppers to pour inside packed Target, Walmart, Home Depot, and other big-box stores by the hour. They are killing small businesses in California and they just don’t care.”</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT</p>

<p>470 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10, 2020 (up from 449 last week)</p>
<p>68,537 total reported employees affected (up from 67,379 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,391 in the Hospitality and Restaurant &amp; Bar sectors. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership. The full impact to employees and the region’s economy is higher as not all employers submit WARN notices.</p>
<p>215 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: California unemployment insurance claims fell by a third last week, to 214,028. This is still 85% above the pre-COVID record and four times the past decade’s average weekly claims, but the decrease is welcome, and we hope to see it continue this week and next as counties across the state enter Phase 2 of the reopening plan.</p>

<p>CITY LAUNCHES BETTER BY BIKE EFFORT</p>
<p>To celebrate National Bike Month in May and to highlight work to improve bicycling infrastructure, the City of San Diego is launching Better By Bike, an outreach and education effort aimed at encouraging more residents to consider commuting by bicycle. The City’s Climate Action Plan calls for an increase in commuter bicycling opportunities, especially in communities near major transit stops.</p>
<p>During May, the City is teaming up with the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition for the Love to Ride 25-day bicycling challenge, with events like the Family Week ride and New Cyclist Week.</p>
<p>People are urged to ride solo or with family members to comply with physical distancing guidelines; indoor rides on stationary bikes are also counted toward participation. Prize drawings will be held each week of the challenge.</p>
<p>“With so many San Diegans staying home to help stop the spread of Covid-19, more people are also hopping on their bikes for exercise and to run essential errands, or just to feel connected while maintaining distance,” said chief sustainability officer Cody Hooven. “We hope this becomes a new habit for people as they realize you don’t need to be an athlete or expert cyclist to commute by bicycle. For your health and the health of our environment, it really is better to go by bike when you can.”</p>
<p>According to Caltrans, traffic volume on roads statewide is down an average of 35% compared to this time last year. Meanwhile, bicycling is up 55% over expected volumes during the first week of May in cities across the southwestern part of the United States, according to data posted by Eco-Counter.</p>
<p>Last month, in response to requests from residents, commuter bikeways within city limits were reopened, including the State Route 56 bikeway and the San Diego River bikeway connecting Mission Valley and Ocean Beach. The City recently launched a Slow Streets program to allow more space for residents who are walking or bicycling in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To sign up for the Love to Ride 25-day challenge, visit lovetoride.net/sandiegocounty. Participants who sign up and log their rides online may be eligible for prizes, including new Brooklyn Bicycle cruiser, cycling gear and more. Share photos of your ride on social media using the hashtag #BetterByBike. Learn more about the City’s bicycling program by visiting sandiego.gov/bicycling.</p>

<p>CITY REPAVING ONE OF ITS BUSIEST STREETS</p>
<p>Taking advantage of reduced traffic due to the pandemic, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 12 ordered the repaving of the main stretch of North Harbor Drive leading to the San Diego International Airport – one of the busiest streets in the City. Faulconer was joined this morning by City Council member Mark Kersey, chair of the Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, to announce the project.</p>
<p>“First impressions are important, and the first thing most people see when they come to San Diego is the bumpy ride as they leave the San Diego International Airport,” Faulconer said. “This stretch of road is so busy that there’s never really a convenient time to make repairs, so we’re taking advantage of the reduced traffic from the statewide stay-at-home order to overhaul and improve this major thoroughfare for the first time in two decades.”</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the City began repaving 3.3 miles along North Harbor Drive between Ash Street to Nimitz Boulevard in both directions. In addition, the project includes buffered bike lanes through striping modifications. Traffic along North Harbor Drive has been reduced by 50 percent as a result of COVID-19. The paving project is expected to be completed in three weeks.</p>
<p>“During this crisis, San Diego International Airport has remained open as a critical piece of the nation’s transportation infrastructure,” said Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “And Harbor Drive is a critical artery helping people get to and from the airport. So we’re excited to see the City moving forward with plans to rehabilitate this roadway.”</p>
<p>REP. PETERS WORKING VIRTUALLY</p>
<p>Congressman Peters continues to work via teleconferencing for California’s 52nd district carrying out his legislative duties remotely while following public health guidance.</p>
<p>“The way we keep people safe and get our economy moving again is through testing, tracing, and treatment,&rdquo; said Peters.“Hearing from the Federal Trade Commission gave us important information to consider as we construct and coordinate innovative systems to allow for safe re-opening.</p>
<p>“While technology can be used to bolster testing and contact tracing efforts, we must work diligently with the tech community to monitor the rollout of any tools aimed at helping track the spread of the virus,” continued Peters. “Regulations will need to be implemented to prevent the abuse of any personal data gathered, and the public’s vigilance will be critical in protecting individuals’ sensitive information online. We should utilize technology in a way that helps our cause in preventing spread, but that doesn’t exploit Americans’ right to privacy, too.”</p>
<p>Added Peters: “According to public health experts, we are going to need $46.5 billion to get adequate testing up and running, with an additional 180,000 people to expand the contact tracing workforce. Robust testing, in tandem with proper contact tracing, will be essential to re-open the economy, and appropriately applied technology will be an important tool to help us do just that.”</p>
<p>The 52nd District of California covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chair.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA ON-RAMP CLOSURES POSTPONED</p>

<p>CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE CONSIDERS NOVEMBER BALLOT PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The City Council’s Rules Committee tomorrow will discuss 17 proposed measures and decide which of them merit further consideration for placement on the November 2020 ballot. Nine of the measures were submitted by individual San Diegans, four by local advocacy groups, and four by City officials, including Council members, the City Attorney, the City Auditor, and the Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The ideas include removing the coastal height limit in the Sports Arena area, implementing ranked-choice voting in San Diego’s general elections, and updating the City’s contracting policies to remain eligible for state grant funding.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many ideas coming from engaged members of our community,” Council president and Rules Committee chair Georgette Gómez said. “I look forward to discussing these proposals with my committee colleagues, and also hearing from the public which ones should be advanced to the ballot.”</p>
<p>Those measures that the committee advances for additional analysis will return to the Rules Committee to be considered for review by the full City Council.</p>

<p>PLHS GRAD IS A DUAL STUDENT-ATHLETE</p>
<p>Being a full-time student, playing a sport, and working is already hard enough. Imagine attending two colleges and being a full-time student at both. That’s a total of 24 units in a semester while playing a sport, and working on top of that. You have to be extremely disciplined and dedicated to being a dual athlete.</p>
<p>Savannah Ames is a dual student-athlete on San Diego Mesa College’s softball team. Ames, a Point Loma High School alumni, attends both San Diego Mesa College and Point Loma Nazarene University. Ames majors in communications and plans on graduating from PLNU in the fall of 2020. She carries a GPA over 3.0 at both colleges, PLNU 3.4 GPA, and Mesa 3.8 GPA.</p>
<p>UNCLAIMED MONEY AT CITY OF SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>Anyone who has done business with the City of San Diego in the past three years, including paying business taxes, could be owed money. Check amounts range from $1 to $22,000. The City regularly receives returned checks that are undeliverable based on the address on file. Checks that remain uncashed after six months become unclaimed monies.</p>
<p>The unclaimed monies report is available at sandiego.gov/finance/unclaimed and is updated quarterly. There is no charge to search the data or to file a claim. Since this time last year, the City returned $368,000 to 119 recipients who were listed on the unclaimed monies report, meaning 29% of the unclaimed monies were returned by the City. The average claim was $3,091.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 1,700 accounts with more than $660,000 in unclaimed monies belonging to people or businesses that have not received money owed to them because of refunds or vendor payments. Payees have approximately one year to claim their money after it’s been added to the unclaimed monies report. The last day to submit a claim for checks issued prior to April 1, 2019, is Thursday, June 18. To submit a claim, print and complete the Request for Unclaimed Monies form.</p>
<p>NEW POP-UP BRUNCH AT OB EATERY</p>
<p>A just-launched pop-up eatery has brought a new take-out brunch option to Ob. Called Loco Lopez and run by chef Richard Lopez, is operating Wednesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. out of the same Sunset Cliffs Boulevard space as Sundara Indian Kitchen, which has remained open throughout this shelter-at-home phase. With restaurants likely limited in their reopening capacity, Sundara co-founder Adam Lowe said the 38-seat eatery will likely continue to focus on its take-out business even after the dine-in ban is lifted.</p>
<p>Lowe approached Lopez with the offer to share the kitchen. The chef previously worked at Sundara, and has cooked in fine-dining restaurants as well as local hotels like the Hotel del Coronado.</p>
<p>Seeing a void in the to-go brunch market, Lopez created a menu of takeout-friendly dishes that includes a breakfast burrito wrapped in a cheese-crusted tortilla, a doughnut grilled cheese served with serrano jam, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs accompanied by house chips.</p>
<p>Though it’s starting as a pop-up, the chef says he’s hoping to make Loco Lopez permanent, either in the Sundara space or elsewhere. He’ll continue to expand the menu and is planning to eventually offer mimosas, micheladas, beer, and wine.</p>

<p>NEEDY FAMILIES TO RECEIVE FOOD FROM UNION VOLUNTEERS</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego in partnership with the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, will host mass “drive-through” food distributions for San Diego families and seniors in need at SDCCU Stadium (formerly Qualcomm) every Saturday in May from 9 a.m. until all of the food is gone.

The distribution is first-come, first-served for 1,100 vehicles starting at 9 a.m. on May 16, 23 and 30. The San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council is a community of more than 200,000 working families standing together.</p>
<p>SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARN LESS STATE FUNDS WOULD CAUSE ‘HARM’</p>
<p>San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten and Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner issued a joint statement in response to the Department of Finance’s preliminary estimates on the California State budget and the need for federal relief:</p>
<p>“A 20 percent reduction in state funds to public education, which would be about $2,700 less per student, would cause irreparable harm to children,” the superintendents said. “California already spends significantly less on public education than other large states. Moreover, reopening school facilities in a safe manner this fall will also require more funding.</p>
<p>“Our efforts to enhance the quality of distance learning and provide a safety net to students and families during this public health crisis have been comprehensive and responsive to student’s needs,” continued their joint release. “With approximately 240,000 devices and close to 18 million meals provided in Los Angeles and San Diego, the immediate challenges posed by Covid-19 have significantly increased costs for our schools.”</p>
<p>Noted both superintendents: “Implicit in every budget are a series of choices, which are made more difficult when the dollars are scarce. But they are still choices that elected officials in Sacramento must make and the consequences will have an impact on an entire generation of children. This generation has a right to an education, and a 20% reduction in state school spending would deny students this right. Simply put, that level of spending reduction would make it impossible for schools to safely reopen this fall.”</p>
<p>Friday, May 8</p>
<p>DUCK DIVE, CITY TACOS, REOPENING IN PACIFIC BEACH</p>

<p>GARNET BUILDING IN PB SELLS FOR NEARLY $2 MILLION</p>
<p>A prominent freestanding 4,500-square-foot building that has a John Lennon mural painted on the side across from Chase Bank at 1020 Garnet Ave. in Pacific Beach was sold for $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Brian Pyke and Allison Campbell of Retail Insite represented the seller and buyer. The seller is Tanya Blane and the buyer has requested anonymity. The new owner has plans to reposition this building currently occupied by Five Guys.</p>
<p>“Pacific Beach continues to evolve as a dynamic neighborhood and ideal location for investors in San Diego. Coastal pockets have historically been able to weather downturns better than other submarkets, and I think PB will continue to be a great area to invest in,” said Pyke.</p>
<p>The sale adds to a steady increase of activity in the PB area for Pyke and Campbell. Over the past year, the team secured leases with F45 at 1245 Garnet Ave., Fritzy’s Roller Skate Shop at The Promenade at Pacific Beach; sourced new leases with Yoga Box, PB Training, and San Diego Sliders Co. at 909 Grand Ave.; and advised retail client QWENCH Juice Bar on its first San Diego location at 4462 Mission Blvd.</p>

<p>WHAT’S RED TIDE AND WHY DOES IT SMELL?</p>
<p>Bioluminescence expert Michael Latz, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said the current red tide, which stretches from Baja California to Los Angeles, is due to aggregations of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra, a species well known for its bioluminescent displays. Each microscopic cell contains some “sunscreen,” giving it a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>On sunny days, the organisms swim toward the surface where they concentrate, resulting in the intensified coloration of the water – and the reason for the term &ldquo;red tide.&rdquo; At night, when the phytoplankton are agitated by waves or other movement in the water, they emit a dazzling neon blue glow.</p>
<p>The ocean along San Diego County is still brown in color, but now the sulfury odor is intense. The strong odor has reached about 1 ½ miles inland. There is also foam, indicating the breakdown of protein and other organic material. There are also reports of fish kills along beaches and in lagoons and harbors. The breakdown of the red tide by microbes results in low oxygen conditions that are deleterious to some animals.</p>
<p>Is the water safe for surfing/swimming? In some areas such as the Mediterranean, Lingulodinium polyedra produces yessotoxin, a compound that acts as a neurotoxin, but local populations do not produce yessotoxin. However, some people are sensitive to inhaling air associated with the red tide, so the organisms must be producing other compounds that can affect human health. In general, during a red tide, there is lots of dissolved and particulate matter in the water with associated enhanced microbial activity. It is a personal choice whether to go in the water, but there is no public health warning associated with the red tide.</p>

We know that many San Diego families are suffering right now because of the shutdown, and we wanted to help ensure that they can access the food they need. We have partnered with the San Diego Food Bank for many years and we are proud to support their extraordinary response to this pandemic,” said Barry La Forgia, International Relief Teams’ executive director.</p>
<p>ILLUMINA DONATES $1 MILLION TO SD SCHOOLS, FRONTLINE WORKERS</p>
<p>The Illumina Corporate Foundation has directed the $1 million gift to The San Diego Foundation COVID-19 Community Fund, which was created to provide resources to low-income workers, families and vulnerable communities most affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Illumina’s donation directs $700,000 to the San Diego Unified School District to help K-12 distance learning and $300,000 to support frontline healthcare workers, food security and small business programs. The COVID-19 Community Response Fund has raised over $10.8 million.</p>
<p>“We are proud to call San Diego home and are dedicated to supporting impactful relief efforts in our hometown. From individuals to communities, from companies to countries, we are finding ways to support each other and address the pandemic together,” said Sam Samad, senior vice president/CFO of Illumina. “One of the brightest silver linings of this time is the amount of innovation in service to others.”</p>
<p>As San Diego families and students transition to distance learning provided by SDUSD, access to reliable internet and technology are essential. Illumina’s donation will support K-12 distance learning programs for students without internet access, as well as science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the support of Illumina, we have worked to guarantee all students in San Diego have what they need to continue their educational journey and pursue their dreams,” SDUSD Superintendent Cindy Marten said. “Illumina’s donation to the San Diego Foundation will allow us to continue to provide our families the technology and services they need to access information and to continue learning now and into the future. We are very thankful for our long-standing partnership with Illumina.”</p>
<p>Illumina is the biggest and highest-valued biotech company in San Diego County. Its mission is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. The company is working to put an end to the spread of COVID-19 by making DNA sequencing accessible around the world.</p>

<p>During May, participants can submit original work based on writing prompts posted on the San Diego Poetry Together webpage. Participants can submit written and spoken word entries. Salisbury will select several poems that will be shared publicly and posted to the web page.</p>

<p>Added Berns, “We need people to enter and shop and move on, basically. We will be restricted to capacity.

<p>FEEDING SAN DIEGO PURCHASES 125 TRUCKLOADS OF FOOD FOR HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego has purchased 125 truckloads of food since March 14 to meet a countywide surge in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. The organization normally purchases approximately 24 truckloads in an entire year.</p>
<p>The increased reliance on purchased food is helping the organization to meet the needs of the nearly one out of every eight San Diegans struggling with hunger prior to the COVID-19 crisis, but also thousands of newly affected residents as San Diego’s unemployment rate reaches 25%. The increased demand comes at a time when Feeding San Diego has experienced a 30 percent decline in donations from local grocery stores due to high consumer demand.</p>
<p>“We are experiencing a tremendous surge in people facing hunger across San Diego County right now, with an estimated 40 percent facing food insecurity for the first time,” said Vince Hall, CEO of Feeding San Diego. “The wave of children, families and seniors in need isn&rsquo;t slowing down — and neither are we because no San Diegan should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. We are grateful to the thousands of San Diegans who have generously donated to Feeding San Diego during this unprecedented crisis. Our donors from across this generous community make our work possible every day.”</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego offers no-touch, drive-through food assistance at hundreds of sites throughout San Diego County. The organization’s food finder map has become a valuable resource to the community and can be found at feedingsandiego.org/find-food. Additional community resources are accessible by calling 2-1-1 or visiting 211sandiego.org.</p>
<p>ROCK CHURCH DELIVERS MEALS IN COVID-19 HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Rock Church in Point Loma has put out the “bat signal” and local restaurants and delivery services have answered the call to band together and bring hunger relief to frontline hospital heroes and first responders. So far, 3,680 meals have been delivered to 13 hospitals throughout San Diego County.</p>
<p>Meals were delivered recently by Rock Church pastor Miles McPherson, a former Chargers player, along with former NFL Hall-of-Fame wide receiver Andre Reed. The pair delivered 50 meals to the San Diego Police Department and 50 meals to the San Diego 911 Call Center.</p>
<p>“I had no idea what an act of service being a 911 dispatcher does to keep people safe,” said Reed. “The SDPD is a huge piece to our San Diego community. After visiting them, I truly have an added respect for our police force, another set of frontline heroes to serve with the Rock Church and pastor Miles.”</p>
<p>The church has been working with Grub Hub to coordinate deliveries and restaurants including Los Primos, Toast, Lola 55, Neighborhood House Association, Beignet Belly, Chick-fil-A and California Pizza Kitchen, which have signed on for the task. Among the 13 hospitals are Sharp Grossmont, Sharp Memorial, Sharp Chula Vista, Sharp Coronado, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, UCSD Hillcrest, UCSD LaJolla, Scripps La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Chula Vista, VA Hospital in Ja Jolla, Palomar Poway and Palomar Escondido.</p>

<p>NIH GRANT ADVANCES RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>The Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at University of California San Diego has received a five-year, $54.7 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health. The new grant is the third such award since ACTRI opened in 2010, bringing total funding support to approximately $144 million.</p>
<p>“The first CTSA laid the foundation for transforming our institution. It built the early infrastructure that would help change the way we thought about moving discoveries from the lab to the clinic,” said Gary S. Firestein, MD, founding director of ACTRI and dean and associate vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “The second CTSA focused on making ACTRI the hub for clinical research and clinical trials at UC San Diego.”</p>
<p>The latest CTSA, said Firestein, will refine the fundamental work of the past decade and provide new resources that will launch a new wave of discovery and transformation.</p>
<p>The new funding will also be used to continue a scholar program supporting young faculty members establishing careers, expand ACTRI’s “Game Center,” a program that uses virtual reality games to train investigators in team science and create new mentoring programs in grant-writing, the financial lifeblood of research.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,400 ongoing clinical trials at UC San Diego Health, involving an estimated 7,000 participants in active treatment. Approximately 250 new trials begin each year, including most recently COVID-19-related trials investigating an antiviral drug, an arthritis drug and a medication for hypertension.</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TO PARTICIPATE IN MAY 6 MUSIC FEST</p>

He will perform a 10-minute set which will include original music.</p>
<p>“San Diego International Airport is excited to join other airports around the nation to showcase the arts in this innovative and collaborative way,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “While many people may not be visiting our terminals during this time, participation in JetStream provides us another outlet to foster positive relationships and support the community through the arts.”</p>
<p>SAN started the Arts Program in 2002 with a mission to surprise and delight travelers with presentations of the highest caliber, and to showcase San Diego’s rich cultural community. Within the terminals, the Arts Program includes visual arts, performing arts, film, and more.</p>

<p>MAYOR URGES SAN DIEGANS TO CONTINUE TO USE BEACHES RESPONSIBLY</p>
<p>Eyeing a sunny weekend forecast, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 1 joined with San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit and Parks and Recreation Department director Andy Field to remind San Diegans of what City resources are now open, and that physical distancing and face-covering mandates continue to be in effect.</p>
<p>What can and can’t be done under the new rules:</p>
<p>BEACHES</p>
<p>On the sand:</p>
<p>Run and walk.</p>
<p>No stopping, sitting, lying down.</p>
<p>In the ocean you can:</p>
<p>Swim.</p>
<p>Surf.</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>And kayak.</p>
<p>In the bays you can:</p>
<p>Paddleboard.</p>
<p>Kayak.</p>
<p>Boating.</p>
<p>No swimming.</p>
<p>NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS</p>
<p>Parks are open for passive use.</p>
<p>Walking.</p>
<p>Jogging.</p>
<p>Hiking.</p>
<p>Sitting with your family.</p>
<p>Parking lots remain closed.</p>
<p>GOLF COURSES</p>
<p>City of San Diego golf courses reopened with physical distancing and face-covering mandates.</p>
<p>FACIAL COVERINGS NOW REQUIRED AT AIRPORT</p>
<p>Per the California Health and Safety Code sections 101040, 120175, and 120175.5 (b), facial coverings are now required at San Diego International Airport (SAN) for all passengers, visitors, tenants, contractors, and employees while on airport property. The mandate is to help curb the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>As stated by the County of San Diego Health Officer, persons with a medical or mental health condition, or developmental disability that prevents wearing a face covering, shall be exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Public Health, a cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>
<p>The airport has placed red tape markings on floors at security checkpoints, airline ticket counters, and concession areas to adhere to six-foot social distancing rules. All airport users are also encouraged to comply with social distancing requirements and follow CDC guidelines to stop the spread of germs which include washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>“SAN’s top priority is the health and safety of all airport users,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “We’ve taken many steps to help curb the spread of COVID-19 and appreciate all airport users adhering to the local and state health orders.”</p>
<p>SDIA offers nonstop service to more than 70 destinations in the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. In operation since 1928, the airport celebrated more than 90 years of service to the San Diego region in 2018. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has managed the airport since 2003. The Airport Authority plans for and provides air transportation services to the region with safe, effective facilities that exceed customer expectations. For more information, visit san.org.</p>
<p>AMTRAK CELEBRATES 49TH ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>Today, Amtrak celebrated its 49th anniversary. For almost five decades, Amtrak has taken U.S. passenger rail customers where they need and want to go. Formally known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak consolidated the services of more than a dozen railroads into a truly national system when it first started. And, while observing this anniversary during an unprecedented time in history, Amtrack continues to provide a vital service to its customers, many of whom are medical professionals and first responders.</p>

<p>CONGRESSMAN PETERS SIGNS LETTER URGING GREATER MENTAL HEALTH, SUICIDE PREVENTION, DURING PANDEMIC</p>
<p>On May 1, Rep. Scott Peters joined 49 of his colleagues in sending a letter to House leadership urging for increased support prioritizing the mental health of the American public during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The bipartisan group of lawmakers requested greater investment in mental health resources and suicide prevention efforts given the unprecedented public health crisis and growing cases of economic insecurity – two stressors linked to mental health challenges and heightened risk of suicide.</p>
<p>The letter advocated for the incorporation of critical provisions in future coronavirus response and recovery packages. This would help address the mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, like enhanced funding for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and inclusion of the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act, which would assist emergency departments to develop better suicide risk protocols.</p>
<p>“We must support our nation’s system of crisis response services, fortify our emergency departments to adequately respond to self-harm, and prepare schools to address the mental health needs of children upon their return in the fall,” the legislators wrote.</p>
<p>MAY IS BICYCLE SAFETY MONTH</p>
<p>For bicycle safety month, Circulate San Diego is encouraging people walking, driving, or riding their bikes to look out for one another while practicing social-distancing.</p>
<p>While shelter-in-place orders are in effect, San Diegans still need to get to essential jobs, run errands, or go outside to exercise. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer unveiled his slow streets initiative this week to make it easier for San Diegans to travel safely while social distancing.</p>
<p>Faulconer’s slow streets initiative includes closing segments of Diamond Street, Adams Avenue, and Howard Street to through vehicular traffic to allow for social distancing for people walking and bicycling. He also announced improvements to pedestrian crosswalk buttons and the re-opening of state Route 56 Bikeway, Rose Creek Bikeway, Rose Canyon Bikeway and the state Route 52 Bikeway.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, San Diegans are finding that bicycling is a great way to travel to an essential job, to access essential needs, and exercise,” Maya Rosas, director of policy at Circulate San Diego said. “It’s important for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians to keep you and your family safe by remaining aware of your surroundings even though there is less vehicular traffic.”</p>
<p>Circulate San Diego has created a webpage with bike-friendly resources to encourage residents to get out and bike, safely and comfortably at circulatesd.org/may_is_bike_month.</p>

<p>A round-up of news, community, and business briefs from sdnews.com highlighting what’s happening in our community.</p>
<p>Saturday, May 30</p>
<p>BEACHES OPEN FOR SITTING JUNE 2</p>
<p>Starting June 2, people will be allowed to sit and lounge at local beaches provided they maintain physical distancing or wear a face covering when close to others, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced.</p>
<p>Sitting on the beach will be allowed for sunbathing and relaxing with towels and chairs if you do it with people in your own household. However, no activities such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Also, all piers and parking lots will remain closed.</p>
<p>All beach communities agreed to ease this restriction starting June 2, but cities can decide if they want to proceed later and how the guideline is going to be enforced.</p>
<p>BLENDERS EYEWEAR PROVIDES SUNGLASSES</p>
<p>Pacific Beach-based Blenders Eyewear will outfit more than 300 FedEx Express workers across the county, offering workers one of five select sunglasses. The Blenders Eyewear team donates sunglasses to the region’s 300-plus FedEx Express workers to thank them for their continued support throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>After re-purposing its production to create and then donate 10,000 safety goggles to Southern California hospitals, plus 20,000 pairs to Direct Relief – in addition to a month-long fundraiser for the international aid organization – Blenders wanted to do more to help those at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more information, visit BlendersEyewear.com.</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT UPDATE</p>
<p>The San Diego Workforce Partnership releases a weekly email update to serve as a one-stop-shop on employment figures and analysis specific to our region’s workforce in regards to impacts associated with COVID-19.</p>
<p>488 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10 (up from 482 last week).</p>
<p>73,617 total reported employees affected since March 10 (up from 72,446 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,692 in the hospitality and restaurant and bar industries. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership, although the full impact to employees and the region’s economy is still unknown.</p>
<p>260 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal.</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: New unemployment claims in California have held steady at a little over 200,000 for the last three weeks. For context, that’s about twice the pre-COVID-19 record. San Diego County’s official unemployment rate was the highest ever recorded last month at 15%, and we believe the current rate is higher, as about 40% of unemployment claims made since the onset of COVID-19 were submitted after April 12, when unemployment was last measured.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORS PROPOSE EVICTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION</p>
<p>Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Greg Cox, co-chairs of the County’s COVID-19 Subcommittee, are proposing the County of San Diego extend its moratorium on evictions for both residents and small businesses for one additional month. The Board of Supervisors will vote on the policy extension Tuesday, June 2.</p>
<p>“We are proposing extending San Diego County’s eviction moratorium for residents and small businesses through June 30th,” said Cox and Fletcher in a statement. “Our region is slowly recovering from the severe economic damage caused by the pandemic. Although more businesses are reopening, it is going to take time for merchants and their employees who have been out of work to rebuild their bank accounts enough to pay their rent. This will give residential and commercial renters more time to get back on their feet. But we are encouraging renters to pay as much rent as they can and set-up a payment program with their landlords.”</p>
<p>The original moratorium policy and resolution is set to expire Sunday, May 31. This moratorium extension only affects the unincorporated areas. If the extension is passed by supervisors, the resolution will continue to ensure protections provided retroactively to March 4, when Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency.</p>
<p>UC SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE VIRTUAL COMMENCEMENT</p>
<p>The university will host a virtual commencement for its School of Medicine Sunday, May 31 at 10 a.m. which can be viewed at medschool.ucsd.edu/Commencement2020. Keynote commencement speaker will be Mona Hanna-Attisha, MD, the pediatrician, scientist and activist who discovered high levels of lead in the blood of children living in Flint, Mich. and led efforts to publicize and address the source, a contaminated local water supply.</p>
<p>Approximately 132 graduates will receive their medical degrees. Of those, 11 will also receive Masters of Advanced Studies and six will also receive PhDs. The majority of these newly minted doctors will move on to residency programs in 26 different states and almost every specialty, such as emergency medicine, psychiatry.</p>
<p>ROCK THRIFT STORE REOPENED</p>
<p>The Rock Thrift Store at 3603 Camino Del Rio has reopened its doors after weeks of being closed due to COVID-19 by State and County regulations for non-essential businesses. Rock Thrift will be open to the public daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Patrons can shop or drop donations off. Everyone will be asked to abide by County regulations in order to keep the store, staff and customers safe. This includes wearing a mask, keeping six feet apart and following signage posted.</p>
<p>“I’m most excited to reopen Rock Thrift so we can go back to engaging and serving more of the community and spreading the love and hope of Christ,” said Brenda Swain, store manager.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional retail aspect of the store, the Rock Thrift Store also provides vouchers to individuals and families in need, through first responders, that may have been evacuated due to a fire, domestic violence and other crises. In a time where COVID-19 has created a multitude of needs for individuals and families across San Diego, the Rock Thrift store is eager to have it’s doors open to exchange those vouchers for much-needed clothing and household items. For store hours, donation guidelines and more information, visit rockthriftstore.com</p>
<p>URGENT NEED FOR BLOOD DONATIONS</p>
<p>The American Red Cross has an urgent need for blood donations to prevent another blood shortage as hospitals resume surgical procedures and patient treatments that were temporarily paused earlier this spring in response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Healthy individuals who are feeling well are asked to make an appointment to donate in the weeks and months ahead by downloading the free Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org, calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or enabling the Blood Donor Skill on any Alexa Echo device.</p>

And thanks to Amazon, all those who come to give June 1-30 will receive a $5 Amazon.com gift card via email. Upcoming blood donation: June 10, 10 a.m.-4 p.m., Torrey Pines Church, 8320 La Jolla Scenic Drive.</p>

<p>U.S. REP. PETERS URGES RESTRAINT IN REOPENING</p>
<p>Congressman Scott Peters (CA-52), who recently heard from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and a key member of the Trump Administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, issued the following statement after a conference call organized for members of the New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>“Many states across the country began to expand their plans to re-open over Memorial Day weekend. With every state creating their own timeline and guidance, I asked Dr. Fauci about the spectrum of criteria being used by states, and what steps can be taken in places where the virus is still strongly present,” continued Peters of Fauci, “He explained that ‘hot spot’ areas like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago and other places where the number of cases continues to climb need to exercise extra-special caution as they look to re-open. He emphasized that phases in re-opening are crucial and should be used gradually instead of allowing all preventative practices to slide away at once. He also doubled down on the importance of everyone wearing a face covering when out to prevent the virus from spreading, and underscored that those who know they’ve been exposed must quarantine and get tested.”</p>
<p>Fauci also filled in lawmakers on various national COVID-19 treatment developments, including the progress being made in vaccine research and production. According to the NIAID director, the rollout of a vaccine is expected to come sometime between late summer and early winter 2021, with a goal to have enough doses for everyone.</p>
<p>Peters serves the 52nd District of California, which covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chairman.</p>

<p>The principal said students will receive all of their class of 2020 items (cap, gown, honor cords, IB Sash, 2020 yard sign, and more). “We will also be collecting any MBHS school items the kids have,” he said. “After dropping off, the kids and families will drive down Lee Street to a senior celebration, to include a DJ, party lighting, congratulations signs, MBHS staff waving to students, images of students projected throughout, and more.”</p>
<p>Added Remillard, “Students and families will need to remain in their cars throughout the event. We have encouraged students/families to decorate their cars for the event. We will be videoing the evening. Then on June 9, a video with student images and footage from the night will be posted on our website, district website, and social media platform. This will be a class of 2020 recognition.”</p>

<p>DIAPER DRIVES FOR NEEDY FAMILIES</p>
<p>Miracle Babies, a nonprofit organization that supports families with critically ill babies in local neonatal intensive care units, is hosting a series of diaper drive-through events for local families.</p>
<p>The diaper donations will be open to all San Diego families in need during this difficult time. Parents will be asked to display diaper size needed on their dashboard as they drive into the parking lot to limit contact. If families currently have a baby in the NICU, parents can write “NICU NOW” on their dashboard for a care package. Diapers will be loaded directly into families’ vehicle for a no-contact experience.</p>
<p>“After seeing how many families turned out for our first diaper drive donation, we knew we had to make this a re-occurring event,” said Marianela Camarillo, chief operations officer of Miracle Babies. “We saw firsthand how many families are in need of diapers, so we decided to host a series of diaper drive-through events throughout San Diego County as a way to support parents during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>The diaper drive-throughs will provide registered parents with diapers and Miracle Babies will hold events throughout the county. Upcoming events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saturday, May 23 from 10 a.m. to noon at the National City Library, 1401 National City Blvd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday, May 31 from 10 a.m. to noon at Scripps Health Campus, 10140 Campus Point Ct. These events require participants to register, email [email protected] to sign up or volunteer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CITY LIBRARIES BEGIN CONTACT-FREE PICKUP</p>
<p>Starting May 26, San Diegans can pick up items on hold at 11 library locations during limited hours. The pickup service will restore access to 2.9 million physical materials in the San Diego Public Library’s collection to library patrons for the first time since libraries were closed in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also prioritizes the health and safety of patrons and employees, while allowing San Diegans to pick up materials at designated locations.</p>
<p>“We’re flattening the curve, and as San Diegans continue to do the right thing we will expand and restore neighborhood services in a safe and responsible way,” said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. “We know San Diegans love and miss their libraries, so we’re excited to offer contact-free pickup to provide access to millions of books and other materials while implementing safeguards to protect employees and patrons.”</p>
<p>Starting May 26, pickup service will be available Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at the following locations: Carmel Valley, College-Rolando, La Jolla/Riford, Logan Heights, Mira Mesa, Mission Hills-Hillcrest/Knox, Mission Valley, Point Loma/Hervey, Rancho Bernardo, San Ysidro and Valencia Park/Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Patrons with existing holds will be notified by email when their materials are available. The San Diego Public Library will begin accepting new holds for pickup on June 1.</p>
<p>“The pickup service is an important first step in the library’s return to full service,” said library director Misty Jones. “While our libraries have been physically closed, patrons have been using our online resources in record numbers. However, we’ve heard from many people who prefer physical books, and this pickup service allows them to access some of the resources they’ve been missing.”</p>
<p>Patrons will need to present a valid library card or library card number to pick up their materials. Library facilities will not be open to the public and will not accept returns at this time. Due dates on items currently checked out have been extended to June 12.</p>
<p>JUNGLE JAVA IN OB CLOSING</p>
<p>“We are so happy and proud that we could keep Jungle Java going for a few more years,” said the coffee shop’s operator for the past three years, Danielle Hargis. “It’s a lovely place that has many memories thanks to the amazing people that worked there threw the years and the wonderful people who came to enjoy the sun, the plants and the tasty treats. Thank you so very much. Be safe. Be well.”</p>
<p>Concerning why she’s closing Hargis said: “It was a mix of a lot of things. It was hard to keep social distancing in a place where people gather. I don’t know how to reopen when people can’t socialize.”</p>
<p>Hargis added she was uncertain she could keep the coffee and plant shop at 5047 Newport Ave. on an even keel financially. “I didn’t think I’d have the numbers to keep the place open,” she said. “Also, my lease is up. It was just a business move.”</p>
<p>Jungle Java has a mobile cart food license and has been selling smoothies along with teas, coffees, and plants. Asked what she’ll do now, Hargis replied, “I’m taking a break. I don’t know if I’ll be successful in getting a job in my industry. Hopefully, I’ll stick with small-business, hopefully, work with agriculture.”</p>
<p>GASLAMP QUARTER BLOOMING WITH MURALS</p>
<p>Several Gaslamp businesses that temporarily shuttered in light of the stay-at-home order covered their windows with plywood during the shutdown. Now, as the neighborhood begins to reopen, flowers have begun to bloom on the boarded-up shops.</p>
<p>“As city lights have dimmed worldwide, these murals offer a sense of brightness for the Gaslamp and surrounding neighborhoods,” said Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter Association.</p>
<p>The pop-up urban art installation is the brainchild of Sean Warner, the Downtown San Diego Partnership’s director of placemaking. Warner hired local artists — including PANDR, Ladies Who Paint, Elliot Shuessler and Visual Gallery + Design — to create compelling images of hope, resilience and strength for storefronts in the Gaslamp, Quarter, the Downtown Core and East Village.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL SUMMER SCHOOL AT LA JOLLA HIGH</p>
<p>LJHS announced that summer school this year will go from Monday, June 22 to Thursday, July 31.</p>
<p>Summer School for 2020 will be taking place virtually using district-issued Chromebooks and Edgenuity online courses. Students will complete all work at home and will not be reporting to a school site.</p>
<p>Counselors have already pre-enrolled any students into summer school who currently have an “F” this semester, or have an “F” on their transcript. A summer school online registration and opt-out form will be sent to all enrolled students after May 25.</p>
<p>If a student does not have a district-issued computer, they may go to Clairemont, Hoover, Lincoln, or San Diego high schools from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Device Exchange and Distribution Centers at those schools. Any district student or family member may go to the center closest to their house to receive a new device or exchange a broken device. If your child would like to remediate a “D” grade, have them contact their counselor by Wednesday, May 27.</p>
<p>LJ COAST WALK TRAIL REPAIRS FUNDED</p>
<p>“With all your help and generous contributions, Friends of Coast Walk Trail has raised enough funds to complete the needed trail repairs starting Monday, June 1,” said Brenda Fake, neighborhood nonprofit spokesperson. “To safely complete these repairs and mitigate cost overruns, the trail will be partially closed for pedestrian/bike traffic starting:</p>
<p>June 1-5 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Cave Store to Prospect Bench just above the bridge;</p>
<p>June 8-12 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Prospect Bench to Coast Walk parking.</p>
<p>To help with community communication and outreach Friends of Coast Walk Trail is seeking trail ambassador volunteers to assist in redirecting pedestrians and providing project information during the day when repairs are being done.</p>
<p>The expected volunteer time commitment would be in 2- or 4- hour shifts to sit at one of two ends of the trail repair area. During this time, trail ambassadors will redirect pedestrians/bike traffic to an alternative entrance to the trail as well as a great opportunity to inform the public about the project. Friends of Coast Walk Trail will provide a comfortable chair, water, safety vest, masks, and information about the repair project.</p>
<p>“This a great opportunity to make a difference and support our local community with this project. Plus it’s a chance to meet other like-minded people,” said Fake. “We will be outlining appropriate social distancing guidelines and ask each volunteer to please wear a mask.” To volunteer, no later than May 30 at 5 p.m., email [email protected].</p>
<p>ONLINE COMMEMORATION FOR MEMORIAL DAY</p>
<p>The USS Midway Museum, Mt. Soledad National Memorial and Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Foundations, will all be holding Memorial Day differently this year due to the ongoing pandemic. Each location will hold approximately 15-minute commemorations that will be streamed live on Memorial Day from 9 to 10 a.m. at sandiegomemorialdaylive.com. The simulcast will flow from Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery to the Mt. Soledad National Memorial to the Miramar National Cemetery to the USS Midway Museum and briefly back to the Miramar National Cemetery for the conclusion. Public spectators will not be permitted at any of the commemoration locations.</p>
<p>“The importance of ensuring public health in the fight again Covid-19 will prevent normal Memorial Day commemorations from being held around San Diego this year,” said David Koontz, Midway Museum marketing director. “However, it is important to continue to honor those who have given their lives in service to the nation as members of the U.S. Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>Added Koontz,” Not only will this simulcast honor those military members who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, but it will also express appreciation to those front line heroes of today in the battle against the coronavirus.”</p>

Mattew Hangauer, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology School of Medicine at UC San Diego, has received $50,000 from The Skin Cancer Foundation, provided by the Ashley Trenner Research Grant Award, for his project “Targeting Immunotherapy-Tolerant Melanoma Persister Cells.”</p>
<p>Hangauer’s research focuses on how tumor cells evade cancer therapies, with a primary focus on melanoma. He aims to specifically understand how residual melanoma cells survive immunotherapy, and how those cells can be therapeutically targeted, in hopes of preventing any relapses. Little has been known about this area of research thus far and he hopes to increase the number of advanced melanoma patients who experience long-lasting responses to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>This spring, The Skin Cancer Foundation has been awarded a combined total of $125,000 in grants to three researchers. The funds encourage innovation in prevention, early detection and treatment of skin cancer. The Foundation’s Research Grants program has helped young doctors and investigators with funding for studies that have led to lifesaving breakthroughs. Hangauer’s project is made possible due to funding provided by Karen and Bob Trenner.</p>
<p>PB KEEPING BUSINESS DISTRICT CLEANER, CRIME-FREE</p>
<p>PBTC is joining Discover PB and &ldquo;Clean &amp; Safe&rdquo; co-chair Andie LaComb to assist San Diego Police Department in dealing with an increase in individuals sleeping and congregating in the alleys, storefronts, and parking lots, and on business property in the business district. The related damage and increased debris are making the entire area less desirable to tourists and residents.</p>
<p>One thing every business can do to help is to complete a Letter of Agency/Authority (LOA) with SDPD.This document authorizes SDPD to remove individuals who should not be loitering on the property and gives them more leverage to remove those engaged in criminal activity. PBTC will be working with its business members to execute LOAs, file them with SDPD, and prompt timely annual LOA renewals. Download an LOA form now.</p>

<p>MTS APPOINTS FEMALE CEO</p>
<p>The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System board of directors has appointed the organization&rsquo;s first female CEO, in the wake of the sudden death last weekend of former CEO Paul Jablonski. Sharon Cooney, whose appointment was unanimously approved by the MTS board, takes over after holding a variety of high-level posts at the transit agency including deputy CEO, director of government affairs, director of planning and chief of staff.</p>
<p>“I am honored that the board expressed confidence in me,” Cooney said. “I think the board also understands that Mr. Jablonski assembled one of the best staffs in the entire country. I am lucky to have been mentored by one of the nation&rsquo;s most respected transit leaders and to have a group of professionals that are absolutely dedicated to advancing public transit in San Diego. We are all ready to take on the challenges today and into the future.”</p>
<p>Jablonski died at age 67 and had a transit career spanning four decades. He had worked at the MTS for 16 years.</p>
<p>WOMEN’S APPAREL RETAILER SUES STATE</p>
<p>San Diego’s largest family of designer consignment shops, My Sister&rsquo;s Closet, My Sister&rsquo;s Attic and Well Suited, will pursue legal action against the State of California after losing more than $1.5 million due to closures in Arizona and California. Owner and founder Ann Siner, who has a store location in the Costa Verde Center at 8610 Genesee Ave. in La Jolla, claims her shops have been the target of harassment by police officers who recently walked into one of her stores not wearing masks demanding her stores be shut down, with the only option being selling her merchandise curbside.</p>
<p>Siner said she has since brought several racks of clothing outside the store hoping it will attract customers, but that business model just doesn’t work. “How do you sell clothing, accessories, furniture, art, jewelry, handbags at the curb?” asked Siner. “It doesn’t work, but yet it’s okay for hundreds of shoppers to pour inside packed Target, Walmart, Home Depot, and other big-box stores by the hour. They are killing small businesses in California and they just don’t care.”</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT</p>
<p>According to the Workforce Partnership, since March 10 there have been:</p>
<p>470 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10, 2020 (up from 449 last week)</p>
<p>68,537 total reported employees affected (up from 67,379 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,391 in the Hospitality and Restaurant &amp; Bar sectors. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership. The full impact to employees and the region’s economy is higher as not all employers submit WARN notices.</p>
<p>215 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: California unemployment insurance claims fell by a third last week, to 214,028. This is still 85% above the pre-COVID record and four times the past decade’s average weekly claims, but the decrease is welcome, and we hope to see it continue this week and next as counties across the state enter Phase 2 of the reopening plan.</p>

<p>CITY LAUNCHES BETTER BY BIKE EFFORT</p>
<p>To celebrate National Bike Month in May and to highlight work to improve bicycling infrastructure, the City of San Diego is launching Better By Bike, an outreach and education effort aimed at encouraging more residents to consider commuting by bicycle. The City’s Climate Action Plan calls for an increase in commuter bicycling opportunities, especially in communities near major transit stops.</p>
<p>During May, the City is teaming up with the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition for the Love to Ride 25-day bicycling challenge, with events like the Family Week ride and New Cyclist Week.</p>
<p>People are urged to ride solo or with family members to comply with physical distancing guidelines; indoor rides on stationary bikes are also counted toward participation. Prize drawings will be held each week of the challenge.</p>
<p>“With so many San Diegans staying home to help stop the spread of Covid-19, more people are also hopping on their bikes for exercise and to run essential errands, or just to feel connected while maintaining distance,” said chief sustainability officer Cody Hooven. “We hope this becomes a new habit for people as they realize you don’t need to be an athlete or expert cyclist to commute by bicycle. For your health and the health of our environment, it really is better to go by bike when you can.”</p>
<p>According to Caltrans, traffic volume on roads statewide is down an average of 35% compared to this time last year. Meanwhile, bicycling is up 55% over expected volumes during the first week of May in cities across the southwestern part of the United States, according to data posted by Eco-Counter.</p>
<p>Last month, in response to requests from residents, commuter bikeways within city limits were reopened, including the State Route 56 bikeway and the San Diego River bikeway connecting Mission Valley and Ocean Beach. The City recently launched a Slow Streets program to allow more space for residents who are walking or bicycling in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To sign up for the Love to Ride 25-day challenge, visit lovetoride.net/sandiegocounty. Participants who sign up and log their rides online may be eligible for prizes, including new Brooklyn Bicycle cruiser, cycling gear and more. Share photos of your ride on social media using the hashtag #BetterByBike. Learn more about the City’s bicycling program by visiting sandiego.gov/bicycling.</p>

<p>CITY REPAVING ONE OF ITS BUSIEST STREETS</p>
<p>Taking advantage of reduced traffic due to the pandemic, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 12 ordered the repaving of the main stretch of North Harbor Drive leading to the San Diego International Airport – one of the busiest streets in the City. Faulconer was joined this morning by City Council member Mark Kersey, chair of the Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, to announce the project.</p>
<p>“First impressions are important, and the first thing most people see when they come to San Diego is the bumpy ride as they leave the San Diego International Airport,” Faulconer said. “This stretch of road is so busy that there’s never really a convenient time to make repairs, so we’re taking advantage of the reduced traffic from the statewide stay-at-home order to overhaul and improve this major thoroughfare for the first time in two decades.”</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the City began repaving 3.3 miles along North Harbor Drive between Ash Street to Nimitz Boulevard in both directions. In addition, the project includes buffered bike lanes through striping modifications. Traffic along North Harbor Drive has been reduced by 50 percent as a result of COVID-19. The paving project is expected to be completed in three weeks.</p>
<p>“During this crisis, San Diego International Airport has remained open as a critical piece of the nation’s transportation infrastructure,” said Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “And Harbor Drive is a critical artery helping people get to and from the airport. So we’re excited to see the City moving forward with plans to rehabilitate this roadway.”</p>
<p>REP. PETERS WORKING VIRTUALLY</p>
<p>Congressman Peters continues to work via teleconferencing for California’s 52nd district carrying out his legislative duties remotely while following public health guidance.</p>
<p>“The way we keep people safe and get our economy moving again is through testing, tracing, and treatment,&rdquo; said Peters.“Hearing from the Federal Trade Commission gave us important information to consider as we construct and coordinate innovative systems to allow for safe re-opening.</p>
<p>“While technology can be used to bolster testing and contact tracing efforts, we must work diligently with the tech community to monitor the rollout of any tools aimed at helping track the spread of the virus,” continued Peters. “Regulations will need to be implemented to prevent the abuse of any personal data gathered, and the public’s vigilance will be critical in protecting individuals’ sensitive information online. We should utilize technology in a way that helps our cause in preventing spread, but that doesn’t exploit Americans’ right to privacy, too.”</p>
<p>Added Peters: “According to public health experts, we are going to need $46.5 billion to get adequate testing up and running, with an additional 180,000 people to expand the contact tracing workforce. Robust testing, in tandem with proper contact tracing, will be essential to re-open the economy, and appropriately applied technology will be an important tool to help us do just that.”</p>
<p>The 52nd District of California covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chair.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA ON-RAMP CLOSURES POSTPONED</p>

<p>CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE CONSIDERS NOVEMBER BALLOT PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The City Council’s Rules Committee tomorrow will discuss 17 proposed measures and decide which of them merit further consideration for placement on the November 2020 ballot. Nine of the measures were submitted by individual San Diegans, four by local advocacy groups, and four by City officials, including Council members, the City Attorney, the City Auditor, and the Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The ideas include removing the coastal height limit in the Sports Arena area, implementing ranked-choice voting in San Diego’s general elections, and updating the City’s contracting policies to remain eligible for state grant funding.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many ideas coming from engaged members of our community,” Council president and Rules Committee chair Georgette Gómez said. “I look forward to discussing these proposals with my committee colleagues, and also hearing from the public which ones should be advanced to the ballot.”</p>
<p>Those measures that the committee advances for additional analysis will return to the Rules Committee to be considered for review by the full City Council.</p>

<p>PLHS GRAD IS A DUAL STUDENT-ATHLETE</p>
<p>Being a full-time student, playing a sport, and working is already hard enough. Imagine attending two colleges and being a full-time student at both. That’s a total of 24 units in a semester while playing a sport, and working on top of that. You have to be extremely disciplined and dedicated to being a dual athlete.</p>
<p>Savannah Ames is a dual student-athlete on San Diego Mesa College’s softball team. Ames, a Point Loma High School alumni, attends both San Diego Mesa College and Point Loma Nazarene University. Ames majors in communications and plans on graduating from PLNU in the fall of 2020. She carries a GPA over 3.0 at both colleges, PLNU 3.4 GPA, and Mesa 3.8 GPA.</p>
<p>UNCLAIMED MONEY AT CITY OF SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>Anyone who has done business with the City of San Diego in the past three years, including paying business taxes, could be owed money. Check amounts range from $1 to $22,000. The City regularly receives returned checks that are undeliverable based on the address on file. Checks that remain uncashed after six months become unclaimed monies.</p>
<p>The unclaimed monies report is available at sandiego.gov/finance/unclaimed and is updated quarterly. There is no charge to search the data or to file a claim. Since this time last year, the City returned $368,000 to 119 recipients who were listed on the unclaimed monies report, meaning 29% of the unclaimed monies were returned by the City. The average claim was $3,091.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 1,700 accounts with more than $660,000 in unclaimed monies belonging to people or businesses that have not received money owed to them because of refunds or vendor payments. Payees have approximately one year to claim their money after it’s been added to the unclaimed monies report. The last day to submit a claim for checks issued prior to April 1, 2019, is Thursday, June 18. To submit a claim, print and complete the Request for Unclaimed Monies form.</p>
<p>NEW POP-UP BRUNCH AT OB EATERY</p>
<p>A just-launched pop-up eatery has brought a new take-out brunch option to Ob. Called Loco Lopez and run by chef Richard Lopez, is operating Wednesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. out of the same Sunset Cliffs Boulevard space as Sundara Indian Kitchen, which has remained open throughout this shelter-at-home phase. With restaurants likely limited in their reopening capacity, Sundara co-founder Adam Lowe said the 38-seat eatery will likely continue to focus on its take-out business even after the dine-in ban is lifted.</p>
<p>Lowe approached Lopez with the offer to share the kitchen. The chef previously worked at Sundara, and has cooked in fine-dining restaurants as well as local hotels like the Hotel del Coronado.</p>
<p>Seeing a void in the to-go brunch market, Lopez created a menu of takeout-friendly dishes that includes a breakfast burrito wrapped in a cheese-crusted tortilla, a doughnut grilled cheese served with serrano jam, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs accompanied by house chips.</p>
<p>Though it’s starting as a pop-up, the chef says he’s hoping to make Loco Lopez permanent, either in the Sundara space or elsewhere. He’ll continue to expand the menu and is planning to eventually offer mimosas, micheladas, beer, and wine.</p>

<p>NEEDY FAMILIES TO RECEIVE FOOD FROM UNION VOLUNTEERS</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego in partnership with the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, will host mass “drive-through” food distributions for San Diego families and seniors in need at SDCCU Stadium (formerly Qualcomm) every Saturday in May from 9 a.m. until all of the food is gone.

The distribution is first-come, first-served for 1,100 vehicles starting at 9 a.m. on May 16, 23 and 30. The San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council is a community of more than 200,000 working families standing together.</p>
<p>SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARN LESS STATE FUNDS WOULD CAUSE ‘HARM’</p>
<p>San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten and Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner issued a joint statement in response to the Department of Finance’s preliminary estimates on the California State budget and the need for federal relief:</p>
<p>“A 20 percent reduction in state funds to public education, which would be about $2,700 less per student, would cause irreparable harm to children,” the superintendents said. “California already spends significantly less on public education than other large states. Moreover, reopening school facilities in a safe manner this fall will also require more funding.</p>
<p>“Our efforts to enhance the quality of distance learning and provide a safety net to students and families during this public health crisis have been comprehensive and responsive to student’s needs,” continued their joint release. “With approximately 240,000 devices and close to 18 million meals provided in Los Angeles and San Diego, the immediate challenges posed by Covid-19 have significantly increased costs for our schools.”</p>
<p>Noted both superintendents: “Implicit in every budget are a series of choices, which are made more difficult when the dollars are scarce. But they are still choices that elected officials in Sacramento must make and the consequences will have an impact on an entire generation of children. This generation has a right to an education, and a 20% reduction in state school spending would deny students this right. Simply put, that level of spending reduction would make it impossible for schools to safely reopen this fall.”</p>
<p>Friday, May 8</p>

<p>GARNET BUILDING IN PB SELLS FOR NEARLY $2 MILLION</p>
<p>A prominent freestanding 4,500-square-foot building that has a John Lennon mural painted on the side across from Chase Bank at 1020 Garnet Ave. in Pacific Beach was sold for $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Brian Pyke and Allison Campbell of Retail Insite represented the seller and buyer. The seller is Tanya Blane and the buyer has requested anonymity. The new owner has plans to reposition this building currently occupied by Five Guys.</p>

<p>WHAT’S RED TIDE AND WHY DOES IT SMELL?</p>
<p>Bioluminescence expert Michael Latz, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said the current red tide, which stretches from Baja California to Los Angeles, is due to aggregations of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra, a species well known for its bioluminescent displays. Each microscopic cell contains some “sunscreen,” giving it a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>On sunny days, the organisms swim toward the surface where they concentrate, resulting in the intensified coloration of the water – and the reason for the term &ldquo;red tide.&rdquo; At night, when the phytoplankton are agitated by waves or other movement in the water, they emit a dazzling neon blue glow.</p>
<p>The ocean along San Diego County is still brown in color, but now the sulfury odor is intense. The strong odor has reached about 1 ½ miles inland. There is also foam, indicating the breakdown of protein and other organic material. There are also reports of fish kills along beaches and in lagoons and harbors. The breakdown of the red tide by microbes results in low oxygen conditions that are deleterious to some animals.</p>
<p>Is the water safe for surfing/swimming? In some areas such as the Mediterranean, Lingulodinium polyedra produces yessotoxin, a compound that acts as a neurotoxin, but local populations do not produce yessotoxin. However, some people are sensitive to inhaling air associated with the red tide, so the organisms must be producing other compounds that can affect human health. In general, during a red tide, there is lots of dissolved and particulate matter in the water with associated enhanced microbial activity. It is a personal choice whether to go in the water, but there is no public health warning associated with the red tide.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL RELIEF TEAMS SUPPLYING SD FOOD BANK</p>
<p>San Diego-based International Relief Teams is providing the Jacobs &amp; Cushman San Diego Food Bank with more than $90,000 worth of canned goods to help meet the increased demand for food assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>“IRT is dedicated to helping families in need. We know that many San Diego families are suffering right now because of the shutdown, and we wanted to help ensure that they can access the food they need. We have partnered with the San Diego Food Bank for many years and we are proud to support their extraordinary response to this pandemic,” said Barry La Forgia, International Relief Teams’ executive director.</p>
<p>ILLUMINA DONATES $1 MILLION TO SD SCHOOLS, FRONTLINE WORKERS</p>
<p>The Illumina Corporate Foundation has directed the $1 million gift to The San Diego Foundation COVID-19 Community Fund, which was created to provide resources to low-income workers, families and vulnerable communities most affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Illumina’s donation directs $700,000 to the San Diego Unified School District to help K-12 distance learning and $300,000 to support frontline healthcare workers, food security and small business programs. The COVID-19 Community Response Fund has raised over $10.8 million.</p>
<p>“We are proud to call San Diego home and are dedicated to supporting impactful relief efforts in our hometown. From individuals to communities, from companies to countries, we are finding ways to support each other and address the pandemic together,” said Sam Samad, senior vice president/CFO of Illumina. “One of the brightest silver linings of this time is the amount of innovation in service to others.”</p>
<p>As San Diego families and students transition to distance learning provided by SDUSD, access to reliable internet and technology are essential. Illumina’s donation will support K-12 distance learning programs for students without internet access, as well as science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the support of Illumina, we have worked to guarantee all students in San Diego have what they need to continue their educational journey and pursue their dreams,” SDUSD Superintendent Cindy Marten said. “Illumina’s donation to the San Diego Foundation will allow us to continue to provide our families the technology and services they need to access information and to continue learning now and into the future. We are very thankful for our long-standing partnership with Illumina.”</p>

<p>FEEDING SAN DIEGO PURCHASES 125 TRUCKLOADS OF FOOD FOR HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego has purchased 125 truckloads of food since March 14 to meet a countywide surge in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. The organization normally purchases approximately 24 truckloads in an entire year.</p>
<p>The increased reliance on purchased food is helping the organization to meet the needs of the nearly one out of every eight San Diegans struggling with hunger prior to the COVID-19 crisis, but also thousands of newly affected residents as San Diego’s unemployment rate reaches 25%. The increased demand comes at a time when Feeding San Diego has experienced a 30 percent decline in donations from local grocery stores due to high consumer demand.</p>
<p>“We are experiencing a tremendous surge in people facing hunger across San Diego County right now, with an estimated 40 percent facing food insecurity for the first time,” said Vince Hall, CEO of Feeding San Diego. “The wave of children, families and seniors in need isn&rsquo;t slowing down — and neither are we because no San Diegan should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. We are grateful to the thousands of San Diegans who have generously donated to Feeding San Diego during this unprecedented crisis. Our donors from across this generous community make our work possible every day.”</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego offers no-touch, drive-through food assistance at hundreds of sites throughout San Diego County. The organization’s food finder map has become a valuable resource to the community and can be found at feedingsandiego.org/find-food. Additional community resources are accessible by calling 2-1-1 or visiting 211sandiego.org.</p>
<p>ROCK CHURCH DELIVERS MEALS IN COVID-19 HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Rock Church in Point Loma has put out the “bat signal” and local restaurants and delivery services have answered the call to band together and bring hunger relief to frontline hospital heroes and first responders. So far, 3,680 meals have been delivered to 13 hospitals throughout San Diego County.</p>
<p>Meals were delivered recently by Rock Church pastor Miles McPherson, a former Chargers player, along with former NFL Hall-of-Fame wide receiver Andre Reed. The pair delivered 50 meals to the San Diego Police Department and 50 meals to the San Diego 911 Call Center.</p>
<p>“I had no idea what an act of service being a 911 dispatcher does to keep people safe,” said Reed. “The SDPD is a huge piece to our San Diego community. After visiting them, I truly have an added respect for our police force, another set of frontline heroes to serve with the Rock Church and pastor Miles.”</p>
<p>The church has been working with Grub Hub to coordinate deliveries and restaurants including Los Primos, Toast, Lola 55, Neighborhood House Association, Beignet Belly, Chick-fil-A and California Pizza Kitchen, which have signed on for the task. Among the 13 hospitals are Sharp Grossmont, Sharp Memorial, Sharp Chula Vista, Sharp Coronado, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, UCSD Hillcrest, UCSD LaJolla, Scripps La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Chula Vista, VA Hospital in Ja Jolla, Palomar Poway and Palomar Escondido.</p>

<p>NIH GRANT ADVANCES RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>The Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at University of California San Diego has received a five-year, $54.7 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health. The new grant is the third such award since ACTRI opened in 2010, bringing total funding support to approximately $144 million.</p>
<p>“The first CTSA laid the foundation for transforming our institution. It built the early infrastructure that would help change the way we thought about moving discoveries from the lab to the clinic,” said Gary S. Firestein, MD, founding director of ACTRI and dean and associate vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “The second CTSA focused on making ACTRI the hub for clinical research and clinical trials at UC San Diego.”</p>
<p>The latest CTSA, said Firestein, will refine the fundamental work of the past decade and provide new resources that will launch a new wave of discovery and transformation.</p>
<p>The new funding will also be used to continue a scholar program supporting young faculty members establishing careers, expand ACTRI’s “Game Center,” a program that uses virtual reality games to train investigators in team science and create new mentoring programs in grant-writing, the financial lifeblood of research.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,400 ongoing clinical trials at UC San Diego Health, involving an estimated 7,000 participants in active treatment. Approximately 250 new trials begin each year, including most recently COVID-19-related trials investigating an antiviral drug, an arthritis drug and a medication for hypertension.</p>

<p>MAYOR URGES SAN DIEGANS TO CONTINUE TO USE BEACHES RESPONSIBLY</p>
<p>Eyeing a sunny weekend forecast, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 1 joined with San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit and Parks and Recreation Department director Andy Field to remind San Diegans of what City resources are now open, and that physical distancing and face-covering mandates continue to be in effect.</p>
<p>What can and can’t be done under the new rules:</p>
<p>BEACHES</p>

<p>Parking lots remain closed.</p>
<p>GOLF COURSES</p>
<p>City of San Diego golf courses reopened with physical distancing and face-covering mandates.</p>
<p>FACIAL COVERINGS NOW REQUIRED AT AIRPORT</p>
<p>Per the California Health and Safety Code sections 101040, 120175, and 120175.5 (b), facial coverings are now required at San Diego International Airport (SAN) for all passengers, visitors, tenants, contractors, and employees while on airport property. The mandate is to help curb the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>As stated by the County of San Diego Health Officer, persons with a medical or mental health condition, or developmental disability that prevents wearing a face covering, shall be exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Public Health, a cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>
<p>The airport has placed red tape markings on floors at security checkpoints, airline ticket counters, and concession areas to adhere to six-foot social distancing rules. All airport users are also encouraged to comply with social distancing requirements and follow CDC guidelines to stop the spread of germs which include washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>“SAN’s top priority is the health and safety of all airport users,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “We’ve taken many steps to help curb the spread of COVID-19 and appreciate all airport users adhering to the local and state health orders.”</p>
<p>SDIA offers nonstop service to more than 70 destinations in the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. In operation since 1928, the airport celebrated more than 90 years of service to the San Diego region in 2018. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has managed the airport since 2003. The Airport Authority plans for and provides air transportation services to the region with safe, effective facilities that exceed customer expectations. For more information, visit san.org.</p>
<p>AMTRAK CELEBRATES 49TH ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>Today, Amtrak celebrated its 49th anniversary. For almost five decades, Amtrak has taken U.S. passenger rail customers where they need and want to go. Formally known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak consolidated the services of more than a dozen railroads into a truly national system when it first started. And, while observing this anniversary during an unprecedented time in history, Amtrack continues to provide a vital service to its customers, many of whom are medical professionals and first responders.</p>

<p>CONGRESSMAN PETERS SIGNS LETTER URGING GREATER MENTAL HEALTH, SUICIDE PREVENTION, DURING PANDEMIC</p>
<p>On May 1, Rep. Scott Peters joined 49 of his colleagues in sending a letter to House leadership urging for increased support prioritizing the mental health of the American public during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The bipartisan group of lawmakers requested greater investment in mental health resources and suicide prevention efforts given the unprecedented public health crisis and growing cases of economic insecurity – two stressors linked to mental health challenges and heightened risk of suicide.</p>
<p>The letter advocated for the incorporation of critical provisions in future coronavirus response and recovery packages. This would help address the mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, like enhanced funding for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and inclusion of the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act, which would assist emergency departments to develop better suicide risk protocols.</p>
<p>“We must support our nation’s system of crisis response services, fortify our emergency departments to adequately respond to self-harm, and prepare schools to address the mental health needs of children upon their return in the fall,” the legislators wrote.</p>
<p>MAY IS BICYCLE SAFETY MONTH</p>
<p>For bicycle safety month, Circulate San Diego is encouraging people walking, driving, or riding their bikes to look out for one another while practicing social-distancing.</p>
<p>While shelter-in-place orders are in effect, San Diegans still need to get to essential jobs, run errands, or go outside to exercise. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer unveiled his slow streets initiative this week to make it easier for San Diegans to travel safely while social distancing.</p>
<p>Faulconer’s slow streets initiative includes closing segments of Diamond Street, Adams Avenue, and Howard Street to through vehicular traffic to allow for social distancing for people walking and bicycling. He also announced improvements to pedestrian crosswalk buttons and the re-opening of state Route 56 Bikeway, Rose Creek Bikeway, Rose Canyon Bikeway and the state Route 52 Bikeway.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, San Diegans are finding that bicycling is a great way to travel to an essential job, to access essential needs, and exercise,” Maya Rosas, director of policy at Circulate San Diego said. “It’s important for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians to keep you and your family safe by remaining aware of your surroundings even though there is less vehicular traffic.”</p>
<p>Circulate San Diego has created a webpage with bike-friendly resources to encourage residents to get out and bike, safely and comfortably at circulatesd.org/may_is_bike_month.</p>

<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: New unemployment claims in California have held steady at a little over 200,000 for the last three weeks. For context, that’s about twice the pre-COVID-19 record. San Diego County’s official unemployment rate was the highest ever recorded last month at 15%, and we believe the current rate is higher, as about 40% of unemployment claims made since the onset of COVID-19 were submitted after April 12, when unemployment was last measured.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORS PROPOSE EVICTION MORATORIUM EXTENSION</p>
<p>Supervisors Nathan Fletcher and Greg Cox, co-chairs of the County’s COVID-19 Subcommittee, are proposing the County of San Diego extend its moratorium on evictions for both residents and small businesses for one additional month. The Board of Supervisors will vote on the policy extension Tuesday, June 2.</p>
<p>“We are proposing extending San Diego County’s eviction moratorium for residents and small businesses through June 30th,” said Cox and Fletcher in a statement. “Our region is slowly recovering from the severe economic damage caused by the pandemic. Although more businesses are reopening, it is going to take time for merchants and their employees who have been out of work to rebuild their bank accounts enough to pay their rent. This will give residential and commercial renters more time to get back on their feet. But we are encouraging renters to pay as much rent as they can and set-up a payment program with their landlords.”</p>
<p>The original moratorium policy and resolution is set to expire Sunday, May 31. This moratorium extension only affects the unincorporated areas. If the extension is passed by supervisors, the resolution will continue to ensure protections provided retroactively to March 4, when Gov. Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency.</p>
<p>UC SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF MEDICINE VIRTUAL COMMENCEMENT</p>

The majority of these newly minted doctors will move on to residency programs in 26 different states and almost every specialty, such as emergency medicine, psychiatry.</p>
<p>ROCK THRIFT STORE REOPENED</p>

<p>U.S. REP. PETERS URGES RESTRAINT IN REOPENING</p>
<p>Congressman Scott Peters (CA-52), who recently heard from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and a key member of the Trump Administration’s White House Coronavirus Task Force, issued the following statement after a conference call organized for members of the New Democrat Coalition.</p>
<p>“Many states across the country began to expand their plans to re-open over Memorial Day weekend. With every state creating their own timeline and guidance, I asked Dr. Fauci about the spectrum of criteria being used by states, and what steps can be taken in places where the virus is still strongly present,” continued Peters of Fauci, “He explained that ‘hot spot’ areas like Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago and other places where the number of cases continues to climb need to exercise extra-special caution as they look to re-open. He emphasized that phases in re-opening are crucial and should be used gradually instead of allowing all preventative practices to slide away at once. He also doubled down on the importance of everyone wearing a face covering when out to prevent the virus from spreading, and underscored that those who know they’ve been exposed must quarantine and get tested.”</p>
<p>Fauci also filled in lawmakers on various national COVID-19 treatment developments, including the progress being made in vaccine research and production. According to the NIAID director, the rollout of a vaccine is expected to come sometime between late summer and early winter 2021, with a goal to have enough doses for everyone.</p>
<p>Peters serves the 52nd District of California, which covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chairman.</p>

<p>The principal said students will receive all of their class of 2020 items (cap, gown, honor cords, IB Sash, 2020 yard sign, and more). “We will also be collecting any MBHS school items the kids have,” he said. “After dropping off, the kids and families will drive down Lee Street to a senior celebration, to include a DJ, party lighting, congratulations signs, MBHS staff waving to students, images of students projected throughout, and more.”</p>
<p>Added Remillard, “Students and families will need to remain in their cars throughout the event. We have encouraged students/families to decorate their cars for the event. We will be videoing the evening. Then on June 9, a video with student images and footage from the night will be posted on our website, district website, and social media platform. This will be a class of 2020 recognition.”</p>

<p>DIAPER DRIVES FOR NEEDY FAMILIES</p>
<p>Miracle Babies, a nonprofit organization that supports families with critically ill babies in local neonatal intensive care units, is hosting a series of diaper drive-through events for local families.</p>
<p>The diaper donations will be open to all San Diego families in need during this difficult time. Parents will be asked to display diaper size needed on their dashboard as they drive into the parking lot to limit contact. If families currently have a baby in the NICU, parents can write “NICU NOW” on their dashboard for a care package. Diapers will be loaded directly into families’ vehicle for a no-contact experience.</p>
<p>“After seeing how many families turned out for our first diaper drive donation, we knew we had to make this a re-occurring event,” said Marianela Camarillo, chief operations officer of Miracle Babies. “We saw firsthand how many families are in need of diapers, so we decided to host a series of diaper drive-through events throughout San Diego County as a way to support parents during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>The diaper drive-throughs will provide registered parents with diapers and Miracle Babies will hold events throughout the county. Upcoming events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saturday, May 23 from 10 a.m. to noon at the National City Library, 1401 National City Blvd.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sunday, May 31 from 10 a.m. to noon at Scripps Health Campus, 10140 Campus Point Ct. These events require participants to register, email [email protected] to sign up or volunteer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>CITY LIBRARIES BEGIN CONTACT-FREE PICKUP</p>
<p>Starting May 26, San Diegans can pick up items on hold at 11 library locations during limited hours. The pickup service will restore access to 2.9 million physical materials in the San Diego Public Library’s collection to library patrons for the first time since libraries were closed in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also prioritizes the health and safety of patrons and employees, while allowing San Diegans to pick up materials at designated locations.</p>
<p>“We’re flattening the curve, and as San Diegans continue to do the right thing we will expand and restore neighborhood services in a safe and responsible way,” said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. “We know San Diegans love and miss their libraries, so we’re excited to offer contact-free pickup to provide access to millions of books and other materials while implementing safeguards to protect employees and patrons.”</p>
<p>Starting May 26, pickup service will be available Monday through Friday, from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., at the following locations: Carmel Valley, College-Rolando, La Jolla/Riford, Logan Heights, Mira Mesa, Mission Hills-Hillcrest/Knox, Mission Valley, Point Loma/Hervey, Rancho Bernardo, San Ysidro and Valencia Park/Malcolm X.</p>
<p>Patrons with existing holds will be notified by email when their materials are available. The San Diego Public Library will begin accepting new holds for pickup on June 1.</p>
<p>“The pickup service is an important first step in the library’s return to full service,” said library director Misty Jones. “While our libraries have been physically closed, patrons have been using our online resources in record numbers. However, we’ve heard from many people who prefer physical books, and this pickup service allows them to access some of the resources they’ve been missing.”</p>
<p>Patrons will need to present a valid library card or library card number to pick up their materials. Library facilities will not be open to the public and will not accept returns at this time. Due dates on items currently checked out have been extended to June 12.</p>
<p>JUNGLE JAVA IN OB CLOSING</p>
<p>“We are so happy and proud that we could keep Jungle Java going for a few more years,” said the coffee shop’s operator for the past three years, Danielle Hargis. “It’s a lovely place that has many memories thanks to the amazing people that worked there threw the years and the wonderful people who came to enjoy the sun, the plants and the tasty treats. Thank you so very much. Be safe. Be well.”</p>
<p>Concerning why she’s closing Hargis said: “It was a mix of a lot of things. It was hard to keep social distancing in a place where people gather. I don’t know how to reopen when people can’t socialize.”</p>
<p>Hargis added she was uncertain she could keep the coffee and plant shop at 5047 Newport Ave. on an even keel financially. “I didn’t think I’d have the numbers to keep the place open,” she said. “Also, my lease is up. It was just a business move.”</p>
<p>Jungle Java has a mobile cart food license and has been selling smoothies along with teas, coffees, and plants. Asked what she’ll do now, Hargis replied, “I’m taking a break. I don’t know if I’ll be successful in getting a job in my industry. Hopefully, I’ll stick with small-business, hopefully, work with agriculture.”</p>
<p>GASLAMP QUARTER BLOOMING WITH MURALS</p>
<p>Several Gaslamp businesses that temporarily shuttered in light of the stay-at-home order covered their windows with plywood during the shutdown. Now, as the neighborhood begins to reopen, flowers have begun to bloom on the boarded-up shops.</p>
<p>“As city lights have dimmed worldwide, these murals offer a sense of brightness for the Gaslamp and surrounding neighborhoods,” said Michael Trimble, executive director of the Gaslamp Quarter Association.</p>
<p>The pop-up urban art installation is the brainchild of Sean Warner, the Downtown San Diego Partnership’s director of placemaking. Warner hired local artists — including PANDR, Ladies Who Paint, Elliot Shuessler and Visual Gallery + Design — to create compelling images of hope, resilience and strength for storefronts in the Gaslamp, Quarter, the Downtown Core and East Village.</p>
<p>VIRTUAL SUMMER SCHOOL AT LA JOLLA HIGH</p>
<p>LJHS announced that summer school this year will go from Monday, June 22 to Thursday, July 31.</p>
<p>Summer School for 2020 will be taking place virtually using district-issued Chromebooks and Edgenuity online courses. Students will complete all work at home and will not be reporting to a school site.</p>
<p>Counselors have already pre-enrolled any students into summer school who currently have an “F” this semester, or have an “F” on their transcript. A summer school online registration and opt-out form will be sent to all enrolled students after May 25.</p>
<p>If a student does not have a district-issued computer, they may go to Clairemont, Hoover, Lincoln, or San Diego high schools from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Device Exchange and Distribution Centers at those schools. Any district student or family member may go to the center closest to their house to receive a new device or exchange a broken device. If your child would like to remediate a “D” grade, have them contact their counselor by Wednesday, May 27.</p>
<p>LJ COAST WALK TRAIL REPAIRS FUNDED</p>
<p>“With all your help and generous contributions, Friends of Coast Walk Trail has raised enough funds to complete the needed trail repairs starting Monday, June 1,” said Brenda Fake, neighborhood nonprofit spokesperson. “To safely complete these repairs and mitigate cost overruns, the trail will be partially closed for pedestrian/bike traffic starting:</p>
<p>June 1-5 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Cave Store to Prospect Bench just above the bridge;</p>
<p>June 8-12 from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. for repairs from the Prospect Bench to Coast Walk parking.</p>
<p>To help with community communication and outreach Friends of Coast Walk Trail is seeking trail ambassador volunteers to assist in redirecting pedestrians and providing project information during the day when repairs are being done.</p>
<p>The expected volunteer time commitment would be in 2- or 4- hour shifts to sit at one of two ends of the trail repair area. During this time, trail ambassadors will redirect pedestrians/bike traffic to an alternative entrance to the trail as well as a great opportunity to inform the public about the project. Friends of Coast Walk Trail will provide a comfortable chair, water, safety vest, masks, and information about the repair project.</p>
<p>“This a great opportunity to make a difference and support our local community with this project. Plus it’s a chance to meet other like-minded people,” said Fake. “We will be outlining appropriate social distancing guidelines and ask each volunteer to please wear a mask.” To volunteer, no later than May 30 at 5 p.m., email [email protected].</p>
<p>ONLINE COMMEMORATION FOR MEMORIAL DAY</p>
<p>The USS Midway Museum, Mt. Soledad National Memorial and Fort Rosecrans and Miramar National Cemetery Foundations, will all be holding Memorial Day differently this year due to the ongoing pandemic. Each location will hold approximately 15-minute commemorations that will be streamed live on Memorial Day from 9 to 10 a.m. at sandiegomemorialdaylive.com. The simulcast will flow from Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery to the Mt. Soledad National Memorial to the Miramar National Cemetery to the USS Midway Museum and briefly back to the Miramar National Cemetery for the conclusion. Public spectators will not be permitted at any of the commemoration locations.</p>
<p>“The importance of ensuring public health in the fight again Covid-19 will prevent normal Memorial Day commemorations from being held around San Diego this year,” said David Koontz, Midway Museum marketing director. “However, it is important to continue to honor those who have given their lives in service to the nation as members of the U.S. Armed Forces.”</p>
<p>Added Koontz,” Not only will this simulcast honor those military members who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, but it will also express appreciation to those front line heroes of today in the battle against the coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 20</p>

<p>Between high school baseball and football as well as college baseball, Pugh had more than 1,000 career victories. He won 86 games in 13 seasons as head football coach at Mission Bay, winning two San Diego Section championships.</p>
<p>His most-notable player at Mission Bay High was running back Arian Foster, who went on to play in the NFL for the Houston Texans, gaining 6,527 yards, playing in four Pro Bowls and was first-team All-Pro in 2010. Pugh is survived by his wife, Marilyn.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA ART &amp; WINE FESTIVAL CANCELED</p>
<p>The La Jolla Art &amp; Wine Festival has spent the last several weeks monitoring the current situations and conferring with public health officials, and while it is still unclear what our new normal will be for this coming fall, it has been decided the LJAWF will be postponed to 2021.</p>
<p>While this decision was not easily made, it is the responsibility of the LJAWF to be good stewards to our local schools and its fundraising mission for them, said organizers. With the amount of uncertainty for the future and a thorough analysis of our planning timeline, the best efforts of the LJAWF team should now be spent on the 2021 event, promoters said.</p>
<p>LJAWF will return to Downtown La Jolla on Saturday, Oct. 9 and Sunday, Oct. 10, 2021. Guests can expect even more prestigious art, international wine, craft beer, and family-friendly fun then than ever before.</p>
<p>In the meantime, LJAWF wishes you and your families good health and well-being. If you would like to support the underfunded programs such as art, music, science, physical education, technology and on-site medical care at all La Jolla public schools, visit ljawf.com to make a donation.</p>

<p>MAY IS SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH</p>
<p>Now is the perfect time to talk about the latest innovations happening around the world’s most common cancer. Mattew Hangauer, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Dermatology School of Medicine at UC San Diego, has received $50,000 from The Skin Cancer Foundation, provided by the Ashley Trenner Research Grant Award, for his project “Targeting Immunotherapy-Tolerant Melanoma Persister Cells.”</p>
<p>Hangauer’s research focuses on how tumor cells evade cancer therapies, with a primary focus on melanoma. He aims to specifically understand how residual melanoma cells survive immunotherapy, and how those cells can be therapeutically targeted, in hopes of preventing any relapses. Little has been known about this area of research thus far and he hopes to increase the number of advanced melanoma patients who experience long-lasting responses to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>This spring, The Skin Cancer Foundation has been awarded a combined total of $125,000 in grants to three researchers. The funds encourage innovation in prevention, early detection and treatment of skin cancer. The Foundation’s Research Grants program has helped young doctors and investigators with funding for studies that have led to lifesaving breakthroughs. Hangauer’s project is made possible due to funding provided by Karen and Bob Trenner.</p>
<p>PB KEEPING BUSINESS DISTRICT CLEANER, CRIME-FREE</p>
<p>PBTC is joining Discover PB and &ldquo;Clean &amp; Safe&rdquo; co-chair Andie LaComb to assist San Diego Police Department in dealing with an increase in individuals sleeping and congregating in the alleys, storefronts, and parking lots, and on business property in the business district.

<p>MTS APPOINTS FEMALE CEO</p>
<p>The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System board of directors has appointed the organization&rsquo;s first female CEO, in the wake of the sudden death last weekend of former CEO Paul Jablonski. Sharon Cooney, whose appointment was unanimously approved by the MTS board, takes over after holding a variety of high-level posts at the transit agency including deputy CEO, director of government affairs, director of planning and chief of staff.</p>
<p>“I am honored that the board expressed confidence in me,” Cooney said. “I think the board also understands that Mr. Jablonski assembled one of the best staffs in the entire country. I am lucky to have been mentored by one of the nation&rsquo;s most respected transit leaders and to have a group of professionals that are absolutely dedicated to advancing public transit in San Diego. We are all ready to take on the challenges today and into the future.”</p>
<p>Jablonski died at age 67 and had a transit career spanning four decades. He had worked at the MTS for 16 years.</p>
<p>WOMEN’S APPAREL RETAILER SUES STATE</p>
<p>San Diego’s largest family of designer consignment shops, My Sister&rsquo;s Closet, My Sister&rsquo;s Attic and Well Suited, will pursue legal action against the State of California after losing more than $1.5 million due to closures in Arizona and California. Owner and founder Ann Siner, who has a store location in the Costa Verde Center at 8610 Genesee Ave. in La Jolla, claims her shops have been the target of harassment by police officers who recently walked into one of her stores not wearing masks demanding her stores be shut down, with the only option being selling her merchandise curbside.</p>
<p>Siner said she has since brought several racks of clothing outside the store hoping it will attract customers, but that business model just doesn’t work. “How do you sell clothing, accessories, furniture, art, jewelry, handbags at the curb?” asked Siner. “It doesn’t work, but yet it’s okay for hundreds of shoppers to pour inside packed Target, Walmart, Home Depot, and other big-box stores by the hour. They are killing small businesses in California and they just don’t care.”</p>
<p>WEEKLY UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT</p>
<p>According to the Workforce Partnership, since March 10 there have been:</p>
<p>470 total businesses reporting layoffs to the Workforce Partnership since March 10, 2020 (up from 449 last week)</p>
<p>68,537 total reported employees affected (up from 67,379 last week)</p>
<p>This includes 36,391 in the Hospitality and Restaurant &amp; Bar sectors. This is an estimate based on the notices received by the Workforce Partnership. The full impact to employees and the region’s economy is higher as not all employers submit WARN notices.</p>
<p>215 open jobs that the Workforce Partnership team is working to fill with local employers in our Career Portal</p>
<p>Data from the U.S. Department of Labor: California unemployment insurance claims fell by a third last week, to 214,028. This is still 85% above the pre-COVID record and four times the past decade’s average weekly claims, but the decrease is welcome, and we hope to see it continue this week and next as counties across the state enter Phase 2 of the reopening plan.</p>

<p>CITY LAUNCHES BETTER BY BIKE EFFORT</p>
<p>To celebrate National Bike Month in May and to highlight work to improve bicycling infrastructure, the City of San Diego is launching Better By Bike, an outreach and education effort aimed at encouraging more residents to consider commuting by bicycle. The City’s Climate Action Plan calls for an increase in commuter bicycling opportunities, especially in communities near major transit stops.</p>
<p>During May, the City is teaming up with the San Diego County Bicycle Coalition for the Love to Ride 25-day bicycling challenge, with events like the Family Week ride and New Cyclist Week.</p>
<p>People are urged to ride solo or with family members to comply with physical distancing guidelines; indoor rides on stationary bikes are also counted toward participation. Prize drawings will be held each week of the challenge.</p>
<p>“With so many San Diegans staying home to help stop the spread of Covid-19, more people are also hopping on their bikes for exercise and to run essential errands, or just to feel connected while maintaining distance,” said chief sustainability officer Cody Hooven. “We hope this becomes a new habit for people as they realize you don’t need to be an athlete or expert cyclist to commute by bicycle. For your health and the health of our environment, it really is better to go by bike when you can.”</p>
<p>According to Caltrans, traffic volume on roads statewide is down an average of 35% compared to this time last year. Meanwhile, bicycling is up 55% over expected volumes during the first week of May in cities across the southwestern part of the United States, according to data posted by Eco-Counter.</p>
<p>Last month, in response to requests from residents, commuter bikeways within city limits were reopened, including the State Route 56 bikeway and the San Diego River bikeway connecting Mission Valley and Ocean Beach. The City recently launched a Slow Streets program to allow more space for residents who are walking or bicycling in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To sign up for the Love to Ride 25-day challenge, visit lovetoride.net/sandiegocounty. Participants who sign up and log their rides online may be eligible for prizes, including new Brooklyn Bicycle cruiser, cycling gear and more. Share photos of your ride on social media using the hashtag #BetterByBike. Learn more about the City’s bicycling program by visiting sandiego.gov/bicycling.</p>

<p>CITY REPAVING ONE OF ITS BUSIEST STREETS</p>
<p>Taking advantage of reduced traffic due to the pandemic, Mayor Kevin Faulconer on May 12 ordered the repaving of the main stretch of North Harbor Drive leading to the San Diego International Airport – one of the busiest streets in the City. Faulconer was joined this morning by City Council member Mark Kersey, chair of the Active Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority, to announce the project.</p>
<p>“First impressions are important, and the first thing most people see when they come to San Diego is the bumpy ride as they leave the San Diego International Airport,” Faulconer said. “This stretch of road is so busy that there’s never really a convenient time to make repairs, so we’re taking advantage of the reduced traffic from the statewide stay-at-home order to overhaul and improve this major thoroughfare for the first time in two decades.”</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, the City began repaving 3.3 miles along North Harbor Drive between Ash Street to Nimitz Boulevard in both directions. In addition, the project includes buffered bike lanes through striping modifications. Traffic along North Harbor Drive has been reduced by 50 percent as a result of COVID-19. The paving project is expected to be completed in three weeks.</p>
<p>“During this crisis, San Diego International Airport has remained open as a critical piece of the nation’s transportation infrastructure,” said Kimberly Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “And Harbor Drive is a critical artery helping people get to and from the airport. So we’re excited to see the City moving forward with plans to rehabilitate this roadway.”</p>
<p>REP. PETERS WORKING VIRTUALLY</p>
<p>Congressman Peters continues to work via teleconferencing for California’s 52nd district carrying out his legislative duties remotely while following public health guidance.</p>
<p>“The way we keep people safe and get our economy moving again is through testing, tracing, and treatment,&rdquo; said Peters.“Hearing from the Federal Trade Commission gave us important information to consider as we construct and coordinate innovative systems to allow for safe re-opening.</p>
<p>“While technology can be used to bolster testing and contact tracing efforts, we must work diligently with the tech community to monitor the rollout of any tools aimed at helping track the spread of the virus,” continued Peters. “Regulations will need to be implemented to prevent the abuse of any personal data gathered, and the public’s vigilance will be critical in protecting individuals’ sensitive information online. We should utilize technology in a way that helps our cause in preventing spread, but that doesn’t exploit Americans’ right to privacy, too.”</p>
<p>Added Peters: “According to public health experts, we are going to need $46.5 billion to get adequate testing up and running, with an additional 180,000 people to expand the contact tracing workforce. Robust testing, in tandem with proper contact tracing, will be essential to re-open the economy, and appropriately applied technology will be an important tool to help us do just that.”</p>
<p>The 52nd District of California covers much of central San Diego County including Poway, Coronado, and large portions of the City of San Diego. He is a member of the House Energy &amp; Commerce and Budget Committees. The Congressman is a former environmental attorney, City Council president, and Port Commission chair.</p>
<p>LA JOLLA ON-RAMP CLOSURES POSTPONED</p>

<p>CITY COUNCIL COMMITTEE CONSIDERS NOVEMBER BALLOT PROPOSALS</p>
<p>The City Council’s Rules Committee tomorrow will discuss 17 proposed measures and decide which of them merit further consideration for placement on the November 2020 ballot. Nine of the measures were submitted by individual San Diegans, four by local advocacy groups, and four by City officials, including Council members, the City Attorney, the City Auditor, and the Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>The ideas include removing the coastal height limit in the Sports Arena area, implementing ranked-choice voting in San Diego’s general elections, and updating the City’s contracting policies to remain eligible for state grant funding.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many ideas coming from engaged members of our community,” Council president and Rules Committee chair Georgette Gómez said. “I look forward to discussing these proposals with my committee colleagues, and also hearing from the public which ones should be advanced to the ballot.”</p>
<p>Those measures that the committee advances for additional analysis will return to the Rules Committee to be considered for review by the full City Council.</p>

<p>PLHS GRAD IS A DUAL STUDENT-ATHLETE</p>
<p>Being a full-time student, playing a sport, and working is already hard enough. Imagine attending two colleges and being a full-time student at both. That’s a total of 24 units in a semester while playing a sport, and working on top of that. You have to be extremely disciplined and dedicated to being a dual athlete.</p>
<p>Savannah Ames is a dual student-athlete on San Diego Mesa College’s softball team. Ames, a Point Loma High School alumni, attends both San Diego Mesa College and Point Loma Nazarene University. Ames majors in communications and plans on graduating from PLNU in the fall of 2020. She carries a GPA over 3.0 at both colleges, PLNU 3.4 GPA, and Mesa 3.8 GPA.</p>
<p>UNCLAIMED MONEY AT CITY OF SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>Anyone who has done business with the City of San Diego in the past three years, including paying business taxes, could be owed money. Check amounts range from $1 to $22,000. The City regularly receives returned checks that are undeliverable based on the address on file. Checks that remain uncashed after six months become unclaimed monies.</p>
<p>The unclaimed monies report is available at sandiego.gov/finance/unclaimed and is updated quarterly. There is no charge to search the data or to file a claim. Since this time last year, the City returned $368,000 to 119 recipients who were listed on the unclaimed monies report, meaning 29% of the unclaimed monies were returned by the City. The average claim was $3,091.</p>
<p>Currently, there are nearly 1,700 accounts with more than $660,000 in unclaimed monies belonging to people or businesses that have not received money owed to them because of refunds or vendor payments. Payees have approximately one year to claim their money after it’s been added to the unclaimed monies report. The last day to submit a claim for checks issued prior to April 1, 2019, is Thursday, June 18. To submit a claim, print and complete the Request for Unclaimed Monies form.</p>
<p>NEW POP-UP BRUNCH AT OB EATERY</p>
<p>A just-launched pop-up eatery has brought a new take-out brunch option to Ob. Called Loco Lopez and run by chef Richard Lopez, is operating Wednesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. out of the same Sunset Cliffs Boulevard space as Sundara Indian Kitchen, which has remained open throughout this shelter-at-home phase. With restaurants likely limited in their reopening capacity, Sundara co-founder Adam Lowe said the 38-seat eatery will likely continue to focus on its take-out business even after the dine-in ban is lifted.</p>
<p>Lowe approached Lopez with the offer to share the kitchen. The chef previously worked at Sundara, and has cooked in fine-dining restaurants as well as local hotels like the Hotel del Coronado.</p>
<p>Seeing a void in the to-go brunch market, Lopez created a menu of takeout-friendly dishes that includes a breakfast burrito wrapped in a cheese-crusted tortilla, a doughnut grilled cheese served with serrano jam, and bacon-wrapped hot dogs accompanied by house chips.</p>
<p>Though it’s starting as a pop-up, the chef says he’s hoping to make Loco Lopez permanent, either in the Sundara space or elsewhere. He’ll continue to expand the menu and is planning to eventually offer mimosas, micheladas, beer, and wine.</p>

<p>NEEDY FAMILIES TO RECEIVE FOOD FROM UNION VOLUNTEERS</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego in partnership with the San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council, will host mass “drive-through” food distributions for San Diego families and seniors in need at SDCCU Stadium (formerly Qualcomm) every Saturday in May from 9 a.m. until all of the food is gone. Teachers, construction workers, nurses, grocery workers and more are mobilizing donations, volunteering and providing logistical support. The distribution is first-come, first-served for 1,100 vehicles starting at 9 a.m. on May 16, 23 and 30. The San Diego and Imperial Counties Labor Council is a community of more than 200,000 working families standing together.</p>
<p>SCHOOL DISTRICTS WARN LESS STATE FUNDS WOULD CAUSE ‘HARM’</p>
<p>San Diego Unified Superintendent Cindy Marten and Los Angeles Unified Superintendent Austin Beutner issued a joint statement in response to the Department of Finance’s preliminary estimates on the California State budget and the need for federal relief:</p>
<p>“A 20 percent reduction in state funds to public education, which would be about $2,700 less per student, would cause irreparable harm to children,” the superintendents said. “California already spends significantly less on public education than other large states. Moreover, reopening school facilities in a safe manner this fall will also require more funding.</p>
<p>“Our efforts to enhance the quality of distance learning and provide a safety net to students and families during this public health crisis have been comprehensive and responsive to student’s needs,” continued their joint release. “With approximately 240,000 devices and close to 18 million meals provided in Los Angeles and San Diego, the immediate challenges posed by Covid-19 have significantly increased costs for our schools.”</p>
<p>Noted both superintendents: “Implicit in every budget are a series of choices, which are made more difficult when the dollars are scarce. But they are still choices that elected officials in Sacramento must make and the consequences will have an impact on an entire generation of children. This generation has a right to an education, and a 20% reduction in state school spending would deny students this right. Simply put, that level of spending reduction would make it impossible for schools to safely reopen this fall.”</p>

<p>GARNET BUILDING IN PB SELLS FOR NEARLY $2 MILLION</p>
<p>A prominent freestanding 4,500-square-foot building that has a John Lennon mural painted on the side across from Chase Bank at 1020 Garnet Ave. in Pacific Beach was sold for $1.9 million.</p>

<p>“Pacific Beach continues to evolve as a dynamic neighborhood and ideal location for investors in San Diego. Coastal pockets have historically been able to weather downturns better than other submarkets, and I think PB will continue to be a great area to invest in,” said Pyke.</p>
<p>The sale adds to a steady increase of activity in the PB area for Pyke and Campbell. Over the past year, the team secured leases with F45 at 1245 Garnet Ave., Fritzy’s Roller Skate Shop at The Promenade at Pacific Beach; sourced new leases with Yoga Box, PB Training, and San Diego Sliders Co. at 909 Grand Ave.; and advised retail client QWENCH Juice Bar on its first San Diego location at 4462 Mission Blvd.</p>

<p>WHAT’S RED TIDE AND WHY DOES IT SMELL?</p>
<p>Bioluminescence expert Michael Latz, a scientist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, said the current red tide, which stretches from Baja California to Los Angeles, is due to aggregations of the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedra, a species well known for its bioluminescent displays. Each microscopic cell contains some “sunscreen,” giving it a reddish-brown color.</p>
<p>On sunny days, the organisms swim toward the surface where they concentrate, resulting in the intensified coloration of the water – and the reason for the term &ldquo;red tide.&rdquo; At night, when the phytoplankton are agitated by waves or other movement in the water, they emit a dazzling neon blue glow.</p>
<p>The ocean along San Diego County is still brown in color, but now the sulfury odor is intense. The strong odor has reached about 1 ½ miles inland. There is also foam, indicating the breakdown of protein and other organic material. There are also reports of fish kills along beaches and in lagoons and harbors. The breakdown of the red tide by microbes results in low oxygen conditions that are deleterious to some animals.</p>
<p>Is the water safe for surfing/swimming? In some areas such as the Mediterranean, Lingulodinium polyedra produces yessotoxin, a compound that acts as a neurotoxin, but local populations do not produce yessotoxin. However, some people are sensitive to inhaling air associated with the red tide, so the organisms must be producing other compounds that can affect human health. In general, during a red tide, there is lots of dissolved and particulate matter in the water with associated enhanced microbial activity. It is a personal choice whether to go in the water, but there is no public health warning associated with the red tide.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL RELIEF TEAMS SUPPLYING SD FOOD BANK</p>
<p>San Diego-based International Relief Teams is providing the Jacobs &amp; Cushman San Diego Food Bank with more than $90,000 worth of canned goods to help meet the increased demand for food assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Donated canned goods include black beans, pinto beans, mixed vegetables, and tuna totaling more than 121,000 cans. The food will be delivered in two large truckloads on May 7-8.</p>
<p>“IRT is dedicated to helping families in need. We know that many San Diego families are suffering right now because of the shutdown, and we wanted to help ensure that they can access the food they need. We have partnered with the San Diego Food Bank for many years and we are proud to support their extraordinary response to this pandemic,” said Barry La Forgia, International Relief Teams’ executive director.</p>
<p>ILLUMINA DONATES $1 MILLION TO SD SCHOOLS, FRONTLINE WORKERS</p>
<p>The Illumina Corporate Foundation has directed the $1 million gift to The San Diego Foundation COVID-19 Community Fund, which was created to provide resources to low-income workers, families and vulnerable communities most affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Illumina’s donation directs $700,000 to the San Diego Unified School District to help K-12 distance learning and $300,000 to support frontline healthcare workers, food security and small business programs. The COVID-19 Community Response Fund has raised over $10.8 million.</p>
<p>“We are proud to call San Diego home and are dedicated to supporting impactful relief efforts in our hometown. From individuals to communities, from companies to countries, we are finding ways to support each other and address the pandemic together,” said Sam Samad, senior vice president/CFO of Illumina. “One of the brightest silver linings of this time is the amount of innovation in service to others.”</p>
<p>As San Diego families and students transition to distance learning provided by SDUSD, access to reliable internet and technology are essential. Illumina’s donation will support K-12 distance learning programs for students without internet access, as well as science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the support of Illumina, we have worked to guarantee all students in San Diego have what they need to continue their educational journey and pursue their dreams,” SDUSD Superintendent Cindy Marten said. “Illumina’s donation to the San Diego Foundation will allow us to continue to provide our families the technology and services they need to access information and to continue learning now and into the future. We are very thankful for our long-standing partnership with Illumina.”</p>
<p>Illumina is the biggest and highest-valued biotech company in San Diego County. Its mission is improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome. The company is working to put an end to the spread of COVID-19 by making DNA sequencing accessible around the world.</p>

<p>FEEDING SAN DIEGO PURCHASES 125 TRUCKLOADS OF FOOD FOR HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego has purchased 125 truckloads of food since March 14 to meet a countywide surge in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. The organization normally purchases approximately 24 truckloads in an entire year.</p>
<p>The increased reliance on purchased food is helping the organization to meet the needs of the nearly one out of every eight San Diegans struggling with hunger prior to the COVID-19 crisis, but also thousands of newly affected residents as San Diego’s unemployment rate reaches 25%. The increased demand comes at a time when Feeding San Diego has experienced a 30 percent decline in donations from local grocery stores due to high consumer demand.</p>
<p>“We are experiencing a tremendous surge in people facing hunger across San Diego County right now, with an estimated 40 percent facing food insecurity for the first time,” said Vince Hall, CEO of Feeding San Diego. “The wave of children, families and seniors in need isn&rsquo;t slowing down — and neither are we because no San Diegan should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from. We are grateful to the thousands of San Diegans who have generously donated to Feeding San Diego during this unprecedented crisis. Our donors from across this generous community make our work possible every day.”</p>
<p>Feeding San Diego offers no-touch, drive-through food assistance at hundreds of sites throughout San Diego County. The organization’s food finder map has become a valuable resource to the community and can be found at feedingsandiego.org/find-food. Additional community resources are accessible by calling 2-1-1 or visiting 211sandiego.org.</p>
<p>ROCK CHURCH DELIVERS MEALS IN COVID-19 HUNGER RELIEF</p>
<p>Rock Church in Point Loma has put out the “bat signal” and local restaurants and delivery services have answered the call to band together and bring hunger relief to frontline hospital heroes and first responders. So far, 3,680 meals have been delivered to 13 hospitals throughout San Diego County.</p>
<p>Meals were delivered recently by Rock Church pastor Miles McPherson, a former Chargers player, along with former NFL Hall-of-Fame wide receiver Andre Reed. The pair delivered 50 meals to the San Diego Police Department and 50 meals to the San Diego 911 Call Center.</p>
<p>“I had no idea what an act of service being a 911 dispatcher does to keep people safe,” said Reed. “The SDPD is a huge piece to our San Diego community. After visiting them, I truly have an added respect for our police force, another set of frontline heroes to serve with the Rock Church and pastor Miles.”</p>
<p>The church has been working with Grub Hub to coordinate deliveries and restaurants including Los Primos, Toast, Lola 55, Neighborhood House Association, Beignet Belly, Chick-fil-A and California Pizza Kitchen, which have signed on for the task. Among the 13 hospitals are Sharp Grossmont, Sharp Memorial, Sharp Chula Vista, Sharp Coronado, Kaiser San Diego Medical Center, Kaiser Zion Medical Center, UCSD Hillcrest, UCSD LaJolla, Scripps La Jolla, Scripps Mercy Chula Vista, VA Hospital in Ja Jolla, Palomar Poway and Palomar Escondido.</p>

<p>NIH GRANT ADVANCES RESEARCH AT UC SAN DIEGO</p>
<p>The Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute at University of California San Diego has received a five-year, $54.7 million Clinical and Translational Science Award from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science, part of the National Institutes of Health. The new grant is the third such award since ACTRI opened in 2010, bringing total funding support to approximately $144 million.</p>
<p>“The first CTSA laid the foundation for transforming our institution. It built the early infrastructure that would help change the way we thought about moving discoveries from the lab to the clinic,” said Gary S. Firestein, MD, founding director of ACTRI and dean and associate vice chancellor of clinical and translational research at UC San Diego School of Medicine. “The second CTSA focused on making ACTRI the hub for clinical research and clinical trials at UC San Diego.”</p>
<p>The latest CTSA, said Firestein, will refine the fundamental work of the past decade and provide new resources that will launch a new wave of discovery and transformation.</p>
<p>The new funding will also be used to continue a scholar program supporting young faculty members establishing careers, expand ACTRI’s “Game Center,” a program that uses virtual reality games to train investigators in team science and create new mentoring programs in grant-writing, the financial lifeblood of research.</p>
<p>There are approximately 2,400 ongoing clinical trials at UC San Diego Health, involving an estimated 7,000 participants in active treatment. Approximately 250 new trials begin each year, including most recently COVID-19-related trials investigating an antiviral drug, an arthritis drug and a medication for hypertension.</p>

<p>Parking lots remain closed.</p>
<p>GOLF COURSES</p>
<p>City of San Diego golf courses reopened with physical distancing and face-covering mandates.</p>
<p>FACIAL COVERINGS NOW REQUIRED AT AIRPORT</p>
<p>Per the California Health and Safety Code sections 101040, 120175, and 120175.5 (b), facial coverings are now required at San Diego International Airport (SAN) for all passengers, visitors, tenants, contractors, and employees while on airport property. The mandate is to help curb the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>As stated by the County of San Diego Health Officer, persons with a medical or mental health condition, or developmental disability that prevents wearing a face covering, shall be exempt from this requirement.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Public Health, a cloth face covering is a material that covers the nose and mouth. It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.</p>
<p>The airport has placed red tape markings on floors at security checkpoints, airline ticket counters, and concession areas to adhere to six-foot social distancing rules. All airport users are also encouraged to comply with social distancing requirements and follow CDC guidelines to stop the spread of germs which include washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>“SAN’s top priority is the health and safety of all airport users,” said Kim Becker, president/CEO of the San Diego County Regional Airport Authority. “We’ve taken many steps to help curb the spread of COVID-19 and appreciate all airport users adhering to the local and state health orders.”</p>
<p>SDIA offers nonstop service to more than 70 destinations in the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, Mexico and Canada. In operation since 1928, the airport celebrated more than 90 years of service to the San Diego region in 2018. The San Diego County Regional Airport Authority has managed the airport since 2003. The Airport Authority plans for and provides air transportation services to the region with safe, effective facilities that exceed customer expectations. For more information, visit san.org.</p>
<p>AMTRAK CELEBRATES 49TH ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>Today, Amtrak celebrated its 49th anniversary. For almost five decades, Amtrak has taken U.S. passenger rail customers where they need and want to go. Formally known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak consolidated the services of more than a dozen railroads into a truly national system when it first started. And, while observing this anniversary during an unprecedented time in history, Amtrack continues to provide a vital service to its customers, many of whom are medical professionals and first responders.</p>

<p>CONGRESSMAN PETERS SIGNS LETTER URGING GREATER MENTAL HEALTH, SUICIDE PREVENTION, DURING PANDEMIC</p>
<p>On May 1, Rep. Scott Peters joined 49 of his colleagues in sending a letter to House leadership urging for increased support prioritizing the mental health of the American public during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The bipartisan group of lawmakers requested greater investment in mental health resources and suicide prevention efforts given the unprecedented public health crisis and growing cases of economic insecurity – two stressors linked to mental health challenges and heightened risk of suicide.</p>
<p>The letter advocated for the incorporation of critical provisions in future coronavirus response and recovery packages. This would help address the mental health challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, like enhanced funding for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) and inclusion of the Effective Suicide Screening and Assessment in the Emergency Department Act, which would assist emergency departments to develop better suicide risk protocols.</p>
<p>“We must support our nation’s system of crisis response services, fortify our emergency departments to adequately respond to self-harm, and prepare schools to address the mental health needs of children upon their return in the fall,” the legislators wrote.</p>
<p>MAY IS BICYCLE SAFETY MONTH</p>
<p>For bicycle safety month, Circulate San Diego is encouraging people walking, driving, or riding their bikes to look out for one another while practicing social-distancing.</p>
<p>While shelter-in-place orders are in effect, San Diegans still need to get to essential jobs, run errands, or go outside to exercise. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer unveiled his slow streets initiative this week to make it easier for San Diegans to travel safely while social distancing.</p>
<p>Faulconer’s slow streets initiative includes closing segments of Diamond Street, Adams Avenue, and Howard Street to through vehicular traffic to allow for social distancing for people walking and bicycling. He also announced improvements to pedestrian crosswalk buttons and the re-opening of state Route 56 Bikeway, Rose Creek Bikeway, Rose Canyon Bikeway and the state Route 52 Bikeway.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, San Diegans are finding that bicycling is a great way to travel to an essential job, to access essential needs, and exercise,” Maya Rosas, director of policy at Circulate San Diego said. “It’s important for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians to keep you and your family safe by remaining aware of your surroundings even though there is less vehicular traffic.”</p>
<p>Circulate San Diego has created a webpage with bike-friendly resources to encourage residents to get out and bike, safely and comfortably at circulatesd.org/may_is_bike_month.</p>
