<p>With touring off the table, Papa Roach are resorting to other ways to still celebrate the 20th anniversary of their breakout album, Infest. On deck is a livestream event on June 20 where the group will perform the record in its entirety.</p>
<p>The ticketed event, which starts at 2PM PT, is being billed as &ldquo;Infest In-Studio.&rdquo; In addition to performing the multi-platinum record in full, Papa Roach will take time to reflect on Infest, presumably recollecting the writing and recording process as well as the instant success that came along with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t take not performing any longer,&rdquo; said frontman Jacoby Shaddix. &ldquo;Having performed the Infest album in full as a surprise one time before (during the band&rsquo;s sold-out 2015 gig at London&rsquo;s Roundhouse on the album&rsquo;s 15th anniversary), we decided to open this infestation to every living-room in the world to celebrate the 20th anniversary with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bassist Tobin Esperance added, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll probably want to move your furniture around a little bit. We&rsquo;ve all got to get some of that quarantine energy out of our system. We&rsquo;ll also have our brother Jerry Horton back from his injury so watch out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Head here for more info.</p>
<p>This performance marks a continuation of Papa Roach&rsquo;s 20th anniversary plans as the group held an &ldquo;Infest In-Conversation&rdquo; livestream on April 25, the exact anniversary date. Over 1.8 million fans tuned in to watch the band reminisce about the record alongside their peers in Linkin Park, Deftones, Korn, Avenged Sevenfold and more.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s even more for fans to look forward to as Papa Roach are working on an Infest-era documentary as well as brand new music.

<p>When Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington took his own life in 2017, most fans probably thought they would never hear new music from him again.</p>
<p>But this weekend a new album, featuring vocals Chester recorded more than 20 years ago, is being streamed around the world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s based on songs he wrote with Grey Daze, the band he was in before Linkin Park - and features guest stars from the music industry and Chester&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It felt like it gave me a little bit of closure with losing him, something that I was able to work on for a couple of years in his honour,&rdquo; Grey Daze&rsquo;s drummer Sean Dowdell tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I feel like I did my friend justice, you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chester Bennington, pictured here in 2001, sold over 70 million albums with Linkin Park</p>
<p>During their career, Linkin Park sold tens of millions of albums, won two Grammy Awards and released a collaboration album with Jay-Z.</p>
<p>But Sean says - even with all this going on - it was actually Chester&rsquo;s idea to reform their 90s band Grey Daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 2016, we decided we wanted make sure people got to hear this music,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Linkin Park&rsquo;s debut album, Hybrid Theory, came out in the year 2000</p>
<p>Chester never got the chance to re-record his vocals - but Sean still wanted to finish the project however he could.</p>
<p>That meant keeping the original vocals intact but re-recording absolutely everything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the reasons this took two and a half years because we were in uncharted territory - we had to reverse engineer these songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think we did a great job. I think we created a masterpiece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Tom Preston Image caption Grey Daze&rsquo;s album is being streamed to fans for the first time this weekend</p>
<p>The album, called Amends, features not only Grey Daze&rsquo;s original line-up, but also Chester&rsquo;s friends from bands including Korn and Breaking Benjamin - and even members of his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About halfway through the recording process a kind of a lightning bolt hit me in the chest,&rdquo; Sean says. &ldquo;I realised we could actually give something back to Chester during this process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We realised we could have his children come in and sing these songs with him - something he never got to do while he was alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we had Chester&rsquo;s son Jaime come in to sing backing vocals on a track called Soul Song and I think his dad would be very proud of the job he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jaime Bennington is one of Chester&rsquo;s six children</p>
<p>Sean says going back to the old music was sometimes difficult - but eventually it felt like he and Chester were working together again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wrote all the lyrics together and while I was writing from more of a philosophical point of view, I can clearly see, now he&rsquo;s gone, that these were real pain points that he was living in his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re writing it, it has one meaning and then after you lose your friend, and you look back, it takes on a whole new meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The album was originally supposed to be released on April 10 but, because of the coronavirus lockdown, this has been pushed back to June.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disappoint people, though, the band are holding virtual listening parties this weekend, where fans can sign up to hear the record before it comes out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chester was not a rock star in my world he was just one of my best friends,&rdquo; Sean says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the tragic things about Chester was he was so giving for other people and put them so much higher than himself that he never really got to a point of appreciating himself or loving himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one tragedy in all of this is that Chester really never felt like he was enough for anybody and it&rsquo;s one of the things that led him down this path with his depression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was a wonderful man.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="depressions-toll-rises-with-death-of-linkin-park-singer">&ldquo;Depression&rsquo;s toll rises with death of Linkin Park singer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/bncore/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chester-Bennington-1.jpg" alt="img">
It was, by most accounts, a typical July day. Summer had set in, but the dog days were still a few weeks in the distance.</p>
<p>Los Angeles was its usual self. Sunny, warm and bustling, the entertainment capital of the world had just opened for another day of business.</p>
<p>But this day would not be just another one at the office. Just as most people in Los Angeles were settling into work, the music world was dealt a shocking blow: Chester Bennington, the 41-year-old Linkin Park singer who had captivated millions with his ability to juxtapose angsty screams with melodic whispers, was dead, having hanged himself in his bedroom.</p>
<p>It was a dark ending for a man with a dark past. Bennington’s parents split when he was 11. He was repeatedly sexually abused as an adolescent. This led Bennington to explore – and subsequently become addicted to – drugs and alcohol as a means of escape.</p>
<p>However, since pledging to be clean in 2006, it had seemed Bennington had been able to escape his demons. This is what made the man’s death particularly polarizing. The singer had, in many respects, become an example of what a man who had recovered from addiction and depression could do. He was a fitness nut, working out several times a day. He was a clothing model for Porsche Design and Hugo Boss. He even began speaking out in support of those fighting the demons of drug abuse and depression.</p>
<p>And, perhaps most notably, he continued to be the frontman of one of the biggest modern bands in the world. He showed all the signs of overcoming his troubles. His death proved otherwise.</p>
<p>What the drugs and alcohol only partially displayed was that the troubled singer had a problem beyond addiction. Sure, at one point Bennington was addicted to drugs and alcohol, but it was not addiction that would ultimately directly lead to his death. It was depression.</p>
<p>Even in a time when self-expression and emotion are increasingly encouraged, a stigma still surrounds depression. That’s concerning, because depression is the undiagnosed epidemic of America: The National Institute of Mental Health estimates 16 million Americans, or about 6.9 percent of the population, has had &ldquo;at least one major depressive episode&rdquo; in a calendar year. Heroin and obesity epidemics have made major headlines – as they should – but depression, which has become just as prevalent, if not even more than heroin and obesity, often gets subconsciously shoved to the back page.</p>
<p>And like any true epidemic, depression has no bounds. Bennington is the perfect example of that. The Linkin Park frontman had seemed to have it all: a successful career, a nice house, and a beautiful wife and family. None of it was enough to help Bennington escape himself.</p>
<p>Depression isn’t like obesity or even addiction, in that it’s often an invisible disease. Except in interviews in which Bennington would retrospectively talk about his bouts with depression, the man was always upbeat and smiling. He was full of energy, seemingly full of life.</p>
<p>But Bennington was suffering – it was just an internal pain. He at one point even admitted, &ldquo;If I’m getting out of myself and being with other people, like being a dad, being a husband, being a bandmate, being a friend, helping someone out … If I’m out of myself, I’m great. If I’m inside all the time, I’m horrible – I’m a mess …This place right here [points to his head], this skull between my ears, that is a bad neighborhood, and I should not be in there alone. I can’t be in there by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bennington suffered from depression for most of his life, but it really began in his teen years. The combination of being sexually abused, his parents divorcing, all while enduring bullying at school depressed Bennington. Drugs were the only thing that could (temporarily) help that.</p>
<p>And while Bennington’s case may be a bit extreme, it draws attention to the teenage depression that medical professionals have long deemed a disturbingly large health risk.</p>
<p>Health experts say depression and suicidal distress originate from psychological, environmental and social aspects of a subject’s life. Especially with the popularity of social media making it easier than ever before to compare one’s life to the oftentimes superficially glamorous ones of celebrities or even simply the &ldquo;popular&rdquo; kids at school, cases of depression and suicide have not only grown for those between the ages of 15-24, but have become almost encouraged by cult-like groups on social media.</p>
<p>So, the question becomes, what can be done to battle depression? In a word, experts stress awareness. Awareness of depression and suicide is the best approach to curbing this disturbing trend. For though depression is an often invisible disease, the American Psychological Association says there can be signs someone is struggling. These include recent weight loss, change in personality, behavior, sleep patterns and/or eating habits, low self-esteem, talking about death and erratic, uncharacteristic actions.</p>
<p>Bennington displayed many of these characteristics, and though he never explicitly asked for help, he was practically pleading in his actions and words. His death was probably preventable had those around him known the telltale signs of someone who is struggling.</p>
<p>Bennington was 41. He was 21 years removed from being a teenager, and yet it was the demons that found him during those years that he’d never be able to fully overcome. The teenage and young adult periods of a person’s life build the foundation for the rest of their years, and in Bennington’s case, it set the stage for his untimely demise.</p>
<p>And though his death is tragic, it should also serve as a catalyst for better mental health awareness in a world that desperately needs it.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171013024625-chester-bennington-carpool-karaoke-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Now, nearly a year after Linkin Park lead singer Chester Bennington took his own life, it&rsquo;s clear to his widow that in the days before he died, there were warning signs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now more educated about those signs, but they were definitely there: the hopelessness, the change of behavior, isolation,&rdquo; Talinda Bennington told CNN during an interview with CNN&rsquo;s Anderson Cooper during the CNN Town Hall, &ldquo;Finding Hope: Battling America&rsquo;s Suicide Crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The program airs Sunday, June 24, at 7 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>But, Bennington explained, these behaviors weren&rsquo;t uncommon for her husband, a father of six who had battled depression for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all part of our daily life,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sometimes, some signs were there more than others. Sometimes, they weren&rsquo;t there at all.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="5-linkin-park-lyrics-that-still-hit-hard-today">&ldquo;5 Linkin Park lyrics that still hit hard today&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tone-deaf-linkin-park-lyrics-1.jpg" alt="img">
In 2017, the music industry lost one of the most admired mainstream songwriters of the past two decades. Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington battled against depression for most of his life and bravely exposed his personal turmoil in poignant lyrics that touched a generation of fans. We revisit five songs that showcase his ability to turn inner demons into inspiring poetry.</p>
<p>The ferocious frontman was found dead on a Thursday morning of July in his California home. He was 41, and his band, the Platinum-selling rock powerhouse Linkin Park had debuted just a few months earlier at No. 1 on the Billboard albums chart with their seventh outing, One More Light.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County coroner’s office ruled the death as suicide by hanging and confirmed that no drugs were present at the scene, only a half-empty bottle of alcohol.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine a world without you in it,” Bennington wrote earlier in May in a note dedicated to his friend and idol Chris Cornell, who took his own life just hours after performing with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre in Detroit.</p>
<p>“I pray you find peace in the next life,” wrote the musician, in a painfully ironic gesture that would later turn out to be premonitory.</p>
<p>Chester Charles Bennington was born in 1976, in Phoenix, the youngest of four children. The singer described his childhood as a dark time in his life, being a victim of sexual abuse from an older friend since he was seven years old until he was 13.</p>
<p>“It destroyed my self-confidence,” Bennington recalled in a 2008 interview with Kerrang! magazine. “Like most people, I was too afraid to say anything. I didn’t want people to think I was gay or that I was lying. It was a horrible experience.”</p>
<p>Bullied at school and going through the divorce of his parents, the singer fell deeper into a state of despair from which he could only find solace in poetry, drawing and later on, in music.</p>
<p>“I have been able to tap into all the negative things that can happen to me throughout my life by numbing myself to the pain, so to speak, and kind of being able to vent it through my music,” he explained in an interview with Noisecreep in 2009.</p>
<p>Linkin Park broke into the scene in the late ’90s with a distinct brand of rock that successfully blended heavy metal guitars with hip-hop and electronica. But one of the traits that made the band unique among its contemporaries was the ability to create surprisingly mature lyrics that gave to their music both a sense of gravitas and accessibility.</p>
<p>From political meditations like ‘The Catalyst’, to the brutally honest descriptions of mental health struggles in ‘Easier To Run’, every Linkin Park album is characterised by incisive songwriting that is surprisingly relatable. We picked five tracks that exemplify what the band is capable of.</p>
<p>‘Crawling’, from Hybrid Theory, 2000</p>
<p>Crawling in my skin</p>
<p>These wounds, they will not heal</p>
<p>Fear is how I fall</p>
<p>Confusing what is real</p>
<p>There’s something inside me that pulls beneath the surface</p>
<p>Consuming, confusing</p>
<p>This lack of self control I fear is never ending</p>
<p>Controlling, I can’t seem</p>
<p>To find myself again</p>
<p>My walls are closing in</p>
<p>(Without a sense of confidence I’m convinced</p>
<p>That there’s just too much pressure to take)</p>
<p>I’ve felt this way before</p>
<p>So insecure</p>
<p>‘Crawling’ was the second single from their debut album Hybrid Theory and is probably the most defining song for their career. Inspired by the singer’s struggles with substance abuse, the track opens and closes with a filtered sound of water running down the drain, almost as a dark analogy to a life that slipping away out of control.</p>
<p>“‘Crawling,’ for example, is probably the most literal song lyrically I’d ever written for Linkin Park,” Bennington told Noisecreep.</p>
<p>“That’s about feeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol. That feeling, being able to write about it, sing about it, that song, those words sold millions of records, I won a Grammy, I made a lot of money,” he continued.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I could’ve been inspired to create something like that by watching someone else go through that. So in a lot of ways that’s been very constructive for me.”</p>
<p>‘Breaking The Habit’, from Meteora, 2003</p>
<p>Memories consume like opening the wound</p>
<p>I’m picking me apart again</p>
<p>You all assume</p>
<p>I’m safe here in my room</p>
<p>Unless I try to start again</p>
<p>I don’t want to be the one the battles always choose</p>
<p>‘Cause inside I realize that I’m the one confused</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s worth fighting for</p>
<p>Or why I have to scream</p>
<p>I don’t know why I instigate</p>
<p>And say what I don’t mean</p>
<p>I don’t know how I got this way</p>
<p>I know it’s not alright</p>
<p>So I’m breaking the habit</p>
<p>I’m breaking the habit tonight</p>
<p>The track was the fifth consecutive single from their sophomore album to reach number one on the “Billboard Modern Rock Tracks” chart, a record no other artist has achieved in the history of that particular countdown.</p>
<p>Unlike other tracks in their discography, the song doesn’t feature the band’s characteristic distorted guitars or counterpoint rapping courtesy of Mike Shinoda. The weight of the song is carried by stinging lyrics that are precise enough to hurt, but vague enough to mean different things to every listener.</p>
<p>Co-written by Shinoda and Bennington, the song poses as a desperate call to action from someone who is clinging to the edge. And who hasn’t felt like that?</p>
<p>‘Hands held High’, from Minutes To Midnight, 2007</p>
<p>Fuck that, I want to see some fist pumping</p>
<p>The world is cold</p>
<p>The bold men take action</p>
<p>Have to react</p>
<p>Or get blown into fractions</p>
<p>Ten years old is something to see</p>
<p>Another kid my age drugged under a jeep</p>
<p>Taken and bound and found later under a tree</p>
<p>I wonder if he thought the “next one could be me”</p>
<p>Do you see?</p>
<p>The soldiers they’re out today</p>
<p>That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away</p>
<p>It’s ironic</p>
<p>At times like this you pray</p>
<p>But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday</p>
<p>There’s bombs in the buses, bikes, roads</p>
<p>Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes</p>
<p>My dad, he’s got a lot of fear I know</p>
<p>But enough pride inside not to let that show</p>
<p>My brother had a book he would hold with pride</p>
<p>A little red cover with a broken spine</p>
<p>In the back he hand wrote a quote inside</p>
<p>When the rich wage war, it’s the poor who die</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the leader just talks away</p>
<p>Stuttering and mumbling</p>
<p>For nightly news to replay</p>
<p>And the rest of the world</p>
<p>Watching at the end of the day</p>
<p>Both scared and angry</p>
<p>Like what did he say?</p>
<p>Precise, yet delicate vocals contrast against a persistent marching snare that gives the whole song an unbearable sense of expectation and inevitable doom.</p>
<p>‘Hands Held High’ is probably the most mature and thought-provoking song of Linkin Park’s catalogue, going as far as including the line, “When the rich wage war, it’s the poor who die.” a reference to Jean-Paul Sartre’s famous 1951 play The Devil And The Good Lord.</p>
<p>Mike Shinoda described the track in an interview with Spotify in 2014:</p>
<p>“You know, Bush was president, we were at war and all that stuff and I felt like I really just said what I wanted to say in that song.”</p>
<p>The track was written as a political statement against the George W’s administration, a turbulent time of economic uncertainty and ideological polarisation not that dissimilar to our current day.</p>
<p>“[The line] ‘What did he say?’, that’s talking about Bush. The people in America are listening to him going like: ‘Oh my God, did you hear what he said?’ But the exact same thing is happening everywhere, people overseas are listening to him also going: ‘Oh my God, did you hear what he said?’</p>
<p>“…‘this is fucked up, this is scary.’… it was a moment when you felt from whether you were democrat or republican, you definitely knew the severity of your situation.”</p>
<p>‘Robot Boy’, from A Thousand Suns, 2010</p>
<p>You say you’re not gonna fight</p>
<p>‘Cause no one will fight for you</p>
<p>And you think there’s not enough love</p>
<p>And no one to give it to</p>
<p>And you’re sure you’ve hurt for so long</p>
<p>You’ve got nothing left to lose</p>
<p>So you say you’re not gonna fight</p>
<p>‘Cause no one will fight for you</p>
<p>You say the weight of the world</p>
<p>Has kept you from letting go</p>
<p>And you think compassion’s a flaw</p>
<p>And you’ll never let it show</p>
<p>And you’re sure you’ve hurt in a way</p>
<p>That no one will ever know</p>
<p>But someday the weight of the world</p>
<p>Will give you the strength to go</p>
<p>Another politically charged work, A Thousand Suns is a concept album that dealt with the constant conflict between humanity and technology. The title is a callback to Oppenheimer’s famous description of the atomic bomb as being “as bright as a thousand suns” which was itself a reference to Hindu Sanskrit scripture.</p>
<p>‘Robot Boy’ is a dense track with multilayered melodies and harmonies that is so complex it’s impossible to play live.</p>
<p>“Some songs weren’t made to be played live,” shared Shinoda in an interview with Electronic Musician. “We decided to go for a more vintage vocal layering, ala the Beach Boys and The Eagles—again, to contrast a robotic, mechanical-sounding track.”</p>
<p>The song is an emotional call to arms, the band inviting the listener to power through any problem that might arise, with the promise that there is always a bright light at the other side. Bennington and Shinoda’s vocals weave in and out of each other to produce a climactic wall of sound that is as optimistic as it is joyous.</p>
<p>‘Pushing me Away’, from Hybrid Theory, 2000</p>
<p>I’ve lied to you</p>
<p>The same way that I always do</p>
<p>This is the last smile</p>
<p>That I’ll fake for the sake of being with you</p>
<p>(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)</p>
<p>The sacrifice of hiding in a lie</p>
<p>(Everything has to end, you’ll soon find we’re out of time left to watch it all unwind)</p>
<p>The sacrifice is never knowing</p>
<p>Why I never walked away</p>
<p>Why I played myself this way</p>
<p>Now I see your testing me pushes me away</p>
<p>Why I never walked away</p>
<p>Why I played myself this way</p>
<p>Now I see your testing me pushes me away</p>
<p>The world’s a stage, and this song talks about the little characters we sometimes play to fit certain circumstances or certain relationships. The irony of life is, sometimes these masks become so habitual, we can’t take them off anymore.</p>
<p>“How many people here have been in a relationship you just can’t seem to get out?” said Bennington to the crowd before performing the song in Wantagh back in 2007. “Whether is someone you love or a friend. I don’t know, maybe you have an asshole dad who kicked your ass on his home or something. This song is for you.”</p>

<p>What’s next for Linkin Park?</p>
<p>After the shock of Chester Bennington’s premature death, Linkin Park entered an indefinite hiatus to heal from the loss of their frontman and friend.</p>
<p>“When Chester passed, for the first week, I was completely lost at sea,” recalls Mike Shinoda in a 2018 interview with Vulture. “I realised in the middle of the week that there were certain things that were really scary for me that, in the long run, I wasn’t going to be able to avoid.</p>
<p>“One of those things was listening to [Linkin Park’s] music at all, and another was getting into the studio to write.”</p>
<p>During a recent Twitter Q&amp;A, Shinoda, doubled down on his intention to carry on making music under the Linkin Park banner: “I have every intention of continuing with LP, and the guys feel the same. We have a lot of rebuilding to do, and questions to answer, so it’ll take time.”</p>

<p>During this temporary absence of Linkin Park, Portugal’s Hybrid Theory has allowed fans to continue to honour Chester Bennington’s legacy. The six-man act capture the same fury and honesty of the original group and have delighted Linkin Park fans to rave reviews.</p>
<p>In February 2020, Hybrid Theory will hit Australian shores with a show packed with Linkin Park’s most beloved songs. Aussie audiences will be able to experience hits like ‘In The End’, ‘Numb’, ‘Breaking the Habit’, ‘Crawling’, plus heaps more, in a show made by Linkin Park fans, for Linkin Park fans.</p>

Chester Bennington&rsquo;s tragic real-life story</p>
<p>Chester Bennington rose to fame in 2000 as the frontman for the nu-metal band Linkin Park. With the help of his iconic vocals and bandmate Mike Shinoda&rsquo;s rap skills, the group&rsquo;s Grammy-nominated debut album, Hybrid Theory, dominated the charts with hits like &ldquo;One Step Closer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crawling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bennington famously used song lyrics to express his feelings of frustration, and once told Rolling Stone, &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of songs about depression, fear and paranoia. Are you just making it up?&rsquo; And I said no.&rdquo; Indeed, years of drug abuse, including bouts of sobriety and relapses, would unfortunately become a continuous cycle throughout the singer-songwriter&rsquo;s life. While those closest to the music star believed he was in a good place, his personal struggles eventually became too much, and on July 20, 2017, Bennington died of an apparent suicide by hanging at the age of 41.</p>
<p>With the rock community losing one more light, Bennington left behind his wife, six children, extended family members, and friends. The void he left behind may never be replaced, but as we continue to honor his legacy, let&rsquo;s explore the unfortunate events that plagued this highly-respected artist&rsquo;s tragic life.

<h3 id="chester-benningtons-widow-talinda-honoured-with-mental-health-hero-award">&ldquo;Chester Bennington’s widow Talinda honoured with ‘Mental Health Hero’ award&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://dontboreus.thebrag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/CHESTER.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Chester Bennington’s widow Talinda has been honoured with an award for campaigning for mental health awareness following the Linkin Park frontman’s death on July 20, 2017.</p>
<p>Sharing the news on Friday over Twitter, Talinda revealed she had received the nod from Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services and products, a non-profit mental health organisation based in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“I’m so honoured to be this year’s recipient of the 2020 ‘Mental Health Ambassador Award’ from the Didi Hirsch Center. Thank you so much for this award,” the 43-year-old said in a video posted to Twitter.</p>
<p>Thank you to @DidiHirsch for honoring me with this award. It is a huge honor to receive this award on its 27th year! I am proud to work alongside this organization. They are an abundance of resources and support to those in need! pic.twitter.com/Fp0R0Gq0Ou — Talinda Bennington-Friedman (@TalindaB) April 24, 2020</p>
<p>She continued: “In July of 2017, I lost my husband, the father of my children, Chester Bennington, to suicide. After our loss, I quickly realised that there was a lot of stigma surrounding suicide and mental health, and I co-founded 320 Changes Direction in his name.”</p>
<p>She added: “I could not be more proud of the Didi Hirsch organisation and all of the opportunities, resources and support groups that they provide for families in need, especially during the COVID-19 crisis.”</p>
<p>Prior to his death, Chester Bennington and Talinda had been married for 11 years, over which time they welcomed three children, Tyler Lee Bennington born in 2006, and twins Lily and Lila born November 9, 2011. The ‘Somewhere I Belong’ singer also had one child from his first marriage to Samantha Olit, as well as one with a former girlfriend. He later went on to adopt that girlfriend’s other son during their relationship.</p>
<p>In January this year, Talinda remarried firefighter Michael Friedman, saying over Instagram at the time:</p>
<p>“With joy and love I want to set something straight. ON JANUARY 4th, I wed a wonderful man, great friend, and son this weekend,” she said over social media.</p>
<p>“We celebrated with all of our family and friends on the beautiful island of O’ahu. The day we chose was a day of meaning, in many different ways.”</p>
<p>Announcing her engagement in September last year, Talida told fans that it was possible to “find love after tragedy” and that “the death of a soulmate does not mean the death of you.”</p>
<p>She added that Chester’s Linkin Park bandmates were supportive and “welcome him to the family with open arms” and that she will “continue to honour Chester and continue my life’s mission to make his passing not in vein (sic).”</p>
