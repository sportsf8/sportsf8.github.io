<p>SINGAPORE - A former part-time actor, who had been stealing women&rsquo;s undergarments from homes since 2018, continued doing so even during the circuit breaker and despite being out on bail for the same offence.</p>
<p>Lee Chee Kin, 39, trespassed into the backyard of a house on April 15, a week into the start of the circuit breaker to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak, with the intention of adding to his tally.</p>
<p>The Singaporean had trespassed into the same property on five earlier occasions, between November 2018 and May last year, stealing nearly 30 pieces of undergarments worth at least $160 in total.</p>
<p>He was sentenced on Monday (June 8) to 23 weeks&rsquo; jail after pleading guilty last month to 10 charges, including criminal trespass, theft and an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act.</p>
<p>Lee had been stealing lingerie for his own sexual gratification since 2018, trespassing into other properties to commit similar acts of crime.</p>
<p>The locations of all affected homes were redacted from court documents. In total, he admitted to entering different premises on at least 30 occasions.</p>
<p>Lee was earlier caught on July 12 last year.</p>
<p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Kwang Jia Min had said: &ldquo;He would select bras and panties to steal based on their appearance&hellip; he would climb over the back gate of the target unit and enter the (laundry or backyard areas) where bras and panties were hanging and steal them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would then leave the premises the way he entered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While out on bail following last year&rsquo;s arrest, Lee left his home in the wee hours of April 15 to return to one of his victims&rsquo; houses.</p>
<p>An occupant alerted the police and officers later arrested him.</p>
<p>Related Story Serial lingerie thief found unsuitable for treatment order</p>
<p>In an unrelated case, he took another man&rsquo;s debit card which he had found at Ang Mo Kio MRT station on May 23 last year.</p>
<p>Lee then used it to buy nearly $91 worth of items by using the Paywave function.</p>
<p>He has since made full restitution to the victim, who made a police report on May 28 last year.</p>
<p>On Monday, the DPP urged the court to sentence Lee to at least six months&rsquo; jail, stressing that he had trespassed into multiple properties to steal women&rsquo;s undergarments.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Roche Eng pleaded for between three and five months&rsquo; jail.</p>
<p>He told the court that his client, who had appeared in productions shown on Tamil channel Vasantham, is &ldquo;looking for judicial mercy&rdquo; and is remorseful.</p>
<p>For each criminal trespass charge, Lee could have been jailed for up to three months and fined up to $500.</p>
<p>For each count of theft, an offender can be jailed for up to three years and fined.

<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/06/06/kc-gear0606.jpg?itok=vBH7Di2B" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - Food and beverage business owners have been busy gearing up to reopen for dine-in during phase two of the post-circuit breaker, which could happen before the end of the month.</p>
<p>Only up to five people a group can dine in then. Industry players are expecting more guidelines to be rolled out, but in the meantime, they are getting their outlets safe for dining in.</p>
<p>Overseas, many restaurants have reopened with mandatory measures in place, including screens to separate diners, allowing only outdoor dining and having one waiter serve the same table throughout the meal.</p>
<p>In Singapore, chefs like Sebastien Lepinoy of three-Michelin-starred Les Amis at Shaw Centre have been closely observing global trends.</p>
<p>For instance, if paper menus are not allowed, to reduce touch points, he may have to write the menu on a board.</p>
<p>Impeccable service is key for the French restaurant, so having one waiter serve the same table would be tricky, he says. Diners sometimes also meet the restaurant&rsquo;s host and sommelier, as well as staff who handle tableside service such as the ice cream and caviar trolleys.</p>
<p>Chef Lepinoy says: &ldquo;We hope this (one waiter to a table) restriction will not be imposed, but we must be ready. We have to anticipate every possible scenario and be ready to adapt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RENOVATIONS AND EXPANSIONS</p>
<p>Major renovations for dim sum restaurant Swee Choon in Jalan Besar will start in phase two, says third-generation owner Ernest Ting, 29.</p>
<p>The revamp will include adding ordering kiosks and an automated system to send food across the shophouse units - without the need for runners anymore.</p>
<p>The 420-seat outlet will halve its seating capacity and shorten operating hours. It used to open from 11.30 to 6am, six days a week. Now, it offers takeaway from 10 to 1am and is likely to continue with the same hours for dine-in. Delivery hours are from 11 to 1.45am.</p>

<p>Mr Ting is also getting Swee Choon&rsquo;s new central kitchen ready. It was initially meant to open as a second outlet in April at Nex mall. The opening has been postponed and the kitchen will produce frozen dim sum for delivery instead.</p>
<p>At Italian restaurant Buona Terra in Scotts Road, its spokesman says it is planning the design concept for renovations this year. A key feature will be a waiting area for walk-in customers.</p>
<p>Over at Shaw Centre, the Les Amis Group, which owns 14 restaurants at the mall, will take over an additional 2,000 sq ft of space on the second floor. The expansion was planned prior to the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>More expansion plans include a new casual concept called IB&rsquo;s Kitchen - which will sell nasi lemak and Peranakan food - as well as more outlets for Tarte by Cheryl Koh, and Peperoni Pizzeria.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s chairman Desmond Lim adds that they are also working to open more ghost kitchens to facilitate island-wide delivery, as well as new virtual brands such as a spin-off noodle concept of its popular Cantonese porridge brand Mui Kee.</p>
<p>RECONFIGURING SPACES AND OUTDOOR DINING</p>
<p>LeVeL33 craft-brewery restaurant and lounge already did a major revamp last year, but founding managing director Martin Bem is ready to reconfigure its outdoor terrace for seating, should it be required.</p>
<p>At Si Chuan Dou Hua Restaurant at Parkroyal on Beach Road hotel, safe-distancing measures will be in place, with its alfresco area used as a waiting point for delivery and takeaways. Additional decorations such as potted plants have been added - to help maintain physical distancing while not compromising the ambience, says the hotel&rsquo;s general manager Paolo Campillo.</p>
<p>American burger chain Shake Shack, which has announced a third outlet at Liat Towers to open in the third quarter of this year, will have an alfresco dining area - a first for the brand in Singapore. Its two other outlets are at Jewel Changi Airport and Neil Road.</p>
<p>DELIVERY TO CONTINUE</p>
<p>Even after dine-in resumes, many of the businesses that have had success with delivery during this period say they will continue with it.</p>
<p>Among them is The Lo &amp; Behold Group, which has brands including heritage restaurant Kin, pizza restaurant Extra Virgin Pizza and natural wine bar Le Bon Funk.</p>
<p>Its Japanese restaurant Esora, which closed last year, returns today with a katsu sandwich takeaway and delivery menu (order.restaurant-esora.com). Today, it will operate fom 4 to 8pm.After that, it operates from Wednesdays to Sundays, 11.30am to 8pm.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s managing director, Mr Wee Teng Wen, says Esora will reopen once dine-in restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>Contactless kerbside pick-up service - offered by restaurants like three-Michelin-starred Odette at the National Gallery Singapore - will continue as well.</p>
<p>GETTING CREATIVE</p>

<p>Many F&amp;B outlets have had to get creative during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as coming up with Do-It-Yourself kits, and this is also something they should carry on with.</p>
<p>Mr Teo Tong Loong, 31, group business development director of ABR Holdings, which runs the Swensen&rsquo;s chain, does not rule out the use of toys and mannequins to enforce safe distancing and ensure the space does not look too empty. This is a measure adopted by some restaurants overseas.</p>

<p>Mr Teo says: &ldquo;This will be useful in cases where it is not practical to remove tables and chairs. To maintain high levels of hygiene standards, if and when such toys are used, we will ensure sanitisation practices are in place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Daphane Loke, 40, founder of casual cafe chain Saybons, is trying to create positive memories of Covid-19 - from her plates.</p>
<p>She launched a crowd-funding project called Save A Plate earlier this week, where she handpainted about 70 plates from her three outlets to be sold as art.</p>
<p>Pledge amounts start at $10, which gets the supporter a postcard of an image of her specially designed plate. Pledge $200 or more to receive a hand-painted 15cm-wide ceramic side plate. The project will be funded only if the $40,000 goal is met by July 15.</p>
<p>When dine-in resumes, Ms Loke will use biodegradable disposable plates at her outlets for hygiene purposes, which will leave her with plenty of unused tableware.</p>
<p>She says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how to respond positively to all the negativity and uncertainty. This may be a good way to remember your favourite restaurant and create a positive Covid-19 memory.&rdquo;

<h3 id="curbs-on-dining-in-and-meeting-most-kin-to-stay">&ldquo;Curbs on dining in and meeting most kin to stay&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/05/20/rk_whampoahawker_200520.jpg?itok=FrcV2BDy" alt="img">
Though the circuit breaker will end after June 1, restrictions on activities such as dining in and meeting friends and most kin will remain as Singapore enters the first phase of reopening its economy.</p>
<p>This will disappoint people but the measures are necessary to avoid any risk of the coronavirus flaring up again, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a virtual press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The feeling of being cooped up at home for a long period of time is starting to have its effect on people&hellip; But I hope we can all maintain our discipline for a while longer,&rdquo; added Mr Wong, co-chair of the multi-ministry task force tackling the pandemic.</p>
<p>He warned that &ldquo;if we were to open up too quickly and allow all these social activities to restart, there is a risk the virus will flare up, and we might see many more cases and clusters forming&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The minister made the point when outlining the three phases of reopening after June 1.</p>
<p>Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, fellow co-chair of the task force, said it could take at least four weeks to exit the first phase and enter the second one, which is a transition stage that will see the resumption of some social activities.</p>
<p>The reason for adopting this timeframe is that Singapore will, by and large, need to observe the situation for two incubation periods - or 28 days - after it rolls back the existing circuit breaker measures, he said.</p>
<p>But it is not set in stone. Adjustments will be made along the way as the situation evolves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball to see what&rsquo;s going to happen&hellip; But at the minimum, we are not likely to make major shifts in the first four weeks,&rdquo; said Mr Gan.</p>
<p>In deciding on the right time to move into the second phase, the Government will not just rely on the number of new cases, he added.</p>
<p>Rather, a &ldquo;whole basket of factors&rdquo; will be considered in assessing risk, including the nature of transmission of new cases.</p>
<p>Related Story Limited visits to parents or grandparents to be allowed from June 2 after circuit breaker</p>
<p>The task force will also consult professionals to help judge whether Singapore is ready for the second phase, he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and &lsquo;no&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s not a table that you tick off and then say, oh, we have passed all these and therefore we can move into phase two,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Should the number of cases soar and big clusters emerge in the first phase, some of the circuit breaker measures will be reintroduced in a targeted way. But this hinges on which sector has a higher risk profile, he added.</p>
<p>The minister also said Singapore is prepared to see a rise in the number of cases initially as people interact more. But if, among other things, the number of cases remains low over a sustained period, then Singapore can consider going into the second phase, he added.</p>
<p>Mr Gan warned that the second phase could also last for several months - three months, six months or longer - depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Mr Wong said there will be two stages in the second phase.</p>
<p>The first stage will kick off with lower-risk activities.</p>
<p>These may include some limited social activities, including letting people gather in small groups and dining in at restaurants.</p>

<p>In the second stage, higher-risk activities - such as events, entertainment and attractions with bigger crowds and close contact among people - will be assessed for reopening, he added.</p>
<p>In the third phase, when Singapore will be in a state of stability, new controls and safeguards have to be put in place until a vaccine is found, said Mr Wong.</p>
<p>It is not a return to life before Covid-19, he stressed.</p>
<p>While activities such as going to a theatre, cinema or place of worship will likely be possible during this phase, limits on group size and safe distancing measures will remain, he said.</p>
<p>Similarly, he added, baseline precautions such as basic personal hygiene, safe distancing and the wearing of face masks will continue to be a must throughout the three phases.</p>

<p>Mr Gan urged Singaporeans not to let up in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope everyone will cooperate with us to support our plan and work together with us, so that we can safely remove the circuit breaker, safely open our economy and society,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And at the same time, make a safe transition towards a safe nation.&rdquo;

<h3 id="work-out-at-home-sportsg">&ldquo;Work out at home: SportSG&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/23/st_20200423_sptamk_56197832.jpg?itok=bdWSX57e" alt="img">
Undergraduate Chan Yun Xuan used to run three times a week at a park in Bedok before the coronavirus pandemic hit Singapore.</p>
<p>Then, she trimmed her 30-minute sessions to only once or twice a week, while turning to YouTube for daily fitness videos.</p>
<p>But the 23-year-old will now be relying solely on virtual workouts to keep fit following Sport Singapore&rsquo;s (SportSG) call for the public to exercise at home.</p>
<p>The national sports agency issued the advisory on Tuesday night as part of a tightening of circuit breaker measures designed to stem the spread of Covid-19. Also among the measures was an extension of the circuit breaker period till June 1.</p>
<p>Now, while individuals are still allowed to leave home to exercise - although this is not encouraged - SportSG is urging them to do so alone and only in their immediate neighbourhoods. Carparks in gardens and parks are now closed to discourage people from travelling distances to work out.</p>
<p>Other measures, such as the mandatory wearing of masks during exercise - except for strenuous activities - remain in effect.</p>
<p>Chan explained that she had decided to exercise at home because while working out at the park near her home in Bedok, she had observed that some did not wear masks when walking.</p>
<p>Chan said: &ldquo;My parents were discouraging me from running because of the Covid-19 situation and there have also been a lot of articles about how you have to keep a further distance when running, which is hard to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of people and I don&rsquo;t want to go out and exercise now, for the safety of my family and others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>National basketballer Leon Kwek, who also plays for the Singapore Slingers, will also be finding alternatives for his runs, which he usually does three to four times a week.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old said: &ldquo;This (the SportSG recommendation) has been done with everyone&rsquo;s well-being as the main priority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as we miss the basketball courts and workouts, this virus is unlike anything we&rsquo;ve seen before, which is why it&rsquo;s important that we stay at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, some feel that the latest advisory is difficult to adhere to.</p>
<p>Republic Polytechnic student Ameet Singh Sandhu still prefers to get his exercise fix outdoors.</p>
<p>SAFETY IS PRIORITY There are a lot of people and I don&rsquo;t want to go out and exercise now, for the safety of my family and others. CHAN YUN XUAN , avid runner, on why she has decided to heed Sport Singapore&rsquo;s advice to work out indoors.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old, who cycles twice a week for two hours each time around Sembawang, turned to cycling as a way to keep fit after public gyms were closed as part of the circuit breaker measures.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I lose my motivation (at home) really quickly as I have options to do other things such as watching videos and lying on my bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find it boring to stay at home to exercise, though I do try sometimes. But cycling is the best option for me because while exercising, I am also able to take in the fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Straits Times reader noted on a Facebook thread that the new measures are not entirely practical.</p>
<p>Wan Chee Kin noted that if one person from the household goes out first, followed by another, &ldquo;either one&rdquo; can bring back the virus anyway.</p>
<p>He also asked what would happen if a child wanted to go cycling - he would have to &ldquo;go alone, mum must stay (home)&quot;.</p>
<p>But there are others who feel the latest measures are not tough enough and want outdoor exercises to be banned altogether.</p>
<p>Security officer Kamal Bhai, 57, who had stopped going out for brisk walks since the circuit breaker measures took effect on April 7, said: &ldquo;How can we contain this virus (if people are still out exercising)? We don&rsquo;t know who is carrying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s best to just stop allowing outdoor exercises for a month and do light training at home.&rdquo;</p>
