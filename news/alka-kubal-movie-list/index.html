<p>Story: In the Ubhe family, the eldest son thinks he is fit to fight for the title of the village sarpanch after his father’s death. Many agree. But what is politics without a few twists and turns in the plot?</p>
<p>Review: Politics is a dirty game, or so people say. But perhaps politics is just a game of chess where one player outsmarts the other using clever ideas and smart moves. And like chess, the political game isn’t over until one player checkmates the other. Till then, the game can turn around anytime. Dhurala brings this game and the dirty politics to the big screen with a set of big players, each with their sets of strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Dhurala is based in a village around a political family. It opens with the passing of the sarpanch of the village and patriarch of the family, Nivrutti Ubhe. The sarpanch’s passing throws open the seat for re-election with only two players in the fray- Nivrutti’s elder son Dada (Ankush Chaudhari) and his arch-rival Harish Gadhwe (Prasad Oak). Dada is a progressive thinker who wants to work for the development of the village, while Harish is the wounded tiger in the arena, waiting for a turn to strike back. Little do these two know that there’s a bigger picture yet to unfold that will bring in more players in the arena, including Dada’s stepmother Akkabai (Alka Kubal-Athalye), his sister-in-law Monica, his younger brothers Bhaujya (Amey Wagh) and Hanumant (Siddharth Jadhav), and his wife Harshada (Sai Tamhankar). Everyone wants a piece of the cake and this turns the Ubhe household into a battlefield with three contenders pitted against each other.</p>
<p>In the past, the director-writer duo of Sameer Vidwans-Kshitij Patwardhan has given the Marathi audience films worth watching (Double Seat, YZ, Time Please). With Dhurala, they continue the winning streak and give a fitting start to the New Year. The film is well-written and well-executed; it has a gripping story line that ensures there’s no dull moment for the audience. At the same time, it is entertaining with the multiple twists and performances.</p>
<p>Often in a multi-starrer, there are one or two actors that overshadow the others, but not in this one. Here’s every character is well-written and has a pivotal role to play in the political game. Moreover, the actors bring their top-game to the fore. Ankush, as the restrained yet clever Dada, Sai as the balanced Harshada, Sonalee as the ambitious Monica, Prasad as the vengeful Harish, Amey as the neglected dreamer, Alka as the hesitant participant and Siddharth as the brawny Cement Sheth with a heart of gold- together they pack a punch and ace their roles.</p>
<p>The film isn’t devoid of drawbacks. The plot twists get predictable after a point and a 5-10 min patch a while before the climax seems stretched. Compared to the bigger picture though, these are just bumps on an otherwise smooth road. Dhurala, perhaps, sets the tone for a promising 2020 for Marathi cinema.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/73072923.cms" alt="img">
The trailer of the film has very successfully given us a glimpse into each one of the characters in the film. While Ankush Chaudhari plays the major role, Chaudhari’s mother (Alka Kubal). His biggest obstacle is Gadhwe (Prasad Oak). The very popular &lsquo;Mauli&rsquo; star Siddharth Jadhav will be seen sharing the screen with Sonalee Kulkarni after a decade. The film also has important characters played by big names like Amey Wagh and Sai Tamhankar. Umesh Kamat makes a fleeting yet strong appearance in the end. All the characters in the movie have their own prominence and each in their own way contributes to the story of the film. And this certainly is one of the major highlights of the movie.

The political situation of Maharashtra has been continuously in the news over the last two weeks or so, ever since the results of the assembly elections are out. Amidst such an atmosphere, the teaser of director Sameer Vidwans’ multi-starrer political drama titled Dhurala (2020) has emerged.</p>
<p>The film has a long list of known faces from the Marathi film industry that includes Prasad Oak, Ankush Chaudhari, Amey Wagh, Sai Tamhankar, Sonalee Kulkarni, Umesh Kamat, Siddharth Jadhav, Priyadarshan Jadhav and Alka Kubal.</p>
<p>Going by the teaser, Dhurala revolves around the political situation of a small town in Maharashtra. The film seems to be about the rivalry or enmity between quite a few political parties. The teaser also makes it clear that every mainstream actor plays a confident person, except the one played by Tamhankar. Her character, which seem to be from a poorer section of the society, appears conscious of others.</p>
<p>Despite politics being widely followed in the state of Maharashtra, Marathi cinema has hardly come up with films about politics over the last two decades. The era before that saw political dramas like Samna (1974) and Sinhasan (1980); both directed by Jabbar Patel. The few prominent films made in this genre in the last few years include Zenda (2010) and Classmates (2015).</p>
<p>The lack of films in this genre coupled by the interesting teaser of Dhurala makes it an awaited film. The film will release on 3 January 2020. Watch the teaser below and let us know if you are keen to watch the film.
