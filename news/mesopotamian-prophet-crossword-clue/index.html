<p>ISTANBUL — The reports are like something out of a distant era of ancient conquests: entire villages emptied, with hundreds taken prisoner, others kept as slaves; the destruction of irreplaceable works of art; a tax on religious minorities, payable in gold.</p>
<p>A rampage reminiscent of Tamerlane or Genghis Khan, perhaps, but in reality, according to reports by residents, activist groups and the assailants themselves, a description of the modus operandi of the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate this week. The militants have prosecuted a relentless campaign in Iraq and Syria against what have historically been religiously and ethnically diverse areas with traces of civilizations dating to ancient Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>The latest to face the militants’ onslaught are the Assyrian Christians of northeastern Syria, one of the world’s oldest Christian communities, some speaking a modern version of Aramaic, the language of Jesus.</p>
<p>Assyrian leaders have counted 287 people taken captive, including 30 children and several dozen women, along with civilian men and fighters from Christian militias, said Dawoud Dawoud, an Assyrian political activist who had just toured the area, in the vicinity of the Syrian city of Qamishli. Thirty villages have been emptied, he said.

<h3 id="who-are-the-yazidi-people-and-what-are-their-beliefs">&ldquo;Who are the Yazidi people, and what are their beliefs?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.1894936&amp;origw=960" alt="img">
A large number of Iraq’s tiny Yazidi minority remains isolated on a remote mountain top, fearing the self-styled “Islamic State” and hoping to be rescued by their Kurdish neighbours. Their plight brings attention to one of the most misunderstood religious minorities in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Although Yazidis are often regarded as Kurds, they form a religious and ethnic minority with unique beliefs and practices misunderstood by their neighbours, leading to their persecution and demonisation as “devil-worshippers”.</p>
<p>There are about 600,000 Yazidis worldwide, but the vast majority – perhaps 400,000 to 500,000 – live mainly in northern Iraq, their home for almost 1,000 years.</p>
<p>For centuries, their neighbours have treated the Yazidis as delinquent Arabs or schismatic Muslims. Some say they are descended from Yazid bin Muawiyah (647-683), the second of the Umayyad dynasty of Islamic caliphs, and others say the name Yazidi comes from the Old Iranian yazata (“divine being”). But Yazidis believe their name comes from the word Yezdan or Ezid, meaning “God,” and simply means “worshippers of God”.</p>
<p>Others say Daasin, the name Yazidis use for themselves, is derived from the name of a diocese in the Nestorian Church, the ancient Church of the Assyrians in the Mesopotamian region.</p>
<p>The complex, secret beliefs of Yazidis, their legends and their social structures, including their caste system, set them apart from other religions in the region.</p>
<p>The Yazidi holy books were said to be the Kitêba Cilwe (Book of Revelation) and the Mishefa Res (“Black Book”). But many scholars now believe the manuscripts published a century ago were forgeries by non-Yazidis. The core religious texts today are hymns or qawls, transmitted orally and laden with cryptic allusions difficult for outsiders to interpret.</p>
<p>The Yazidis’ syncretic religion has a rich oral tradition mixing Islamic mysticism with the dualism of Zoroastrianism, the ancient Persian religion, elements of early, pre-Islamic religions, including Mithraism, a mystery religion originating in the eastern Mediterranean, and some Christian practices.</p>
<p>In the Yazidi calendar, this is the year 6764. But the origins of the religion are found in the complex, syncretic teachings of their founder, Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir, a Sufi mystic who claimed descent from the Umayyad dynasty and who was proclaimed an incarnation of Malak Tawous, the principal figure in Yazidi cosmology. Sheikh Adi settled in the valley of Lalis, northeast of Mosul, and after his death in 1162 his tomb became the focus of pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Good and evil</p>
<p>They say Malak Tawous is the only angel who refused to bow down to Adam at his creation. He fell from God’s favour, but when he saw the suffering and pain of the world, his tears of remorse put out the fires of hell. Recognising his obstinacy as a sign of devotion, God then elevated Malak Tawous as the Peacock Angel to head the angels and to serve as the intermediary between God and humanity.</p>
<p>In early Christianity, the peacock symbolised the Resurrection and immortality because it was believed its flesh does not decay. But another name for Malak Tawous is Shaytan, the name in the Koran for Satan. Yet Yazidis are forbidden to speak the name Shaytan, and hold that the source of evil is in human hearts.</p>
<p>Yazidis believe they are descended from Adam alone through his son Shehid bin Jer, born without Eve as his mother. Every Yazidi is born into either a priestly or lay family and inter-marriage between the castes is prohibited. The priestly families form two groups – the sheikhs who preside at major religious festivals and the pirs who officiate at births, marriages and funerals. But this caste system is about religious duties rather than privilege or wealth.</p>
<p>Yazidis traditionally believe in the reincarnation or the transmigration of souls, which they liken to changing clothes so that the soul can attain spiritual purification. But, like the neighbouring Alawis and Druze, it is not possible for outsiders to convert to Yazidism – one must be born a Yazidi.</p>
<p>Yazidis pray five times daily, at dawn, sunrise, noon, afternoon and sunset, although most observe only the sunrise and sunset prayers. When they pray, they turn towards the sun, and at noon they pray facing Lalis and the tomb of Sheikh Adi. But daily prayer must not be said in the presence of outsiders.</p>
<p>Children are baptised at birth by a priest, circumcision is often practised, and a form of Communion with blessed bread is shared at weddings. The practice of burying the dead with their hands crossed may be derived from Sufi Islam rather than Christianity.</p>
<p>Elemental worship</p>
<p>Accusations of devil worship first surfaced among Muslims in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and Yazidis became so despised a hymn recalls 72 attempts by their neighbours in the last three centuries to exterminate them. Today, Yazidi leaders fear they are facing their 73rd massacre. “Our entire religion is being wiped off the face of the Earth,” says Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi MP in Baghdad for the Kurdish Democratic Party.</p>

<h3 id="aphrodite-the-true-origins-of-the-greek-goddess-of-love-sex-and-beauty">&ldquo;Aphrodite: The True Origins of the Greek Goddess of Love, Sex, and Beauty&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/intriguing-origins-aphrodite.jpg" alt="img">
Aphrodite is the Greek goddess of love, sex, and beauty and there are many tales of how she could entice both gods and mortals to lust after her. In one of the most famous images of the goddess, we see her beautiful form emerge from the sea, a reference to her fascinating origin story. But the true origins of the goddess come from long before the Greeks.</p>
<p>A Brief Overview of Aphrodite</p>
<p>Aphrodite was part of the ancient Greek pantheon. Some of her famous symbols are a mirror, scallop shell, dove, girdle, and apple. Of course, this popular goddess had many other symbols associated with her and the icons relate to the myths and attributes of the goddess .</p>
<p>The ancient stories of the goddess tend to reflect her role in love between the gods, humans, and gods and humans. Sometimes she was an outside influence on others’ stories and many times she was a major player in the stories as well. But as was common with the Olympian deities, Aphrodite also had a darker side and revenge was one of her less attractive features.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, her beauty and prevalence in ancient myth have inspired great works of art and literature since the goddess first enthralled mortal minds. She was also the patron deity of mariners, courtesans, and prostitutes . Though it may surprise you to know that her cult was actually said to be pretty austere for the times. The Romans adopted Aphrodite as their goddess Venus, which is also the planet connected with her.</p>

<p>Aphrodite’s First Origin Story</p>
<p>In this older of the two stories of Aphrodite’s birth , she emerges from the sea a grown woman. Her father is Uranos, the god of the sky, and she has no mother. This story takes place two generations before Zeus, when Uranos reigned with his wife Gaia, the goddess of the earth . Uranos hated his children and hid them in the depths of the earth, until Gaia, loathing her husband, devised a plan with her son Cronus. She equipped her son with a sickle and, when Uranos next came to sleep with Gaia, Cronus chopped off his genitals. The severed parts fell into the ocean and sea foam enveloped them. From this foam emerged the goddess Aphrodite.</p>
<p>This story was handed down to us by Hesiod, one of the earliest Greek poets. He explains that Aphrodite’s name comes from the Greek word aphros, meaning “foam,” which could refer to the sea foam or to Uranos’ semen. This myth is etiological, with Aphrodite’s birth from foam explaining the origin of her name. This is a poetic invention, however, and the true etymology of Aphrodite’s name remains unknown.</p>
<p>In his story, Hesiod has Aphrodite float past Cytherea and emerge at Cyprus. In Ancient Greece, both of these cities had huge cults to Aphrodite. In fact, the temple of Aphrodite at Cyprus is as old as the 12th century BC, long before Hesiod lived. Just as he used a Greek word to explain the mystery of Aphrodite’s name, Hesiod here uses geographical details to explain why she was worshipped in these two cities.</p>
<p>Aphrodite - The Great Goddess of Cyprus. ( Public Domain )</p>
<p>A Second Tale of Aphrodite’s Birth</p>
<p>In Aphrodite’s second birth story, she is a daughter of Zeus. Zeus is the grandson of Uranos and the son of Cronus. Like Cronus, Zeus overthrew his father to become ruler of heaven. In this story, Aphrodite’s mother is a goddess called Dione, about whom little else is known. It is notable that the name Dione is a feminized form of the Zeus’ alternate epithet, Dios.</p>
<p>The Greek poet Homer, a contemporary of Hesiod, subscribed to this second myth of Aphrodite’s origin and she appears in his epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey. This Aphrodite was later absorbed into the Roman pantheon as the goddess Venus. In this role she is credited with founding Rome through her mortal son, Aeneas. She also features as the cruel mother-in-law in Apuleius’ romantic epic Cupid and Psyche , and she has important roles in many other myths.</p>
<p>Different Versions of Aphrodite for the Greeks</p>
<p>Because of Aphrodite’s dichotomous origin stories, there is some confusion about her among Greek and Roman writers. In Plato’s Symposium, the characters discuss the differences between Aphrodite Urania, meaning “Heavenly Aphrodite,” and Aphrodite Pandemos or “Common Aphrodite.”</p>
<p>Heavenly Aphrodite is the daughter or Uranos. She inspires the love between two men and the love of learning and wisdom. Men who are under the spell of Common Aphrodite, however, have no preference between loving women or men. Interested in the body and not the soul, their love is base and uninspired. This interpretation, however, is unique to Plato . In Athens, where Aphrodite was worshiped with the title “Pandemos,” she was not thought to preside over base love, but rather her quality of being common meant that she was involved in civic matters.</p>
<p>‘</p>
<p>The Pearls of Aphrodite’ (1907) by Herbert James Draper. ( Public Domain )</p>
<p>Aphrodite in Other Myths</p>
<p>Different sides of Aphrodite and her powers can be seen in the myths about her. In one of the popular myths, it is said that Aphrodite was so beautiful that other gods would fight for her affections. This allegedly led Zeus to decide that the goddess would be wed to the ugly Hephaestus. But marriage didn’t stop Aphrodite from taking many lovers .</p>
<p>The affair of Ares and Aphrodite is well known, but other myths describe her flings and subsequent children with Dionysus, Hermes, and Poseidon. Aphrodite’s magic girdle also appears in myths when others borrow it to inspire love and desire. Zeus himself fell prey to the enchanted object when Hera would wear it to incite his love.</p>
<p>Because Aphrodite was at the heart of so many affairs between other gods and mortals, it is said that Zeus decided she should also take a turn at losing some control and falling madly in love with humans. That explains how Aphrodite came to have a deep passion for Anchises and give birth to Aeneas and Lyrus.</p>
<p>Like many of the gods, Aphrodite was said to be rather vain and expected that humans would worship her and her powers. People who refused to do so, or somehow offended the goddess were severely punished. For example, Aphrodite made King Minos of Crete’s daughter Phaedra, who was also Theseus’ wife, fall in love with her stepson.</p>

<p>Classical mythology also suggests that Aphrodite was indirectly responsible for the Trojan War . This is because Paris chose Aphrodite as the winner of the golden apple over Athena and Hera in a goddess beauty contest after Aphrodite promised him the most beautiful woman in the world – Helen. She also intervened in the war a few times, most famously to save Aeneas and to help Ares.</p>
<p>‘Judgement of Paris’ (c.1632-1635) by Rubens. ( Public Domain )</p>
<p>Aphrodite Before the Greeks</p>
<p>Although these myths surrounding Aphrodite are Greek, Aphrodite is not a Greek creation, but more of an acquisition. She is a version of the goddess Ashtart, also called Astarte, Ishtar, Isis, and a number of other variants, when she appears in different places around the Mediterranean and throughout the Middle East. As a goddess, Astarte held dominion not only over love, but also heaven and war. Aphrodite’s function was narrowed down to the goddess of love, although she is occasionally depicted with weapons or married to Ares, the Greek god of war, which is evidence of her bellicose beginnings.</p>

<p>Aphrodite resulted from a syncretism, or merging, between a Greek deity and this goddess of many names from the east. The myth of Aphrodite and Adonis supports this version of her history. In this tragic romantic tale, Aphrodite falls in love with a mortal named Adonis, but he is killed by a boar’s tusk while hunting. Shakespeare wrote a version of this story and so did the Roman poet Ovid in the first century AD, but its roots are much older than these two writers.</p>
<p>In ancient Mesopotamia, the goddess was called Inanna and her mortal lover was Dumuzi. Just as the goddess’ name varies by region, Dumuzi has his other epithet “Adonis.” This name has Semitic roots, and it is the same as the invocation “oh my lord,” or adonai in Hebrew. This tragic love story between the great goddess and the ill-fated mortal man appears in many cultures throughout the Middle East, and attests to Aphrodite’s origins outside of Greece.</p>
<p>“Venus and Adonis” by Titian (c. 1553). ( Public Domain ) In this painting, Venus tries to stop Adonis from going hunting, which will lead to his death.</p>
<p>The Greeks had two contradicting birth myths for Aphrodite, their goddess of love. Hesiod tried to explain her name and places of worship when writing her origin story, while Homer took up the version that made her subordinate to the greatest god, Zeus. Through study of religion in other ancient cultures, we see that both stories were attempts by Greek poets to ingratiate a foreign goddess into their existing belief structure.</p>

<p>The Lost Man</p>
<p>Pan MacMillan</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: The Lost Man is an Australian mystery set deep in outback Queensland. The novel centres around the unexplained death of one of three brothers on an isolated cattle station and the family’s search to find answers. It is a very character-driven story set against a vivid and brutal landscape.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? Goodnight Mister Tom by Michelle Magorian. I like to read well outside my genre when I’m writing to keep my ideas fresh, but this beautiful childhood favourite reminded of the importance of creating deep relationships between characters.</p>
<p>What will you read next? Nine Perfect Strangers by Liane Moriarty. I’m a big fan of her work and admire the way she can convey so much with just a few well-chosen words.</p>
<p>David Marr</p>
<p>My Country: Stories, Essays &amp; Speeches</p>
<p>Black Inc.</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: From thousands of articles I’ve written and speeches I’ve delivered over 45 years, these are the ones that seem to have something still to say about my country and its mysteries. This isn’t everyone’s Australia but it’s mine, mapped by politics, history, memoir, tales of gay life and stories of the writing trade. I began with childish optimism in the age of Whitlam and, 10 prime ministers down the track, battle hardened, I’m still convinced this is a place that gets things right – in the end.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? Everything, year in and year out.</p>
<p>What will you read next? I’m deep in Patrick Mullins’s Tiberius with a Telephone: The Life and Stories of William McMahon, a fine account of a vile politician in the dying days of old conservative Australia. So long ago yet strangely familiar …</p>

<p>Preservation</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: I’m fascinated by the history of Bass Strait, and particularly the Furneaux Islands. Preservation reimagines the true story of the Sydney Cove shipwreck in 1797 – a tale of survival, but one which sheds an unusual light on first contact with Aboriginal nations, and evokes a landscape and an ecology that we’ve mostly lost.</p>
<p>One of the survivors, William Clark, kept a journal of the desperate walk from eastern Victoria to Sydney, and the journal was a starting point for me. But it raises more questions than it answers: that’s what drew me to the story as a novelist. It’s the inverse of what we were taught in school about explorers: these are forgotten and often nameless sailors – most of them Bengalis, not Europeans – depending on the Gunaikurnai, and the Yuin for their survival. The novel is built on the voices of people who weren’t heard in those times: Aborigines, lascars and women.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? I was reading a range of new (and new-ish) Australian history that up-ended what I thought I understood about Aboriginal societies and the early years of European presence on the continent. Books like Bruce Pascoe’s Dark Emu, Grace Karskens’ The Colony, Bill Gammage’s The Biggest Estate on Earth, and Mark McKenna’s From the Edge: Australia’s Lost Histories.</p>
<p>What will you read next? I’ve just started Billy Griffiths’s Deep Time Dreaming, a study of the history of Australian archaeology. The research, and the writing, are extraordinary. I studied archaeology at uni, hoping to learn about Australia’s human record, but back then it was just the dead hand of Mesopotamia, over and over. This writing feels new, and it feels ancient, and it’s bloody exciting.</p>

<p>Close to Home</p>
<p>Black Inc.</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: Close to Home is a collection of essays and non-fiction stories spanning 17 years, from my earliest published work when I was 20 to the latest non-published piece written this year. There are profiles of extraordinary ordinary people I’ve interviewed, and essays about 24-hour K-Mart, a doll museum, a wigmaker, Western Australian ghosts and everything in between. I’ve found that class is one of my recurring themes, as well as belonging.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? I read Helen Garner’s Everywhere I Look and almost didn’t want to go ahead with my own book! Helen is the consummate observer of life. She looks at the world unflinchingly and never writes with, as she calls it, “all moral guns blazing.”</p>
<p>What will you read next? The Arsonist by Chloe Hooper, because I love true crime books and Chloe’s way of telling a non-fiction story so it reads like the greatest literary fiction.</p>

<p>Kill Shot</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: Kill Shot is the ninth novel in the Wyatt series. Wyatt specialises in high-end burglaries and holding up banks and payroll vans, so Kill Shot is a caper novel, a crime-from-the-inside novel. Wyatt is meticulous and focused and doesn’t suffer fools gladly. He has no altruistic motives for stealing – he’s not funding his little niece’s leukaemia operation, for example – he simply likes the planning, the execution and the money. And we don’t learn much about Wyatt: if we knew that he had a troubled childhood, for example, he’d suddenly be vulnerable, he’d no longer be Wyatt. Readers tell me, “I don’t approve of Wyatt but I want him to win”, which is exactly my intention.</p>
<p>In Kill Shot, he sets out to steal the million-dollar running-away stash of a Ponzi scheme chancer who intends to flee the country rather than face trial. Needless to say, nothing goes smoothly.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? I reread all of Michael Connelly’s novels (the series characters and the standalones) while writing Kill Shot. I do this from time to time with favourite authors, most recently John Sandford and Stuart MacBride. Connelly has taught me the value of artful plotting and plain prose.</p>
<p>What will you read next? In a string of recent crime novels set in rural Australia, the lead investigators are outsiders, not rooted to place in the way urban detectives like Michael Connelly’s Bosch are. I look forward to reading Chris Hammer’s Scrublands, set in the Riverina and featuring an investigative journalist.</p>

<p>The Butcherbird Stories</p>
<p>Transit Lounge</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: I’ve had a few customers ask me about butcherbirds in my bookstore, assuming it was a portmanteau I’d created for the title of my latest book. It might depend of what region of Australia you live in because, to some people, butcherbirds are as common as magpies. Even though I didn’t create the word, birdsong and bird-flight do jar nicely in my mind with the bones and flesh of butchery. It reflects how I see the process of writing. Authors hack things apart that were recently alive to see if they can find a way to sustain life. And there’s always a desire for music in a world of noise – so writers capture those things that are most dear to us, even at the cost of mutilation. A story collection can feel particularly dismembered but The Butcherbird Stories was a way for me to find song and flight.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao made me excited for the future of literature. Junot Díaz also impressed me deeply with his collection of stories, Drown, but his Pulitzer prize-winning debut novel wasn’t only brilliant, it revitalised the whole literary project – everything was possible again on the page.</p>
<p>What will you read next? I’ve just started Paul Kelly’s autobiography, How to Make Gravy. What he’s contributed to Australian culture awes me – but he’s a singer that has also fed my mind, heart and soul, ever since I was a child. And now I just feel dismayed that it’s taken me eight years to get around to it.</p>

<p>Two Old Men Dying</p>
<p>Vintage Australia</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: The book concerns the death of two old Australians separated by 42,000 years. One is a man, Shade, who lived on the shores of a lake in western New South Wales, and is based on Mungo Man, the eloquent skeleton of the oldest ritually buried homo sapiens. The other is a modern shaman, a suburban man and filmmaker named Shelby Apples.</p>
<p>Apples is possessed by the Old Man’s spirit, and the novel deals with our intellect, our taste for savagery, and the fact that we are not at ease and want to steal fire from the heroes and gods. And that life is demanding and joyous. Both of them are travellers, and what Shelby does casts light on the Old Man, and vice versa. Shelby’s pilgrimages are to Africa, Central Australia, the Arctic. Shade’s are to other communities of homo sapiens who existed at the time in eastern Australia. The women are beings of weight and influences in both cases. The chief argument of the book is that we moderns don’t have a clue what a prophet and educator we have in Mungo Man, the inspiration for Shade.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? I was actually reading a lot of Dickens, the collected oeuvres, but the most relevant book was Yuval Noah Harari’s history of humankind, Sapiens. There were two aspects of the book I was drawn by: the idea that about 70,000 years ago a burst of DNA brought a new cognitive revolution to the species; and the fact that the arrival of homo sapiens in Australia was a defining moment in human history. The vacancy which the Palaeolithic age occupies in the Australian imagination was not a vacancy but a teeming stage.</p>
<p>What will you read next? I do my best to pretend I’ve read every new book soon after publication. My holiday reading, however, is one I’ve not got around to, despite my admiration for the author. It will be Peter Carey’s Amnesia. Peter has reached the stage of his career where people are used to the security of having him and say, “Oh yes, another Carey novel, how welcome!” This reaction is the enemy of urgency, so I’m looking forward to getting on with it. Urgently.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Kleinhenz</p>
<p>Germaine: The Life of Germaine Greer</p>
<p>Knopf Australia</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: I started this book about the life of Germaine Greer with some trepidation, knowing how extraordinarily complex and contradictory – funny, witty, charming, brilliant, rude, raunchy, sensitive and insensitive – she is. But I was excited at the thought of exploring her archive, which she had only recently sold to Melbourne University. I knew that my greatest challenge would be to balance Greer’s personal life as celebrity, sexual adventurer, mistress of the put-down comment, with her extraordinary intellectual achievements and contributions to second and third-wave feminism.</p>
<p>“Silly old bat”, “idiot”, “pain in the neck” were just a few of the negative comments I received to describe Greer. I realised these people were talking not of her, but of the caricature that has been made of her, largely by some sections of the media. This is unfair to a woman who is probably the most influential Australian woman of her time. I am hoping my book may help to correct this misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Most of my writing to now has been academic in nature, written to appeal to a limited audience in the field of education. This time I wanted not so much to dissect and analyse as to entertain. I am too often disappointed by biographies that tell the facts about a life without engaging the reader in the essence of the person. My hope is that I have created a nuanced and engrossing book, some parts of which have the capacity to make readers laugh out loud.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? I re-read Greer’s own books. I was amazed at the freshness of The Female Eunuch and its continuing appeal. For the first time, I read Daddy We Hardly Knew You. I am sad that she has not written more in this genre.</p>
<p>What will you read next? I am about to read Helen Garner’s True Stories. I am particularly interested in the relevance of her story about writing The First Stone to the Me Too movement and to Germaine Greer’s recent On Rape.</p>
<p>Anne Summers</p>
<p>Unfettered and Alive</p>
<p>Allen &amp; Unwin</p>
<p>Tell us about your book: Unfettered and Alive is a memoir – the story of my public and private lives since the age of 30 – but it is also something of a social history in that it also tells the story of an era through the prisms of journalism, politics, feminism and the music, the books and the overall culture of our time. I am often the principal character in this story, but I am also sometimes just a bystander who was fortunate enough to be close to some pretty important and interesting events and people.</p>
<p>The cast of characters, and places, is large as I have done lots of things in my life. Readers will share the many risks I’ve taken, my failures as well as my successes, and the heartbreak and family trauma that are also part of my story. But, as the title suggests, the book is ultimately one of affirmation and celebration that I, once a scared and self-loathing teenager in 1950s Adelaide, could become the woman I am today.</p>
<p>What were you reading while you wrote it? I needed to reread Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex, a pivotal book in my early life, and was startled to learn that a key quote, which I used to frame my book, was radically altered in the 2015 translation, the first-ever faithful rendition of this book into English, by two feminists, who restored both the integrity and the original length of de Beauvoir’s text.</p>
<p>What will you read next? I am really looking forward to Bri Lee’s Eggshell Skull, which everyone tells me is startlingly good. I had had it on my bookshelf for some months but was unable to start it because I was so involved in the book’s publication and then my month-long book tour of Australia in October/November.</p>
<p>Candy Royalle</p>
<p>A Trillion Tiny Awakenings</p>
<p>UWA</p>
<p>Terri-ann White, director and publisher of UWA Publishing, writes here about this posthumously published collection of Candy Royalle’s work.</p>
<p>Tell us about Candy’s book: I met Candy Royalle in May 2018 after I had accepted her first foray into traditional publishing, a manuscript entitled A Trillion Tiny Awakenings. We scheduled it for early 2019 release in our UWAP Poetry series. The next morning, I was her guest at the Art Gallery of New South Wales for a performance in the room containing the medieval Lady and the Unicorn tapestry, a meditation on earthly pleasures and courtly love. Who knew Candy was as unwell as she must have been? Her proud performance embodied love: intimate, direct, holding nothing back.</p>
<p>Candy’s preparations for publication were precise. She knew where she wanted this book to go and intended to submit the final manuscript to me after a residency yielded new poems. That residency didn’t happen, and we got the shocking news that Candy had died in June. The up-swelling of grief was the reason we decided to bring the release forward, making it a stand-alone book with a stunning photograph of Candy by her beloved friend Nicola Bailey.</p>
<p>What should be read alongside it? Publishing this book has demonstrated to me the power that friendship and influence of other poets had for Candy and her writing. We’ve seen it in the media and in social media, and via email I’ve had mountains of tributes to Candy by writers and poets including Ali Cobby Eckermann (who wrote an introduction to the volume), Quinn Eades and Omar Musa, who write of the love and inspiration gained from Candy. Vale, Candy.

<h3 id="the-patricians-and-the-plebeians-a-very-roman-social-struggle">&ldquo;The Patricians and the Plebeians: A Very Roman Social Struggle&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ancient-origins.net/sites/default/files/field/image/Patricians-and-Plebeians.jpg" alt="img">
During the time of the Roman Kingdom and the Roman Republic, Roman society was divided between two important classes – the patricians and the plebeians. Originally, the patricians were part of the ruling class and enjoyed greater privileges and rights than the plebeians. Following the Conflict of the Orders, however, the distinction between patrician and plebeian lost importance, as the plebeians (at least the wealthiest among them) could now aspire to political power.</p>
<p>What Was the Difference Between Patricians and Plebeians?</p>
<p>According to Livy, after Rome was founded, Romulus selected 100 men to form the Roman Senate, which would govern the newly-formed city. By virtue of their rank, these men were called ‘patres’ (meaning ‘fathers’), and their descendants formed the patrician class. As the ruling class of Rome, the patricians enjoyed a variety of privileges. For example, it was only members of the patricians who were allowed to hold political and religious offices.</p>

<p>Unlike the patricians, the origin of the plebeian class was not recorded by the ancient authors. This is unsurprising, since the plebeians were not part of Rome’s ruling elite but were members of the general citizenry. The plebeians enjoyed far less privileges than the patricians and eventually sought to change the status quo. This resulted in the Conflict of the Orders, a struggle between the patrician and the plebeian classes that lasted from 500 to 287 BC.</p>
<p>Conflict of the Orders: Patricians and Plebeians History</p>
<p>The Conflict of the Orders began as a result of the dissatisfaction felt by the plebeians regarding the status quo in Rome. Till then, political power was monopolized by the patrician class. The situation deteriorated further around the end of the 6 th century BC. In 509 BC, Tarquinius Superbus, the last Roman king was deposed, and the Roman Republic was founded. One of the consequences of this change from monarchy to republic was the increase in the power held by the patricians. An example of this is the loss of access by the plebeians to public land (which had been regal domain during the Roman Kingdom). In order to increase their wealth, the patricians seized these lands and either rented them out, or had slaves work on them.</p>
<p>Tarquinius Superbus makes himself King; from The Comic History of Rome by Gilbert Abbott à Beckett (Posner / Public Domain )</p>
<p>Facts Regarding the First Important Incident</p>
<p>The plebeians grew increasingly displeased with this inequity and began making demands to right these wrongs. The first important incident in the Conflict of the Orders occurred in 494 BC. In that year, Rome was at war with the Italic tribes . Instead of fighting the enemy, however, the plebeians seceded from Rome to the Sacred Mountain outside the city. The patricians were aware that the secession of the plebs would have dire consequences for Rome’s military might, as there would not be enough fighting men to defend Rome. Therefore, they decided to negotiate with the plebeians, which resulted in the plebeians being granted the right to elect their own officials, who were known as the Plebeian Tribunes.</p>

<p>Secession: The Patrician and Plebeian Conflict Continues</p>
<p>As the plebeians formed the majority of Rome’s citizenry, secession was a powerful weapon at their disposal and was used several times more after 494 BC. Each time the plebeians seceded, the patricians were forced to negotiate, and to concede to their demands. In 451 BC, for example, the secession by the plebeians resulted in the appointment of the decemvirate, a commission of ten men. Another secession occurred in 445 BC, which resulted in the passing of the Canuleian Law. This law allowed the patricians and plebeians to inter-marry.</p>

<p>Threats, Demands, and Negotiations on the Road to Equality</p>
<p>Nevertheless, secession was not always necessary for the plebeians to obtain what they wanted. Without the use of secession, the plebeians were still able to make demands on the patricians and negotiate with them. In 367 BC, for instance, the plebeians won the right to be elected consul, and the first consul from the plebeian class was chosen in the following year. From 300 BC onwards, the plebeians were also allowed to serve in the priesthoods. As the Conflict of the Orders dragged on, the gap between the patricians and plebeians, in terms of privileges and rights, decreased.</p>
<p>The Hortensian Law Ends the Conflict of the Orders</p>
<p>As the Conflict of the Orders began with a plebeian secession, so was it ended by another. In 287 BC, the plebeians seceded for the last time. The result of the secession was the passing of the Hortensian Law, which made all resolutions passed by the Plebeian Council binding on all Roman citizens, thus placing the plebeians, politically speaking, on equal footing with the patricians.</p>

<h3 id="homers-crowdsourced-genius">&ldquo;Homer’s Crowdsourced Genius&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492187024/articles/2015/01/11/homer-s-crowdsourced-genius/150110-romeo-homers-crowdsourcing-genius-tease_sqp6qx" alt="img">
In the early years of the 20th century, a German archaeologist discovered hell. To be precise, he found the location of Hades, the underworld of the ancient Greeks—or so he suggested. The site was in a hilly region of southwestern Spain with abandoned mines dating back to the Bronze Age. The earth was red and orange; the landscape metallic and lifeless.</p>
<p>In Homer’s Odyssey, the goddess Circe directs Odysseus to “the dank house of Hades,” located at “the meeting place of two roaring rivers.” Hades is described as a distant realm at the fringes of the ancient Mediterranean world, and Bronze Age Greek archaeological deposits suggest southwestern Spain might have occupied precisely this periphery.</p>
<p>The confluence that Circe mentions is intriguingly similar to an estuary near the coastal city of Huelva, Spain, where two rivers flow together. The Homeric geography of Hades is barren and menacing; the trees are fruitless and the rivers bear Greek names that can be translated as “hateful,” “blazing,” and “howling.” The rivers that mingle at Huelva are naturally poisoned with chemical residues, and only one type of weed can live in the water, which often runs an iron red. The landscape is austere and infertile, precisely the sort of lifeless place where even the young and beautiful Persephone, a seasonal captive of Hades, would lose her fecund powers.</p>
<p>At an ancient Bronze Age mine in the hills above Huelva, workers once loosened ore by setting fires in subterranean crevices. The labor was hot, dangerous, and seemingly endless. Homer’s Hades is not the flame-licked inferno of the Christian imagination, however, but a pale realm of insubstantial shadows. Odysseus lures the fluttering souls of the dead with the stuff of life: milk, wine, honey, and even the blood of sacrificed lambs. Only then are the ghosts sufficiently enlivened and appeased to answer Odysseus’s questions.</p>
<p>If ancient miners resembled their more recent counterparts, they thought of mines as sites of spirits. From Renaissance Germany to 19th century England, miners across Europe imagined that the hills and mountains where they worked were populated by capricious spirits who could cause a collapse if not placated. Like Odysseus feeding the shades of Hades, many miners left small offerings of food to appease the spirits who dwell in the caverns.</p>
<p>So was Homer’s Hades inspired, however indirectly, by memories of a Bronze Age mine in southwestern Spain? It’s impossible to know with certainty, but this is just one of many tantalizing traces of the Homeric epics that Adam Nicolson examines in his captivating and beautifully written new book, Why Homer Matters. He travels to the island of Chios, seven miles off the coast of Turkey, to visit an abandoned village from 800 BC and explore the rocky landscape where Homer may have lived. He walks around Ischia, near the Bay of Naples, searching for the lush and seductive island of Calypso and studying pottery and grave goods. He even feels echoes of Odysseus’s nautical voyages while sailing on the Atlantic in a small vessel, the spray misting his face.</p>
<p>Nicolson’s title—Why Homer Matter—assumes some skepticism about Homer’s relevance to our world. He tells a funny story about a 19th-century French dinner party at which various intellectuals argued so heatedly about Homer’s merits that someone threatened to hurl himself out a window. It’s certainly true that shouted arguments about Homer are not exactly common anymore. The historian Victor Davis Hanson’s 1998 Who Killed Homer? went so far as to perform a book-length autopsy investigating the causes of Homer’s death. For Hanson (and his co-author John Robert Heath), Homer perished at the hands of pedants, his deep human relevance buried beneath mounds of trivial and obscure scholarship. For Nicolson, however, Homer is essentially unkillable. Hanson criticized the sins of stuffy academics; Nicolson sings a rapturous love song to the beauty and force of Homeric epic.</p>
<p>His search for tangible vestiges of the Homeric world is only part of a broader agenda to discover the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of Homer’s sprawling epics. Nicolson is not an adventurer or relic hunter; this is not The Year of Living Homerically (first I besieged and sacked London, then I carried off Princess Kate as a concubine, slaying a few lords who intervened). Nor is Nicolson a modern-day Heinrich Schliemann, the infamous 19th-century German businessman who sloppily excavated the city of Troy, dressed his wife in the jewelry he found, and declared, falsely, “I have gazed on the face of Agamemnon.”</p>
<p>Nicolson is closer to what the philosopher George Santayana once called a secondary prophet: a gifted figure who popularizes and illuminates without compromising the complexity of a primary creator. Such language might make Homer sound a bit like God, but this is more or less the view many writers hold. Aeschylus proclaimed that all Greek tragedies were merely scraps from the banquet of Homer. Goethe wished that Europe had revered Homer rather than the Bible as its scripture, claiming that history would have been different and better with Homer as a sacred text. In a famous sonnet, Keats likened his first encounter with Homer to the experience of discovering a new planet or continent. Homer is a maker of worlds.</p>
<p>He’s also a broken reflection of vanished worlds. There are many familiar moments in the Iliad and the Odyssey—the pleasures of feasting with friends, the pains of nostalgia and hunger, the horror of warfare, the delights of the erotic—but the poems also reveal some attitudes that are utterly foreign. Odysseus boasts happily about sacking a city, killing all the men, and enslaving the women and children. The old Greek warrior Nestor motivates his comrades by dangling before them the prospect of raping the wives of their slaughtered enemies. Warriors regularly taunt the corpses of those they’ve just killed, boasting that now dogs and birds will eat their genitals. The Greek warrior Achilles threatens to eat the corpse of the Trojan Hector, and even Hera, Queen of the gods, longs to eat the raw liver of a Trojan.</p>
<p>These might seem like moments of literary flourish that don’t actually show ancient attitudes towards warfare. But the casual brutality is too frequent and pervasive to be explained away. Consider the moment in book nine of the Odyssey when the Cyclops smashes the brains of two Greek soldiers against the floor of his cave and then eats them. To make the moment relatable, Homer adds a simile. The Cyclops bashes the men against the earth like they are puppies: because who hasn’t dashed open the head of a young puppy on the ground?</p>
<p>Nicolson thinks that certain clues in the Homeric epics can help us peer into the darkness that shrouds the ancient Mediterranean between 2000 and 3000 BC. With some archaeological and linguistic sleuthing, he makes an interesting if speculative case that the Iliad preserves a cultural memory of a dramatic clash between the nomadic warriors of the northern Eurasian steppes and the sedentary city-dwellers of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>In his reading, the Greeks were once marauding raiders who swept into the Mediterranean world from the North. There are words for cattle and sheep in the Proto-Indo-European language ancestral to ancient Greek, whereas words for quintessential features of the Greek landscape like the olive tree appear later. Much of the language for ships and sailing also seems to have been co-opted from the terminology of horses and chariots. The sea in Homer is sometimes figured as a vast steppe across which ships race like horses.</p>
<p>Treating Homer as a window onto the pre-history of ancient migrations, beliefs, and practices is an intriguing but perilous approach. Often the spirit if not the substance of his stories seems true: even if men never hid inside a hollow wooden horse to sack a city, strategic deception has always been an essential element of warfare in general and siege-craft in particular. We shouldn’t believe Homer when he says that his heroes easily hoisted massive boulders that later mortals could barely budge. But warfare in the ancient Mediterranean was a grueling physical affair that rewarded immense strength, stamina, and speed.</p>
<p>One of Nicolson’s many intriguing suggestions is that the magical ships that convey Odysseus home to Ithaca from the island of the Phaeacians preserve the memory of landlocked Northerners’ first encounters with ships. The vessels intuit and obey the desires of their sailors without prompting. Someone from the inlands who saw a sailing ship speed across the sea could easily think the sailors and their ships had a telepathic connection.</p>
<p>A single individual named Homer, of course, probably never lived. Ethnographic research in the 20th century showed that singers of epic poems in many cultures all employ certain formulaic structures in the phrasing and plotting of their stories. Any reader of Homer remembers his frequent epithets: long-suffering Odysseus, ox-eyed Hera, swift-footed Achilles, the wine-dark sea. But these lexical units are only one scale at which repetition occurs; entire scenes of arming, feasting, fighting, and greeting also recur. This regularity eases the mnemonic demands on the singer by allowing him to choose from a finite set of predictable and metrically appropriate options.</p>
<p>The oral nature of Homeric epic does not mean that particularly talented bards never left their marks on the poems. A singer who arranged beautiful and effective combinations of phrases and sequences and knew whether to linger on a scene or fast-forward with narrative summary would have influenced other bards. Miles Davis shaped jazz more than an average professional trumpeter, but Davis is not synonymous with jazz. Homer, too, is larger than any one individual, even if especially gifted singers helped mold the tradition.</p>
<p>Different oral versions of the Homeric epics existed throughout the ancient Mediterranean world; there was a Homer of Crete and a Homer of Cyprus, a Homer of Athens and a Homer of Delos. It was only the scholars of ancient Alexandria who standardized the version of Homer that was rediscovered in the Renaissance and has become canonical today.</p>
<p>Part of why Homer matters, then, is because his poetry represents a powerful alternative to later models of literature as a dazzling feat of singular genius. Calling Homer’s poetry crowdsourced smacks of the slang favored by trendy tech gurus, but there is something fundamentally social and collaborative about the creative products of an oral culture. The bards in Homer—notably Demodocus in book eight of the Odyssey—aim to please their listeners, and they are richly rewarded with honor, wine, and meat when they succeed. The bards who comprise the shaggy, many-tongued being we call Homer were probably no different. Tailoring a given performance to accommodate the mood of an audience or the local history of a region may have been a common practice. If you are singing an Iliad in Argos, then perhaps the Argive warriors will be especially ferocious in battle, leaving a trail of Trojan corpses in their wake.</p>
<p>But Homer matters not only as a source of ancient anthropology; he’s also a guide to the geography of human psychology that hasn’t changed over the past four millennia. The different islands that Odysseus confronts on his voyage home to Ithaca are metaphors for the lures of nostalgia (the Sirens), forgetfulness (Lotus Eaters), the erotic (Calypso), the comfortable (the Phaeacians), and the delicious (Circe). Each island tempts a different aspect of his nature; each threatens to indefinitely postpone the homecoming that is his true desire. Homer’s enchanted Mediterranean is ultimately a metaphor for the human mind: a realm of dangers and delights that we all must navigate toward the final Ithaca of mortality.

The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared</p>
<p>From Sweden, a comedy about a retirement-home resident who decides it’s time to escape and have a new adventure. It may be significant that he used to be a dynamite expert. Robert Gustafsson stars. Felix Herngren directed.</p>
<p>1001 Grams</p>
<p>From Norway, a romantic comedy about recalibrating the national Norwegian kilo. Bent Hamer wrote and directed this story of a bored scientist in a bad marriage who goes to Paris for a seminar and meets a guy who is seriously into weights and measures. Ane Dahl Torp and Laurent Stocker star.</p>
<p>Piku</p>
<p>A father-daughter road-trip drama from India. Shoojit Sircar directed.</p>
<p>Playing It Cool</p>
<p>Chris Evans is a disillusioned screenwriter who thinks romantic comedies are all lies — and promptly lives out every one of the genre’s clichés. Michelle Monaghan is the perfect woman he meets and pursues. Too bad he kind of lied about being a wealthy philanthropist. With Aubrey Plaza, Luke Wilson, Anthony Mackie and a bearded Topher Grace. Justin Reardon directed.</p>
<p>Preggoland</p>
<p>A party-loving single 35-year-old — the kind of woman who’d bring a sex toy as a gift to a baby shower — is surrounded by friends having kids. Feeling excluded and loserly, she blurts out a lie — that she’s pregnant — and is forced to keep up the bluff. Sonja Bennett stars in her own screenplay; Jacob Tierney directed. James Caan plays her delighted father.</p>
<p>Saint Laurent</p>
<p>He took over the House of Dior when he was 21. He tried to introduce a fragrance called Opium — and got away with it. From France, nine intense years in the life of a fashion designer with issues, starring Gaspard Ulliel as Yves Saint Laurent. Nominated for 10 César awards, including best actor, director (Bertrand Bonello) and picture. (It won for best costume design.)</p>
<p>The Seven Five</p>
<p>Michael Dowd was a police officer in the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn. He robbed drug dealers, sold cocaine and ran his own crime ring. This documentary, directed by Tiller Russell, explains why, when Mr. Dowd was finally arrested in 1992, it was not by his own precinct but by Long Island cops.
