<p>Colleges have come rushing forth to announce that they will be inviting students back to campus this fall. But as I’ve spoken to college officials over the past few weeks — usually not for quotation — I’ve been struck by the difference between their public optimism and their private uncertainty.</p>
<p>Many university leaders aren’t sure how well on-campus living and in-person classes will work during this pandemic. Some acknowledge it may not work at all.</p>
<p>It will require radical changes to the normal campus experience, like canceling many activities, rotating which students can return (to keep dorms from being too full) and continuing to hold classes online (to protect professors).</p>
<p>This approach is likely to frustrate students — and it still might not prevent new coronavirus outbreaks. Nearly all distinctive parts of a campus experience, including parties, meals and extracurriculars, revolve around close social contact, often indoors.

Webster says that the term bragging rights is “a good reason to talk with pride about something you have done.”</p>
<p>As a young boy onward it seemed that life on the farm was based always on competing for that defined right. It didn’t matter if it was who was the strongest to who could skip a flat stone across a space of water and causing the most skips. If you did the most you then had the right to brag if so desired. I feel safe in saying this went on from daylight until dusk.</p>
<p>I feel it was due to a farmer’s life mostly. Most all a farmer does is manual labor of some sort and of a skill most always was needed to move the job along quicker. From weeding tobacco beds to tossing bales of hay. The jobs were greatly needed but let’s face it the jobs took up a lot of hours. Hours that became boring and mundane in nature. That was unless the task was turned into a competition in some way or form. For example look at setting tobacco. You set on the transplanter with a bunch of plants to go into the ground. All the person really had to do was take a plant put it in the finger that put it into the ground then grab another plant. Over and over until the day ended or the patch was completely set. Think about it. Boring! But if a person counted how many plants went through their hands in a minute, well the one who put the most plants in the ground was the fastest. Wouldn’t the two on the setter come out even? Not if you get in too big of a hurry and missed your turn. This could and did go on all day and the best got to boast.</p>
<p>This could be for a group such as a hay crew to see how many bales of hay they could move from the field into the hay mow. When talking to other guys from other crews the numbers were matched and a winner would be declared in most cases. Sometimes convincing the other person you were faster didn’t happen and it stayed a tie. From the start of the day on we would match each other as to how much, how long, or how fast.</p>
<p>This would also spill over to a farmer and his crops or produce from their gardens. How many bushel to the acre of corn, or pounds of tobacco per acre. I have seen huge tomatoes on the front porch at a farmer’s house or a very large potato so any visitor could see the monster you had grown in your garden. It also allowed anyone who thought they could out do it to bring it on. For at least until the next growing season the top producer had earned the right to tell of his ability to outgrow all others. Not all would brag but I have seen quite a few that if someone brought up how well you had done they would just smile real big and nod their heads to confirm it.</p>
<p>But of all the contests for the bragging rights around here it was who could cut tobacco the fastest. Cutting tobacco was a talent that not all could excel at. It seemed in each neighborhood there would be one or two that could and would put the stalks of tobacco on the sticks so quickly and accurately and show little or no effort that they earned a lot of praise from all the rest.</p>
<p>I feel I have cut with some of these men in the same patch. I didn’t say I was cutting beside them. I want to name some I have witnessed but am afraid I would miss someone.</p>
<p>The story I will relay is of a man before my time and can only tell what I was told. In I think the 40’s there was a young man named Mel Ott from around Felicity that they said was the fastest. One day a retired man said I don’t believe you to be the fastest and I am betting you 50 dollars that you can’t drop your own sticks and cut 1,000 sticks of tobacco in an eight hour day. Mel said I will take your bet but I’m being paid by the stick, so no matter what the outcome I still want to be paid what I earn by the stick. The man said it’s a bet. So the next day many folks other than the other cutters and the man who bet showed up and watched Mel. He didn’t cut 1,000 sticks but instead he cut over 1,250 sticks approximately as I’ve been told. Now a thousand sticks in a day is the measuring stick for a very good cutter and what Mel did was a land mark for a new standard. I believe this to be true as the bet was carried out on my dad’s farm and he is the one who told me this. Dad wasn’t a man to bet but he loved a great contest. He said besides, he got more tobacco cut that day than he had all fall. From that time forward Mel Ott held the bragging rights if he wanted to brag but I never heard him boast. However if ask he would smile and nod his head yes.</p>
<p>For a million bragging rights and to make a day move faster and with some added interest it served their purpose then and I assume they still do. I have tried many times to win at a challenge of the best and can say sometimes I did. Also it is safe to say many times I didn’t but almost every time I enjoyed the chance to take on the challenge. When it came to lifting I could win most times. I could even lift the front end of a Volkswagen and carry it in a half circle and never lost that challenge. But remember that strength doesn’t take the need for talent or skills. Just big muscles to lift. But it helped the day pass a little easier and made it more interesting.</p>

<p>Comments</p>
<p>Well, I’m sure we all need several stiff drinks and a straightforward Plain or two after that. Special congratulations to the 130 who stuck with it and submitted entries. I didn’t spot any mistakes, though in truth I wasn’t looking very hard for these. I guessed it would be a really tough challenge for you, but if it’s any consolation it took me many, many hours to complete the thing. I started pondering on a suitable theme months before the deadline and was getting pretty desperate before the 502 idea occurred to me and the thing started to take shape. The main problem was not so much the construction of the grid (all entries having to have an even number of letters, at least four of each but not too many 4-letter words and these not having more than one unchecked letter each). Rather it was the clue-writing itself and then checking that I’d accounted for each repositioned half. (One competitor asked if I’d noticed that ZA represented 2,500 in medieval Latin, with the implication that that might have formed the basis for a theme. Alas I had not, and the opportunity has passed for good!)</p>
<p>Given the special restraints imposed, writing convincing (and reasonably short) clues was also not easy, and on the whole I was much impressed by your efforts. Many still took the time to pick favourites: 12 received votes with most going to ‘Severely criticise constitutional activity when limited by the crown’ for PAS(EAR/BER)ATE. Of clues submitted most were on the themes of either the coronavirus scourge or the milestone represented by the puzzle. Many of the latter, including Mr Willett’s fine winner, were blush-makingly complimentary to me and I do hope I do not appear too self-regarding in quoting them above. I was quite overwhelmed by the large number of special messages, cards and other ways of acknowledging the event which you kindly sent. I hope you will understand that I cannot reply personally to them all, but it did make the whole thing gratifyingly memorable for me. Thank you all so much for your continuing loyalty to the series.

Then there are a couple of equipment references. I don’t know my cleeks from my baffies, so I figured out 88A, “problems with an angled club,” on crosses. Same goes for 100A — my golf knowledge is increasing in leaps and bounds now, but I’d have still been better off with a reference to anemia, say, for this entry (maybe this occurred to me only after actually encountering ANEMIA a few clues later). And, finally, a reminder that I’m still pretty ill-equipped to comment on said sport, even though I thought this theme and its clues were lovely.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>I love all the little bubbles of youth that effervesce through this grid, ranging from goofy (GAG, SNARF and ARFED, PLONKS) to snarky (TOUPEE) to techy (how can “In Real Life” be a debut?). I loved the clue for APP as well, referring to something you buy on your phone (and I fell down the rabbit hole on this one, because there are a lot of good apps that they’re pushing on us for free now that we’re an even more captive audience).</p>
<p>4A: I love bees, too, and I hope it warms up soon in Queens so I can enjoy them buzzing through the crab apples near my house. I have a neighbor who keeps a hive in his yard and dons a suit, so I guess I have a local APIARY.</p>
<p>71A: We can count this as sporting equipment, a BOBSTAY, for sailers and yachters — right? I’d never have guessed it without SPEEDBAG crossing, which also helped with AEGIS, with a tough clue.</p>
<p>31D: Sigh, Harry Potter, I get it — he’s here, he’s everyweir, I need to get used to it. This is the second time ELDER WAND has been in the Times grid and the second time ELDER WAND has been in a Jeff Chen Times grid. Repetitus Chenitus!</p>
<p>50D: I enjoyed a SETI reference in the same grid as BAT SIGNAL.</p>
<p>102D: A sentimental favorite today; we tend to think of “spoilers” as ruining the ending, but NANAS provide a much more comforting experience. Juxtaposed next to CRONE? Bad FENG SHUI.</p>
<p>Constructor Notes</p>
<p>Mr. Mowat: Before I say anything at all, I want to take this chance to wish my sister Margaret a happy 16th birthday!!! With that out of the way, I am very happy to have my first Sunday puzzle published in the NYT! (Of course this is far from Jeff’s first.) Being that this was my first stab at a 21x grid it was tricky getting the fill for this one. With the long themer spanning the middle, we had to make a few compromises, especially in the upper half of the grid, but I am still happy with how it turned out. We got some nice stuff in there and I’m particularly proud to debut the three-letter entry IRL. The theme started off pretty broad but Jeff and I were able to narrow it down to some fun golf themers. At that point we discovered that a similarly themed Sunday puzzle ran in the times in 2012. We felt as though this was long enough ago to press on but we thought that it needed an extra element. It was Jeff’s idea then to focus on mistakes a golfer might make. This addition made the theme a lot tighter and made me smile at each theme entry a little bit more. Finally, a big shout out to my dad, an avid golfer, whom I had in the back of my mind as this puzzle got made. I know this doesn’t make up for the Masters getting postponed, but maybe this is the next best thing! Hope everyone is happy and healthy, and enjoys the puzzle!</p>

Yu Darvish, hit hard by Astros in 2017 Series, says, ‘They don’t have to talk’</p>
<p>Recommended Video:</p>
<p>Yu Darvish</p>
<p>The ex-Dodgers right-hander was hit hard by the Houston Astros in the 2017 World Series, and after a bullpen session for the Chicago Cubs on Sunday, he sought to settle the score. He said the Astros, their sign-stealing exposed, should be stripped of their title. “Like the Olympics, when a player cheats, they can’t have a gold medal,” Darvish said. “But (Houston) still has a World Series title. It does make me feel weird. That’s it.” Darvish said he wasn’t actually angry about the sign-stealing scandal but said the somewhat defiant Astros should be more apologetic. “So they cheat, I think, right now, they don’t have to talk. They shouldn’t talk like that,” he said.</p>
<p>Joe Palumbo</p>
<p>The pitching prospect is bound to lose weight in spring training, but he might lose more than anyone else on the Texas Rangers’ roster. The left-hander doesn’t have Valley Fever or a stomach bug; he has dropped daily 4,000-calorie shakes from his diet. “It was a grind, but I got it done,” he said. The purpose behind the shakes, with protein powder, creatine, fruit, yogurt, eggs and more, was to put weight on his slight frame to add strength and endurance. Palumbo, who made his MLB debut last season, said he added 20 to 25 pounds. “Sometimes I’d be there for like and hour and a half, just competing through it,” he said.</p>

The new coronavirus is not an equal opportunity killer.</p>
<p>We know COVID-19 is more deadly the older you get. It’s also more dangerous for those who have chronic lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, weakened immune systems and other underlying health issues .</p>
<p>And yet our news feeds are full of stories about seemingly healthy young people who are quickly struck down, like 32-year-old Jéssica Beatriz Cortez or a 25-year-old pharmacy tech from La Quinta.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>These tragic deaths seem all the more confounding when you consider a flurry of new scientific studies that suggest as many as 20% of people who are infected with the coronavirus — and possibly many more — never develop any symptoms.</p>
<p>This lucky group is spared the dry cough, fever and body aches we now associate with COVID-19, even while the virus proliferates in their bodies and potentially spreads to others.</p>

<p>This new understanding about the role of “silent spreaders” is why the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health authorities are now suggesting that people wear masks when they leave the house. The recommendation is primarily designed to keep asymptomatic people from unwittingly spreading a disease they may not even know they have.</p>

<p>But how can the same virus affect people so differently — killing some while leaving others blissfully unaware that they have been infected at all?</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times spoke with two infectious disease experts — Dr. Otto Yang of UCLA and Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez of USC — to answer that question.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind before we continue: It is possible that the information you read below will be contradicted in the coming weeks or that gaps in knowledge today will soon be filled as scientists continue to study the virus.</p>

<p>“There is an explosion of research about this, and what we know about it is changing almost by the hour,” Jones-Lopez said.</p>
<p>Here’s what they know so far:</p>
<p>What happens when a person is infected with the new coronavirus?</p>
<p>OY: The coronavirus, like all viruses, is basically just a piece of genetic information that enters into a cell and then hijacks its machinery so that the cell starts producing the virus’ genetic material rather than its own.</p>
<p>EJL: Keep in mind that not all exposures lead to infections. If an infection occurs, it means that the virus has identified the type of cell it needs to establish an infection.</p>

<p>Once an infection has been established, the virus replicates very quickly and is disseminated through the blood.</p>
<p>How does the coronavirus make people sick?</p>
<p>OY: It makes people sick in two ways. Initially, people get fever and cough, and some other symptoms. In this phase, the virus is causing direct damage and infection to cells in the lungs.</p>
<p>Some patients get better after this point, but others get severe inflammation in their lungs and other organs, and that can be life-threatening. This appears to be the immune system reacting severely to the virus.</p>

<p>But there are varying degrees of how sick people get with the disease.</p>
<p>EJL: The data tell us that about 50% of people who acquire the infection develop either no symptoms at all or very mild symptoms to the point that they don’t even know they have it.</p>
<p>Among the other 50%, the estimates are that about 30% develop overt symptoms from mild to moderate.</p>
<p>The last 20% are the ones that develop severe symptoms, and those are the ones that are ending up in the hospital.</p>
<p>Why would the virus affect people so differently?</p>
<p>OY: The simple answer is we don’t know for sure. The big risk factors are diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease and age.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But how each of those contribute to mortality rates is not entirely clear, and they may not contribute in the same way.</p>
<p>EJL: It may not be so much an issue of age as overall health because there are 20-, 30- and 50-year-olds who, despite their relatively young age, are getting very sick.</p>
<p>Older people tend to accumulate more health issues. That is probably one of the reasons that older patients are not doing so well.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But we know that some people who seem healthy are getting very sick as well. What’s causing that?</p>
<p>EJL: We don’t really understand the predictors for who gets critically ill. It may be related to how a person’s particular immune system reacts with the virus that is responsible for how severely it will affect them.</p>
<p>OY: I think of the immune system like the police and the virus like criminals.</p>
<p>If the criminals are easily brought under control, then the police don’t do much collateral damage to the city. But if there is an all-out war with equally matched sides, there is a lot of collateral damage. That’s what we are seeing in the sickest patients.</p>

<p>Is it surprising that the virus would affect people so differently? Do other viruses do that too?</p>
<p>EJL: It actually is somewhat typical, I would say. What’s different is that the coronavirus doesn’t seem to be affecting children in the same way for reasons we don’t understand yet.</p>
<p>That might be a very important scientific clue to investigate in the future.</p>
<p>There are a lot of unknowns. When do you expect to have more answers?</p>
<p>EJL: The virus first surfaced in China just four months ago, and we already have 50 papers published on coronavirus. That’s unheard of. We already know a lot, and it is very likely that in the next six months the knowledge base will multiply by many times.</p>
<p>OY: I’m going to quote Yogi Berra — predictions are really hard to make, especially about the future. But there is a lot of new information trickling out, and I think many of our questions will be answered in the next few months, and definitely within the next year or two.
