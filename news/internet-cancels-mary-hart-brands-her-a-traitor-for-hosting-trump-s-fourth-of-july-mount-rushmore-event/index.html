<p>OG &lsquo;Entertainment Tonight&rsquo; host Mary Hart has been out of the spotlight for many years. The former television star has finally made a reappearance, however, the internet doesn&rsquo;t appear to be too happy about it. Hart was seen hosting President Donald Trump&rsquo;s rally at Mount Rushmore, as the President and First Lady Melania arrived at the historical site to kick off the July 4th celebrations.</p>
<p>The event began with a show by the US Navy Blue Angels that was MCed by Hart. At the event, Trump is expected to speak on the rampant &ldquo;cancel culture&rdquo; that seems to be trending all over the internet.</p>
<p>When fans saw Hart at the event, many were taken by surprise, which was soon replaced with anger directed at her for not only supporting the President but also hosting an event for him. Ironically, while the President seems hell-bent on getting rid of the &ldquo;cancel culture&rdquo;, internet users began canceling Hart. A user tweeted, &ldquo;Time to cancel Mary Hart&hellip; #CancelMaryHart.&rdquo; Another user wrote, &ldquo;Mary Hart is a horrible person for doing this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say I&rsquo;m shocked Mary Hart is Trump supporter, but I&rsquo;m not. There&rsquo;s a certain vibe conservative celebrities put out there that I can just sense,&rdquo; expressed a user. Another user shared, &ldquo;Guess I’ll never look at Mary Hart in the same way. She needs to be boycotted for anything going forward.&rdquo; &ldquo;So add Mary Hart to the Scott Baio/Dean Cain list of Trump-supporting has-beens,&rdquo; commented an annoyed user. &ldquo;Traitor!&rdquo; declared another.</p>
<p>Hart became a household name and was a permanent fixture on television from many years after her show &lsquo;Entertainment Tonight&rsquo; became a smashing success. She earned many fans after her stint on television. But these fans seem to be having second thoughts on their adoration towards her after watching her extend support to Trump.</p>
<p>A former fan wrote, &ldquo;#maryhart Wow. I remember when I used to respect and adore her. No more. Bye gurl bye.&rdquo; Another user shared, &ldquo;Mary Hart trending and lately usually means the person is dead or something bad happened to them and then you find it&rsquo;s even worse than that. She&rsquo;s a #MAGAts.&rdquo; &ldquo;#MaryHart has been irrelevant for a decade now, but will forever be remembered for propping up evil on a pedestal. F you Mary Hart!&rdquo; declared a user.</p>

Rushmore Rally Brings Out Mary Hart As A MAGA Supporter While Don Jr.’s Girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Tests Positive for COVID-19&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Mary-Hart-Kimberly-Guilfoyle-President-Donald-Trump-Rally.jpg" alt="img">
President Donald Trump grabbed Mary Hart, of Entertainment Tonight fame, and no one linked to rival entertainment news program Access Hollywood, as his Master of Ceremonies at the July 4th celebration at Mt. Rushmore earlier today.</p>
<p>Supporters of the former reality TV star said that Hart was the right pick because she is from South Dakota. However, many people on social media were shocked that the TV personality came out as a Trump supporter.</p>
<p>Hollywood elites are often presented as anti-Trump, and Hart seems to have chosen a different path. The Trump rally also grabbed headlines because many in attendance were not wearing masks or practicing social distancing as the COVID-19 pandemic keeps gaining ground in the country.</p>
<p>Moreover, earlier in the day, Kimberly Guilfoyle, the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr., tested positive for coronavirus. She is also a top fund-raising official for the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>Friday, the White House also opted to campaign on the idea that Americans will have to live with the virus moving forward. Experts say that this kind of pessimistic messaging is a gift to Democrats.</p>
<p>About the rally, one Trump supporter stated: “It was a wonderful speech, definitely doing a great job: but kind of heartbroken no Jr. who else is going to wake the masses.”</p>
<p>A second Republican chimed in: “As far as I’m concerned, everyone is testing positive with no symptoms 🤨 So what’s really going on?”</p>
<p>Another backer of the administration added: “Oh no, she tested positive for common cold via a test that Birx herself admits is only 50% accurate, whoop’d fucking D! Oh and 89% of all people have zero symptoms because it’s sooooo strong. 🙄🙄 When does stupid end? Like seriously how pathetically dumb are we? We stopped humanity because leftists don’t want to lose power and are working with global eugenist to kill us off. And we go right on along with it.”</p>
<p>A critic replied: “I’m shocked. No mask. No social distancing. And she’s caught COVID19? How’s this possible?!”</p>
<p>A social media user mocked Hart for attending the event with: “Mary Hart came out of her irrelevant cave for a token speech and left with a corona parting gift…….”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Some are wondering if the rally will be a plus or a minus for the Trump campaign.

US President Donald Trump and his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, arrived to Mount Rushmore on Saturday to mark July Fourth, America’s Independence Day.</p>
<p>The celebration began with a show by the US Navy Blue Angels and is led by TV personality Mary Hart, who is originally from South Dakota and won the title of Miss South Dakota in 1970.</p>
<p>Trump is expected to speak out against “cancel culture”, which is the idea modern America should remove certain monuments to persons such as Robert E. Lee or former US president Woodrow Wilson for holding racist views.</p>

Rappaport, 49, has taken the time to get to know a lot of baseball people. Mets fans may recognize him from Dodgers games in Los Angeles, where he often sits with Larry King and Mary Hart. Since his net worth is not nearly enough to buy the Mets on his own, Rappaport will need billionaire investors to join his group. Those close to Rappaport believe he should have no problem doing that.
