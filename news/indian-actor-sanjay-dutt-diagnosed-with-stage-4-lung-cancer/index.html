<p>Key Highlights Worldwide, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women If you are diagnosed with lung cancer your doctor will decide the line of treatment based on the location and the stage of cancer Here&rsquo;s all you need to know about stage 3 non-small lung cancer, including the symptoms, treatment and outlook</p>
<p>Lung cancer is said to be the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the risk of a man developing lung cancer in his lifetime is about 1 in 15, whereas, the risk for a woman is about 1 in 17. However, the risk is much higher in smokers than non-smokers. But people who never smoked or who never had prolonged exposure to secondhand smoke can also get lung cancer, and there may be no clear cause of the condition in these cases. Meanwhile, Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt has been reportedly diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer.</p>
<p>The actor took to Twitter to announce that he’s taking a short break from work because of health concerns. “Hi friends, I am taking a short break from work for some medical treatment. My family and friends are with me and I urge my well-wishers not to worry or unnecessarily speculate. With your love and good wishes, I will be back soon,” Dutt wrote. Read on to learn what exactly stage 3 lung cancer is.</p>
<p>What is stage 3 lung cancer?</p>
<p>Lung cancer is defined as a type of cancer that begins in a person’s lungs. Stage 3 lung cancer is when the disease has begun to spread beyond the lung where it started. Medical doctors use stages to help them describe where the cancer is and how it is likely to respond to specific treatments. According to WebMD, stage 3 cancer is in just one lung in most cases and it’s also limited to the lymph nodes, organs, and other tissue near that organ. Here, cancer has not spread, or metastasised, beyond that. Hence, stage 3 lung cancer is also called locally advanced or locoregional disease. The next stage, stage IV, is the last and most serious stage of cancer.</p>
<p>The ACS said that about 80-85 per cent of people with lung cancer have non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and about 10-15 per cent have small-cell lung cancer - a rarer and more aggressive type. Doctors treat these two types of lung cancer differently. Here&rsquo;s all you need to know abut the symptoms, treatment and outlook for stage 3 NSCLC.</p>
<p>Stage 3 lung cancer can be categorised into - 3A, 3B and 3C, depending on the size of the tumour and which lymph nodes and other tissues that have been affected by cancer.</p>
<p>Stage 3A: A person has one or more tumours in one lung and the cancer is in nearby lymph nodes. The cancer hasn’t reached distant organs although it may be in certain nearby tissues.</p>
<p>Stage 3B: This is more advanced and a person has one or more tumours in the same lung. The disease may have spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone and may be in lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest.</p>
<p>Stage 3C: A person has one or more tumours in the same lung and the cancer has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone or to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest. The cancer may be spread to all parts of the chest wall or its inner lining, heart, breastbone, and other nearby tissues but hasn’t spread to distant organs. Stage 3C is the most advanced stage within this stage.</p>
<p>Symptoms of stage 3 lung cancer</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that small and non-small cell lung cancer have similar symptoms, although they can vary between individuals. Sign and symptoms of stage 3 lung cancer may include the following:</p>
<p>Pain in the chest</p>
<p>A cough that won’t go away</p>
<p>Coughing up blood or rust-coloured spit</p>
<p>Difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Wheezing</p>
<p>Weight loss</p>
<p>Hoarseness or an altered voice</p>
<p>Loss of appetite</p>
<p>Pain or difficulty when swallowing</p>
<p>Fatigue and weakness</p>
<p>Swelling in the face, veins of the neck, or both</p>
<p>As cancer progresses through stage 3, it can start to affect other parts of the body and the person may develop other symptoms such as bone pain and jaundice.</p>
<p>Treatment for stage 3 lung cancer</p>
<p>Treatment for stage 3 lung cancer depends on the location, size and other characteristics of the cancer, as well as age and overall health of the patient. In most cases, doctors will treat a person with stage 3 lung cancer using a combination of treatments such as:</p>
<p>Surgery</p>
<p>Chemotherapy</p>
<p>Radiation therapy</p>
<p>Targeted therapy</p>
<p>Immunotherapy</p>
<p>Laser therapy</p>
<p>Endoscopic stent</p>
<p>Treatment for stage 3 lung cancer can be aggressive for many patients as this may give a better chance of survival. Patients can experience pain or discomfort resulting from their cancer or treatment they are receiving. In such cases, they should speak to their doctors who can help them feel more comfortable during treatment or cope with their problems.</p>
<p>Outlook</p>
<p>As with any serious illness, lung cancer can bring uncertainty, worry and other challenges to the patients and their loved ones. Perhaps, doctors often find it challenging to treat stage 3 lung cancer. However, improvements in diagnosis and treatments in recent years have led to better outcomes and survival rates for most cancer patients, including those with stage 3 lung cancer. Currently, there is no cure for stage 3 lung cancer, but treatment can help relieve symptoms and prolong life. While there&rsquo;s no definitive way to prevent lung cancer, adopting healthier lifestyles and being aware of the disease can reduce the risk.</p>

<p>Stage 4 lung cancer, also called metastatic lung cancer, is the most advanced stage of the disease. In this stage, the disease has spread, or metastasized from the lung in which it originated to the other lung, the pericardium (membrane around the heart and lungs), chest and/or other areas of the body. It may also be found in the lymph nodes and multiple organs, including the kidneys and the adrenal gland, but it most often spreads to the bones, liver and/or brain.</p>
<p>Dutt was hospitalised on August 8, after he complained of chest discomfort and his oxygen saturation levels had decreased. Soon after he was admitted, the doctor tested him for COVID-19 through both, the rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests, which were negative.</p>
<p>He was discharged from the hospital on Monday after his health condition was stable.</p>
<p>His fans are praying for his speedy recovery. “Prayers for you sir love you reply for England fans,” wrote one. “Good bless you baba,” wrote another.
