<p>Nine Army families are suing their privatized base housing landlords at Fort Hood, Texas, over what they say were life-threatening levels of mold and &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo; conditions in their homes that ruined their belongings.</p>
<p>The suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in San Antonio, charges that the problems occurred during and after a scandal erupted in 2018 and 2019 over living conditions in military housing communities nationwide.</p>

<p>Complaints from military families following a Reuters report detailing the disrepair and hazardous conditions in privately managed on-base housing prompted promises from the companies and pledges from military officials and lawmakers to fix the problems.</p>
<p>But the issues have not gone away, according to the families at Fort Hood. In an 83-page lawsuit, they charged that Fort Hood Family Housing LP, FHFH, Inc., and Lend Lease US Public Partnerships, LLC, failed to properly address issues in their homes, including hazardous states of disrepair, persistent dampness and high levels of mold.</p>
<p>The families reported developing asthma, skin rashes, nosebleeds, blurred vision, chronic respiratory issues and mental distress while living on base. One family said their oldest child is coughing up blood and has attempted suicide before being diagnosed with severe depression. That depression, the child said, started &ldquo;when he had to throw out all of his mold-contaminated toys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort Hood is nicknamed &lsquo;The Great Place,&rsquo; but service members and their families have discovered that living there is anything but &lsquo;great.&rsquo; Instead, many service members&rsquo; time living there has been marred by neglected, filthy living conditions in on-post housing that has caused the service members and their families injury, personal property damage, illness, heartache, and insult,&rdquo; said Ryan Reed, an attorney with Pulman, Cappuccio &amp; Pullen, LLP., one of the law firms representing the group.</p>
<p>The suit is the latest in a series of legal actions taken by military families alleging that the companies that manage military housing have breached contracts, committed fraud, engaged in deceptive trade practices and are guilty of gross negligence.</p>
<p>Last September, a Marine family was awarded $2 million in a suit against San Diego Family Housing and parent company, Lincoln Military Housing, alleging that water damage, mold and dilapidated conditions in their home at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego caused health problems and damage to their property. But a judge ordered a new trial in December, saying the award was excessive.</p>
<p>Similar lawsuits have been filed over housing at Fort Meade, Maryland, and San Antonio.</p>
<p>In the Fort Hood suit, the families described attempts to have the issues resolved. But the post housing office, they said, brushed off the concerns, took shortcuts in making repairs or simply didn&rsquo;t fix the problems.</p>
<p>Sgt. Jason Kiernan and Sarah Kiernan, the couple whose oldest son was diagnosed with depression after living at Fort Hood, said they experienced respiratory distress living in their home, and all of their children had health problems.</p>
<p>Jason Kiernan, a Marine Corps veteran with combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, said he experienced migraines and had to destroy some of his military equipment and clothing due to mold contamination.</p>
<p>At one point in their house on Drum Song Trail, one of their children fell through a soggy wall in his bedroom, revealing extensive mold behind the drywall, according to the lawsuit. Their youngest child, born while the family lived in the house, allegedly experienced such extensive respiratory distress in the house that he was sent to the post hospital and then medevaced to a children&rsquo;s hospital, where at the age of two months, he spent 20 days in pediatric intensive care with pneumonia.</p>
<p>After a doctor expressed his concerns over the baby&rsquo;s health, Fort Hood Family Housing put the Kiernans in a hotel room with a queen bed and pullout sofa, where they, their three children, including the infant on oxygen, and two dogs lived until they moved out of state, according to the suit.</p>
<p>For Sgt. 1st Class William Hamilton and Courtney Hamilton, duty at Fort Hood got off to a bad start when the couple moved into a base house and immediately encountered fire ants in the backyard. They began experiencing odd health symptoms in the home, which they described as smelling constantly like &ldquo;stale Fritos,&rdquo; according to the suit.</p>
<p>In June 2019, as Courtney Hamilton was cleaning a bathroom floor, a tile popped out, revealing a layer of dark mold underneath, according to the lawsuit. The mold had infiltrated the subflooring, according to the Hamiltons, but the Fort Hood Family Housing declined to remove the subflooring and instead simply replaced the floor and carpeting, the suit alleges.</p>
<p>A company spokeswoman said Fort Hood Family Housing believes it has &ldquo;acted appropriately&rdquo; and is prepared to &ldquo;take all necessary steps to defend these allegations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added that the company has policies that ensure it responds to residents&rsquo; requests for repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our teams are dedicated to providing quality housing to the military families we serve. This is a job that we take very seriously and one that we are honored to have,&rdquo; according to a statement provided by the company.</p>
<p>A Fort Hood spokesman said base officials were aware of the lawsuit but declined to comment on it or the allegations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend Lease [is] the majority (controlling) partner and the Army [is] the minority. Privatization of Fort Hood&rsquo;s family housing was approved by the Army in 2001 under the Residential Communities Initiative program,&rdquo; said Tom Rheinlander, director of Fort Hood Public Affairs.</p>
<p>Other firms representing the families in the suit include the Law Offices of James R. Moriarty, Houston; Watts Guerra LLP, San Antonio; and Johnson Reist PLLC, Plano, Texas.</p>
<p>Additional parties in the suit include Sgt. 1st Class Jesus and Emilee Brown; Staff Sgt. Stephen and Allison Shea; Staff Sgt. Adam and Tiffany Vaughn; Staff Sgt. James and Brittney Butler; Spc. John and Lily Kelley; Capt. Michael and Sarah Jo Proulx; and retired Sgt. Melissa and Samuel Douglass.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and compensation for the families for loss of their personal belongings, mental anguish, economic damage and future costs related to medical conditions related to exposure.</p>
<p>Fort Hood Family Housing manages 5,617 houses at Fort Hood. Across the country, according to the lawsuit, private companies manage more than 200,000 military homes, or 99% of the Pentagon&rsquo;s housing stock.</p>
<p>But while DoD and the services are supposed to exercise oversight over the contracts and agreements with the companies, they largely have failed to do so.</p>
<p>In 2019, the National Defense Authorization Act required the Defense Department to inspect homes, resolve issues and implement reforms to ensure that the problems did not recur. It also proffered a tenant bill of rights that included 15 conditions housing offices must agree to, including the right to have a house in working order, and prompt repairs.</p>
<p>DoD also is working on efforts to provide service members with the rights to receive a maintenance history of their homes and withhold rent if disputes with their landlords are not resolved.</p>
<p>The Military Housing Advocacy Network, a group formed after Reuters&rsquo; award-winning series was published, called the Fort Hood suit &ldquo;a step towards accountability&rdquo; that is needed since the Defense Department or the housing companies have not fixed long-standing problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These companies must be investigated on a larger scale, their blatant violations of service members and tenant rights are only currently being held accountable through litigation. Our military families deserve safe and accessible homes without needing to seek legal counsel,&rdquo; the organization said in a statement.</p>

<p>What would the fiercely articulate writer James Baldwin have made of the world today? Sadly the great man died of stomach cancer aged just 63 in 1987, but this film, made in 2016, shows how his thinking remains powerful, precise, poetic and relevant. Told entirely in Baldwin’s words and using the text (read by Samuel L Jackson) of his final unfinished book project, Remember This House, Raoul Peck’s Oscar-nominated film follows Baldwin’s history of the black experience in America, from ghastly media stereotypes to scenes of police brutality that today feel horribly familiar. Baldwin only completed 30 pages of his final book,

Nadine Milroy-Sloan, 28, of Grimsby, alleged last May that the Hamiltons had forced her to take part in sex games at a flat in Ilford, east London, owned by Barry Lehaney, 61, a retired financial adviser.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons were arrested in August but no charges were levelled. Mr Lehaney was also cleared.</p>
<p>Mr Hamilton was forced to resign from the goverment in 1994 after the Guardian revealed that he had accepted cash in exchange for asking parliamentary questions.</p>
<p>Ms Milroy-Sloan was formally charged that &ldquo;on or before May 6 2001 &hellip; with intent to pervert the course of public justice, you did an act or series of acts which had a tendency to pervert the course of public justice in that you falsely alleged rape and serious sexual assault leading to the arrest of Barry Lehaney, Neil Hamilton and Christine Hamilton which is contrary to common law&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons are pursuing a libel action against Ms Milroy-Sloan, whose assets were frozen by the high court. She has since declared herself bankrupt.</p>
<p>Both sides in the saga sold their stories while the police investigation was continuing, with the Hamiltons making public the lurid allegations against them on the steps of the police station.</p>
<p>Mrs Hamilton said the allegations and investigation had left her &ldquo;traumatised mentally and physically&rdquo;, and described the decision to investigate as an outrage.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons maintained that they had been drinking in Claridges when they were alleged to have been attacking the woman.

<h3 id="the-sex-scandal-that-ruined-alexander-hamiltons-chances-of-becoming-president">&ldquo;The Sex Scandal That Ruined Alexander Hamilton’s Chances of Becoming President&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.history.com/.image/t_share/MTU3ODc4NjAyOTk1ODAzODcx/gettyimages-90015518.jpg" alt="img">
As the first secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Alexander Hamilton built the foundations of the national banking system and wielded more power in the earliest years of American democracy than any other man beside George Washington. Yet unlike Washington, and unlike his longtime nemesis Thomas Jefferson, Hamilton would never serve as U.S. president—not only because he died in a duel by the hands of Aaron Burr.</p>
<p>In fact, as any fan of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s blockbuster hip-hop musical Hamilton knows, Hamilton torpedoed his own presidential ambitions for good in 1797, when he published a tell-all pamphlet about the sordid details of his earlier affair with a married woman, Maria Reynolds, and the blackmail payments he made to her husband to cover up the affair.</p>
<p>Complete with illicit meetings, payments of “hush money” and allegations of corruption, the Reynolds Affair had all the trappings of a modern-day political sex scandal, and was all the more shocking for being the first such drama in U.S. history. It also bears certain similarities to the current scandal surrounding the payments made to prevent the adult film star Stormy Daniels from speaking out about an alleged affair with President Trump.</p>
<p>Maria Reynolds approaches Alexander Hamilton.</p>
<p>According to Hamilton’s version of events, which he shared with the world in 1797, Maria (probably pronounced “Mah-rye-ah”) Reynolds came to his family home in Philadelphia in the summer of 1791, and asked to speak to him in private. The 23-year-old blonde presented herself as a damsel in distress, telling the treasury secretary that her abusive husband, James Reynolds, had left her and their young daughter to run off with another woman. Maria said she was destitute, and asked for money to help her get to friends in New York.</p>
<p>At the time, Hamilton was at the height of his influence as treasury secretary, and could be considered the second most powerful man in the United States. Yet his outspoken style earned him many enemies, which as biographer Ron Chernow has written “should have made him especially watchful of his reputation.” And yet—that night, Hamilton took a 30-note bill to the rooming house where Maria Reynolds was staying. She led him upstairs, where, in his words, “it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable.” They began a sexual relationship, meeting often at Hamilton’s own home after his devoted wife, Eliza, took their children to visit her father in Albany.</p>

<p>James Reynolds bribes Hamilton.</p>
<p>Soon enough, Maria’s sleazy husband, James Reynolds, confronted Hamilton via letter and demanded $1,000 (the equivalent of nearly $25,000 today) to keep quiet about the affair. Hamilton paid the full amount in two installments by January 1792, but Reynolds stayed in Philadelphia despite his promise to leave town. He even encouraged Hamilton to resume the affair with his wife, who claimed to be devoted to her powerful lover. That spring, Reynolds repeatedly asked Hamilton for smaller amounts in “loans,” until finally Hamilton stopped seeing Maria for good in the summer of 1792.</p>
<p>That November, James Reynolds and an associate, Jacob Clingman, were arrested and imprisoned for their involvement in a scheme to defraud the government by posing as the executors of deceased Revolutionary War veterans to get their back pay. While out on bail, Clingman approached his former employer Frederick Muhlenberg, a congressman from Pennsylvania, and claimed that Reynolds had been involved in illegal speculation with none other than Alexander Hamilton. With two colleagues from Virginia, James Monroe and Abraham Venable, Muhlenberg visited James Reynolds in jail and Maria Reynolds at her home, then went to Hamilton’s to confront him in person about these suspected illegal dealings.</p>
<p>To their surprise and embarrassment, Hamilton came clean not about the speculation, but about his extramarital affair, even sharing the letters he received from both Mr. and Mrs. Reynolds. Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable left convinced that Hamilton was innocent of all except adultery, and supposedly promised not to say anything more to anyone. But unbeknownst to Hamilton, Monroe sent copies of the documents Hamilton had shown them to Jefferson, while John Beckley, then the clerk for the House of Representatives, also kept a copy.</p>
<p>The Reynolds Pamphlet. (Credit: Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Yale University/Public Domain)</p>
<p>What caused Hamilton to release the damning “Reynolds Pamphlet” in 1797?</p>
<p>Over the next several years, Hamilton retired from his Cabinet post and went back to New York to his law practice. The Reynoldses split up (with Aaron Burr serving as Maria’s attorney) and Maria married Clingman the same day her divorce became official.</p>
<p>Then in the fall of 1796, in a series of essays written under the name “Phocion,” Hamilton threw shade on Jefferson’s private life, including a pretty big hint about his rumored relationship with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings. In response, the scandal-mongering journalist James Callender struck back hard, writing in the summer of 1797 that not only that Hamilton had his own sexual indiscretions, but that Hamilton had used federal funds to illegally speculate in government securities with Reynolds.</p>
<p>Though John Buckley likely gave Callender access to the documents after Federalists fired him as House clerk, Hamilton himself would blame Monroe. The two men nearly got into a duel over it, before (in another supreme irony) Burr interceded to talk them down. For her part, Eliza Hamilton would reportedly carry a grudge against Monroe for years to come.</p>
<p>Given the charges against him, Hamilton decided his best option was to come clean about his infidelity so he could defend himself on the speculation charges, which would not only ruin his career but permanently stain the Federalist Party and the U.S. Treasury. To that end, in late August 1797 he published what became known as the Reynolds Pamphlet, in which he shared the details of his affair with Maria and the subsequent blackmail payments he made to James Reynolds, including excerpts from their letters.</p>
<p>While the Reynolds Pamphlet successfully refuted the more serious accusations against Hamilton, the sordid revelations of his affair humiliated his wife and permanently ended any hope he might have had of becoming president of the United States. It didn’t destroy his career, however: He continued to exert influence during President John Adams’ Federalist administration, until his feud with Adams exploded into a public attack on the incumbent president just before the election of 1800. Adams lost to Jefferson that year, marking the beginning of the end for the Federalist Party.</p>

<p>How the Reynolds Affair compares to the Stormy Daniels scandal.</p>
<p>Though both the Reynolds Affair and the current scandal involving Stormy Daniels involve payments of “hush money” to cover up extramarital liaisons on the part of powerful men, there are clear differences between the two.</p>
<p>Though Hamilton submitted to blackmail to cover up his extramarital liaison with Maria Reynolds, he was accused of being involved in something much more serious: illegal speculation with federal funds. In the current case, the most serious allegations involve Michael Cohen, Trump’s personal lawyer, who paid the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford (known professionally as Stormy Daniels) $130,000 in exchange for her agreement not to talk about an affair she claims to have had with Donald Trump. Cohen, who denied the affair, said he used his own money to pay Daniels, and was not reimbursed by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign. But he may have violated campaign finance laws with the payment, which was made just 11 days before the 2016 presidential election. Federal law limited the amount an individual can donate directly to a campaign during the 2016 primary and general election to $2,700.</p>
<p>If Trump himself had made the payment to Daniels, the $130,000 would not violate campaign finance laws, as candidates themselves can spend unlimited amounts on their own campaigns. But Trump, who has denied the affair with Daniels, has said he had no idea where the “hush money” came from. On April 9, 2018, FBI agents raided Cohen’s office in New York, seizing business records and other documents, including some related to the payments to Stormy Daniels.</p>
<p>With his back against the wall in mid-1797, Alexander Hamilton proved his innocence of the more serious charges of improper financial dealings by revealing all about his adulterous affair. With Cohen under investigation by the FBI, and President Trump trading barbs on Twitter with Daniels’ lawyer, it seems unlikely the current scandal will end with something as simple as a tell-all pamphlet.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2019/07/thr_speterson_thr_george_hamilton_1_of_3_splash.jpg" alt="img">
He&rsquo;s starred opposite Lana Turner and Brigitte Bardot, dated Marilyn Monroe, Liz Taylor and a first daughter, made dozens of films (a couple of them good), befriended Imelda Marcos, and now he&rsquo;s taking stock of a remarkable life as a showbiz bon vivant.</p>
<p>George Hamilton doesn&rsquo;t mind if you lead with his tan. As he embarks on his ninth decade — he turns 80 on Aug. 12 — the actor and avatar of ease knows that his hue is what has made him an icon. Also a durable punchline. While he&rsquo;s the first to laugh about it — explaining that his dermatologist long ago &ldquo;just gave up&rdquo; on convincing him to limit his solar exposure, and counting himself lucky not to have been felled by skin cancer — he remains an evangelist for sunbathing, which he started because he didn&rsquo;t like wearing film makeup that melted in the heat.</p>
<p>Hamilton, who once received an honorary degree from the International Smart Tan Network, a trade association for indoor tanning facilities, that he still prominently displays, says vitamin D is &ldquo;a healer for me.&rdquo; These days, though, to maintain his mahogany effect, he relies on a vintage stash of George Hamilton&rsquo;s Constant Color auto-bronzing tinted cream, which he once peddled on QVC.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s uniquely qualified to assess the country&rsquo;s only better-known perma-tanner, Donald Trump. &ldquo;I think he slops bronzer on and hopes it&rsquo;ll last till the evening — easy to put on, probably a spray tan: less fussy and camera-ready,&rdquo; says Hamilton, whom Trump once employed as a host of Miss Universe and later bestowed with a Lifetime Achievement Award for &ldquo;debonair style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For anyone seeking more than skin-deep analysis of the president, Hamilton is not your man. He says he hasn&rsquo;t voted in his life and believes it&rsquo;s irresponsible for actors, who &ldquo;have no qualifications,&rdquo; to express opinions on such matters. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re given an unusual amount of credibility,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;A lot of young actors do it and they shouldn&rsquo;t. The political [people] are happy to use your persona. I think it&rsquo;s unfair to the voter.&rdquo; (Still, this belief didn&rsquo;t stop him from discussing gun rights on a 2016 Fox &amp; Friends appearance to announce his new gig as KFC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Extra Crispy&rdquo; Colonel.)</p>
<p>That said, Hamilton keeps a Make America Great Again cap in the corner of his living room, which Trump, with whom he has mutual Palm Beach pals, gifted him at a campaign rally the actor says he happened into at Trump Tower. The president, he says, &ldquo;was always a performer in his own mind&rdquo; — like Hamilton himself.</p>
<p>Though his more than 60 film roles include Evel Knievel, Hank Williams and the consigliere in The Godfather: Part III (&ldquo;Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t in the better ones&rdquo;), Hamilton&rsquo;s best character has always been George Hamilton. Long before it became axiomatic for actors to leverage their personal brands, Hamilton understood that his persona was matinee idol. (One who did an awful lot of TV.) He&rsquo;s parlayed his shtick into one of Hollywood&rsquo;s remarkably long-lasting careers — including as pitchman and owner of eponymous cigar lounges — outlasting stretches when the acting offers dried up. Now one of the last remaining products of the old studio system still actively working, he offers a singular perspective on a transforming industry.</p>
<p>Hamilton remains vigorous, in all connotations. His trainer has him boxing. His vitamin intake includes 40 pills a day. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s off the rails,&rdquo; he admits. He&rsquo;s developing two films and a TV series as a producer out of a well-staffed office suite in Beverly Glen, where he first invites THR to meet him, taking a seat beneath a large chalk pastel portrait of his more youthful self. His current projects include a sequel to his star turn as Dracula in the hit 1979 romantic comedy Love at First Bite (&ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m alive, I can play that guy; the more befuddled I might become, the better&rdquo;) as well as a drama about the life and 1970 disappearance of his friend Sean Flynn, son of Errol. And while Hamilton, who dated the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Danielle Steel and Britt Ekland, isn&rsquo;t currently romantically attached, he&rsquo;s quick to qualify: &ldquo;I have dates.&rdquo; Indeed, it was on the way to a dinner rendezvous a few months ago at industry hangout Craig&rsquo;s — a regular spot where he can often be found with pals Robert Wagner, Tom Jones, Sugar Ray Leonard and Sylvie Vartan — that he and a companion ended up in a Bentley-on-Bentley wreck. Luckily, they were unscathed.</p>
<p>He replaced his totaled Continental GT with an identical model: &ldquo;That car was elegant in a fistfight, and I liked that.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>On the Texas set of Hamilton&rsquo;s 1960 breakout, Vincente Minnelli&rsquo;s Home From the Hill, a boy asked co-star George Peppard if Peppard was a movie star. The Method-trained thespian replied that, actually, he was an actor. Then the kid turned to Hamilton and wondered if he, too, was an actor. Hamilton responded that, in fact, he was a movie star.</p>
<p>While Hamilton had said it to razz Peppard, he realized he meant it. He was a fervid soldier at MGM&rsquo;s backlot boot camp, where he&rsquo;d honed the all-purpose practical arts: fencing, riding, shooting and whatever else might be needed in everything from comedies to Westerns. (&ldquo;To this day, I can take a bullwhip,&rdquo; he boasts, &ldquo;and cut a cigarette in half.&quot;) More crucially, Hamilton — armed with good looks, easy charm and a given name so WASPy it almost seemed a put-on — couldn&rsquo;t have been more game to participate in what would prove to be the old studio publicity machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just played into it,&rdquo; Hamilton says, grinning. &ldquo;They did all the lying.&rdquo; In conjuring his playboy image, MGM manufactured an old-money background. In reality, he spent his teen years on the edge of real wealth in Palm Beach and attending the tony New York prep school Hackley for a short spell alongside true blue-blooded best buddy Herb Allen, the financier scion now famed for his Sun Valley mogul conference. (&ldquo;He knew he was going to inherit the earth; I only knew I was going to pretend I was going to do it.&quot;)</p>
<p>Friend of six decades Joan Collins doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s all a put-on. Or, at any rate, he became who he was feigning to be. &ldquo;George was urbane and charming by the time I met him when he was 20 years old,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Very elegantly dressed and able to make you laugh: You can&rsquo;t say that of many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton&rsquo;s no crank about the good old days. But he does relish how, once upon a time in Hollywood, contrivance was an inalienable right. He deplores the cult of authenticity that has overtaken the town since his heyday. &ldquo;Everybody has to be &lsquo;real,&rsquo; &quot; he says, spitting the word. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the purpose of being here. It&rsquo;s invention.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Hamilton credits his larger-than-life Southern belle socialite mother, Anne, known as Teeny, and nine-years-older gay half brother Bill as defining influences. They&rsquo;d brought him and younger sibling David from small-town Arkansas to Beverly Hills when George was 7. Teeny was escaping Hamilton&rsquo;s father, a philandering bandleader. Both mother and brother harbored dreams of stardom.</p>
<p>The family settled into a house along the upper residential stretch of Rodeo Drive, where by Hamilton&rsquo;s account they entertained the likes of Clark Gable, whose supposedly false teeth were &ldquo;all I could look at,&rdquo; and Gloria Swanson (&ldquo;Very strong-minded. She&rsquo;d say things like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll poison myself if I wish!&rsquo; &ldquo;). He soaked it up. His takeaway was Teeny&rsquo;s and Bill&rsquo;s devout commitment to glamour as a way of life: &ldquo;It took the mundane out of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother David, whom Hamilton frequently visits in Palm Beach, describes the perspective that Teeny and Bill shared as &ldquo;a philosophy of optimism, a looking for the best out of life, to make it adventurous rather than dull.&rdquo; While never poor, mother and brothers were at times broke — which they saw as temporary, &ldquo;a bad hand in a poker game&rdquo; — as Teeny teetered from one supportive suitor to the next. (Merv Griffin labored for years to turn Hamilton&rsquo;s early life into a film, finally released in 2009 as My One and Only, with Renée Zellweger as Teeny and Logan Lerman playing 15-year-old Hamilton.)</p>
<p>The serene relationship Hamilton possesses with artifice was, however, not passed on to his own children. When shooting a Kardashians-knockoff reality show for E! in 2015 called Stewarts &amp; Hamiltons (it lasted a single season), he found that his grown sons — Ashley, an actor, musician and comedian, and George Jr., a college student — didn&rsquo;t share his equanimity about self-caricature. &ldquo;The joke being on me,&rdquo; says George, smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve long been OK with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton contends it was for Teeny and Bill as much as himself that, at the age of 28, he bought the 36-room Grayhall in Beverly Hills, where Douglas Fairbanks once lived. He purchased the storied mansion with money earned off movies co-starring Olivia de Havilland, Brigitte Bardot and Lana Turner, films that not only were successful but had given Hamilton a real shot at critical approval — one he never appears to have been interested in. (The lauded French director Louis Malle, who cast him for 1965&rsquo;s Viva Maria!, once sighed, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more interested in being in the social columns — I don&rsquo;t understand — when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.&quot;)</p>
<p>Hamilton enjoyed the &ldquo;huge pleasure&rdquo; of lording over his estate, yet in time it became a burden. &ldquo;A property like that brings you friends you don&rsquo;t want and relatives who come to stay and don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You become a custodian, arriving home at night and seeing 15 people for dinner and thinking, &lsquo;What am I doing?&rsquo; &quot; Later, when Hamilton married model-actress Alana Stewart and sold the place, Teeny and Bill sued him for financial support, arguing that his subsidizing of their lifestyle had, in effect, saved his life by precluding him from serving in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Hamilton&rsquo;s draft deferment had in fact been granted on the grounds that he was the sole financial provider for Teeny — which prompted an outcry when the public learned he was dating Lynda Bird Johnson in 1966. He brought the then-22-year-old presidential daughter to the Academy Awards that year. (&ldquo;When I took out Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s daughter, they didn&rsquo;t make such a fuss,&rdquo; presenter Milton Berle joked.)</p>
<p>While the actor insists his relationship with Lyndon Johnson was warm, recalling intimate family gatherings as well as a watch the commander in chief gifted him, behind the scenes there was trouble. The president — apparently skeptical of this movieland slickster — had his longtime fixer turned Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas spearhead an off-the-books FBI probe into Hamilton&rsquo;s personal life. The inquiry, whose machinations became public only five years ago, turned up nothing that could potentially be weaponized except that Bill was gay. Still, in that era, the budding romance was reckoned untenable because of the potential for scandal. &ldquo;It was a bad time,&rdquo; Hamilton says of the saga, his voice soft. He broke up with the first daughter not long afterward. They&rsquo;ve remained friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>On another day, reclining on the cream sofa in the Wilshire Corridor high-rise condo where he&rsquo;s lived since 2008, his untucked dress shirt unbuttoned halfway to his navel, Hamilton is expansive. On how a career in Hollywood is like gambling: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be a little bit foolish about the way you play.&rdquo; On his empathetic nature: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m cerebral about my heart.&rdquo; And on how he&rsquo;s been grateful to be dismissed as a talking mannequin: &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d been overestimated, I may not have made it in the first place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a vivid storehouse of alert detail. Yet when inquiry turns to pricklier matters, memory blurs.</p>
<p>A decade ago, he talked in swashbuckling terms about an affair with his stepmother, June Howard, a onetime singer in his father&rsquo;s big band. She&rsquo;d initiated it when George was living in Manhattan for a stretch as a preteen with his father, by then working as a high-ranking executive at Elizabeth Arden. When they were together, &ldquo;Her pelvis would arrive across the room before the rest of her,&rdquo; Hamilton once volunteered. In his 2008 memoir, Don&rsquo;t Mind If I Do, he called the experience &ldquo;my own sexual bar mitzvah.&rdquo; But now, post-#MeToo reckoning, there&rsquo;s no romance to molestation, and he&rsquo;ll speak of the perpetrator only elliptically, if still sympathetically, as a discontented housewife, &ldquo;slightly off, quite beautiful too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Though Hamilton is all for gender parity in the industry, he doesn&rsquo;t retreat from his past description of himself as &ldquo;an enlightened male chauvinist,&rdquo; the kind who once issued such wisdom in a self-help book as &ldquo;Women are like a fine violin: They just need to be appreciated and bowed properly.&quot;)</p>
<p>Hamilton is hard to pin down on the least-fun scandal of his life, the Justice Department&rsquo;s accusation that he was a front for the 1980s looting of the Philippine treasury at the hands of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator in the case, was granted immunity at the trial. He made headlines testifying that he&rsquo;d received a multimillion-dollar loan from a Marcos associate that he&rsquo;d used for a Beverly Hills mansion (later repossessed by the Manila government) and financed an ill-fated film about Gen. Douglas MacArthur&rsquo;s wartime experiences in the region. When asked about it now, he blinks in apparent bewilderment then goes, &ldquo;Federal case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton, who befriended Imelda when he participated in her country&rsquo;s attempt to create a Southeast Asian answer to Cannes, has remained a fan of the notorious spendthrift. He believes her to be a misunderstood humanitarian — she personally phoned Cedars-Sinai when Hamilton&rsquo;s brother Bill lay dying, startling the nurse on duty, a Filipina, into taking special care — and that the focus on her enormous shoe collection is &ldquo;a big to-do about nothing. They&rsquo;re thought to be an extravagance, but, as my mother said, those are the kind of shoes they make out of a material to match the dress: not the greatest shoes on Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another longtime party pal, arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, was indicted in the same transaction. &ldquo;I just knew him as an amazing character and never did any form of business of any kind with Adnan,&rdquo; explains Hamilton. &ldquo;He was an impish, elfish, humorous person — always very nice. He wanted stars around him. It was his world.&rdquo; (Both Khashoggi and Marcos were later acquitted.) As for why he consorted with the Marcoses in the first place, given that Ferdinand had placed the country under martial law a decade earlier, he claims he was naive at the time of what he chalks up to broadly as &ldquo;unrest in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton&rsquo;s at his most forthright when describing the emotional bond he shares with his loved ones, such as ex-wife Stewart. It was his only marriage; the two separated in 1976 after four years together. Though she would go on to marry and divorce Rod Stewart, she and Hamilton remain close. They had a short-lived mid-&rsquo;90s morning syndicated talk show, George &amp; Alana, which competed with Live With Regis &amp; Kathie Lee. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d always be very warm and outgoing,&rdquo; Stewart remembers, adding: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he understood that it&rsquo;s the guests who were supposed to talk on the talk show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then again, Hamilton does have more stories than most. Like about how he got a look at Elvis Presley in his coffin before his funeral (the rocker&rsquo;s manager, Col. Parker, was a close friend) and saved mourners a lamentable final impression by pointing out the tiny trickle of hair dye running down his forehead. Or watching his then-girlfriend Elizabeth Taylor — aboard Khashoggi&rsquo;s yacht (later sold to Trump) — in a face-to-face showdown with a tabloid photographer brought on board whose roll of negatives of her topless she&rsquo;d gotten ahold of. &ldquo;She looked at it,&rdquo; Hamilton recalls, &ldquo;looked at it sideways, and said, &lsquo;Well, this looks rather good. Let him publish it.&rsquo; And she just handed it to him and everybody went, &lsquo;phew.&rsquo; &quot;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s clearly pleased to have so many tales to tell. But these days, as his life arcs through its final act, and so many of the fellow players who shared in those stories with him are gone, Hamilton acknowledges a certain wistfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not depression,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s melancholy. It&rsquo;s like the feeling of bubbles in champagne.&rdquo;</p>
<hr>
<p>Brand Hamilton</p>
<p>From bronzer to fried chicken, the actors has proved that skin really does sell.</p>
<p>George Hamilton still acts — for the past few seasons as Spencer Blitz on ABC&rsquo;s American Housewife. He&rsquo;s a utility player in the reality sphere, from Dancing With the Stars (eliminated in the sixth week of the second season) and Wife Swap to I&rsquo;m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. He&rsquo;s an active producer. He&rsquo;s an author, every so often, of fizzy ghostwritten books.</p>
<p>And, perennially, Hamilton is a pitchman. Early on, he cashed in on his nickname, The Tanned One, with the George Hamilton Sun Care System during the late 1980s that at one point was sold exclusively at Neiman Marcus. Marketed as a &ldquo;secret formula,&rdquo; it included a self-tanning exfoliating scrub and bronzer. More recently, as a spokesman, he has hawked the vitamin supplement Youth Infusion as well as another anti-aging formula, Renuva.</p>
<p>Yet as a peddler, his most prominent pop culture moment has been his big-budget commercial turns as the KFC Colonel, appearing on a branded yacht cruising through crystal-clear skies, talking up a double-breaded chicken sandwich that&rsquo;s &ldquo;extra-crispy, like me.&rdquo; (Hamilton says he dug deep on the role, recalling meeting Colonel Harland Sanders when the two crossed paths while both were handling respective press duties at an Ohio radio station four decades ago.)</p>

<h3 id="neil-hamilton-disgraced-mp-to-z-list-celebrity-to-political-comeback">&ldquo;Neil Hamilton: disgraced MP to Z-list celebrity to political comeback&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc545ee220a877ad0a4bdc8fb2f43f2e5e9de7d8/0_0_1568_941/1568.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTYucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=3a0c6757d3a075c556b7fc689b32919a" alt="img">
The former Tory is unexpectedly back, leading Ukip in the Welsh assembly. Here’s a summary of his career highs and lows</p>
<p>Younger citizens may not have heard of Neil Hamilton, who has made a triumphant return with Ukip to the Welsh assembly after 20 years in the political wilderness.</p>
<p>Not only has he been elected as one of seven Ukip assembly members via the regional list system, he has been appointed “group leader”, beating the head of the party in Wales, Nathan Gill. Gill remains Welsh leader of Ukip because that role is directly appointed by Nigel Farage, the party’s UK chief. This in no way sounds awkward.</p>
<p>Hamilton told ITV Morning Britain he had strong ties with the country. “Cut me open, I’d be like a stick of Blackpool Rock,” he said, momentarily forgetting that Blackpool is not in Wales.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick reminder of some of Hamilton’s career highlights, in case you were lucky enough to have missed them first time round.</p>
<p>He was a Tory whip in the 1980s</p>
<p>Hamilton became MP for Tatton in 1983, after failing to secure Bradford North in 1979. He served as a government whip under Margaret Thatcher, before becoming corporate affairs minister under John Major. Hamilton’s views and policies – anti-Europe, pro-privatisation, anti-trade unions, and pro-smoking – haven’t changed too much since.</p>
<p>He wanted to shut down the coal mines</p>
<p>Hamilton’s roots may have been in coal mining – both his grandfathers were south Wales miners – but he was part of the Thatcher government that went to war with the industry and its unions. “Britain couldn’t continue being an industrial museum for ever,” he explained more recently.</p>
<p>He opposed the removal of lead from petrol</p>
<p>Hamilton wasn’t too impressed at the medical and environmental evidence on unleaded petrol, telling parliament as recently as 1999 there was “no evidence that lead in petrol poses any health risk”.</p>
<p>A liar and a cheat</p>

<p>Hamilton’s political downfall came in 1996, after the Guardian reported he had taken money in brown envelopes from Mohamed Al Fayed in the “cash-for-questions” scandal. His libel suit against the paper collapsed, leading to this infamous headline and his resignation from government. He went on to lose his Tatton seat to journalist Martin Bell in 1997’s general election.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Tatton’s MP is George Osborne, the chancellor.</p>
<p>He was the subject of a Louis Theroux documentary</p>
<p>In 2001, Hamilton was considered weird enough to justify a Louis Theroux documentary, appearing alongside his wife, Christine. The couple used the programme to relaunch themselves as media stars and it’s still compelling viewing, particularly Christine Hamilton’s flirt scene, and Neil’s House of Cards (original version) quoting response. The Hamiltons’ friends in the Tory press weren’t too impressed, but the couple seemed to know what they were doing. While Neil’s political career was in the wilderness, he had a new plan.</p>
<p>He becomes an all-purpose Z-list celebrity</p>

<p>It’s difficult to imagine now, but the Hamiltons became archtypes for a new kind of celebrity: famous for being famous, the initial context of their fame (public scandal and humiliation) seemed forgotten in an endless round of shameless PR appearances.</p>
<p>He danced for Johnny Vegas’s fish</p>
<p>But suckling from the teat of media fame is a game of ever-descreasing circles, and tends to end one way: in a perspex cage being showered with fish while Johnny Vegas shouts: “You sicken me!”</p>
<p>He joins Ukip</p>
<p>After first appearing on a Ukip stage in 2011, eyebrows were raised when Hamilton was given important roles within the party, rising to the role of campaigns director. He was demoted from the role in 2014.</p>

<p>And then gets voted in as the leader of their Welsh assembly group. Happy now?</p>

<h3 id="americas-first-hush-money-scandal-alexander-hamiltons-torrid-affair-with-maria-reynolds">&ldquo;America’s first ‘hush money’ scandal: Alexander Hamilton’s torrid affair with Maria Reynolds&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/J2ILCR5MHUZZFHQ7H7COMXXQVE.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
AD</p>
<p>The house call was only a sign of respect before exposing Hamilton to the long knives of public scorn.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>As Hamilton would later write, the three politicians “introduced the subject by observing to me that they had discovered a very improper connection between me and a Mr. Reynolds.” The treasury secretary, however, cut them short. They had it wrong, he explained. He was not involved in financial duplicity, but an extramarital affair with Reynolds’s wife, Maria.</p>
<p>The woman’s husband knew of the affair, forcing Hamilton — one of the most powerful figures in the fragile republic — to fork over hush money.</p>
<p>“Another man might have been brief or elliptical,” Ron Chernow wrote in his 2005 classic biography. “Instead, as if in need of some cathartic cleansing, Hamilton briefed them in agonizing detail. . . . It was as if Hamilton were both exonerating and flagellating himself at once.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Realizing they were dealing with an affair of the heart, not the state, Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable pledged to stay mum. The letter to Washington went unsent. But the affair would eventually explode into the public domain, marking the first high-profile sex scandal to rock the new nation’s political scene.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The scandal not only sank Hamilton’s larger political aspirations and inspired a song in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s blockbuster musical, but the payoffs also prefigure the current headlines.</p>
<p>On Sunday, porn star Stormy Daniels will sit down with Anderson Cooper on “60 Minutes.” She is expected to detail not only her alleged affair with President Trump but also efforts on the part of the real estate developer’s team to buy her silence with a $130,000 payment in conjunction with a “nondisclosure agreement.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Hamilton’s “Reynolds Affair,” as it’s known, began in the summer of 1791 when the 23-year-old blond woman, Maria Reynolds, knocked on his door in Philadelphia in desperate need. As Reynolds explained, her husband had abandoned her and she was in need of financial help getting back to New York City. Hamilton, then 36 and by all accounts dashing, offered to bring money to Maria’s home. When he arrived, he was shown into the bedroom.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Some conversation ensued from which it was quickly apparent that other than pecuniary consolation would be acceptable,” Hamilton later wrote.</p>
<p>Maria and Hamilton continued to meet, including at Hamilton’s own house when his wife, Eliza, and their children were visiting family in Albany. “It is baffling that Hamilton, having worked to achieve a spotless reputation as treasury secretary, did not see that he was now courting danger and would be susceptible to blackmail,” Chernow says in his book.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>James Reynolds eventually reappeared on the scene, confronting Hamilton about his relationship with his wife. Initially appearing outraged, the husband then encouraged Hamilton to continue the affair. As Hamilton wrote, he “invites me to renew my visits to his wife.”</p>
<p>“Its true its in your power to do a great deal for me, but its out of your power to do any thing that will Restore to me my Happiness again for if you should give me all you possess would not do it,” Reynolds said in a note to Hamilton. “I have this preposial to make to you. give me the Sum Of thousand dollars and I will leve the town.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>That sum, $1,000 in hush money, is the equivalent of about $25,000 today.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Hamilton paid and continued to make amorous calls on Maria. Her husband continued to hit up the powerful government official for money after the encounters, $30 or $40 sums Reynolds cast as loans. He even gave Hamilton receipts. According to Chernow, both Maria and her husband were probably working together on the extortion plot.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1792, Hamilton cut off the affair. But that November, Reynolds found himself in a Philadelphia jail cell. Along with a partner, Jacob Clingman, he was charged with defrauding the U.S. government. The two men were accused of posing as the executors of a Revolutionary War veteran to claim $400 in back pay due to him.</p>
<p>While free on bail, Clingman tried to secure the help of his former employer, Muhlenberg. The accused scammer sparked the politician’s curiosity.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Muhlenberg wrote later: “Clingman, unasked, frequently dropped hints to me that Reynolds had it in his power, very materially, to injure the secretary of the treasury and that Reynolds knew several very improper transactions of his.”</p>
<p>Muhlenberg brought this information to Monroe and Venable. The trio interviewed both Maria and her husband about the connection with Hamilton. The couple declined to give specifics on their relationship with the treasury secretary, but Maria provided the politicians with letters between her husband and Hamilton. She claimed she had burned many others.</p>
<p>The three men were convinced Reynolds was involved in some official misconduct with Hamilton. Free on bail, Reynolds fled — further confirming their suspicions. On Dec. 15, they decided to confront the Cabinet official.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Hamilton instead shocked Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable with his story about the affair. He showed — and allowed them to copy — letters from both Maria and James Reynolds as evidence.</p>
<p>“The small delegation seemed satisfied with Hamilton’s chronicle, if not a little flustered by the awkward situation,” Chernow wrote. “They apologized for having invaded his privacy.”</p>
<p>They also pledged to keep the matter private. Maria Reynolds eventually sued her husband for a divorce. The attorney she hired to represent her was Aaron Burr.</p>
<p>The affair eventually went public in 1797 as part of a complex political chess match between Hamilton and his enemies in Thomas Jefferson’s Republican Party.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>That year, a pro-Jefferson writer named James Callender published a series of pamphlets, “The History of the United States for 1796.” The text revived accusations that Hamilton, now out of the Cabinet, had engaged in official misconduct with Reynolds and Clingman.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>As proof, Callender published the same letters Hamilton had shown Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable in 1792. The pamphlet suggested the romance between Maria and Hamilton was a cover story for shady financial dealings.</p>
<p>Hamilton was in a tight spot. Five years earlier, cornered with the allegations by Monroe and the others, he had opted for disarming honesty. Now, with the Reynolds affair again circulating, he did the same on the public stage with a preemptive strike that would allow him, as the phrase now goes, to put his own spin on everything.</p>
<p>Hamilton published a 95-page pamphlet. For 37 pages, he confessed and outlined the affair and extortion; the remaining 58 pages were supplemental letters and affidavits proving his case.</p>
<p>The song, “The Reynolds Pamphlet” in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical opens with Jefferson, Madison and Angelica Schuyler (Hamilton’s sister-in-law) exclaiming “Have you read this?”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Aaron Burr, Jefferson and Madison then describe the horror revealed: “Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair. And he wrote it down right there.”</p>
<p>The pamphlet’s actual words are something less than “torrid”-sounding to modern eyes.</p>
<p>“The charge against me is a connection with one James Reynolds for purposes of improper pecuniary speculation,” Hamilton wrote. “My real crime is an amorous connection with his wife, for a considerable time with his privity and connivance, if not originally brought on by a combination between the husband and wife with the design to extort money from me.”</p>
<p>The confession may have cleared Hamilton of official misconduct, but it also smeared his name and embarrassed his family. Both Hamilton and his wife, Eliza, believed that James Monroe — a close friend of Hamilton’s archrival Thomas Jefferson — had provided the letters to Callender.</p>
<p>Hamilton eventually confronted Monroe at his home in New York.</p>
<p>“I will meet you like a gentleman,” Hamilton said, using the language of a duel.</p>
<p>“I am ready, get your pistols,” Monroe shot back.
