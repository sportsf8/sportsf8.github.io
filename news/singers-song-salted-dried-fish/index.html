<p>The title couldn’t have been better. The concert was titled ‘Nenje Ezhu’, originally a song written for Tamil film Maryan, but could have well been reflective of the times Chennai underwent during the recent floods.</p>
<p>Music composer A.R.Rahman, who by his own admission has not performed much in his hometown, seemed to reserve all his energies for such rare occasions and got Chennaiites on their feet with his pulsating numbers at YMCA, Nandanam, on Saturday evening. It was a concert for a cause alright – the composer made it clear that it was like a slogan to cheer people and given them hope – but that wasn’t stopping him, or thousands of his fans, from having their share of fun, dancing and swaying to some foot-tapping numbers.</p>
<p>It was a musical treat to all those fans that had waited for the big day with bated breath, participated in contests, stood in long queues and arriving at the venue post much anxiety. But once in, all that was forgotten; all that they cared for was that one man on stage with microphone in hand.</p>
<p>Rahman might have gotten older – he turned 49 just a couple of weeks ago – but his songs from the 90s are an integral part of many Chennaiites’ childhood memories. Take ‘Mustafa Mustafa’, billed the ‘friendship anthem’, for instance. The popular ‘Oh Oh…’ catchphrase had the crowd swaying to it, their cellphone lights up in the air. Or the classical-based ‘Nila Kagirathu’ from Indira that had melody lovers go ‘ooh aah’ at every variation, every improvisation.</p>
<p>‘Nenje Ezhu’ was a musical mix of the composer’s works not just over the years but also across genres. Perhaps to do justice to them, singers from different backgrounds and experiences were roped in; if you had an accomplished Hariharan getting his fair share of attention with songs like ‘Kurukku Chiruthavale’ and ‘Vennilavae’, there was also youngsters like Haricharan and Sid Sriram getting the crowd on their feet, delivering ‘Uppu Karuvadu’ and ‘Yennodu Nee Irunthaal’ with panache.</p>
<p>Youngsters who tuned in to the composer’s tunes in recent years weren’t disappointed either; there was the fast-paced ‘Mersalayitten’, the sultry ‘Maiya Maiyaa’ and the melodic ‘Aye Sinamika’. Singer Sid Sriram (remember ‘Adiye’ from Kadal?) sprung a surprise on the unsuspecting audience by unleashing into ‘Thalli Pogathey’, his brand new song in the much-awaited Gautham Menon-Rahman offering Accham Enbathu Madamayada.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a pure Tamil concert, but Rahman made an exception by delivering an experimental version of ‘Dil Se’. Accompanied by a posse of talented musicians on stage, the song struck an instant chord with the audience.</p>
<p>The classical-inclined weren’t ignored either; there was the raga-based ‘Sowkiyamma’ on offer. The spirited, full-of-feel rendition of ‘Innum Konjam’ by Vijay Prakash and Shweta Mohan had their ears perked up as well. Folk lovers got more than what they would’ve expected, sampling songs like ‘Usilampatti’ and ‘Uppu Karuvaadu’.</p>
<p>‘Nenje Ezhu’ will also be presented in Coimbatore on January 23. The Hindu is the associate sponsor for the event. Part of the funds from the concert will go towards post-flood rehabilitation.</p>
<p>‘Let’s talk about love’</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the evening was the informal, fun setting of four accomplished singers – Srinivas, Karthik, Vijay Prakash and Haricharan – interacting with the Mozart of Madras, albeit musically. The song they chose was one forgotten melody Rahman fans dote on; ‘Pennalla Pennala’ from Uzhavan. The renditions were magical and a true throwback to his melodic magic in the 90s.</p>
<p>Making up for SPB</p>
<p>What can one do when a legendary singer like S.P.Balasubrahmanyam isn’t able to perform for a concert as scheduled? You get three young singers, and hope the audience will like the rendition for its fresh treatment.</p>
<p>SPB’s presence was missed at the ‘Nenje Ezhu’ evening, but the now-popular stars of film music made up by joining hands (or voices, should we say) for the superhit numbers. Those used to SPB’s energetic voice in numbers like ‘Oruvan Oruvan’ and ‘Ballelaka’ were in for a pleasant surprise as they saw Karthik, Benny Dayal and Haricharan dishing out special performance.

Filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon has put his singing ability to good use by crooning a number in filmmaker Radha Mohan’s upcoming Tamil comedy “Uppu Karuvadu”.</p>
<p>Filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon has put his singing ability to good use by crooning a number in filmmaker Radha Mohan’s upcoming Tamil comedy “Uppu Karuvadu”.</p>
<p>“The music director of my film is a good friend of Gautham. He suggested that we use Gautham’s voice for the song as it would be apt,” Radha Mohan told IANS.</p>
<p>“When we had approached Gautham, although he was interested, he couldn’t take out time to record as he was busy with the release of his film ‘Yennai Arindhaal’.</p>
<p>“Since Gautham was busy, my music composer Steve sang the song for the shoot. Later, Gautham called and asked if he could still sing, provided I want to record his voice. I instantly agreed and we record the song in his voice,” he added.</p>
<p>The song has lyrics by Madhan Karky.</p>
<p>“Uppu Karuvadu” features Nandita, Karunakaran and Satish in important roles.</p>

<h3 id="picture-the-song-we-say-yes-yes-yes-to-yenna-solla-pogirai-from-kandukondain-kandukondain">&ldquo;Picture the song: We say yes, yes, yes, to ‘Yenna Solla Pogirai’ from ‘Kandukondain Kandukondain’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s01.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/facebook/870214-83184-rvrbiistii-1519740535.jpg" alt="img">
Shankar Mahadevan’s voice has a distinctive quality to it – it tends to fill the ears and embody a kind of surround sound quality.</p>
<p>Among the first times Mahadevan’s voice boomed through the screen was when hairstylist Deva (Prabhudeva) cries his heart out in the song Vennilave Vennilave in Rajiv Menon’s 1997 romantic drama Minsaara Kanavu. (The happier version was sung by Hariharan). Music composer AR Rahman knew that Mahadevan’s resonant and full-throttle singing would work perfectly for a moment of heartbreak. Mahadevan’s ability to hold higher and lower notes with equal strength and depth was remarkable.</p>
<p>Rahman has given Mahadevan some of the most memorable tracks of his multi-faceted career – Varaha Nadhikkarai Oram from Sangamam (1999), Uppu Karuvadu from Mudhalvan (1999), September Maadham from Alaipayuthey (2000), Thaniye from Rhythm (2000), the title track of Thenali (2000). These tracks highlight the classically-trained yet playback-ready voice of Mahadevan, who had by then established himself as a acclaimed composer along with Ehsan Noorani and Loy Mendosa and a versatile, multi-lingual singer.</p>
<p>The song that brought out the best of both Mahadevan as well as Rahman is from 2000, and is again from a Rajiv Menon film. Rahman composed Yenna Solla Pogirai from Kandukondain Kandukondain in Misra Kirvani raga and set it to a haunting rhythm with fascinating instrumental interludes. Menon visualised the song against the pyramids of Giza, which allows Mahadevan’s voice to echo and reverberate among the ancient monuments. Ajith and Tabu, dressed in Rajasthani outfits, convincingly play passionate lovers yearning to be together.</p>
<p>Yenna Solla Pogirai is the theme song of Manohar (Ajith) and Soumya (Tabu) in Kandukondain Kandukondain. Snatches of the song appear right from the moment when Manohar sets his eyes on Soumya. She mistakes him to be her prospective groom and agrees to the alliance. Manohar, an aspiring filmmaker, has come to ask if Soumya’s house can be rented out for a film shoot, and he feels sorry when Soumya realises the embarrassing truth. But it is love at first sight for both: he realises it, she is reluctant to admit it.</p>
<p>After they run into each other a couple of times, a determined Manohar confronts Soumya and asks her if she feels the same way as he does. Soumya mumbles a no, at which point Manohar breaks into Yenna Solla Pogirai.</p>
<p>The song begins with Mahadevan’s two-line solo before the instruments kick in. His voice matches Ajith’s searching and intense eyes as he asks Soumya what her final answer is going to be. In true filmmaker style, Manohar slips into a dream sequence in which they are star-crossed lovers in a desert. By the end, Soumya does give her consent to Manohar. Who would possibly turn down such a passionately sung proposal?</p>
<p>Mahadevan won a National Film Award for the track.

<h3 id="singer-and-dubbing-artist-m-m-manasi-talks-about-her-work">&ldquo;Singer and dubbing artist M M Manasi talks about her work&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema-news-16/images/singer-and-dubbing-artist-m-m-manasi-talks-about-her-work-photos-pictures-stills.jpg" alt="img">
In the recently released film Devi, one aspect that stood out among many other things was Tamannaah’s voice and her impeccable dialogue delivery. The young girl who is responsible for this is singer and voice over artist M M Manasi. We catch up with the talented young lady.</p>
<p>How did it all begin?</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Mumbai. I am basically a trained Hindustani music vocalist. I came to Chennai along with my parents to pursue music and dubbing was never in the plan.</p>
<p>While singing for a film called Nirnayam, director S S Saravanan liked my voice and wondered if I could dub for the heroine Regina Cassandra. I readily agreed as I like experimenting with my voice. I dubbed for her, but eventually the film that got released first with my voice was Idharkuthaanae Aasaipattai Balakumara where I spoke for Swathi Reddy.</p>
<p>Movies/artists dubbed</p>
<p>I have dubbed for Swathi Reddy in Vadacurry. My first big movie was Anjaan for Samantha. Post this, I dubbed for Hansika in Meaghaman and then for Nikki Galrani in Darling and Velainnu Vandhutta Vellakaaran. I have spoken for Nazriya in Thirumanam Ennum Nikkah, for Bindu Madhavi in Savalae Samali, Jackson Durai and Thamizhukku Enn Ondrai Azhuthavum, for Lakshmi Menon in Mirudhan, for Kajal Agarwal in Maari, for Regina Cassandra in Maanagaram, for Nanditha Swetha in Nenjam Marappathillai and for Kamalini Mukherjee in Iraivi. I have lent my voice for Amy Jackson in Thanga Magan- Telugu, for Nayanthara in Telugu Iru Mugan.</p>
<p>Tamannaah and the big break</p>
<p>My biggest milestone as regards dubbing is easily Baahubali where I dubbed for Tamannaah and then followed it up with Thozha, Dharmadurai and Devi.</p>
<p>Tamannaah in her recent interaction about her roles in various films had mentioned about me which is actually a nice gesture on her part. She even mentioned that I am a singer. She has been telling her directors to use my voice. It’s kind of attaching to a brand and I am very grateful to her for this. At the end of the day, when artists themselves recognize our work, there is nothing like it.</p>
<p>Voice variations</p>
<p>Thanks to Tamannaah and her roles, I have been really able to do a lot in terms of bringing in variations and experimenting. For Baahubali, I had to throw in on a baritone because Tamannaah’s character Avantika was a warrior woman. For Thozha, I had to maintain a tone of a sophisticated corporate woman. In Dharmadurai, my voice had to be that of a gentle village woman turning out as an independent professional. In Devi, I play two characters, so voice had to be different.</p>
<p>Trisha</p>
<p>I dubbed for Trisha in Kodi which is a Diwali release. She had apparently tweeted about my voice.</p>
<p>Challenges in dubbing</p>
<p>Baahubali was one film where my voice was way out my character. I am generally known for having a basal voice. I had to go three or more times the voice I usually use. The exact opposite was Radha Mohan sir’s Uppu Karuvadu where I spoke for Nanditha Swetha. She played two characters, an insane and a sane one, the insane being the actual character of the lady. She had to be screechy, that was way out of my character. People still don’t know I dubbed for this role.</p>
<p>Songs</p>
<p>I have sung almost 75 songs till date in Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil and Hindi. My hits have been Stylish Thamizhachi from Ajith’s Arrambam, Kattikida from Anirudh’s Kaaki Sattai, Aattakkaari Maaman Ponnu from Raja sir’s 1000th film Tharai Thappattai.</p>
<p>I also debuted in Bollywood with Daddy Mummy number in Bhaag Johnny under DSP music. The song is a huge hit and is being played in many radio stations.</p>
<p>Singing or dubbing?</p>
<p>Singing is my primary career, but dubbing is really catching up now for me. I want to balance both dubbing and singing.</p>
<p>We are sure you are going to balance both Manasi!</p>
<p>Wish you the best!</p>

Four years after it became a viral sensation, Why This Kolaveri Di has become the highest viewed Indian video on YouTube. The song, composed by Anirudh and sung by Dhanush for Aishwaryaa Dhanush���s Tamil film 3, is all set to hit 100 million views in the coming days. Sridhar Subramaniam, the president of the music label that released the song, informs that the views for the user generated content for the song (by way of cover versions, flash mobs, parodies, etc) is around 500 million. ���This was the first song that truly showed the power of online media to Indians. And it launched the career of Anirudh and made Dhanush a nationwide sensation,��� he says.Talking about the song���s journey from being a single to a pop cultural phenomenon, he says, ���Once we realized that the song was getting huge attraction from Tamil movie fans, we shared it with social media influencers in Mumbai and also made sure that it was picked by traditional media like radio and TV as well. In the first three days, it hit 10 million views and after that the song took a life of its own as it and was embraced nationally and internationally.��� He adds that the song still pulls in around one lakh views a day.He says that the label deliberately adopted a non-restrictive copyright policy ���to harness the power of the crowd���. ���After seeing that it had captured people���s imagination, we chose not to pull down content based on the song citing copyright infringement. It had become a song of the people,��� he explains.While he admits that online video sharing platforms have become great promo vehicles, he reveals that the monetary benefits are minuscule compared to what one generates through traditional media.

<h3 id="baahubali-music-director-all-praises-rahman-for-this-unique-trait">&ldquo;&lsquo;Baahubali&rsquo; music director all praises Rahman for this unique trait&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://1847884116.rsc.cdn77.org/tamil/news/keeravani080517_1t.jpg" alt="img">
Senior music director Keeravani known as Maragadamani in Kollywood is getting enormous acclaim for his phenomenal work with the songs and background score for the film &lsquo;Baahubali 2:The Conclusion&rsquo; which has become the first Indian film to gross Rs.1000 crores.</p>
<p>In a recent interaction with fans in his social media page, one person asked what made him to not use any top or well known singers to render his songs in &lsquo;Baahubali&rsquo; and its sequel which were made on a huge budget of Rs.450 crores.</p>
<p>To this veteran gave a surprising reply crediting Isaipuyal A.R.Rahman for this remarkable selection. &ldquo;ARR shattered the difference between chorus singers and solo singers, He is a pioneer actually.&rdquo; was Keeravani&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>ARR right from his initial days in the industry has introduced so many new talents to the film industry as singers and many of them are currently top singers in entire Indian film industry. Rahman continues to give opportunity for new or less known singers in his films even at a time when world renowned singers are yearning to work with him.</p>
<p>It is amazing to see Keeravani, who is much elder to Rahman in terms of age and experience giving due credits to Rahman for this unique trait of the Oscar winning composer. It shows the modesty of the former and the greatness of the latter.

<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-53209966,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-134414/53209966.jpg" alt="img">
Singer MM Manasi , who made the girls groove with Stylish Thamizhachi from Arrambam, is happy to have recorded a song for Ilaiyaraaja. While the singer has recorded a couple of songs for the Maestro before, this is the first time she���s singing a duet with him. ���My first song for Raaja sir was in Kannada. He was there throughout the recording, which left me both excited and nervous! I again got the opportunity to sing for his 1000th film, Tharai Thappattai. Recently, I recorded a duet for Kattam Potta Sattai. It is always a pleasure to work with a legend like him,��� says an excited Manasi. And she says that her classical music training is what helped her achieve so much in her career. ���I have been trained in Hindustani classical for the last 15 years and been training under Sriram Parasuram for the past five years. Being a classical musician helps you adapt to any musical form very easily,��� says Manasi.While she is busy recording songs for both Tamil and Telugu films, the singer also works as a dubbing artiste in Kollywood. She has dubbed for several actresses, including Tamannaah, Samantha and Hansika. ���You need to understand that no two films or two characters are the same. You need to dub how the director wants you to sound. For instance, I dubbed for Nandita for Uppu Karuvadu, where she was playing a dual role. And I dubbed for both those characters. It is for the same film, but two strikingly different roles. Even for Tamannaah in Baahubali, she comes from a different era. I cannot speak normal Tamil. The language that you speak should sound different. So, there are a lot of nuances that one must keep in mind when you dub. And of course, being a singer has made me so versatile,��� she says.
