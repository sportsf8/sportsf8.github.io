<p>CLEVELAND, Ohio &ndash; As the saying goes, a spectacular voice can move mountains. And amazing singing has been in popular culture since before the days of rock and roll. Think Billie Holliday, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald or Dean Martin.</p>
<p>Genres change. New instruments are created. Sounds can be produced electronically. But if you can sing&hellip;you have the chance to write your own ticket to stardom. That’s as true today as it was nearly a century ago.</p>
<p>Our recap of the best singers doesn’t go back that far. We kept things rather modern, looking back at the world’s greatest singer (and a runner-up) ever year since 1980.</p>
<p>Several of the names won’t surprise. But don’t expect us to end any major debates. When you’re talking about the best singers, you’re often splitting hairs. Mariah or Whitney? Michael or Prince? Beyonce or Adele?</p>
<p>They are the questions we asked ourselves time and time again making this list. We took into account ability, power, range, control, cultural impact and body of work during that particular year. We also limited it to popular music. So, you won’t find any opera singers on the list.</p>
<p>There is no perfect science. But we put together a list of some men and women we hope really hits the high notes.</p>
<p>1980: George Jones</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” “If Drinkin’ Don’t Kill Me (Her Memory Will),” “I’m Not Ready Yet”</p>
<p>You might be surprised to see this list begin with a country singer. But not every country singer is George Jones, a man who was labeled the greatest living country vocalist over the course of multiple decades. Jones was a once-in-a-generation talent. His career is so spread out, there is no one album that sums up his greatness. But there is one song. And that’s “He Stopped Loving Her Today,” one of the greatest country tunes of all time, released in 1980.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Diana Ross</p>
<p>Diana Ross’ 1980 album, “Diana,” was a solo comeback of sorts that showed she was still one of the world’s greatest pop stars, even if the album’s sound was heavy on dance production from Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards.</p>
<p>1981: Steve Perry</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Open Arms,” “Who’s Crying Now,” “Don’t Stop Believin&rsquo;”</p>
<p>In 1981, Journey released its blockbuster album, “Escape,” and a stadium-rock icon was born. Steve Perry’s voice on songs like “Open Arms&rdquo; and “Don’t Stop Believin&rsquo;” ruled the pop and rock charts. These days, it’s easy to forget that the man dubbed “The Voice” wasn’t even Journey’s first lead singer. He was actually the band’s third frontman, hired in 1978 to replace Robert Fleischman, who had replaced Gregg Rolie. Remember them? Didn’t think so. But it’s impossible not to immediately picture Perry when thinking of Journey.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Luther Vandross</p>
<p>Luther Vandross’ debut album, “Never Too Much,” and its title-track were a revelation that established him as one of the premier voices in soul music. The album’s closer, a cover of Dionne Warwick’s “A House Is Not a Home,” is astonishing. From a singing standpoint, Vandross was the clear rookie of the year.</p>
<p>1982: Michael Jackson</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Beat It,” “Human Nature,” “Billie Jean&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where else were we going to go with this one? It was the year of “Thriller.” But with all the glitz and glamour of the album’s sound, it’s easy to forget how much vocal range Michael Jackson had throughout the 1970s and early 1980s (He would be our greatest singer of 1979 had we went back a year earlier to start this list). Consider on “Thriller,” the biggest album of all time, Jackson sings a delicate song like “Human Nature” and then goes into full rock mode with “Beat It.” Even the way he shouts “Thriller!” on the title track’s chorus gives you more chills than the zombies in the iconic music video.</p>
<p>Other contenders: Bruce Dickinson</p>
<p>Bruce Dickinson became a metal titan on Iron Maiden’s “The Number of the Beast.&rdquo; Not only does it stand as one of the greatest metal albums of all time. But it also showcases Dickinson the greatest metal singer of all time not named Rob Halford.</p>
<p>1983: Chaka Khan</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Ain’t Nobody,” “Got to Be There&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you look back at Chaka Khan’s influence on the modern pop diva, it really begins with her 1983 self-titled album. Sure, she released “I’m Every Woman” in 1978. But this was Khan putting together a vocal display over the course of an entire album. And if you want the icing on the cake, she also stole the show on Rufus’ 1983 monster single “Ain’t Nobody.” Her voice was a force of nature.</p>
<p>Other contenders: Cyndi Lauper</p>
<p>Cyndi Lauper had a unique sound. Haters might call it annoying. But that’s too dismissive of one of the best hitmakers of the 1980s. Lauper’s debut album, “She’s So Unusual,” was a smash that features one of the greatest ballads of all time in “Time After Time.” Also consider her cover of Prince’s “When You Were Mine.” If you can hold your own on a Prince song, you’re good to go.</p>
<p>1984: Prince</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “When Doves Cry,” “The Beautiful Ones,&rdquo; “Let’s Go Crazy,&rdquo; “Erotic City”</p>
<p>Prince was one of the greatest vocal chameleon’s in music history. His ability to morph into different characters vocally was second to none. Just look at what he did on the “Purple Rain&rdquo; soundtrack. He’s an energetic rock star on “Let’s Go Crazy,” oozes sex appeal on “When Doves Cry&rdquo; and then delivers, arguably, the best all-round vocal of his career on “The Beautiful Ones.” There’s also the climactic ending to the album’s title track. If that doesn’t give you goosebumps, you’re not human.</p>
<p>Other contenders: Sade</p>
<p>1984 was a great year for vocalists. We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention Tina Turner’s comeback, of course. But the runner-up choice for 1984 has to be Sade. She released “Diamond Life” and became the benchmark for smooth soul-singing moving forward. One listen to “Smooth Operator” will melt your soul.</p>
<p>1985: Whitney Houston</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Greatest Love of All,” “Saving All My Love For You,” “How Will I Know”</p>
<p>Whitney Houston dropped her debut album in 1985, beginning, perhaps, the greatest run by any vocalist in music history. Had she unleashed just one song from her self-titled album that year, she probably would have earned this spot on our list. Even 35 years later, songs like “Greatest Love of All” and “Saving All My Love For You” are vocally breathtaking.</p>
<p>Other contenders: Freddie Mercury</p>
<p>In 1985, Freddie Mercury and Queen made their comeback with the greatest live performance ever at Live Aid. Any other year, that would put Mercury back on top of the singing mountain. Same goes for George Michael hitting No. 1 with “Careless Whisper&rdquo; or Chaka Khan getting massive airplay with “I Feel For You.” But they had to go up against Whitney Houston.</p>
<p>1986: Anita Baker</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Sweet Love,” “Caught Up in the Rapture,” “No One in the World”</p>
<p>With one album, “Rapture,” Anita Baker defined the quiet-storm genre, a sultry form of easy listening that merged soft-rock and soul while still being quite powerful. Baker would prove a precursor to the likes of Toni Braxton, Mariah Carey and Vanessa Williams.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Jon Bon Jovi</p>
<p>Bon Jovi’s “Slippery When Wet” established Jon Bon Jovi as the premier voice in stadium rock and hair metal. On songs like “Livin’ on a Prayer” and “Wanted Dead or Alive,&rdquo; he delivers vocal performances that mainstream rock singers use studio tricks to pull off these days.</p>
<p>1987: George Michael</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Father Figure,” “One More Try,&rdquo; “Kissing a Fool”</p>
<p>People knew George Michael could sing from his days with Wham! But it wasn’t until he released his solo debut, “Faith,” that music fans took note of how truly great his voice was. Forget the title track, which is fantastic. The album is full of astonishing vocal performances, from the old-school vibes of “Kissing a Fool” to the gut-wrenching “One More Try” to the soaring global smash, “Father Figure.”</p>
<p>Runner-up: Bono</p>
<p>U2 frontman Bono’s singing really came into its own on 1984′s “The Unforgettable Fire.” It got even better on 1987′s “The Joshua Tree.&rdquo; The Edge’s guitar was the standout on U2′s early albums. But Bono’s voice drives the biggest hits from U2′s most iconic recording.</p>
<p>1988: Axl Rose</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Sweet Child o’ Mine,” “Paradise City,” “Patience”</p>
<p>Guns N’ Roses spent 1988 as the biggest rock band in the world. Hands down. You could make a case for Axl Rose as the best rock singer of 1987, when “Appetite for Destruction” was released. But the fact that GN’R sustained its dominance all the way through the end of 1988 and the release of “G N’ R Lies” was pretty amazing. Rose has one greatest vocal ranges in rock music history. But if you need proof that he didn’t need to shout to win you over, give another listen to Guns N’ Roses’ acoustic hit “Patience.”</p>
<p>Runner-up: Steven Tyler</p>
<p>Two amazing lead singers doing their thing in the late 1980s. What a time for rock and roll. After “Walk This Way” took off again with Run-DMC, Aerosmith was back on top and the band delivered some of its biggest songs from 1986 to 1989, including “What It Takes,” “Love in an Elevator,” “Angel” and Janie’s Got a Gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1989: Luther Vandross</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Here and Now,” “Treat You Right”</p>
<p>You could argue that Luther Vandross was the greatest male singer of the 1980s (and maybe even the 1990s). His “The Best of Luther Vandross&hellip; The Best of Love” compilation put a stamp on that. It helped that the release came with a new song, “Here and Now,” which proved to be his first top-10 song on the pop charts and one of his greatest vocal performances.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Babyface</p>
<p>Right behind Vandross was Kenneth “Babyface” Edmunds. The songwriter/producer’s sophomore album as a solo artist was full of new jack swing beats. But they weren’t enough to overshadow Babyface’s beautiful voice on tracks like the baby-making anthem “Whip Appeal.”</p>
<p>1990: Mariah Carey</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Vision of Love,&rdquo; “Love Takes Time,” “Someday,&rdquo; “I Don’t Wanna Cry”</p>
<p>Right from the release of Mariah Carey’s debut album and its lead single, “Vision of Love,” you could choose Carey as the year’s best singer for about an eight-year period and not be wrong. Her five-octave vocal range took hold of pop music for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Sinead O’Connor</p>
<p>It wasn’t just her cover of Prince’s “Nothing Compares 2 U.&rdquo; But that was certainly a huge part of it. Sinead O’Connor’s album, “I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got,” is a stellar showcase for her unique, yet powerful vocal ability.</p>
<p>1991: Chris Cornell</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Jesus Christ Pose,” “Say Hello 2 Heaven,” &ldquo;Slaves &amp; Bulldozers</p>
<p>Chris Cornell delivered a one-two punch in 1991. First was Temple of the Dog’s album with the members of Pearl Jam. Then came Soundgarden’s “Badmotorfinger,&rdquo; which features “Jesus Christ Pose&rdquo; &ndash; the greatest vocal performance of the grunge era or, perhaps, all of 1990s rock and roll.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Eddie Vedder</p>
<p>Eddie Vedder was the second singer on that Temple of the Dog album and held his own with Cornell. Oh, and Pearl Jam released “Ten,” which made Vedder the archetype of the grunge vocal.</p>
<p>1992: K.D. Lang</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Save Me,” “Constant Craving,&rdquo; “Miss Chatelaine”</p>
<p>Not the biggest name on this list, but from a technical standpoint, few were better. K.D. Lang spent the early part of her career with a twangy country vibe. But on 1992′s “Ingenue” she switches to a pop/cabaret style that really shows of her vocal beauty. Rarely has anyone ever stretched notes in such a beautiful way. It’s a performance for the ages.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Layne Staley</p>
<p>Layne Staley’s tenor voice went beyond grunge music, making Alice In Chains one of the most formidable bands in hard rock. Staley’s vocals, along with Jerry Cantrell’s dual harmonies, turned the band’s album “Dirt” into a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>1993: Whitney Houston</p>
<p>Songs that proved it: “I Will Always Love You,” “I’m Every Woman,” “I Have Nothing,” “I Run to You”</p>
<p>Everyone else who made music in 1992/1993, clear the way. Whitney Houston’s “The Bodyguard,” both the film and its blockbuster soundtrack, arrived in late 1992 and remained pop music’s unstoppable force for the next year. It spent 20 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1. Houston’s cover of “I Will Always Love You,&rdquo; of course, became one of the biggest singles of all time. But you could make the case it wasn’t even the album’s biggest showstopper (“I Have Nothing” is something to behold). At this point, Houston wasn’t just the best singer of the early 1990s. An argument could be made she was the best of all time.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Mariah Carey</p>
<p>Even Mariah Carey couldn’t top Whitney Houston in 1993, despite releasing “Music Box,” an album that’s sold more 28 million copies worldwide and featured two No. 1 singles.</p>
<p>1994: Jeff Buckley</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Grace,” “Hallelujah,&rdquo; “Last Goodbye”</p>
<p>Jeff Buckley’s landmark album, “Grace,” wasn’t a smash hit when it was released in 1994. But those in the know were aware of his greatness. The album would gain a reputation over time, especially after Buckley’s death in 1997. Buckley is now regarded as one of the great singers of the 1990s with “Grace” as one of the best vocal performance albums in rock history.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Mary J. Blige</p>
<p>The queen of hip-hop soul built on the success of her first album with “My Life,” a more personal effort that showed off Mary J. Blige’s voice in spectacular fashion. “I’m Goin’ Down” remains one of her best live songs to this day.</p>
<p>1995: Selena</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “I Could Fall In Love,” “Dreaming of You,” “Tu Solo Tu”</p>
<p>Already a massive star in Mexico and with Latin-music audiences in the United States, Selena was on the verge of global superstardom when she readied the release of 1995′s “Dreaming of You.” She would die before witnessing its release. In 1997, the biopic starring Jennifer Lopez would bring Selena the fame she deserved. Had she lived, who knows how big Selena would have become.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Bjork</p>
<p>Looking for something different, yet all the way inspiring? Here’s Bjork. Later in her career Bjork would construct “Medulla,” and album almost entirely comprised of sounds made by human voices. But when she released “Post” in 1995, she was making stunning electronica music with her voice serving as an uncompromising art-pop instrument.</p>
<p>1996: Toni Braxton</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Un-Break My Heart,” “You’re Makin’ Me High,” “How Could an Angel Break My Heart”</p>
<p>Toni Braxton arrived on the scene in 1993 like a cooler version of Anita Baker. By 1996, she had exploded into a pop diva armed with hit after hit, after hit. That peaked with “Un-Break My Heart,” the Diane Warren-penned love song that never gets old.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Maynard James Keenan</p>
<p>Tool’s music was sonically astonishing. But there was something about frontman Maynard James Keenan’s voice that put the band over the top. That power, matched with his haunting lyrics about pain and anger, showcased a level of depth the metal genre hadn’t heard in quite some time.</p>
<p>1997: Celine Dion</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “My Heart Will Go On,” “Tell Him,” “The Reason&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celine Dion spent the second half of 1997 releasing a duet with Barbara Streisand (“Tell Him&rdquo;) and getting big overseas before absolutely exploding on the American pop scene with “My Heart Will Go On,” the theme from a little movie called “Titanic.” That one song made her as big as Mariah, Whitney and every other pop diva.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Erykah Badu</p>
<p>Erykah Badu arrived with a voice even the emerging neo-soul genre hadn’t heard before. Songs like “On &amp; On” and “Appletree” drew Billie Holiday comparisons, which is a compliment of the highest order.</p>
<p>1998: Lauryn Hill</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “X-Factor,” “Doo Wop (That Thing),&rdquo; “Superstar,&rdquo; “To Zion”</p>
<p>Anyone who followed Lauryn Hill’s career knew she was destined to be a solo star. That became most apparent after the Fugees’ cover of Roberta Flack’s “Killing Me Softly” hit big in 1996. Then came “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” in 1998. It was a hybrid of hip-hop and R&amp;B. But some of Hill’s best performances came with via her amazing singing voice. Songs like “To Zion” and “Ex-Factor” stay with you.</p>
<p>Runners-up: Brandy &amp; Monica</p>
<p>We’re breaking our rule of choosing one runner-up from each year. But it was impossible to separate Brandy and Monica in 1998. They each released the biggest solo albums of their careers and then joined forces for the massive duet “The Boy Is Mine.”</p>
<p>1999: Christina Aguilera</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Genie in a Bottle,” “I Turn To You,” “What a Girl Wants&rdquo;</p>
<p>Britney Spears may have been the bigger breakout star in 1999. But everyone was willing to admit that Christina Aguilera had the greatest voice of the TRL era. Even on bubble-gum pop songs like “Genie in a Bottle” and “What a Girl Wants,&rdquo; Aguilera’s voice remains the signature force. And then she released the ballad, “I Turn to You,” proving she was much more than a teen-pop diva.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Faith Hill</p>
<p>Faith Hill was already a huge country star by 1999. But she made the move to pop stardom thanks to the success of 1998′s “Faith,&rdquo; which led all the way up to “Breathe,” the title track from her fourth album, which would make Hill the top female voice in country music.</p>
<p>2000: D’Angelo</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Untitled (How Does It Feel),&rdquo; “Devil’s Pie,&rdquo; “Feel Like Makin’ Love,” “Sent It On”</p>
<p>There were doubts that D’Angelo, or anyone for that matter, could top the neo-soul sounds of his debut album “Brown Sugar.” But D’Angelo kicked off the 21st century with the masterpiece that is “Voodoo.” His vocal performance throughout the entire album is flawless. Heck, even if it hadn’t been accompanied by a music video showing off D’Angelo’s nude physique, “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” would rate as one of the sexiest songs of all time.</p>
<p>Honorable mention: Jill Scott</p>
<p>As you can tell, the start of the 2000s was pretty good for neo-soul music. Aside from D’Angelo, Jill Scott released her debut album that summer, showcasing one of the strongest and most powerful new voices in genre.</p>
<p>2001: Alicia Keys</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Fallin,'&rdquo; “A Woman’s Worth,” “How Come You Don’t Call Me”</p>
<p>Alicia Keys felt like a throwback. Maybe it was the image of her sitting at a piano on “Fallin,'&rdquo; the way she worked harmonies like Marvin Gaye or conveyed a vulnerability like Nina Simone. Keys’ voice was a revelation on her debut album. Critics and fans were wowed.</p>
<p>Honorable mention: Shakira</p>
<p>Shakira’s voice is deceptively forceful. She comes across as a performer at first. But if you listen to a song like “Whenever, Wherever,&rdquo; it soars on the strength of her voice, turning it into the global anthem it became.</p>
<p>2002: Justin Timberlake</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Like I Love You,” “Cry Me a River,” “Take It From Here,&rdquo; “Rock Your Body”</p>
<p>Justin Timberlake got a pass in 2002, but he earned it. A white guy making R&amp;B music, jacking Usher’s style and being compared to Michael Jackson usually brings about a backlash. But Timberlake was so charming, whether he was crooning a slow jam or a dance anthem, he was impossible to resist. And that falsetto had been untouchable since the days of N’Sync’s “Gone.”</p>
<p>Runner-up: Norah Jones</p>
<p>Norah Jones’ debut album, “Come Away With Me,” dominated the Grammy Awards. People couldn’t get enough of her throwback blues and jazz vibes. But her voice is not to be underestimated. Comparisons to Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan are warranted.</p>
<p>2003: Beyonce</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Crazy in Love,” “Me, Myself and I,” “Dangerously in Love 2,&rdquo; “Naughty Girl”</p>
<p>Right from the onset of her solo career, Beyonce was one of the greatest singers in the world. Removed from the group vibe of Destiny’s Child, Bey let loose. Her debut album is heavy on hip-hop vibes. But her voice, which moves from traditional R&amp;B ballads to rap-assisted tunes to dance songs (see her Donna Summer impression on “Naughty Girl”) to even reggae, reigns supreme.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Amy Lee</p>
<p>In 2003, there weren’t a ton of great new rock singers. So when Amy Lee arrived with Evanescence, it was a “wow&rdquo; moment. Evanescence came and went in terms of mass popularity. But it’s hard to deny the power of Lee’s performance on a song like “My Immortal.”</p>
<p>2004: Usher</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Burn,” “Confessions,&rdquo; “Superstar,&rdquo; “My Boo”</p>
<p>Usher had established himself as one of R&amp;B’s greatest voices during the 1990s. But “Confessions” took things to the next level. The production and songwriting (led by Jermaine Dupri) is exceptional. However, Usher’s voice takes the spotlight. Just listen to his tone on the title track’s chorus or marvel at his various vocal styles on “Superstar,” a throwback anthem in the mold of Teddy Pendergrass.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Brandon Flowers</p>
<p>Charisma can take you a long way and The Killers’ Brandon Flowers has it for days, especially on the group’s first album, “Hot Fuss.” The vulnerability on “Mr. Brightside” is moving, while “Smile Like You Mean It&rdquo; gives you all the new-wave feels.</p>
<p>2005: Mariah Carey</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “We Belong Together,” “Be Mine,&rdquo; “Stay the Night,&rdquo; “Shake It Off”</p>
<p>Theoretically, Mariah Carey should not be here. The greatest singer to start the 1990s is also the best in the world in the mid-2000s? Wow. Many had written Carey off. Then came “The Emancipation of Mimi,” her comeback album that was led by the lead single, “We Belong Together.” This was vintage Mariah, hitting the notes we hadn’t heard her hit in nearly a decade. And when Mariah Carey is on point, very few, if any, have ever been better.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Kelly Clarkson</p>
<p>Three years after winning the first season of “American Idol,&rdquo; Clarkson came into her own with a run of singles that included “Breakaway,” “Because of You,” “Behind These Hazel Eyes” and the amazing “Since You Been Gone.”</p>
<p>2006: Carrie Underwood</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Before He Cheats,” “Don’t Forget to Remember Me”</p>
<p>Carrie Underwood came out strong after her “American Idol” win, building on the fact that she was the most popular winner in the show’s history. Her debut album, “Some Hearts,” was a smash. “Jesus Take the Wheel” was only the beginning in 2005. Underwood dropped her biggest hit, “Before He Cheats,” the following year and all bets were off.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Pink</p>
<p>Pink has already been one of the more underrated singers of her generation. She can sing anything, from rock and pop to folk and R&amp;B. Tracks like “The One That Got Away” and “Nobody Knows,&rdquo; from 2006′s “I’m Not Dead,&rdquo; show how truly great she is.</p>
<p>2007: Amy Winehouse</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Rehab,” “Back to Black,” “Me &amp; Mr. Jones,” “Tears Dry on Their Own,” “Love Is a Losing Game”</p>
<p>2007 easily belonged to Amy Winehouse. Her breakthrough hit “Rehab” peaked on the charts, while “Back to BlacK” became a critical darling. Winehouse brought the retro pop and soul sound of 1960s girl groups back into the mainstream, paving the way for Adele, Sam Smith, Lana Del Rey and others.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Thom Yorke</p>
<p>Plenty of art rockers have tried to sound like Radiohead’s Thom Yorke (just ask Chris Martin). But it’s not so easy. Yorke’s best overall vocal display came on 1997′s “In Rainbows,” with amazing songs like “Reckoner” and “Nude.”</p>
<p>2008: Beyonce</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “If I Were a Boy,” “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),&rdquo; “At Last”</p>
<p>Beyonce could drop catchy dance anthems like nobody’s business. And while 2006′s “I Am&hellip; Sasha Fierce” may have been a little uneven, the single “If I Were a Boy” was a head-turner from a vocal standpoint. On top of that, Bey covered Etta James’ signature song “At Last” for the film “Cadillac Records&rdquo; and more than does it justice.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Jennifer Hudson</p>
<p>Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar for her performance in 2006′s “Dreamgirls,” leading everyone to wonder how she got eliminated early on “American Idol.” She dropped her debut album and the single “Spotlight” in 2008 and became a megastar anyway.</p>
<p>2009: Miranda Lambert</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Dead Flowers,&rdquo; “The House That Built Me,” “White Liar”</p>
<p>Forget Carrie Underwood or Taylor Swift. With the release of “Revolution” in 2009, Miranda Lambert became the premier female voice in country music. The chorus of the album’s lead single, “Dead Flowers,” is her coming-out party as a vocalist, while “The House That Built Me” took its place among the greatest country tearjerkers of all time.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Maxwell</p>
<p>Maxwell was one of the greatest and most important R&amp;B artists of the 1990s. But some of his later work during the decade was heavy on vibes and grooves. He got back to focusing on his voice on 2009′s “BLACKsummer’night.&rdquo; Songs like “Pretty Wings” and “Fistful of Tears” stand as some of the most beautiful tracks of his career.</p>
<p>2010: Michael Buble</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Cry Me a River,” “Hollywood,” “Haven’t Met You Yet”</p>
<p>A throwback to traditional pop and the days when crooners ruled music, Michael Buble was beloved at the start of the 2010s. In 2009, he released “Crazy Love,” which debuted at No. 1. A series of strong singles, a live CD/DVD from Madison Square Garden, various television appearances and a hit Christmas album in 2011 followed to make him a superstar.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Bruno Mars</p>
<p>Bruno Mars released his debut album, “Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans,” in 2010. But he was already everywhere before that, writing and singing massive hooks on other people’s hit songs like Travis McCoy’s “Billionaire” and B.O.B.&lsquo;s “Nothin’ On You.”</p>
<p>2011: Adele</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Someone Like You,” “Rolling in the Deep,” “Set Fire to Rain,” “Turning Tables”</p>
<p>When Adele arrived (like, fully arrived) with “21,” it became hard for any other artist to claim the title of greatest singer in the world. There was just no topping her performance on songs like “Rolling in the Deep” and “Someone Like You,” which stayed on the charts forever. Adele wasn’t very prolific during the 2010s, because she didn’t have to be. People just kept buying her records.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Lady Gaga</p>
<p>The title for 2011 would have easily gone to Lady Gaga, had it not been for the power of Adele. Gaga stepped away from dance music to prove she had one of the greatest voices in music on songs like “You and I” and “The Edge of Glory.”</p>
<p>2012: Florence Welch</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Shake It Out,” “Never Let Me Go,&rdquo; “Lover to Lover&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florence Welch doesn’t shy away from showing off the power of her voice, which is impressive given how Florence and the Machine’s art pop songs can really take off. But they never go anywhere without Welch’s soaring vocals, especially on the group’s stellar sophomore album, “Ceremonials.&rdquo; Even with all the elaborate sounds and instruments, Welch’s voice is the focal point, something she would further prove during an “MTV Unplugged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Runner-up: Miguel</p>
<p>Usher, Frank Ocean and Alicia Keys all released noteworthy albums in 2011. But none of them had the vocal range of Miguel on “Kaleidoscope Dream,&rdquo; thanks to songs like “Adorn” and “Use Me.”</p>
<p>2013: Idina Menzel</p>
<p>Songs that prove it : “Let It Go,&rdquo; “You Learn to Live Without”</p>
<p>“Rent” and “Wicked” made Idina Menzel one of Broadway’s greatest stars of all time long before Disney’s “Frozen” came out. But even those spectacular musicals weren’t as big as Elsa and Anna. “Let It Go” just wouldn’t go away. Holiday albums, national tours and appearances on “Glee” followed for Menzel, whose voice was just as powerful as it was when she was on Broadway.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Justin Timberlake</p>
<p>JT threw his hat into the retro soul arena on “The 20/20 Experience” and proved his falsetto was still to notch. The single “Suit &amp; Tie” got an assist from Jay-Z, but it was JT’s style that won out.</p>
<p>2014: Sam Smith</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Stay With Me,” “Latch,&rdquo; “I’m Not the Only One,&rdquo; “Money on My Mind”</p>
<p>Sam Smith already had hits before he released his debut album. Only, you may not have known it was him. He’s the stunning voice on Disclosure’s “Latch” and Naughty Boy’s “La La La.” Of course, Smith would top both of those songs, becoming the male equivalent of Adele on amazing slow-burners like “Stay With Me” and “I’m Not the Only One.”</p>
<p>Runner-up: Sia</p>
<p>Sia finally stepped into the spotlight (well sort of) with her own hit album “1000 Forms of Fear.” She may not have appeared in the videos, but songs like “Chandelier” and “Elastic Heart” were pop bliss.</p>
<p>2015: Adele</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Hello,” “When We Were Young,” “All I Ask,” “Send My Love (To Your New Lover)”</p>
<p>In 2015, Adele returned with “25,” which means every other singer had to move out of the way. Despite the fact that “25” came out in November, it essentially took over the year, beginning with the monumental release of “Hello.”</p>
<p>Runner-up: The Weeknd</p>
<p>By 2015, The Weeknd had cemented himself as the kind of alternative R&amp;B. But he became a true pop star with the release of “Beauty Behind the Madness,” which featured three top-10 hits.</p>
<p>2016: Beyonce</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Sorry,” “Freedom,” “Sandcastles,&rdquo; “Pray You Catch Me”</p>
<p>Beyonce really turned to experimental R&amp;B art pop during the 2010s. But make no mistake, she was still one of the greatest singers in the world. “Lemonade’s” biggest songs are driven by hip-hop sounds. But take a listen to tunes like “Sorry” and “Freedom” and realize Bey could put out a traditional R&amp;B album anytime she wants and decimate all.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Sturgill Simpson</p>
<p>There were several great R&amp;B and pop vocal performances in 2016 (See: Lady Gaga’s “Million Reasons”). But there was just something nostalgic and warm about Sturgill Simpson, who released “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth” and drew comparisons to Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard and Marty Robbins.</p>
<p>2017: Bruno Mars</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “That’s What I Like,” “Finesse,” “Versace on the Floor&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bruno Mars released the title track to his 2016 album, “24K Magic,” at the end of the year. It became a hit, but wasn’t as big as that album got. “That’s What I Like” would rule the charts during the first half of 2017. Mars dominated the year as its biggest pop star and would clean up at the 2018 Grammys thanks to his throwback new jack swing vibes and sweet voice.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Harry Styles</p>
<p>After One Direction broke up, Harry Styles could have banked on the upbeat pop-rock the group sold millions of records with. Instead, Styles put the emphasis on his voice on his self-titled album with fantastic results.</p>
<p>2018: Lady Gaga</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Shallow,&rdquo; “Always Remember Us,&rdquo; “I’ll Never Love Again”</p>
<p>As you may remember, Lady Gaga starred in the remake of “A Star Is Born” in 2018 and wowed audiences around the world. She also released this little song called “Shallow” (with Bradley Cooper) that you couldn’t escape. Coupled with the film’s powerhouse ballads “Always Remember Us” and “I’ll Never Love Again,&rdquo; “Shallow” delivered a chill-factor for the ages.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Brendon Urie</p>
<p>Panic! at the Disco’s lead singer Brendon Urie brought the influence of his time on Broadway (“Kinky Boots”) to the band’s album, “Pray for the Wicked.” The results made his voice sound bigger and better than it ever had.</p>
<p>2019: Ariana Grande</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Thank U, Next,&rdquo; “7 Rings,” “Ghostin&rsquo;”</p>
<p>After back-to-back No. 1 albums and a series of hit singles, Ariana Grande was the queen of pop music in 2019. She bounced back from the tragic 2017 Manchester bombing in inspiring fashion. Grande always had raw talent. But her 2019 album, “Thank U, Next,” gave her a glossy swagger without sacrificing her vocal talent.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Brittany Howard</p>
<p>The power of Brittany Howard’s voice is the driving force behind Alabama Shakes. But on her solo album, Howard takes things to new level on a song like “Georgia.”</p>
<p>2020: The Weeknd</p>
<p>Songs that prove it: “Heartless,” “Blinding Lights,” “In Your Eyes,&rdquo; “Scared to Live”</p>
<p>2020 isn’t even halfway through. But it will be hard to top The Weeknd and his album “After Hours,” which has ruled the charts. His previous full-length “Starboy” saw new wave vibes overwhelm the sultry harmonies R&amp;B fans have come to love. “After Hours” finds the perfect mix, allowing for some of best vocal performances of Abel Tesfaye’s career.</p>
<p>Runner-up: Fiona Apple</p>
<p>The Weeknd may be winning the battle on the charts so far in 2020. But the critical acclaim goes to Fiona Apple, whose “Fetch the Bolt Cutters” is one of the best-reviewed albums in recent history. Apple has been making great music since the late 1990s and her uncanny, if awkward, jazz-influenced voice is a big part of the appeal.

<h3 id="bandcamp-friday-june-2020-edition-support-artists-by-buying-this-music">&ldquo;Bandcamp Friday, June 2020 Edition: Support Artists by Buying This Music&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bandcamp-friday.jpg" alt="img">
Starting in March, when the COVID-19 crisis flattened the livelihoods of many in the music business, Bandcamp has held a monthly holiday in which it waives its full revenue share on all sales. The idea was an immediate hit. Bandcamp Friday, which falls on June 5th this month, has successfully directed millions of fans’ dollars to the artists who rely on income from merch and music to pay their bills at a time of acute economic distress.</p>
<p>Today, there’s another reason to pick up that record or T-shirt you’ve had your eye on: As protests against racist police violence continue across the country, many independent artists and labels have chosen to give their proceeds this Bandcamp Friday to bail funds and other organizations working to end racial injustice. (See here for more details.)</p>
<p>Here are 13 releases worth your money this Bandcamp Friday, as chosen by Rolling Stone staff. You can find our first two rounds of Bandcamp picks here and here. For more ideas, try consulting this crowd-sourced spreadsheet with more than 1,000 Black musicians whose work is available for purchase on Bandcamp. It’s also worth taking a look through the bail funds, legal aid, and other groups compiled here, for some more direct ways to support protesters against police brutality right now. Once you’ve done that, why not pick up something new to listen to?</p>
<p>Sault, 5 and 7</p>
<p>“You don’t feel what we feel, and it’s evident/That you shoot to kill,” goes the provocative first line of Sault’s “Foot on Necks.” Needless to say, this upfront track on police brutality feels especially timely right now, but “Foot on Necks” is just one of the sprawling 24 songs that the mysterious band released out of nowhere last year, across two LPs: 5 in May and 7 in September. (A vinyl release of the second one is due later this month.) Nobody really knows who Sault are — there have been links to London producer Dean Josiah (Michael Kiwanuka, Little Simz), as well as British soul singer Cleo Sol and Chicago rapper Kid Sister — but the group’s anonymity only gives their ESG-like combo of funk, Motown, and post-punk a sharper edge. May the life-affirming grooves on “Up All Night,” “Over” and “Let Me Go” inspire you as you march to your next protest. — Claire Shaffer</p>
<p>Kiki and Herb, Whitey on the Moon EP</p>
<p>Justin Vivian Bond and Kenny Mellman return to their out-of-touch aging cabaret act alter egos, Kiki and Herb, for this three-song digital EP of never-before-released live covers. The intention behind the three songs — “Whitey On The Moon Medley” (based on Gil Scott-Heron’s 1970 classic), Elliott Smith’s “King’s Crossing,” and Bright Eyes’ “First Day Of My Life” — are still relevant, and the 20-year-old raw recordings capture frustration and anger with humor and pathos. All profits are going to Black Visions Collective (BLVC), a Minnesota-based organization committed to a longterm vision in which all Black lives not only matter, but are able to thrive. As Bond and Mellman explained in a statement: “Kiki &amp; Herb was born as a direct reaction to the AIDS Crisis and the government’s lack of response to it. We feel like in these times, unable to exist on stage, we wanted to give back to communities who are under assault by this administration.” — Jerry Portwood</p>
<p>Archie Shepp, Raw Poetic, and Damu the Fudgemunk, Ocean Bridges</p>
<p>The marriage of music and text has been at the center of Archie Shepp’s art for close to 60 years. So it’s not hard to draw a direct line from the urgent message and impassioned playing heard on classic Shepp statements like 1965’s Fire Music and 1972’s Attica Blues to 2007’s Chuck D-featuring Gemini and finally to Ocean Bridges, the 83-year-old saxophonist and poet’s new album with MC-producer Raw Poetic (who is Shepp’s nephew) and multi-instrumentalist Damu the Fudgemunk. The LP’s lengthy tracks unfold as loose studio jams, with Raw Poetic’s searching, socially conscious rhymes and Shepp’s sax — both his keening soprano and grittily majestic tenor — bubbling to the surface in turn. It’s the latest surprising statement from a musician who clearly views “avant-garde” as a philosophy rather than a style. — Hank Shteamer</p>
<p>Chicano Batman, Invisible People</p>
<p>This quartet’s fourth collection of SoCal roots-funk is a cratedigger’s paradise, traversing hip-hop (“Pink Elephant”), jittery psych-rock (“Polymetronomic Harmony”), spacey synth-pop (“I Know It”), and more. The title track is a timely plea for communion (“the concept of race was implanted inside your brain”), but it’s the band’s razor-sharp songcraft that makes their latest work their most fully-realized effort to date. As lead singer Bardo Martinez has said of lead single “Color My Life,” “my inspiration was that we just needed bangers.” — Jonathan Bernstein</p>
<p>Momma, Two of Me</p>
<p>This L.A. rock band’s second album is billed as a concept album about sin and suffering, but you don’t need to read the liner notes to get lost in its heady guitar haze. Singer-songwriters Etta Friedman and Allegra Weingarten are great at damaged riffs (“Biohazard,” “Derby”) and even better at disaffected melodies (“Carny,” “Double Dare”), and they know that grunge is just another word for pop. If you’re a generation or two ahead of them, some of the songs on Two of Me might remind you of Helium circa The Magic City or Sonic Youth circa Dirty, but at its best this album creates a twilight zone of its own. — Simon Vozick-Levinson</p>
<p>Wylde Ratttz, Wylde Ratttz</p>
<p>Supergroups — bands comprised of members of other, often bigger acts — have been a pop tradition for over five decades. In 1997, it was alt-rock’s turn to give the idea a spin. When covers of Stooges songs were needed for the soundtrack of director Todd Haynes’ glam-rock dramatization Velvet Goldmine, the Wylde Ratttz were born. And quite the indie-all-star lineup it was: Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore and Steve Shelley, Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton, Mudhoney singer Mark Arm, Minutemen and Firehose bassist Mike Watt, the open-to-experimentation Sean Lennon, and guitarist and all-around alt-rock compadre Don Fleming. Their version of “TV Eye” graced the movie’s soundtrack. But before Asheton’s death in 2009, the band reconvened and recorded an entire album of garage-punk originals, which was belatedly unveiled on Bandcamp in April. As a postscript to that release, we’re also getting two more, very different instrumentals from those sessions. “Judy’s Blues” is slow and sludgy — Sixties-style white blues with a layer of scuzz slathered across it. The keeper is “Flow,” eight minutes of guitar-squawk improv that’s reminiscent of the way Sonic Youth would draw out their songs onstage by way of discordant jams. With Asheton and Moore lobbing splotches of noise back and forth, the music lumbers, slithers and lurches into periodic spams. “Flow” conveys chaos, confusion, and imminent collapse. In other words, it’s an unearthed treasure that’s never felt more relevant than right now. — David Browne</p>
<p>Jeremiah Cymerman, Systema Munditotius, vol 1</p>
<p>Abstract music comes in many forms. For those times when, say, a soothing Eno ambient disc just isn’t cutting it, Jeremiah Cymerman’s albums bring about a very different headspace. A clarinetist and an ace sound designer, Cymerman crafts aural worlds of rare detail. This latest one — featuring Cymerman’s overdubbed clarinets, plus synths, electronics, and more, and drums by Brian Chase, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs member with a lengthy history of experimental soundmaking — evokes a sustained sense of creeping dread, erupting at times into outright alarm. Inspired by a mandala that psychiatrist Carl Jung drew in 1916, “wholly unconscious of what it meant,” the music likewise provides no easy answers. In the insanity of our present moment, there’s something almost comforting about that. — Hank Shteamer</p>
<p>Angel Bat Dawid, “Transition East”/”No Space Fo Us”</p>
<p>If you haven’t already heard this Chicago clarinetist’s excellent 2019 debut, The Oracle, go check that out — few records will make you feel more like you’re voyaging among distant stars while also keeping your feet firmly rooted on our troubled earth. Then, if you’re looking for more of Angel Bat Dawid’s far-out sounds of liberation, turn up her latest single and let it help you dare to imagine another world. — Simon Vozick-Levinson</p>
<p>GBN Live House, Golden Hits</p>
<p>This 42-track Korean punk comp is a subgenre-spanning survey of what’s happening right now in Seoul. From garage to hardcore to ska to power pop to thrash to powerviolence, and even with a little NOFX worship in the mix, Golden Hits has something for anyone who ever wore studs on leather. GBN Live House is an underground club that Seoul’s aggressive music community calls home, and the compilation is a fundraiser to keep the doors open after COVID-19. Standout tracks include d-beat banger “Future” by Scumraid, modern hardcore anthem “The Trap” by Slant, brutal riff rocker “피에는 피” by Martyrs, and oi singalong “다정한 사람” by the 1234 Dah. There are certainly some weirder tracks on here as well, particularly the closing track, a synth and drum-machine downer in the vein of Joy Division, in which Tank Boys continuously croon, “I Don’t Want To Know.” A fun, varied listen if you want to hear what Korean punk sounds like right now. — Reed Dunlea</p>
<p>Amarcord Nino Rota</p>
<p>You could call the late Hal Willner a producer or booker, but when stacked up against his vast creative output, those stock terms fall short. Willner’s signature move was assembling dream casts, drawn from the worlds of rock, pop, jazz, the avant-garde, and beyond, and matching them with handpicked repertoire. His first such effort — a previously out-of-print 1981 tribute to legendary Italian film composer Nino Rota that’s back out thanks to the adventurous Chicago label Corbett vs. Dempsey — set the template for decades of brilliant work. It features everything from offbeat jazz genius Carla Bley tackling madcap themes from Fellini’s 8 1/2, to Blondie’s Debbie Harry and Chris Stein appearing on a balmy interpretation of a piece from La Dolce Vita, and maverick improvisers Jaki Byard, Bill Frisell, and Steve Lacy putting idiosyncratic solo spins on assorted other Rota material. As a whole, Amarcord Nino Rota is pure Willner, and it couldn’t have emerged from any other mind. (The entire Corbett vs. Dempsey catalog is filled with obscure and unusual delights; check out a 1985 Willner-produced set of wonderfully surrealistic jazz from a band co-led by drummer Beaver Harris and pianist Don Pullen, and a stunning 1967 duo between Dutch improv legends Willem Breuker and Han Bennink.) — Hank Shteamer</p>
<p>Luke Schneider, Altar of Harmony</p>
<p>The pedal steel has long been linked with the sound of country music, and Nashville musician Luke Schneider has played the instrument in its conventional way with Margo Price, Caitlin Rose, and Orville Peck. But on his solo album Altar of Harmony, released by Third Man Records, the Ohio native gives the instrument an ambient makeover across an instrumental suite of songs that range from soothing and placid to cosmic and rapturous. Every sound on the album was made by Schneider’s steel, be it the extended droning chord that underpins the opening track “Anteludium,” or the angelic, church organ-like tones that he teases out in “Mundi Tuum Est.” In “Umbra,” he evokes a cloud-like airiness, letting an amorphous set of tones drift slowly out into infinity as occasional low-end rattles dart out of the darkness. “Lex Universum” reaches past the clouds and into the heavens, finding something warm and welcoming like a sunrise on some distant planet. It’s gorgeous, and like the rest of this album, a perfect tonic for when the apocalyptic anxiety begins to overtake us. — Jon Freeman</p>
<p>Marissa Nadler, “Old Friends/Bookends”</p>
<p>Boston’s Marissa Nadler has built a cult following by patiently developing a folk-rock sound that’s as lovely and eerie as a long walk under a starless sky. (Try 2014’s July or 2016’s Strangers for two of her best full-length explorations.) It’s a style that’s suited well to acoustic covers, like this lonesome version of Simon &amp; Garfunkel’s 1968 ballad. “This song to me now feels like a memory of a place that just doesn’t exist anymore, a romanticization of a forgotten era,” Nadler writes in a note accompanying the song, all of whose profits she is donating to Black Lives Matter. “A daydream of a better time. A desire to live long enough to look back.” — Simon Vozick-Levinson

<h3 id="the-new-queen-bee-rihanna-is-crowned-britains-wealthiest-female-musician">&ldquo;The new queen bee: Rihanna is crowned Britain&rsquo;s wealthiest female musician&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4abc09ad942f1802ad38a71be636b9a200df880f/0_127_5906_3545/master/5906.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=30338c29ee9d4c51ead303081ee27935" alt="img">
Rihanna was a tiny child when she first walked in on her father smoking crack. The family struggled with poverty during her childhood in Barbados; her home life was marred by violent arguments and her father’s crippling drug and alcohol addictions. At school though, her teachers recorded that she was sure of herself, intelligent and “very observant of her environment”. By the time she was 10, Rihanna had become a carer to her two younger brothers while her mother worked to support them. Her parents later divorced.</p>
<p>If humble, troubled beginnings go some way to explain the drive of the most successful stars, then Rihanna makes a bold claim to be among the biggest. At 32, she enters the Sunday Times Rich list as Britain’s wealthiest female musician.</p>
<p>Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the pop megastar-turned-businesswoman has a fortune estimated at £468m. Eligible for inclusion in the newspaper’s annual list since she moved to London over a year ago, Rihanna, who enters the musicians’ category at No 3 after Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney, is now richer than Mick Jagger and Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Adele. And, to the consternation of her fans, she hasn’t even released an album since 2016. She last did a concert tour the same year.</p>
<p>Her rise to the top of Britain’s elite list appears to have even shocked Robert Watts, who compiles it. “She somewhat caught us by surprise,” he told the BBC. “Very few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer; now she’s well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK.”</p>

<p>Rihanna was just 17 when her first single, Pon De Replay, became an unexpected global smash hit. (Her UK label was paying such little attention to its Caribbean signing at the time, it didn’t even bother spelling her name right on their first ever run of “Rhianna” CDs).</p>
<p>At 22, she became the only female artist in the history of the US Billboard chart to score four No 1 singles in a calendar year. By 24, she had won the record as the biggest-selling digital artist of all time, and at 31, Rihanna became the first black woman to run a luxury fashion house. Backed by luxury brand Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), her fashion brand has been the key to building her staggering wealth. First, with the industry-disrupting launch of Fenty Beauty in 2017, the first cosmetics line to cater for up to 40 skintones, then, with Savage x Fenty, a lingerie line for all sizes.</p>

<p>It’s a long way from the parish of St Michael, in the south west of Barbados, where Rihanna was born. Her Guyanese mother was an immigrant and her father came from mixed-race heritage, black and white. “The Guyanese are like the Mexicans of Barbados,” she told British Vogue last month. “That’s why I really relate and empathise with Latino people who are discriminated against in America.”</p>
<p>Rihanna spent her early teenage years training as an army cadet. When she was 14, she formed the girl group Contrast with her friends. That summer, in 2003, the group auditioned for US music producer Evan Richards, who immediately dumped the other girls and set about making Rihanna a solo star. A meeting was arranged with Jay-Z at Def Jam records – he signed her on the spot.</p>
<p>In 2007, at 19 and with three albums already under her belt, Rihanna told the Observer: “They locked me into the office – til 3am. Then Jay-Z said: ‘There’s only two ways out: out the door after you sign this deal or through this window.’” Naively, perhaps, she was thrilled by the story. “We were on the 29th floor,” she said. “[It was] very flattering.” Later, she said she felt stifled by the contract she signed so young, which saw her churn out seven hit albums in seven years.</p>
<p>But the release of 2007’s Good Girl Gone Bad marked a creative turning point and saw Rihanna drop her label-mandated image which she deemed “girlie and boring” to experiment with “different, unexpected and edgy” looks. She moved on from reggae-flavoured dancehall and delivered Umbrella, a track that earned her the first of nine Grammys and spent 71 weeks in the UK charts, staying at No 1 for 10 of them.</p>
<p>“She’s now got enough incredible singles to fill five greatest hits albums, and it’s amazing she’s never released one,” says Michael Cragg, music journalist and editor of BEAT magazine. “She’s got one great album – Anti – but like Madonna, she’s made so many good singles it doesn’t matter.” Her ninth album is allegedly imminent, but then it has been for the last year.</p>

<p>While, professionally, Rihanna is at her peak, she has faced hardship in her private life. A year after going public about her relationship with RnB singer Chris Brown, photos of her battered face – swollen and bruised – were leaked to the press. Brown had beaten her after an argument in the car home from an awards ceremony. The couple broke up, but reconciled several times over the next four years.</p>
<p>In a 2009 US television interview with Diane Sawyer, Rihanna said that Brown was her “first big love”. She had been warned that her reconciliation with him would set a bad example for young girls. “I realise that my selfish decision for love could result in some getting killed,” she said. “Even if Chris never hit me again, who’s to say that [their abusers] won’t kill these girls?” In 2013, back again with Brown, she told Rolling Stone, she didn’t care what people thought : “I decided it was important for me to be happy … I wasn’t going to let anyone’s opinion get in the way of that.” Months later they broke up again.</p>

<p>While music has been the backbone to her creative success, her commercial skill goes far beyond singing songs. Designers including Tom Ford and Alexander Wang have been quick to heap praise on her, marking out her daring and constant reinvention. “She’s an amplified version of what a lot of girls want to look like, but she’s always one step ahead of the game,” designer Peter Dundas told British Vogue.</p>
<p>Critics largely agree it’s a talent that applies to her songs, too. The New Yorker, noting that her limited vocal range has never been the draw, declared in 2016 that her “real art” was “her accessible brand of casual, forward-thinking cool”. Put plainly, Rihanna excels at producing influential pop anthems that reverberate from school discos to underground clubs.</p>
<p>Rihanna is notorious for playing against pop machine’s rules and has cultivated a brand – the “Bad Gal Riri” of her Instagram handle – that is unapologetically sexual. She has her critics: Annie Lennox accused her of peddling “pornographic” music videos, and Mail on Sunday columnist Liz Jones called her “toxic” and “poisonous”.</p>
<p>“Her fans lap it up,” says Cragg. “Rihanna can be messy, get drunk, have spats on Twitter, sit on the shoulders of her bodyguard at Coachella rolling a blunt, and it’s part of her charm.</p>
<p>“She’s still got a real edge and you can’t market that or fabricate it in any way. She genuinely has to have really great taste to still be so relevant at this point in her career.”</p>
<p>By all accounts, Rihanna is supremely slick at what she does – with little sign that she’s letting up.</p>
<p>“I was always trying to figure out ‘how can I change the world? What could I do?’” she told the Observer in 2007. “I think the American way is a fantasy … Their priorities are fancy cars and bling. In Barbados, it’s about having fun.”

<h3 id="indiana-states-kurt-thomas-gymnast-denied-1980-glory-dies">&ldquo;Indiana State&rsquo;s Kurt Thomas, gymnast denied 1980 glory, dies&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/06/07/PIND/9b9909e0-d176-4cff-b207-bc0eb3a4b92f-gymnastics_1977_team.jpg?crop=1599,900,x0,y75&amp;width=1599&amp;height=900&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Forty years ago, Kurt Thomas was on the verge of becoming one of America’s most celebrated male Olympians.</p>
<p>We’re talking Thorpe, Owens, Mathias, Ali, Hayes, Spitz, Lewis, Phelps.</p>
<p>Thomas had talent. Yet it takes more than that to be a transcendent figure in a sport that features the women’s side.</p>
<p>Thomas had charisma, and he had style. The New York Times called him “the Baryshnikov and Balanchine of men’s gymnastics.” On his Indiana State campus, the stature of the 5-5, 127-pound gymnast rivaled that of 6-9 basketball player Larry Bird.</p>
<p>Thomas was all over television in the late 1970s, including appearances on late-night talk shows. And he did so before having won an Olympic medal.</p>
<p>Indeed, he never won an Olympic medal. Tellingly, people still thought he had. The United States’ boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games deprived him of his Olympic moment.</p>
<p>“Kurt Thomas was the only male gymnast we&rsquo;ve ever had — maybe the only male gymnast anyone has ever had — who had the same attraction to the general public and the media as the top females did,” USA Gymnastics director Mike Jacki once told the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>Thomas, the first American male gymnast to win a world championship, died Friday. He was 64.</p>
<p>Thomas had a stroke May 24, caused by a tear of the basilar artery in the brain stem.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, I lost my universe, my best friend and my soulmate of 24 years. Kurt lived his life to the extreme, and I will be forever honored to be his wife,’’ Beckie Thomas told International Gymnast Magazine.</p>
<p>Indiana State, just a few years removed from Division II gymnastics, was led to the 1977 NCAA championship by Thomas. Schools from the Power Five have won every subsequent team championship —and Indiana State dropped men’s gymnastics in 1986.</p>
<p>Thomas won five individual NCAA titles, including the all-around in 1977 and 1979.</p>
<p>His breakthrough gold medal came in floor exercise at the 1978 World Championships. He followed that with six medals, including golds in floor exercise and high bar, in the 1979 worlds at Fort Worth, Texas. That remains a record U.S. medal haul at a single worlds, tied by Simone Biles in 2018.</p>
<p>Also in 1979, Thomas won the Sullivan Award as the nation’s outstanding amateur athlete. He was inducted into four halls of fame: USA Gymnastics in 1990, Indiana State athletics in 1999, International Gymnastics in 2003 and Missouri Valley Conference in 2010.</p>
<p>Weekend tributes poured in, including those from Indiana State’s president, Deborah Curtis, and athletic director, Sherard Clinkscales.</p>
<p>“Kurt represented his university, state, and country with professionalism and class,” Curtis said. “We will honor his legacy later this year.”</p>
<p>Thomas, born in Hollywood, Fla., did not come from affluence. He was one of four children, and his father died when he was 7.</p>
<p>He was a latecomer to the sport. He was introduced to gymnastics as a 4-9, 77-pound freshman at Miami Central High School. The coach wanted football types until he saw what this tiny kid could do on gymnastics apparatus.</p>
<p>Indiana State flew Thomas in for a recruiting visit – something usually only football players from his high school did — and he accepted a scholarship offer. He told the Sycamores’ coach, Roger Counsil, he would make the 1976 Olympic team. Thomas did so but could not return to that stage in 1980.</p>
<p>Thomas had a “neurological gift,” Counsil told the Washington Post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got to be a favorite in Moscow,&rdquo; Counsil said in a 1979 interview. “He&rsquo;s known the world over now. He is the greatest male gymnast. He knows it and the rest of the world knows it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world never got to witness it. Thomas did not express bitterness.</p>
<p>“In my mind and my heart, I knew I was the best at that time,&rsquo;&rsquo; Thomas told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 1989.</p>
<p>He said he could have gone to Moscow “and placed 50th.” And Thomas, who once filed for bankruptcy, said he would have blown the money from endorsements.</p>
<p>This way, he said, “I’m a hero without proving it, a gold medalist without ever doing it.”</p>
<p>He brought innovation and showmanship to gymnastics, and two moves were named for him: the Thomas flair on pommel horse and Thomas salto in floor exercise. When he unveiled the Thomas flair in Barcelona, newspapers in Spain headlined it “The New Gymnastics.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>After the 1980 boycott was announced, Thomas abruptly quit training. He wasn’t eligible for the 1984 Olympics after becoming “pro” – that is, organizing and participating in touring gymnastics shows. He starred in a forgettable 1985 movie, “Gymkata,” and also worked as a television analyst.</p>
<p>He resumed competing in 1989 but, at age 36, did not make the U.S team for the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. He and his wife owned and operated Kurt Thomas Gymnastics in Frisco, Texas.</p>
<p>Thomas is survived by his wife and children Kassidy Thomas, Hunter Thomas, and Kurt Travis, a singer/songwriter.</p>

<h3 id="vanessa-williams-joining-nyu-steinhardt-as-scholar-in-residence-for-2020-2021-academic-year">&ldquo;Vanessa Williams Joining NYU Steinhardt as Scholar-in-Residence for 2020-2021 Academic Year&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.nyu.edu/content/nyu/en/about/news-publications/news/2020/may/vanessa-williams-mpap-scholar-in-residence/jcr:content/page/image.img.480.high.jpg" alt="img">
NYU Steinhardt is excited to announce that multi-faceted performer Vanessa Williams will serve as the 2020-2021 Dean’s Scholar-in-Residence in the Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions. Her appointment comes as MPAP prepares to launch its new Contemporary Vocal program, which aims to train singers and songwriters in newer methods of their crafts in order to help prepare them for a career in the recording industry.</p>
<p>Beyond the new Contemporary track, Williams will be involved in many of MPAP’s other programs, including Songwriting, Music Business, Vocal Performance, and Music Technology. She’ll conduct master classes, discuss the role of and challenges for women in the arts, mentor music performance and creator students, and offer a unique performance in collaboration with students and faculty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vocal work involves talent, but there&rsquo;s also a great deal of education, practice, and care that goes into a music career,” Williams said in a statement. “I&rsquo;m incredibly excited to bring my experience to NYU Steinhardt this fall as a Scholar-in-Residence, and work with students to hone their musical crafts. The new Contemporary Vocal program promises to add an innovative element to an already robust department, and I can&rsquo;t wait to begin helping students harness their talents and pursue their creative goals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MPAP’s faculty is composed largely of music industry professionals and performers who bridge the worlds of education and experience. Adding Williams to that roster deepens MPAP’s commitment to prepare students for a music career by helping them develop the tools they’ll need to succeed in the industry. “Vanessa Williams is the quintessential role model that exemplifies how creative people pursue their lives,” said MPAP Chair Dave Schroeder. “Our faculty direct and inspire students, and now we’ve added Vanessa Williams to confirm that a life in the arts is a life well spent.”</p>
<p>Williams’ presence at NYU Steinhardt solidifies a 30-year professional relationship with songwriter and Director of Songwriting Phil Galdston. “Everything she has accomplished amazes me, but none of it surprises me,” said Galdston. “She is a consummate pro, and I know she&rsquo;ll bring her vast experience, insight, and compassion to the NYU community. We are most fortunate to have her as a member of our team.”</p>
<p>Williams is a respected and multi-faceted performer who has sold millions of records worldwide. She has achieved numerous #1 hit singles and top-performing songs across genres such as pop, dance, r&amp;b, adult contemporary, holiday, Latin, gospel and jazz.</p>
<p>Her critically acclaimed work in film, television, and on the Broadway stage has been recognized by every major industry award affiliate. Williams has received 11 Grammy nominations, one Tony nomination, four Emmy nominations, three SAG Award nominations, and seven NAACP Image Awards. Her platinum single, &ldquo;Colors of the Wind&rdquo; from the animated film Pocahontas, won the Oscar, Grammy, and Golden Globe for Best Original Song. In 2007, she was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>
<p>A graduate of Syracuse University, Williams is an advocate for equal rights, especially concerning the gay community and minorities. The Human Rights Campaign presented her with their “Ally for Equality” Award for her humanitarian contributions.

<h3 id="beyoncé-supports-black-lives-matter-calls-out-sexist-music-industry">&ldquo;Beyoncé Supports Black Lives Matter, Calls Out Sexist Music Industry&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://newsbrig.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Beyonce-Supports-Black-Lives-Matter-Calls-Out-Sexist-Music-Industry.jpgquality90stripallw1200.jpeg" alt="img">
Beyoncé Knowles-Carter made a powerful statement on the Black Lives Matter movement and sexism in the music industry during YouTube’s “Dear Class of 2020” virtual graduation on Saturday.</p>
<p>The singer started by congratulating the high school seniors who persevered through an unprecedented time in the country.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to the class of 2020, you have arrived here in the middle of a global crisis, a racial pandemic and worldwide expression of outrage at the senseless killing of yet another unarmed Black human being. And you still made it, we’re so proud of you,” she said.</p>
<p>Beyoncé highlighted the Black Lives Matter protests that have taken place around the country.</p>
<p>“Thank you for using your collective voice and letting the worlds know that Black lives matter. The killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many others have left us all broken. It has left the entire country searching for answers. We’ve seen that our collective hearts, when put to positive action, could start the wheels of change. Real change has started with you, this new generation of high school and college graduates who we celebrate today,” she said.</p>
<p>She also touched on the sexism that is still prevalent in the music industry and how she had to carve her own path to success. Although the process was “terrifying” in her own words, building her own company was a major turning point in her life, “I know how hard it is to step out and bet on yourself.”</p>
<p>“The entertainment business is still very sexist. It’s still very male-dominated and as a woman, I did not see enough female role models given the opportunity to what I knew I had to do — to run my label, and management company, to direct my films and produce my tours that meant ownership, owning my masters, owning my art, owning my future and writing my own story. Not enough Black women had a seat at the table. So I had to go and chop down that wood and build my own table. Then I had to invite the best there was to have a seat. That meant hiring women, men outsiders, underdogs, people that were overlooked and waiting to be seen,” she said.</p>
<p>She touched on how race and gender played a part in music corporations overlooking some talented candidates.</p>
<p>“Many of the best creatives and business people, who although supremely qualified and talented, were turned down over and over as executives at major corporations because they were female or because of racial disparity. And I’ve been very proud to provide them with a place at my table. One of the main purposes of my art for many years has been dedicated to showing the beauty of Black people to the world, our history, our profundity and the value of Black lives. I’ve tried my best to pull down the veil of appeasement to those who may feel uncomfortable with our excellence,” she said.</p>
<p>“To the young women, our future leaders, know that you’re about to make the world turn. I see you. You are everything the world needs. Make those power moves. Be excellent. And to the young kings, lean into your vulnerability and redefine masculinity. Lead with heart. There’s so many different ways to be brilliant. I believe you and every human being is born with a masterful gift. Don’t let the world make you feel that you have to look a certain way to be brilliant. And no you don’t have to speak a certain way to be brilliant. But you do have to spread your gift around the planet in a way that is authentically you.”</p>
<p>“To all those who feel different. If you’re part of a group that’s called ‘other,’ a group that does not get the chance to be center stage, build your own stage and make them see you. Your queerness is beautiful, your blackness is beautiful. Your compassion, your understanding, your fight for people who may be different from you, is beautiful. I hope you continue to go into the world and show them that you will never stop being yourself. That it’s your time now, make them see you.”</p>
<p>The all-day celebration honored graduating seniors who were unable to have an in-person commencement ceremony due to the coronavirus pandemic. It also features words of encouragement from Barack and Michelle Obama, BTS and Lady Gaga, as well as musical performances from Chloe x Halle, Lizzo and the New York Philharmonic and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>“Dear Class of 2020” is just one of many virtual graduation ceremonies that have taken place to celebrate the class of 2020. Originally scheduled for June 6, “Dear Class of 2020” was rescheduled pushed back a day to honor the memorial service of George Floyd, who died on May 25 at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p>

The bad news earlier this year was that the 2020 edition of Download Festival would not be going on as scheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. But organizers of the annual Euro festival season staple worked quickly to find an alternative, and now have a virtual festival set to take place. Mark off June 12-14 for some prime rock and metal viewing, with many top acts taking part.</p>
<p>The Download TV weekend will be split into day and evening programming, with tailor made shows featuring Iron Maiden, System of a Down and KISS leading the way. KISS will headline the Friday (June 12) festivities, with a replay of standout moments from their huge 2015 headline set. Iron Maiden head up the Saturday (June 13) programming with nostalgic performances, &ldquo;Legacy of the Beast&rdquo; snippets, as well as &ldquo;something just for Download TV.&rdquo; And System of a Down get to close out the virtual festival on Sunday (June 14) with footage from their performances in 2005, 2011 and 2017.</p>
<p>Organizers have revealed their virtual lineup, which includes content from the following:</p>
