![Jacob Miller The Voice](https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/jacob-miller-the-voice-e1583800695330.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780)

Jacob Miller is one of the hopefuls who auditioned during the Blind Auditions phase of NBC’s singing-competition reality show _[The Voice.](https://www.heavy.com/tag/the-voice) _He sang “The Times They are A-Changin'” and earned a 3-chair turnaround.

Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson and Nick Jonas all turned around during [Jacob’s](https://www.instagram.com/jacobmiller/) audition with Nick being especially impressed with the young singer-songwriter. Nick offered to work with Miller closely saying that he’d love for Miller to collaborate with the Jonas Brothers, saying “Jacob Jonas” sounded pretty good.

Jacob joined Team Nick in the end, not being able to resist the idea of working closely with the Jonas Brother.

* * *

1\. Jacob is from Wisconsin
---------------------------

The singer-songwriter is from Eden, Wisconsin, but he currently resides in Portland, Oregon. According to [idolchatteryd](https://idolchatteryd.com/meet-jacob-miller-of-the-voice-season-18/), the popular reality show spoiler site, Jacob boarded an Amtrak with a suitcase and guitar in 2009 with “little idea of what my plan was – except to get out of that hometown mindset.”

He later went on a hitchhiking tour of North America. During the tour, he studied traditional music and spent time in the Appalachians and Blue Ridge Mountains.

He was away from home for over a year.

* * *

2\. He Started His Own Band
---------------------------

After [traveling the country](http://www.jacobmillermusic.net/about), Jacob started a band called Jacob Miller and the Bridge City Crooners. Together, they released four albums in between the years of 2012 and 2016. The band disbanded in 2017.

He [spent 7 years](http://www.jacobmillermusic.net/about) leading a jazz sextet performing internationally and throughout North America. Now, however, he focuses on a different type of storytelling and songwriting. According to his website, his “passion, voice, and laid-back demeanor create an intimate connection with audiences far and wide.”

Now, Jacob performs mostly minimalist pop and uses American traditional music as a jumping off point.

* * *

3\. He Released an Album in 2019
--------------------------------

Jacob released his debut record on June 6, 2019. The record, called _This New Home _shows off all of his abilities.

On the album, Jacob performed, wrote and composed songs. According to his website, the record was “recorded and performed entirely by Miller in a Portland home-turned-studio.”

The album is described as “honest and heartfelt.” It features ten tracks including “Take Me Home,” “Words We Didn’t Mean,” “Lifted,” “As I Am,” and “St. Mary’s Gospel Choir.”

Jacob Miller Sings Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are A-Changin'" – The Voice Blind Auditions 2020 [https://youtu.be/YBv4FxGcS6Y](https://youtu.be/YBv4FxGcS6Y) The Voice [http://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice](http://www.youtube.com/user/nbcthevoice)2020-03-10T00:40:52.000Z

Every coach but John Legend turned around and wanted Jacob to join their team. Nick asked if he was a songwriter, and the contestant replied that he usually only sings his own songs.

Nick tweeted after the audition ended, welcoming Jacob to the team, writing “Welcome to the family, Jacob! Hope you don’t mind brothers who don’t understand personal space. #VoiceBlinds.”

He told the coaches that he grew up on ragtime, early jazz music and folk music and that he was very inspired by those types of music. Kelly commented that most people now don’t know ragtime and may not be familiar with the genre and then offered to work with him to ragtime-ize modern songs to introduce more people to the art.

5\. Blake Shelton Told Him He Needs to Be Protective on ‘The Voice’
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After his audition, Blake told Jacob that he needed to protect himself from being experimented with while on the show.

“You have a very specific thing you do that you need to be protective of on this show,” Blake told him. “And you can’t be an experiment, and you can’t be pushed into things that don’t represent who you are.”

He went on to say he loved the fact that he played guitar while auditioned and complimented the way he just “rolled through” the track. John Legend also complimented him, though he did not turn his chair around initially.

In the end, Jacob joined Team Nick.
