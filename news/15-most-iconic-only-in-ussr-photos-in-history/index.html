<p>Believe it or not, but Soviet children really did sleep outdoors, even in winter. It was common practice in Soviet kindergartens, and widely considered a preventive measure against respiratory illnesses, as well as simply a good habit to have.</p>

<p>There was something often peculiar about late-Soviet photos - women wearing tall and thick fur hats. They wouldn’t part with the things - even indoors! Back then, it wasn’t surprising: they were a luxury item, like owning a Louis Vuitton bag today.

<p>Soviet fashion - like our government - was never of two minds about what a woman must look like, including what ‘calibre’ floral dresses to wear and what colors being acceptable to don during a daytime walk.

<h3 id="whos-flying-in-the-spacex-crew-dragon-meet-astronauts-bob-behnken-and-doug-hurley">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s flying in the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Meet astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.heraldtribune.com/storyimage/LK/20200519/NEWS/200518001/AR/0/AR-200518001.jpg" alt="img">
Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will break the nine-year drought on crewed flights from Kennedy Space Center on May 27.</p>
<p>It’s not every day that you get to see your husband fly to space. And it’s even more unusual when you can relate to that experience, as well.</p>
<p>But that’s what’s in store for NASA astronauts Megan McArthur and Karen Nyberg when their spouses, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, break the nine-year drought on crewed flights from Kennedy Space Center on May 27.</p>
<p>From the safe confines of KSC, McArthur and Nyberg, along with their sons, will watch as Behnken, 49, and Hurley, 53, blast off from pad 39A on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule for a historic mission to the International Space Station that will place them in the Astronaut Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>They will know the excitement running through Behnken&rsquo;s and Hurley&rsquo;s veins as they become the first astronauts to fly to space from U.S. soil since the shuttle program ended in 2011 and the first to command an entirely new spacecraft since the debut of the shuttle in 1981.</p>
<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s next launch will officially have astronauts on board</p>
<p>And yes, McArthur and Nyberg will know the dangers that come along with human spaceflight, too.</p>
<p>For Behnken and Hurley, the flight is a career-capping opportunity that&rsquo;s even more special because of their long-time friendship, which began when they joined the astronaut class in 2000.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, Behnken, who is from Missouri and Hurley, who is from New York, have developed a close bond. Not only were they military test pilots before becoming astronauts, they also met their future spouses in the same astronaut class and even attended each other&rsquo;s weddings. Hurley was Behnken&rsquo;s best man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man named Duane Ross was the lead for the astronaut selection process. In some sense, he picked my spouse for me; he picked my friends for me,&rdquo; Behnken told The Atlantic in 2019.</p>
<p>The close-knit astronaut couples, who currently reside in Houston, have learned to balance work and family while simultaneously dealing with the occasional spaceflight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That’s one of the things that is unique in our relationships: We have spouses that have the same job. If you even just look at our wedding planning, my wife and I were balancing space flights and a lot of stuff going on back here in Houston. Her flight got delayed a little bit and we found a window where we could get out to San Diego and have our wedding,&rdquo; Behnken told the magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doug and Karen have to work their personal life around their space flights. And same thing for us. I know what he&rsquo;s going through. We both have sons in elementary school; we&rsquo;re balancing the same challenges. That lets us predict how to best support each other as we work through pulling off our next space flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are not the only astronaut couples. Others like Rhea Seddon and Hoot Gibson, Bill and Anna Fisher, and Steve Hawley and Sally Ride, who were all part of the first shuttle astronaut class to include women, also got together when they were in the space program, according to Air &amp; Space Magazine.</p>
<p>Even the first woman in space, Russian Valentina Tereshkova, married fellow cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev, who became the third Russian to fly to space. They later divorced in 1980.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes it easier to get along (with other astronauts) because you come from similar backgrounds &hellip; and when you arrive as a brand new astronaut, you know a little bit about the astronauts who are already there,&rdquo; former space shuttle astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY.</p>
<p>This will be Behnken and Hurley&rsquo;s first spaceflight together, and it will be unlike past trips.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be in a capsule rather than a shuttle. They won&rsquo;t be wearing the traditional orange shuttle suits. And they won&rsquo;t head to the launch pad in the famous silver astronaut transfer van, or &ldquo;Astrovan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, on the day of launch, they&rsquo;ll don SpaceX&rsquo;s white-and-gray futuristic spacesuits and ride in Teslas — SpaceX CEO Elon Musk&rsquo;s other company — to the pad where they will pave the way for a new type of spaceflight: one where astronauts fly on commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Under NASA&rsquo;s Commercial Crew Program, SpaceX beat Boeing to be the first contender to fly astronauts to the station. This mission, dubbed Demonstration Mission 2 or Demo-2, is a historic milestone aimed at proving SpaceX can send humans safely to space.</p>
<p>Behnken and Hurley say it helps that both are seasoned astronauts familiar with launching from KSC. Behnken’s last flight was in 2010 aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour. Hurley’s was more recent: he piloted the final shuttle mission on Atlantis, taking off from pad 39A on July 8, 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think for both Doug and I, with our careers with the shuttles launching off the Florida coast, that&rsquo;s probably the thing that&rsquo;s very different from a mission perspective,&rdquo; Behnken told reporters during a video teleconference from Houston. &ldquo;When we launched on our first flight, it was kind of repeated to fly from the Florida coast, that was the normal thing, that&rsquo;s what we grew up with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have a different perspective of the importance of coming to Florida, launching again on an American rocket from the Florida coast and generations of people who maybe didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see a space shuttle launch, getting a chance again to see human spaceflight in our own backyard is pretty exciting to be a part of,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Dragon spacecraft is a capsule, more like the Russian Soyuz spacecraft and NASA&rsquo;s Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules from the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s.</p>
<p>Class of 2020: SpaceX, NASA want your photos. They&rsquo;ll fly them to International Space Station</p>
<p>And when they maneuver the capsule, the astronauts won’t be pulling a lever — they’ll be working with a touchscreen. That’s a first for Behnken and Hurley who are used to using a stick to fly a vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Growing up as a pilot my whole career, having a certain way to control the vehicles, this is currently different, but you know we went into it with a very open mind,&rdquo; Hurley said during the teleconference. &ldquo;The difference is that you&rsquo;ve got to be very deliberate when you&rsquo;re putting an input with a touchscreen relative to what you would do with a stick because when you&rsquo;re flying an airplane, for example, by pushing (the stick) forward, it&rsquo;s going to go down, (but now) I actually have to make a concerted effort to do that with a touchscreen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospect of putting Dragon through its paces as its first occupants is, in some ways, an astronaut’s dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you told us when we were students at test pilot school that we would get an opportunity not only to fly a new developmental aircraft, which we both were able to do while we were test pilots but then get to fly the first flight of a spaceship, I think we would have told you you were crazy,&rdquo; Hurley said.</p>
<p>Scott, who was a naval aviator before joining the astronaut class in 1992, admitted he wouldn’t mind flying on SpaceX’s vehicle if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as pilots, as test pilots, you always like to do something new. So these guys are going to be the first ones that pilot a brand new spaceship into space and dock with the International Space Station so I know they&rsquo;re very excited about that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In typical astronaut fashion, neither Hurley nor Behnken got too personal during NASA’s meet the crew virtual news conference. Their astronaut spouses didn&rsquo;t come up.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to look far to see excitement is building among those who know them best. Hurley’s wife, Nyberg, retweeted her husband&rsquo;s tweet of a drawing their young son Jack did of the capsule that will take his father to space. It included a fiery tail propelling the Dragon onward and a brightly colored Earth.</p>
<p>Our son’s version of Crew Dragon. I love it. pic.twitter.com/GIYRRMOXd4</p>
<p>— Col. Doug Hurley (@Astro_Doug) April 30, 2020</p>
<p>When the date for the Demo-2 launch was announced, Nyberg wrote on Twitter, &ldquo;It is fantastic to see a launch date for Crew Dragon Demo-2! Jack and I are so proud of (Doug) and are excited to support him through this historic mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyberg flew to space twice, including a long stay on the ISS in 2013 while Behnken’s wife, McArthur, flew on the final Hubble servicing mission in 2009.</p>
<p>Once Behnken and Hurley arrive at the space station, which is scheduled to occur within 24 hours after liftoff, they will be greeted by NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, who flew to the space station last month and is currently the only American on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be excited to see Bob and Doug,&rdquo; Cassidy told reporters last month. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known them for many years, we&rsquo;ve worked together, they&rsquo;re friends and with their families as well, so it&rsquo;ll be really special to have such a historic moment for our nation and such a cool personal event for me greeting them at the hatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassidy flew with Hurley on STS-127 in 2009 and then flew with Nyberg on their long-duration mission in 2013. As Nyberg said via Twitter, &ldquo;Flying with Chris is a family affair for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This historic launch doesn&rsquo;t come without a caveat, however.</p>
<p>Previously, the expectation had been nearly half a million people descending into Brevard County to watch this special occasion, but the coronavirus pandemic has changed plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally, the disappointing aspect of all of this pandemic is the fact that we don&rsquo;t have the luxury of our family and friends being there at Kennedy to watch the launch. But obviously, it&rsquo;s the right thing to do in the current environment,&rdquo; Hurley said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I would also say that the last five years for Bob and I working on commercial crew and then the last two specifically with SpaceX, it&rsquo;s been a long road to get here and I don&rsquo;t think either one of us would have predicted that when we were ready to go fly this mission that we would be dealing with this as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NASA has urged people to stay and watch the launch from home and will not provide the public access to KSC in an attempt to reduce crowds. But officials say they&rsquo;ll do everything else to ensure Americans recognize the importance of the moment of returning crewed spaceflight to U.S. soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect to fly again (and) I certainly didn&rsquo;t necessarily have a plan to fly again,&rdquo; Hurley said. &ldquo;Once again, I think Bob and I are very humbled to be in this position.&rdquo;</p>

By By Karen Graham May 26, 2020 in Technology SpaceX&rsquo;s Crew Dragon capsule - scheduled to launch two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station on May 27, will — if all goes well — become just the ninth space vehicle to carry humans into space in almost six decades of space flight. Four crewed vehicles to date have been American spacecraft, a point NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine emphasized in remarks made during a &ldquo;We think about Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and then space shuttle: Those are really the four times in history where we have put humans on brand new spacecraft, and now we&rsquo;re doing it for the fifth time,&rdquo; Bridenstine said, noting that it will be the ninth global flight of a new crewed spacecraft. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since we put humans on a brand new spacecraft, but that&rsquo;s what this is. And it is truly a test flight, to be very clear.&rdquo; So who is in this elite group of spacecraft that Crew Dragon will be joining? Let&rsquo;s take a quick journey through the company Crew Dragon will join. Vostok spaecraft de:Benutzer:HPH Vostok (USSR, 1961) Vostok 1launched from the Tyuratam (Baikonur Cosmodrome), U.S.S.R on April 12, 1961. This was Gagarin made just over one full orbit of Earth, perched atop a belt of life-support gas tanks, and a pyramidical instrument module that was jettisoned before the cabin reentered Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Gagarin could view the Earth by looking through a window at his feet. Vostok translates as &ldquo;East;&rdquo; Gagarin&rsquo;s capsule went by the call sign Swallow, according to NASA. Six Vostok capsules in all carried cosmonauts to orbit between 1961 and 1963. The final flight of the capsule on Friendship 7 at the National Air and Space Museum, 2009 HrAtsuo Mercury (the US, 1961) Project Mercury was born during the And while the Soviet Union beat us into orbit with Gagarin&rsquo;s flight; three weeks later, the U.S. launched astronaut Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight aboard the Freedom 7 capsule. A real Today the Mercury program is commemorated as the first American human space program. While it did not win the race against the Soviet Union, it gave back national prestige and was a scientifically successful precursor of later programs such as Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab. One little bit of trivia to go with the Mercury program - Mercury capsules had individual names beyond the series itself; others included Liberty Bell 7, Sigma 7, and Aurora 7. The final crewed Mercury capsule flew in 1963. This model depicts the Voskhod 2 Capsule in its deployed state. Fac-tory-o (CC BY-SA 4.0) Voskhod (USSR, 1964) The Voskhod capsule resembled the Vostok, but was designed to carry more than one crew member and later, allow for a spacewalk. To accomplish this, the USSR needed to squeeze several crewmembers into the small capsule. To accomplish that, spacecraft engineers ditched the ejection seat and replaced it with stable couches and a landing system, Believe it or not, but for the first crewed mission, three people were squeezed into the capsule, a pilot, a medical doctor, and a spacecraft engineer - and none of them wore a spacesuit. In 1965, as part of the final flight of Voskhod 2, two crew members were sent aloft in pressure suits on a 26-hour flight. One of those cosmonauts, Alexei Leonov, exited the inflatable airlock and spent about 12 minutes in space, becoming the first human to walk in space. This photograph of the Gemini 7 spacecraft was taken from Gemini 6 during rendezvous and station keeping maneuvers at an altitude of approximately 160 miles above the Earth. Gemini 6 and Gemini 7 launched on December 15, 1965 and December 4, 1965, respectively. NASA Gemini (the US, 1965) The Ten Gemini crews and sixteen individual astronauts flew low Earth orbit (LEO) missions during 1965 and 1966. All Gemini flights were launched from Launch Complex 19 (LC-19) at Cape Kennedy Air Force Station in Florida. The astronaut corps that supported Project Gemini included the &ldquo;Mercury Seven&rdquo;, &ldquo;The New Nine&rdquo;, and the 1963 astronaut class. The Gemini program was a vital link to the Apollo program, first conceived in early 1960 - NASA&rsquo;s plan to land a man on the moon. And each space flight got a little longer as crews learned to prepare for a lunar mission. By the time Gemini 7 came around, missions were stretching as long as 11 days to help scientists understand the consequences of lengthier spaceflights. The final mission, Gemini 12 - launched in November 1966 and included three separate spacewalks. It also included a successful docking maneuver with an uncrewed spacecraft. The Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft is seen docked to the International Space Station. The vehicle launched July 7, 2016 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. NASA Soyuz (USSR/Russia, 1967) The first crewed launch of a Soyuz capsule was way back in 1967, and a version is still flying today. Soyuz means &ldquo;union,&rdquo; and the USSR and Russia have developed a total of 10 different crewed Soyuz models over the decades. One thing has remained the same in all the variations of the Soyuz - they all adhere to a The Soyuz consists of a spheroid orbital module, which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission; a small aerodynamic reentry module, which returns the crew to Earth; and a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached, which contains the instruments and engines. The Soyuz spacecraft has been a real workhorse and has made nearly 150 crewed flights since the vehicle design was introduced. The vehicle also docked with an Apollo command module in 1975 to mark the end of the Cold War space race. And since the retirement of NASA&rsquo;s space shuttle in 2011, the U.S. has become dependent on Soyuz as a taxi service to the ISS. Bryan Erb lent that expertise to the development of a heat shield for the Apollo spacecraft’s command module, which protected the astronauts from extreme heat as they travelled through the Earth’s atmosphere on their return home. NASA Apollo/Lunar Module (the US, 1968) The one big difference in the Apollo crew module as compared to its predecessors was that it became more squatter, rather than cylindrical. It was designed to serve only as Apollo 1&rsquo;s first crew launch was supposed to be the start of the program in 1967, however, during a preflight test, a flash fire in the command module killed the mission&rsquo;s three crewmembers. The command module successfully flew with humans on board in 1968 on a mission called Apollo 7. Thirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earth&rsquo;s orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 - and half of them actually walked on the lunar surface. The last Apollo mission - Apollo 17 - occurred in December 1972, making it Apollo&rsquo;s last crewed Moon landing. Space shuttle Discovery NASA Space Shuttle (the US, 1981) With the end of the Apollo program in 1972, NASA would not launch another crewed vehicle until the early 1980s. This was the Space Shuttle. A total of five shuttles were built that gave the agency 135 crewed missions between 1981 and 2011. Just so you know, but the proper name for the space shuttle was the &ldquo;Space Transportation System.&rdquo; The Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital Of the five shuttles made, two were destroyed in horrible accidents. First, in January 1986, Challenger suffered an anomaly during launch; then, in February 2003, Columbia fell to pieces during reentry. In both cases, all seven astronauts were killed. China&rsquo;s Shenzhou vehicle line is one other space vehicle that has carried a human into space. The first crewed Shenzhou to fly launched in 2003 and made China the third country with the capability to launch humans to orbit. That flight carried one taikonaut, the Chinese term for an astronaut, who orbited for nearly a day. Crew Dragon&rsquo;s mission to the International Space Station will put the capsule right up there with an elite group of spacecraft that have carried hundreds of people into space - and it was all accomplished with just eight vehicles. Crew Dragon will be the ninth to carry passengers into space.Four crewed vehicles to date have been American spacecraft, a point NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine emphasized in remarks made during a May 1 news conference about the upcoming SpaceX launch, called Demo-2.&ldquo;We think about Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and then space shuttle: Those are really the four times in history where we have put humans on brand new spacecraft, and now we&rsquo;re doing it for the fifth time,&rdquo; Bridenstine said, noting that it will be the ninth global flight of a new crewed spacecraft. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since we put humans on a brand new spacecraft, but that&rsquo;s what this is.

This was the first spacecraft to carry a human, Yuri A. Gagarin, into space. There was so much concern over how a human would experience weightlessness that the manual controls on the spacecraft were locked prior to launch and the entire flight was under the control of ground personnel.Gagarin made just over one full orbit of Earth, perched atop a belt of life-support gas tanks, and a pyramidical instrument module that was jettisoned before the cabin reentered Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Gagarin could view the Earth by looking through a window at his feet.Vostok translates as &ldquo;East;&rdquo; Gagarin&rsquo;s capsule went by the call sign Swallow, according to NASA. Six Vostok capsules in all carried cosmonauts to orbit between 1961 and 1963. The final flight of the capsule on June 16, 1963 , carried Valentina Tereshkova, who became the first woman in space. She spent almost three days in space and orbited Earth 48 times in her space capsule, Vostok 6.Project Mercury was born during the Cold War Space Race , a series of competitive technology demonstrations between the United States and the Soviet Union, aiming to show superiority in spaceflight. In all, there were six crewed flights in the Mercury program.And while the Soviet Union beat us into orbit with Gagarin&rsquo;s flight; three weeks later, the U.S. launched astronaut Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight aboard the Freedom 7 capsule. A real crewed Mercury mission didn&rsquo;t reach orbit until John Glenn&rsquo;s flight in February 1962 aboard the Friendship 7 capsule.Today the Mercury program is commemorated as the first American human space program.

Each Space Shuttle orbiter was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life, although this was later extended.

<p><img src="https://freenews.live/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vladimir-Putin.jpg" alt="img">
Despite the “amendment” of Valentina Tereshkova, which will allow the current President of Russia Vladimir Putin to be elected to the post of head of state for a new term, he will not take this chance. Many experts both in the country and abroad are sure of this.</p>
<p>Of course, this amendment to the fundamental law made a lot of noise among the liberal-minded part of society and showed their “mean” essence to their own country. These “patriots” are ready to do anything to be in power with which they do not know what to do. They are, as always, confident that the West will tell them.</p>
<p>Of course, in any case, the decision will be made by Putin himself, perhaps after consulting with his inner circle, but it is too early to talk about this. Most likely, Mr. Putin is already thinking about his successor, but we will find out later.</p>
<p>Putin’s agreement to Tereshkova’s “amendment” is nothing more than a distraction designed to calm the country’s citizens in the current complicated international situation and stop the internal struggle between elites for a possible successor.</p>
<p>Despite all the difficulties faced by our country due to the global pandemic and the collapse of oil prices, no one cancels large-scale national projects and the “struggle” for the worthy place of the Russian Federation in the international arena.

The Soviet Union consisted of 16 republics, each of which had a unique local flavor, yet all of them were building communism together. What did it look like? Let’s take a look at the five Central Asian Soviet Socialist Republics: Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Turkmen, and Tajik.</p>
<p>Children</p>
<p>One of the main tasks facing the USSR was the elimination of illiteracy, and so, new schools, including those for adults, were set up all over the country. Tuition was in Russian and in local languages. Children were taught to love the Communist Party and Lenin from an early age. Many pioneers from Central Asia were awarded with visits to both the capitals of their republics and Moscow.</p>

<p>Collective farmers</p>
<p>Collectivization, i.e. the process of merging individual peasant farms into collective farms, was carried out in the Central Asian republics. People from all over the USSR poured into the region. They ploughed virgin lands and developed agriculture.</p>

<p>Workers</p>
<p>Central Asia was also the scene of major industrialization projects: building railways, factories, hydroelectric power stations and canals. Incidentally, local Stakhanovites invariably received recognition from Moscow – in the form of bonuses or feature stories about them in national papers and magazines.</p>

<p>Local flavor</p>
<p>The authorities in Moscow supported the development of local crafts and encouraged the production of ‘exotic’ items. Thanks to the Central Asian republics, residents of the central part of the USSR had the opportunity to buy carpets, which they loved hanging on walls, and to try delicious fruits. At the same time, the inhabitants of Central Asia enjoyed inventions by metropolitan designers, and listened to radio even in the steppe.</p>

<p>Architecture</p>
<p>Foreign travel was out of reach for most Soviet people, but many could still travel to other Soviet republics. For example, Muscovites could go on a trip to Alma-Aty or Tashkent. Many Central Asian cities had numerous preserved historical buildings, as well as new buildings erected in the Soviet modernist or constructivist style.</p>

<p>Agitprop</p>
<p>Many Central Asian place names were changed to Soviet ones. For example, the Kazakh city of Akmolinsk (present-day Nur-Sultan) in Soviet times was renamed Tselinograd (tselina means a virgin land). Meanwhile, Dushanbe, the capital of the Tajik Republic, was named Stalinabad. Every major city in Central Asia had a monument to Lenin, and many buildings were decorated with agitprop mosaics. Street names had the words Revolution, Gorky, and Peace in them – same as in many cities across the USSR.</p>

<p>Life</p>
<p>Soviet Asia was predominantly Muslim. As in the rest of the USSR, religion was suppressed and atheism promoted. Mosques were closed or even destroyed. However, the religious system was not dismantled completely. Official Muslim bodies, albeit fully controlled by the state. Praying was not forbidden, but, for example, workers were officially freed from the obligation to observe Ramadan fasting. Also, collecting money for the poor was banned because in the Soviet state there was no need for it.</p>

<p>The Kazakh Republic had numerous settlements for exiles: the Volga Germans and Crimean Tatars were resettled there by force. In addition, the republic had several Gulag camps on its territory, the most infamous of which was the so-called AZhIR, the Akmolinsk Camp for Wives of Traitors to the Motherland, where women were sent because their husbands had been convicted as “enemies of the people”.</p>
