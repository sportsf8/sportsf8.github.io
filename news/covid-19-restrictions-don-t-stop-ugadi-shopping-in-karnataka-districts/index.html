<p>Hundreds of people came out of their houses in several cities and towns across Karnataka on Tuesday to shop for Wednesday’s Ugadi festival despite the government’s lockdown orders to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Karnataka has reported there are 33 Covid-19 patients across the state and four people have recovered from the respiratory illness. One person has died, so far.</p>
<p>People in several districts including Bengaluru, Chikballapur, Mysore, Mandya and several other towns were seen shopping for the festival rather than staying at home.</p>
<p>Ugadi, or the beginning of the new year, is an important festival according to the Hindu calendar in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra. It is usually celebrated by tying mango leaves to house entrances, arches and eating a mixture of jaggery and neem leaves, said to symbolise both the sweet and the bitter experiences of life, after offering prayers.</p>
<p>Police also carried out a mild lathi-charge in several local flower and vegetable markets in Mandya, Mysuru and Chikkaballapur as a large number of people had gathered for shopping for the festivities.</p>
<p>Bengaluru Police commissioner Bhaskar Rao also said police would take the strictest action against those found deliberately violating the government’s orders to stay indoors.</p>
<p>“Am getting calls since 4 am that their service is essential…more essential than Corona..” he tweeted with an emoji of a smiley indicating the demands by several people to allow them to go ahead as usual in spite of government orders.</p>
<p>“Requesting citizens to ensure ‘stay indoor call’ is implemented. No threat of law but don your role of enlightened citizen. Nothing is more important than our life. Please do this for yourself,” he said in another tweet.</p>
<p>Several people from cities also travelled to their native villages to celebrate the festival.</p>
<p>Chief minister BS Yediyurappa has repeatedly appealed to citizens to avoid all non-essential and non-emergency travel to ensure that villages, which are largely unaffected by the coronavirus, remain so.</p>
<p>Yediyurappa also appealed to people to celebrate Ugadi at home by offering prayers and not going out. “If some defy the government order banning movement, the police will take action without any compunction according to law,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the free food at Indira canteens across Bengaluru has been stopped as hundreds thronged it defeating the purpose of maintaining social distance.

Ugadi is the Kannada New Year which is celebrated on the first day of the Hindu month of Chaitra according to the lunar-solar calendar. This auspicious day is celebrated with much pomp and cheer. People wear new clothes and have traditional meals. They offer prayers in temples and also perform multiple rituals to please the Gods and ask for a prosperous and good year ahead. Some people also visit each other&rsquo;s houses to wish them a happy new year. People also make rangolis and decorate their houses with flowers. Some even feed the poor on this auspicious day as an act to share happiness.</p>
<p>While Ugadi falls on different dates of the English calendar, this year it will be celebrated on March 25. It marks the beginning of Spring and the end of the cold wintry days. The festival is also celebrated all across India with different names. For example, in Maharashtra, it is known as Gudi Padwa and Naba Barsha in Bengal.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-lockdown-ugadi-celebrations-remain-a-low-key-affair">Coronavirus lockdown: Ugadi celebrations remain a low-key affair</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.yourstory.com/cs/2/b094ec506da611eab285b7ee8106293d/Ugadi-1585156421957.jpg?fm=png&amp;auto=format" alt="img">
The lockdown imposed in the wake of coronavirus outbreak dampened the celebrations of Ugadi festival. Ugadi is celebrated to usher in the New Year by people in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana.</p>
<p>Most celebrated the festival in a simple way within their homes.</p>
<p>While festivals are best enjoyed with family and friends, the lockdown forced people to keep it a low-key affair.</p>
<p>“Generally, Ugadi is celebrated in large groups with family and friends. However, because of the lockdown, we are celebrating it only with our immediate family members. The usual hype around the festival is missing. At the same time, we are worried about the prevailing situation. It doesn’t feel like a festival day,” said 27-year-old Jithendra Prasad M from Bengaluru.</p>

<p>Following a sharp increase in coronavirus cases in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a complete lockdown across the country for 21 days.</p>
<p>Missing out on delicacies</p>
<p>People faced difficulty in buying ingredients required to make delicacies for the festival. Roshni Balaji from Bengaluru says that a dish called Bevu-Bella is made as part of the celebrations. Bevu-Bella is made from six ingredients — raw mango, salt, neem leaves, jaggery, and green chilli — believed to signify different tastes of life and human emotions.</p>
<p>However, the dish-making tradition had to be skipped due to lack of availability of ingredients in the market. “We couldn’t make the dish since we could not get raw mangoes from the market. Overall, the festive mood was dim. But, it was necessary to tone it down and be responsible citizens,” Roshni said.</p>
<p>Praveen Kumar from Bengaluru said one of the major highlights of the festival is the previous day when everyone is out on roads shopping for new clothes and buying necessities, with family and friends. This was however not possible this time due to the lockdown.</p>
<p>Praveen added that the grim situation over the virus outbreak across the world discourages people to celebrate the festival in a happy manner.</p>
<p>While people managed to get flowers and fruits for the puja, delicacies had to be sacrificed due to the lockdown. Most festivals have their own special delicacies. The main Ugadi dish named ‘Holige’ had to be skipped at RT Nagar resident Pavana Praveen’s household due to non-availability of ingredients.</p>
<p>People across different states took to Twitter and other social media platforms to greet each other. Some people had to be content with puja alone and missed out on the larger festive fervour.</p>
<p>With initiatives such as staying at home and maintaining social distance, one hopes Ugadi brings safety and health for everyone.</p>
