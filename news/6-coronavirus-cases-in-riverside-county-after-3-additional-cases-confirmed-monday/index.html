Money Heist. La Casa De Papel, the Netflix hit show around the world. Making the world sing with its famous song Bella Ciao. There is no doubt that the show offers one of the best plots. Moreover, its fever around the world gives proof of it. The most awaited fourth season of the show released on 3rd of April. If you haven’t watched it yet then you better go and watch it first as this article is going to be full of spoilers.</p>
<p>Will There be a Fifth Season?</p>
<p>Well, obviously there will be another season. Although Netflix hasn’t announced it officially yet, we can be sure of it. It would just be unreasonable for the company to cancel it right now, as the heist hasn’t ended yet. We need a fifth season soon to know what happens next. I can say for sure that no one had anticipated that this heist would go for this long.</p>
<p>It is just a matter of time that Netflix announces the renewal of the show for the next season. We might hear about it in the coming month.</p>
<p>When Will The Next Season Release?</p>
<p>As of now, we cannot anticipate the release date. Once the show is renewed and the lockdown has ended we can predict a release date then. However, my gut says we might be getting it around the same time next year.</p>
<p>What Might Happen In The Next Season?</p>
<p>As you know, the heist hasn’t ended yet. However this time, things seem under control of the Professor. It sure did have a twist in the end but it isn’t much of a threat for the Professor. I guess it would be easy for the Professor to defeat a pregnant woman wanted by the police. Professor sure did play his moves well. Although who knows, what Alecia Sierra is capable of doing. The next season will mainly be about the escape of the crew. It might also have some fatalities.

The fans are expecting season 5 already. So here’s all we know about the future of the show.</p>
<p>Will There Be A Fifth Season?</p>
<p>Seeing the popularity of the show, it was obvious that there would be further seasons. However, it hasn’t been confirmed officially yet, sources have been giving unofficial confirmations. It is believed that season 5 is already underworking. Moreover, La Vanguardia, a Spanish newspaper published the news about the fifth season.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility of a sixth season. However, there’s not much on it but it has the possibility of happening. There’s also a distant possibility of a spin-off. Well, these do not come with a surprise as there is the scope of further seasons and spin-offs in the show.</p>
<p>What’s gonna happen in the most anticipated, Season 4?</p>
<p>We will surely see the ongoing heist end one way or the other. Chances are that it goes according to the Professor. However, it might feature the deaths of multiple characters, who might it be isn’t confirmed though. Well, seeing the trailer, things for Helsinki do not seem too bright. We might see him end up dead. Apparently Nairobi’s condition also doesn’t seem very good.</p>
<p>The main question here is, How are they going to escape? This is something that will be cleared up 3rd April.

<h3 id="who-is-nairobi-on-la-casa-de-papel">Who Is Nairobi on La Casa de Papel</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/albaflores-1585760363.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0983xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Season 4 of La Casa de Papel, a.k.a. Money Heist, hits Netflix on April 3.</p>
<p>Fans are on the edge of their seats after season 3&rsquo;s ending, which left us with a major cliffhanger about a fan favorite character, Nairobi. But who is the actress who plays her?</p>
<p>Ahead, meet Alba Flores, who opens up exclusively to OprahMag.com about how creator Álex Pina created the role of Nairobi especially for her. And as always: Beware of spoilers ahead.</p>
<p>La Casa de Papel, a.k.a. Money Heist, broke records last year when it became Netflix&rsquo;s most-watched non-English series around the globe. Three seasons have led viewers like me to become more and more attached to each character in the story of a gang of robbers who rebel against their government by pulling off intricate, high-level bank heists. If you ask any fan who their favorite character is, they will all likely have impassioned responses, from the nerdy teddy bear that is the crew&rsquo;s leader, El Profesor, to the eccentric yet lovable Berlín.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no question that there&rsquo;s a particularly rabid fan group behind one specific character: Nairobi, played by actress Alba Flores. Even Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny recently crooned about the single mom-turned-bank heister in his hit single, &ldquo;Yo Perreo Sola,&rdquo; with a lyric—loosely translated from Spanish—about wanting a &ldquo;bad girl&rdquo; like Nairobi.</p>
<p>In a cast portraying misfits who are quick to draw their guns on each other amidst temper tantrums, Flores&rsquo; character is the heart of the squad—and the only truly cool-headed person of the group. And that&rsquo;s exactly what made season 3&rsquo;s cliffhanger ending all the more stressful as we waited for months for season 4 to learn: Is Nairobi still alive?</p>
<p>In an interview at Netflix&rsquo;s headquarters in Madrid, Spain, last fall, Flores was coy with me about season 4 details, of course. But she did say: &ldquo;If you’re going to watch it, keep your tissues close to you. This season is tough—tougher than you think it will be at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&lsquo;If you like it, I can write a role for you.&rsquo; And that’s how Nairobi was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Madrid native shared a surprising tidbit with me: In the original script of La Casa de Papel/Money Heist, there actually wasn&rsquo;t a Nairobi. I know, I know. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the robbers without sweet, motivational Nairobi, but Flores explains that after working together on another Spanish show for Netflix, called Vis a Vis, La Casa de Papel/Money Heist creator Álex Pina offered to write a role for her for his new show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were writing the script for La Casa de Papel, and they realized that there was just one female character, Tokio. And they thought, &lsquo;This is not going to work,'&rdquo; Flores said. &ldquo;So he called me and asked if I wanted to come be on his new TV show and offered to send me the script for the first two episodes. He said, &lsquo;If you like it, I can write a role for you.&rsquo; And that’s how Nairobi was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Money Heist has since become an international smash hit, and Flores admits she&rsquo;s still adjusting to exactly how, um, dedicated viewers are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have fans around the entire world, from Spain to the U.S. to Thailand. There are people that have tattooed my face on their body!&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I was recently in the street and a teenage girl came to me and said, &lsquo;Please take a picture with me&hellip;I&rsquo;m so excited that I’m going to get your face tattooed on my arm.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Think about it for a few days, please! Not even my mother is going to do that!&rsquo; So somewhere, this girl has Nairobi&rsquo;s face on her arm forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But fame isn&rsquo;t new to the actress—who was born into a family well-known in Madrid—and La Casa de Papel is far from her first foray into TV and movies. Ahead, a few more fun facts about Alba Flores to read up on after you binge-watch Money Heist.</p>
<p>Where is Alba Flores from?</p>
<p>Given her character&rsquo;s name on Money Heist and her portrayal of a Romani woman on Vis a Vis, many fans often wonder about Flores&rsquo;s nationality in real life. The actress was born and raised in Madrid, Spain, the daughter Antonio Flores, a noted composer and musician with Romani roots. And her grandmother, Lola Flores, was a renowned flamenco singer and dancer nicknamed &ldquo;La Faraona,&rdquo; known for her over-the-top on-stage persona.</p>
<p>Flores in Vis a Vis, aka Locked Up. Netflix</p>
<p>What are Alba&rsquo;s other TV shows and movies?</p>
<p>Even before La Casa de Papel, Flores depicted another fan favorite character: Saray Vargas de Jesús, a Romani woman facing a five-year prison sentence in the series Vis a Vis, or Locked Up, another Netflix hit. Before then, she portrayed a Moroccan servant in the local Spanish drama series El tiempo entre costuras, as well as the police drama Cuéntame, before joining the cast of Vis a Vis in 2015.</p>
<p>Does she have a partner?</p>
<p>From her social media, it&rsquo;s clear the actress keeps her private life just that—private—so we don&rsquo;t know much about her relationship status. But while she admitted in our interview that she&rsquo;s a bit of a &ldquo;workaholic,&rdquo; she did share that in her personal life, she likes to find time for yoga and small theater projects with friends.</p>
<p>Where can I find her on Instagram?</p>
