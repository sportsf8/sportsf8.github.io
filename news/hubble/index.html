<p>Astronomers don&rsquo;t know exactly when the first stars formed in the Universe because they haven&rsquo;t been observed yet. And now, new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope suggest the first stars and galaxies may have formed even earlier than previously estimated.</p>
<p>Why? We <em>still</em> haven&rsquo;t seen them, even with the best telescope we&rsquo;ve got, pushed to its limits.</p>
<p>A group of researchers used Hubble to look back in time (and space) as far as it could see, hoping to study these first generation of stars of the early Universe, which are called Population III stars.</p>
<p>Hubble peered and squinted back to when the Universe was just 500 million years old – which is thought to be Hubble&rsquo;s limit — and found no evidence of these very first stars.</p>
<p>The name — Population III – is a little confusing. Shouldn&rsquo;t these first stars be called Population I stars? Let&rsquo;s face it, astronomers have never been great about naming things.</p>
<p>The name Population I had already been taken when astronomers classified the stars of the Milky Way as Population I (stars like the Sun, which are rich in heavier elements). Then, the name Population II was used to classify older stars in the Milky Way with a low heavy-element content.</p>
<p>And that left the name Population III to classify the stars that were forged from the primordial material that emerged from the Big Bang, approximately 13.8 billion years ago.</p>
<p>Population III stars must have been made solely out of hydrogen, helium and lithium, the only elements that existed before processes in the cores of these stars could create heavier elements, such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and iron.</p>
<p>Rachana Bhatawdekar of the European Space Agency led this most recent study, probing the early Universe from about 500 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>They studied the star cluster MACSJ0416 (see earlier comment about astronomers naming nomenclature) and the surrounding field with the Hubble Space Telescope, along with using supporting data from NASA&rsquo;s Spitzer Space Telescope and the ground-based Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory).</p>
<p>Illustration of the depth by which Hubble imaged galaxies in prior Deep Field initiatives, in units of the Age of the Universe. (NASA and Feild)</p>
<p>These observations were part of Hubble&rsquo;s Frontier Fields program, which observed six distant galaxy clusters from 2012 to 2017, and produced the deepest observations ever made of galaxy clusters and the galaxies located behind them.</p>
<p>This was achieved by using the gravitational lensing effect, where the masses of foreground galaxy clusters are large enough to bend and magnify the light from the more distant objects behind them. This allows Hubble to use these cosmic magnifying glasses to study objects that are beyond its nominal operational capabilities.</p>
<p>These observations revealed galaxies between 10 to 100 times fainter than any previously observed.</p>
<p>Bhatawdekar and her team developed a new technique that removes the light from the bright foreground galaxies that constitute these gravitational lenses.</p>
<p>This allowed them to discover galaxies with lower masses than ever previously observed with Hubble, at a distance corresponding to when the Universe was less than a billion years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found no evidence of these first-generation Population III stars in this cosmic time interval,&rdquo; said Bhatawdekar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results have profound astrophysical consequences as they show that galaxies must have formed much earlier than we thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since these observations are at the limits of Hubble, it puts one more task on the to-do list for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

NASA/ESA&rsquo;s Hubble Space Telescope has just captured a striking new image of a globular cluster some 44,000 light-years away from Earth and 13,000 light-years from the heart of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>NGC 6441 is a 13-billion-year-old collection of galaxies existing in the southern constellation of Scorpius, and is by far one of the largest and most luminous globular clusters in our regional galaxy. This vibrant cluster, one of 150 catalogued in the Milky Way, was initially discovered by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop (1793-1848) on May 13, 1826.</p>
<p>Dunlop was a renowned stargazer and in 1822 became the first person to observe the reappearance of Encke&rsquo;s comet — only the second incidence of a verified predicted return of a comet after the confirmation of Halley&rsquo;s Comet in 1758.</p>
<p>Hubble&rsquo;s dense composite image is formed using a range of filtered images of different wavelengths captured by Hubble’s Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), all drawn from the ultraviolet and optical bands of the full spectrum. Colors depicted are portrayed by assigning various hues to each monochromatic image snapped using individual filters.</p>

<p>NGC 6441 is a fertile starfield that is home to at least four millisecond pulsars, two of which are in binary star systems. It also hosts a rare planetary nebula called JaFu 2, one of only four planetary nebulae seen to reside in Milky Way globular clusters.</p>
<p>Hubble astronomers admit that the precise number of stars in such a concentrated cluster is hard to pin down, but have estimated that all together, its collection of stars weigh approximately 1.6 million times the mass of the Sun.</p>

<p>NASA/ESA&rsquo;s flagship low-Earth-orbit telescope is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, having first been launched via the space shuttle Discovery (STS-31) on April 24, 1990, then successfully deployed into orbit the next day. For three decades, it has provided a window into the heavens by photographing galactic objects and celestial bodies while delivering a reliable, long-term space research facility for all aspects of optical astronomy.</p>
<p>The Hubble is named after astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble (1889–1953), a pioneering scientist who made some of the most relevant discoveries in the history of modern astronomy, including the novel idea of multiple galaxies existing in the Milky Way, and the determination in 1929 that the more distant a galaxy is from Earth, the faster it appears to move away.</p>

One of the many profound questions about the birth of the universe is when the first stars and galaxies formed in the cooling aftermath of cosmic creation.</p>
<p>Those presumably massive first-generation population III stars must have been composed of the hydrogen, helium and trace amounts of lithium and beryllium, the only elements forged in the initial fireball. But no population III stars have ever been observed, possibly because they all exhausted their nuclear fuel long ago and only remnants remain today.</p>
<p>But that still leaves the question of when they first formed and what effect they had on the surrounding interstellar medium. A team of European astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope, data from NASA’s now-retired Spitzer Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope to study low-mass galaxies dating back to between 500 million and 1 billion years after the Big Bang.</p>
<p>To detect those faint galaxies, the team studied six remote galaxy clusters with Hubble’s Wide Field Planetary Camera 3 and the Advanced Camera for Surveys. The combined mass of the galaxies within each cluster acts as a gravitational lens, magnifying the light from even more remote background galaxies. The observations, carried out between 2012 and 2017, are among the deepest ever made, revealing galaxies 10 to 100 times fainter than any previously seen.</p>
<p>“We found no evidence of these first-generation population III stars in this cosmic time interval” said Rachana Bhatawdekar of the European Space Agency.</p>
<p>Such stars and the first galaxies must have formed even earlier than previously believed. The many observed low-mass galaxies suggests those galaxies may have produced the radiation needed to reionise the universe, breaking neutral hydrogen atoms apart and ending the so-called dark ages that followed the Big Bang.</p>
<p>“These results have profound astrophysical consequences as they show that galaxies must have formed much earlier than we thought,” Bhatawdekar said. “This also strongly supports the idea that low-mass/faint galaxies in the early Universe are responsible for reionisation.”

NASA/ESA’s Hubble Space Telescope Makes Surprising Find in Early Universe</p>
<p>By Space Coast Daily // June 6, 2020</p>
<p>exploration of first galaxies remains a significant challenge in modern astronomy</p>
<p>(NASA) – New results from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope suggest the formation of the first stars and galaxies in the early universe took place sooner than previously thought.</p>
<p>A European team of astronomers have found no evidence of the first generation of stars, known as Population III stars, as far back as when the universe was just 500 million years old.</p>
<p>The exploration of the very first galaxies remains a significant challenge in modern astronomy. We do not know when or how the first stars and galaxies in the universe formed.</p>
<p>These questions can be addressed with the Hubble Space Telescope through deep imaging observations. Hubble allows astronomers to view the universe back to within 500 million years of the big bang.</p>
<p>A team of European researchers, led by Rachana Bhatawdekar of ESA (the European Space Agency), set out to study the first generation of stars in the early universe. Known as Population III stars, these stars were forged from the primordial material that emerged from the big bang.</p>
<p>Population III stars must have been made solely out of hydrogen, helium, and lithium, the only elements that existed before processes in the cores of these stars could create heavier elements, such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and iron.</p>
<p>Bhatawdekar and her team probed the early universe from about 500 million to 1 billion years after the big bang by studying the cluster MACS J0416 and its parallel field with the Hubble Space Telescope (with supporting data from NASA’s Spitzer Space Telescope and the ground-based Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory).</p>
<p>“We found no evidence of these first-generation Population III stars in this cosmic time interval,” said Bhatawdekar of the new results.</p>
<p>The result was achieved using the Hubble Space Telescope’s Wide Field Camera 3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys, as part of the Hubble Frontier Fields program.</p>
<p>This program (which observed six distant galaxy clusters from 2012 to 2017) produced the deepest observations ever made of galaxy clusters and the galaxies located behind them which were magnified by the gravitational lensing effect, thereby revealing galaxies 10 to 100 times fainter than any previously observed.</p>
<p>The masses of foreground galaxy clusters are large enough to bend and magnify the light from the more distant objects behind them. This allows Hubble to use these cosmic magnifying glasses to study objects that are beyond its nominal operational capabilities.</p>
<p>Bhatawdekar and her team developed a new technique that removes the light from the bright foreground galaxies that constitute these gravitational lenses.</p>
<p>This allowed them to discover galaxies with lower masses than ever previously observed with Hubble, at a distance corresponding to when the universe was less than a billion years old.</p>
<p>At this point in cosmic time, the lack of evidence for exotic stellar populations and the identification of many low-mass galaxies supports the suggestion that these galaxies are the most likely candidates for the reionization of the universe. This period of reionization in the early universe is when the neutral intergalactic medium was ionized by the first stars and galaxies.</p>
<p>“These results have profound astrophysical consequences as they show that galaxies must have formed much earlier than we thought,” said Bhatawdekar.</p>
<p>“This also strongly supports the idea that low-mass/faint galaxies in the early universe are responsible for reionization.”</p>
<p>These results also suggest that the earliest formation of stars and galaxies occurred much earlier than can be probed with the Hubble Space Telescope.</p>
<p>This leaves an exciting area of further research for the upcoming NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope — to study the universe’s earliest galaxies.</p>
<p>These results are based on a previous 2019 paper by Bhatawdekar et al., and a paper that will appear in an upcoming issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS).</p>
<p>These results are also being presented at a press conference during the 236th meeting of American Astronomical Society.</p>
<p>The European team of astronomers in this study consists of R. Bhatawdekar and C.J. Conselice.</p>
<p>The Hubble Space Telescope is a project of international cooperation between NASA and ESA (European Space Agency). NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, manages the telescope.</p>
<p>The Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore conducts Hubble science operations. STScI is operated for NASA by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy in Washington, D.C.</p>
