<p>NEW DELHI: Denim brand Numero Uno has forayed into personal protective equipment (PPE) category with the launch of face masks. The company has taken the initiative of recycling the existing fabric and reusing it by way of reusable and washable masks as face protection becomes a new way of life during the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>Though not a replacement for medical-grade masks, these masks are moulded with a triple layer protection. The outer layer is made with fine cotton that filters large particles, mid layer of polyspun fibers that filters the fine particles and the inner layer of soft cotton which is gentle on skin to extend all-day comfort. Antimicrobial treatments have been given to the fabric for added protection. The ergonomic face shape given to the mask gives maximum face coverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea to launch face protection gear came up because of the customer demand. Protection is a big concern with everybody. Most of the masks available at the pharmacies are non-woven which wasn&rsquo;t very convincing for customers. It is not a medical mask but it provides protection from dust, pollution and microbes present in the air including viruses, &quot; said Manjula Gandhi, chief product officer, Numero Uno.</p>
<p>The brand has used unused fabric to create this range during the lockdown. This also gave employment opportunities to our staff who created this range in compliance with the staggered workforce norms. Numero Uno said this launch was also a way to connect with customers.</p>
<p>To stand out from other face mask options available in the market, the brand will leverage innovative design to create multi-purpose masks.</p>
<p>Young consumers are looking for face protection options which offer both comfort and style, said Gandhi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We intend to create multi purpose face protection which will offer convenience and protection benefits. These could be design innovations to combine face protection mask with neck warmers or head band. It could be double up as a fashion accessory and be worn in different ways,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Priced at ₹299, the masks will be available at brand&rsquo;s retail outlets, Shoppers Stop as well as e-commerce platforms.</p>
<p>A clutch of fashion brands such as Allen Solly, Peter England, Zodiac shirts and Fabindia have started creating designer and matching masks with shirts as covering one&rsquo;s face becomes the new normal during the covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Recently, homegrown outdoor and tactical gear firm Wildcraft India Pvt Ltd has forayed into manufacturing and distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) including hazmat suits, respirator masks and face shields with the aim to equip and enable health workers as well as consumers to stay safe amidst coronavirus outbreak.</p>

<h3 id="the-7-softest-t-shirts">&ldquo;The 7 softest T-shirts&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/6/15/a4a475ca-a825-4e06-8ec4-78cbffdee8be-softest_tshirts_men.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;fm=jpg" alt="img">
Button-down shirts may have dominated the work attire game for years, but now that working from home is slowly becoming the norm, you’re looking at a new WFH uniform: the softest T-shirts imaginable. According to a two-year study out of Stanford, you’re actually more productive working from home than you are at the office, so you may as well be working in comfort. Plus, a high-quality tee (versus an ancient one you&rsquo;d wear to the gym) helps you feel slightly more put-together so you can get into a professional mindset.</p>
<p>In terms of fabrics to consider, cotton is great because it’s strong, soft, and breathable. Supima cotton is the first-class version: it’s literally the one percent of cotton, with premium extra-long staple fibers for top-of-the-line softness and staying power. But regular cotton will get the job done just fine, too, if you’re on a budget. Rayon is soft and ideal if you like thinner tees, and washable merino wool is way more versatile than you might think, delivering itch-free, moisture-wicking, insulating-yet-breathable comfort, so it’s great to have on-hand for days of endless Zoom calls or wilderness hikes. Whatever material you prefer, the seven soft T-shirts below are WFH-approved.</p>
<ol>
<li>A quality Supima cotton tee that won’t break the bank</li>
</ol>
<p>Supima is about as top-shelf as cotton gets but this high-quality tee is actually affordably priced, for an über-nice staple that will net you a ton of mileage. It&rsquo;s blended with a hint of spandex for stretch, and since it&rsquo;s machine washable, it&rsquo;s a low-maintenance basic. It also comes in a broad range of sizes up to 4X. If you prefer a crew neckline, make sure to check out the brand&rsquo;s Supima cotton crewneck tee. Either way, Amazon reviewers praised it on fit and comfort, with one commenting, &ldquo;It has been one of the best T&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve owned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Available colors: 5</p>
<p>Available sizes: X-Small – 4X-Large</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>This white henley tee that doesn’t look like an undershirt</li>
</ol>
<p>A plain white T-shirt can run the risk of looking like an undershirt on a Zoom call, so the button-down placket here signals “Yes, I changed out of pajamas.” The cotton-polyester blend in this henley T-shirt is pre-washed for added softness and lightweight but with some heft. You might want it in more than one color. &ldquo;After leaving it in the dryer overnight, it still had no wrinkles. Will be buying more,&rdquo; noted one shopper.</p>
<p>Available colors: 6</p>
<p>Available sizes: Small – 3X-Large</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>A loose-fitting v-neck in an affordable two pack</li>
</ol>
<p>This V-neck tee has an easygoing fit that&rsquo;s perfect for WFH life and a tagless design so you’re totally comfortable. The solid-hued shirts are made from 100% cotton, while the heathered options have polyester blended in. Both come in wallet-friendly twin-packs &ldquo;At this price I thought I&rsquo;d be replacing them every few months, but these shirts may last my entire career,&rdquo; a reviewer commented. &ldquo;Nice thick fabric, very soft, very comfy.&rdquo; Plus, they&rsquo;re machine washable.</p>
<p>Available colors: 15</p>
<p>Available sizes: X-Small – XX-Large</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>This preshrunk crewneck tee that comes in more than 60 colors</li>
</ol>
<p>This 100% cotton jersey tee has a lot of really nice details for the affordable price. The fabric is ring-spun (which means it feels ultrafine and soft) with a sturdy double-stitched hem and sleeves. There’s a tearaway tag and the shoulders have a forward set for a better fit, especially when you’re hunched over a desk. And it’s preshrunk, so you won’t have to give it to your nephew after a stint in the dryer. Like the tees above, the heathered and antique colors here have a bit of polyester.</p>
<p>Available colors: 63</p>
<p>Available sizes: X-Small – 4X-Large</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>An organic merino wool tee that comes with socks</li>
</ol>
<p>This merino wool tee looks super polished but feels like pajamas, and packs outdoor performance tech into a piece you’ll want to wear every day. It’s made from organic New Zealand wool that’s lightweight with natural temperature-regulating and moisture-wicking power. It comes with a pair of socks that have built-in arch support – and everything can be run through the washer and dryer. Since it’s a base layer, it’s meant to fit a little snug. Size up if you want more give. One reviewer noted, &ldquo;These shirts are a great alternative to cotton T-shirts in that they provide a bit of warmth, breathe well, and feel good against the skin (NO itch).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Available colors: 7</p>
<p>Available sizes: Small – X-Large</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>A set of lightweight tees that feel like a second skin</li>
</ol>
<p>If thinner tees are your jam, you have to try this set in a soft bamboo rayon with a hint of spandex. (You’ll also see it labeled as modal here, which is just another type of rayon.) These ultra-soft tees are sewn with flat seams you’ll barely feel, and a tag-free design. Reviewers especially liked them as undershirts or sleep shirts. Other options on the page come in Supima cotton and nylon mesh blends.</p>
<p>Available options: 15</p>
<p>Available sizes: S – XL</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>This long-sleeved tee with a pocket</li>
</ol>
<p>A soft, lightweight long-sleeved cotton tee is a go-to piece for any time of year. It&rsquo;s made from 100% cotton and has a slimmer fit with a pocket so there’s no mistaking it for a sweatshirt. The thinner cotton layers well but won’t overheat you when temperatures rise. Plus, there’s no tag, either. &ldquo;Really good soft material. Repeated washings hold up great. My only complaint is that I wish that the pocket was deeper,&rdquo; a shopper noted.

<h3 id="where-to-buy-a-face-mask-the-best-face-coverings-to-buy-online">&ldquo;Where to buy a face mask: the best face coverings to buy online&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/09/15/best-face-masks-and-coverings-to-buy-online.jpg" alt="img">
Ministers have announced that it will be mandatory to wear facial masks and coverings when using public transport from June 15.</p>
<p>That means if you use trains, tubes, trams, ferries, planes or buses, you must cover your nose and mouth to help contain the spread of coronavirus. Those without an adequate face covering could be refused travel on public transport and may even face a fine.</p>
<p>Many people have already been wearing masks for walks or to shop for groceries, but now it&rsquo;s official - and there’s more choice than ever.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between medical masks and face coverings?</p>
<p>Not to be mistaken for clinical medical grade face masks (or PPE), which NHS staff and frontline workers still need to stay safe, facial masks and coverings are typically made from cloth and elastic and sometimes feature a removable filter so that you can change it to keep it working effectively.</p>
<p>Buying reusable cloth masks for personal use ensures that supplies of clinical PPE are there and remain stable for the people who really need them.</p>
<p>What’s the point of wearing a face mask?</p>
<p>Despite advice at the beginning of the pandemic, the government is now advocating the use of face masks. This is so that the mask can catch as many water droplets as possible containing coronavirus to reduce the chances of others from catching it. Even if you don’t show symptoms, you could still be a spreader.</p>
<p>You’ll still need to wash hands thoroughly and use hand sanitiser, but wearing a mask is an additional measure we all can take to help slow the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>The most unlikely accessory of 2020</p>
<p>Cast your mind back to January 1 of this year: if we had told you we would all be wearing masks by mid-June you may have thought we’d lost the plot. But just like those awkward Zoom calls, social distanced park picnics and takeaway pints from some pubs, face masks are now just another symbol of the strange, strange times we’re living in.</p>
<p>How to properly wear a facial covering or mask</p>
<p>There’s slightly more to it than simply bunging it on. Here are a few do’s and don’t’s from Gov.UK to wearing a mask as safely as possible.</p>
<p>Do make sure your mask or covering is enclosing your mouth and nose while still allowing you to breathe comfortably.</p>
<p>Do wash your hands thoroughly or use hand sanitiser before putting it on and after taking it off.</p>
<p>Don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth when you’re wearing one - tuck away loose ends and hair so you’re not tempted to brush it away.</p>
<p>Do keep your mask safely stored in a plastic bag until you have a chance to wash them.</p>
<p>Don’t touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Once removed, do make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched, such as the lower half of your face.</p>
<p>Do wash your mask regularly - most can go in with your normal load, using your regular detergent or washing machine gels.</p>
<p>​Safe and stylish</p>
<p>While Gov.UK has released a DIY guide to making a mask at home, entrepreneurs and retailers have launched stylish mask collections designed to keep you safe.</p>
<p>Facial masks are undeniably for safety first, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have fun with them too.</p>
<p>We’ve found cool prints, bold designs and designer styles, all available to shop online, to keep you protected - while looking as good as possible.</p>

By JERRY SAMPSON</p>
<p>Question: Good Morning Jerry, I was interested in getting an appraisal done on an antique doll that has been passed down to me from my great-grandmother. Is that something you are possibly capable of doing?</p>
<p>My mother told me it held quite a bit of value but I do not know much about it. I have tried to do research on it but I do not know much about antique dolls. Currently would like to just know the value of it.</p>
<p>Answer: What a sweet face she has. I get a lot of questions about dolls, and frankly, most are just newer “collectible” dolls.This is certainly an older doll.</p>
<p>You have a Hertwig &amp; Company doll. Hertwig had a long German history. Hertwig &amp; Company was founded by Christoph Hertwig and Johann and Benjamin Beyermann. They produced porcelain and earthenware objects in their factory in Katzhütte, Thuringen, Germany from 1864 to 1941.</p>
<p>Of course, the year 1941 is important, as virtually every German factory was destroyed after WWII. The company ceased production at that time.</p>
<p>Doll head production was first mentioned in 1884. They were famous for their line of snow babies — these are the old snow babies and NOT the modern versions and Nanking dolls, which is what you have.</p>
<p>Nanking dolls have tightly stuffed cloth bodies. The name Nanking, comes from a type of finely woven cotton fabric that was imported from Nanking, China, hence the nickname</p>
<p>Your head is what’s called a “character” doll. With her flower bonnet, she was part of a line of dolls that were created around flowers.</p>
<p>She dates to about 1900. So, she was new when she was given to your great-grandmother. It’s a nice doll but not a great one. Sadly, someone re-dressed her in the 1960s in a modern fancy dress.</p>
<p>You can tell this by the use of an over the top style, and just cheap fabric. The doll market is so soft for average dolls. However, the really, really fine and blue chip dolls tend to hold some of their value.</p>
<p>She has such a pretty face. I hope you enjoy her because she was treasured by your great-grandmother.</p>
<p>In this market and being re-dressed, it might be priced in a retail store, for about $50. Thanks for sharing her with us.

<h3 id="james-halliday-collection-his-rarest-wines-in-once-in-a-lifetime-auction">&ldquo;James Halliday Collection: His Rarest Wines In Once-In-A-Lifetime Auction&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.bosshunting.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6965d343376988cb0daae8451cb5b6d6.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Australia’s most prolific wine authority, James Halliday, is auctioning off a very rare segment of his 12,000-bottle strong wine collection in what can only be described as a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity.</p>
<p>Brokered by fine wine auction house Langton’s, the wines in question today are 252 bottles of Domaine de la Romanée-Conti pinot noir (commonly referred to as DRC). Widely regarded as one of the rarest and finest drops of its grape variety in the world, the few hundred bottles are collectively valued at AU$1 million – that’s an average of almost $4,000 a bottle. The oldest example is a 1973 vintage.</p>
<p>Domaine de la Romanée-Conti’s vines have been harvested from the same 4.5-acre property in Burgandy, France, since the year 1232. In its current form, a few additional plots of pinot and chardonnay grapes have been added and the winemaking process is revered across the industry resulting in unfermented, filtration-free, and biodynamic world-class wines.</p>
<p>If you can’t compete with the elite during the auction of each individual bottle, then we’ve got some good news for you. One bottle of 2006 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Échezeaux has been set aside for a charity raffle; the proceeds of which will go towards the Humpty Dumpty Foundation, a non-profit providing medical equipment to 400 children’s hospitals and health services around the country.</p>
<p>“Rising 82, [there’s] no way I’m going to drink them,” says Halliday in a promotional video by Langton’s.</p>
<p>“I want to share these wines with people who understand what these wines are and what they stand for.”</p>
<p>The 252 bottles of the James Halliday collection were purchased via Christie’s auctions, Negociants (DCR’s Aussie distributor), and from Domaine itself.</p>
<p>Bidding closes for the main event at 7 PM AEST on June 28, with the 2006 Domaine de la Romanée-Conti Échezeaux raffle closing two days prior on June 26. Tickets can be purchased in lots of 1, 10, and 50.

<h3 id="plant-based-materials-catch-on-with-home-goods-designers">&ldquo;Plant-based materials catch on with home-goods designers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1578508940" alt="img">
With an eye toward sustainability, makers of home furnishings are experimenting more and more with plant-based materials. You can find things like bark, leaves and seeds transformed into vegan leather, fabric and organic plastic.</p>
<p>At Frankfurt&rsquo;s Heimtextil 2020 trade fair earlier this year, for example, there were lots of examples. Swiss company Qwstion showed its Bananatex, a sturdy, waterproof yet biodegradable cloth woven from Philippine abaca banana-plant fiber. It&rsquo;s being used to make totes and bags.</p>
<p>Dutch designer Nienke Hoogvliet weaves seaweed into rugs, chairs and tables in her Sea Me Collection. She also dyes organic linen using herbs like rosemary, sage and chamomile.</p>
<p>Various design studios are developing bio-laminates, laminated materials composed of plant starch and fibers that can be made into tabletops and other furniture.</p>
<p>East African mutuba fig bark, a fleecy material used by Ugandan craftspeople for generations, is sustainably harvested and processed by Barktex into a pliable, leather-like material that can be used to dress walls and furniture.</p>
<p>Another African company, Green-Nettle Textile in Kenya, harvests the nettles that grow on the country&rsquo;s steep hillsides. Besides being transformable into a linen-like fabric, the drought-tolerant nettle crops help curb soil erosion in areas not suitable for agriculture.</p>
<p>Latvian-born designer Sarmite Polakova turned her studies in material research at Design Academy Eindhoven in the Netherlands into the development of a leather-like material harvested from fresh tree bark. She doesn&rsquo;t use live trees, but gets the bark from harvested timber. Called PineSkins, the textured strips are woven into objects like baskets and mats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project gives the bark new purpose,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It becomes a living extension of the tree long after the wood has been cut in pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In London, designer Nathalie Spencer gathers pineapple leaves discarded by juice bars and produce markets and spins the silky fibers into a fine, wool-like fabric.</p>
<p>In Mexico, designer Fernando Laposse has partnered with CIMMYT, a nonprofit agricultural research and training organization focused on corn and wheat crops. He has worked with a village of Mixtec farmers and herders to transform waste from these plants into furniture. The corn&rsquo;s kernels and husks come in hues of cream, deep red, pink, black and purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What my project tries to do is visualize the diversity of corn that we have in my home country,&rdquo; says Laposse.</p>
<p>He has contracted with local women to prepare and trim the husks into a veneer-like marquetry material for his pieces, which include tables, wall panels and accessories. The husks are flattened and backed with paper pulp before being cut into shapes.</p>
<p>Corn kernels are being processed in the United States by San Francisco-based Gantri into a biodegradable thermoplastic fiber called PLA that can be formed into a sturdy vegan plastic. Gantri&rsquo;s founder Ian Yang says the material can be treated in different ways to be translucent or opaque, and is being used to make contemporary wall, floor and table fixtures.</p>
<p>During Dutch Design Week in Eindhoven last fall, set designer Pascal Leboucq collaborated with Krown Design studio on a temporary pavilion made of timber, mycelium fiber and cattails.</p>
<p>In southeast London, Sebastian Cox has worked with design researcher Ninela Ivanova on light fixtures made of mycelium, or mushroom fiber. The material is blended with wood fibers to create textural pieces. Also in London, studio Nir Meiri is making rustically elegant lampshades out of both mycelium and red cabbage leaves.</p>
<p>Got Tencel bedding at home? You&rsquo;re actually sleeping on a material made of eucalyptus fibers. The material is being used in bedding because it is soft, wrinkle-resistant and has temperature-moderating properties. (See PB Teen&rsquo;s Amelia pintucked duvet cover set.)</p>
<p>Hemp is another popular fiber in the textile market. Although not as soft as cotton, hemp is durable, and its production involves about half the amount of water as cotton&rsquo;s. Like linen, continued washing will soften the material over time. West Elm recently launched a hemp bedding collection that&rsquo;s gently tinged with natural plant dyes.
