<p>Back in March, Stewart, 31, confirmed on Instagram Live that she was dating McGraw for about three months, revealing the duo had previously dated a decade ago.</p>

I don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo; And then I went on obviously to have another relationship and then the past year we got back together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2016, Stewart married her former ‚ÄúRich Kids of Beverly Hills‚Äù co-star Brendan Fitzpatrick. They split in August 2019, with Stewart officially filing for divorce two months later.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBrendan and I have spent six wonderful years together, but we have made the difficult decision to go our separate way,&rdquo; she wrote at the time on Instagram. ‚ÄúI wanted to take the time to clarify that our reason for separating has nothing to do with anything other than two people who sadly grew apart, deciding what‚Äôs best for themselves in the next phase of their lives.‚Äù</p>
<p>She continued, ‚ÄúThank you from the bottom of my heart for the extremely heartfelt and supportive messages so many of you have sent ‚Äî they have meant the world to me. I will always have a tremendous amount of love and respect for Brendan and our relationship.‚Äù</p>

<p>He also gushed on his son&rsquo;s Instagram post over the news as well, writing, &ldquo;Jordan so happy and proud for you and so thrilled that Morgan is going to be part of the family! Good job on that ring!!&rdquo;

<p>This June, E! turns 30! To celebrate we&rsquo;re looking back at the most monumental moments in pop culture.</p>
<p>They are the rich and popular!</p>
<p>At the start of 2014, E! viewers were introduced to Beverly Hills&rsquo; wealthy, young elite through a new docu-series, #RichKids of Beverly Hills. Through the reality show, we got a first-hand look at how those in the world&rsquo;s most famous zip code really spent their time.</p>
<p>Whether they were boarding a private plane or popping champagne with a Mr Chow meal, the #RichKids gang‚Äîwhich included, at different times, Dorothy Wang, Morgan Stewart, EJ Johnson, Brendan Fitzpatrick, Jonny Drubel, Roxy Sowlaty, Taylor-Ann Hasselhoff and Bianca Espada‚Äîknew how to live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>The show wrapped in 2016 and, thus, we&rsquo;re curious to know what the #RichKids (now adults) are up to these days.</p>
<p>In honor of E!&lsquo;s 30th anniversary, we&rsquo;re taking a look back at the cast then and giving an update on what they&rsquo;re up to now.

Kanye West never fails to hit the headlines for something outrageous, controversial, or all-out eyebrow-raising. In fact, he may be famous for his chart-topping music and marriage to Kim Kardashian, but the star seems to stir up more attention because of anything except for his music career.</p>
<p>And now he‚Äôs back with some pretty big news. A presidential bid!</p>
<p>Keep scrolling to learn more.</p>
<p>Did you know that Kanye West was besties with Elon Musk? via: Getty Images Because I didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ But while I‚Äôm still confused about the new picture Kanye posted, I also almost expected it from a man like him.</p>
<p>Because Kanye has been known for his crazy antics‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images Since the early 2000s, the rapper has become one of the biggest names in the music industry.</p>
<p>Kanye was born in Atlanta in 1977. via: Getty Images And after being raised in Chicago, he kicked off his career by working as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, producing singles for artists such as Jay-Z and Alicia Keys.</p>
<p>Though he was always intent on pursuing a solo career‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images He began experimenting with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration in 2005 and Graduation in 2007.</p>
<p>The rapper has gone on to release numerous albums‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images These include My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy in 2010, Yeezus in 2013, The Life of Pablo in 2016, Ye in 2018, and Jesus is King in 2019.</p>
<p>Kanye‚Äôs music isn‚Äôt the only reason he‚Äôs so famous‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images Kanye met Kim Kardashian back in 2003, but they didn‚Äôt rekindle until October of 2011 ‚Äì a mere few weeks after Kim divorced Kris Humphries after a seventy-two-day marriage.</p>
<p>But it seems that Kim and Kanye are the real thing‚Ä¶ The couple got married in Italy in 2014 and they have since had 4 children together ‚Äì North, Chicago, Saint, and Psalm.</p>
<p>Kanye is now also a fashion designer. via: Getty Images He has been working on fashion lines since 2006, and now Kanye‚Äôs Yeezy collections are sold-out worldwide ‚Äì despite waves of criticisms surrounding them.</p>
<p>The Kardashian-Wests are probably the most stylish family ever‚Ä¶ via: Instagram But being a family man doesn‚Äôt seem to have settled down Kanye, who is also very well known for his outspoken and often irrational personality.</p>
<p>Where do we start when it comes to Kanye‚Äôs erratic behavior? via: Getty Images Kanye isn‚Äôt afraid of letting his opinion be known and he enjoys going to extreme lengths to do so.</p>
<p>He completely ruined Taylor Swift‚Äôs acceptance of an MTV Video Music Award in 2009‚Ä¶ Instead of allowing Swift to happily accept her award ‚Äì that she won ‚Äì he interrupted her on stage saying that Beyonce deserved to win more than she did.</p>
<p>Kanye‚Äôs rude and arrogant behavior didn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images He has made claims in the past that he is, in fact, a God, which didn‚Äôt go down well with Christian communities around the world.</p>
<p>He is also an active Trump supporter. Getty Images While wearing a red ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hat, the musician sat down with Donald Trump in the Oval Office last year, where he proclaimed his support for the polarizing president and declared Trump a ‚Äúhero‚Äù in a rambling televised monologue that spawned myriad parodies.</p>
<p>Kanye announced that he converted to Christianity this year‚Ä¶ Getty Images He also announced that he had been battling with his mental health over the last few years, but he has found his saving grace through religion.</p>
<p>Kanye seems to be pretty serious about his newfound faith‚Ä¶ Over the past year, Kanye‚Äôs hosted his Sunday Service every week almost without fail. While it initially seemed like a gimmick to propel his fledgling music career, it‚Äôs clearly part of a personal journey for the rapper.</p>
<p>His faith has impacted his career. via: Getty Images Kanye‚Äôs new album, Jesus is King, takes on a gospel direction that stays in line with the music at his Sunday Service.</p>
<p>Kanye treated the production of his Christian-themed album very seriously‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images So seriously, in fact, that he told his team working on the production of Jesus is King that they were to not take part in pre-marital sex.</p>
<p>He really enjoys telling people what to do‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images But he may have bitten off a bit more than he could chew when he decided to take on Forbes Magazine after they finally featured the singer on their coveted ‚ÄúBillionaires 2020‚Äù list.</p>
<p>The publication announced that they were adding West to the list a few weeks ago‚Ä¶ After months of asking him for his financial records, they estimated his value at around 1.3 billion, but West was having none of that as he explained that they undervalued him by 2 billion dollars. That was a very messy part on his behalf because he kept parts of his records a secret.</p>
<p>But lately, he‚Äôs become more obsessed with posting pictures‚Ä¶ Firstly, it was a strange tribute to his wife Kim Kardashian, as she finally became (and then unbecame) a billionaire. You can read more about that incident a bit later on.</p>
<p>But his most recent Twitter post involved his bestie, Elon Musk. via: Getty Images Even though I was initially surprised that these two were even friends, it kind of makes sense given that their personalities are very similar. You know what they say about birds of the same feather‚Ä¶</p>
<p>But rather than it being a cute photo of friends, people couldn‚Äôt help but focus on Grimes‚Ä¶ via: Getty Images You‚Äôll understand when you see the picture.</p>
<p>It sent the internet alight with comments. Initially, the comments just started off with mocking the two.</p>
<p>We all knew this was coming‚Ä¶ Especially with a caption like ‚ÄúWhen you go to your boys house and you‚Äôre both wearing orange‚Ä¶‚Äù Stop it.</p>
<p>But then people started noticing something strange‚Ä¶ via: Twitter Why is Grimes in the photograph?</p>
<p>We know who the real star of the show is‚Ä¶ via: Twitter And it ain‚Äôt the 2 men up front‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Clearly, neither of them know how a mirror selfie works‚Ä¶ via: Twitter But Grimes, you‚Äôre doing amazing sweetie.</p>
<p>This was all anyone could focus on‚Ä¶ Why didn‚Äôt they just take the selfie for themselves?</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the full post so you can have a look‚Ä¶ Keep scrolling to learn more about Kanye‚Äôs relationship with the one and only, Kim Kardashian.</p>
<p>But what‚Äôs the latest news? Getty Well Kanye has pulled yet another huge stunt ‚Äì he‚Äôs running for President!</p>
<p>He made the announcement on Twitter. He wrote: We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States! #2020Vision</p>
<p>And who‚Äôs supporting him? Well absolutely none other than Elon Musk: ‚ÄòYou have my full support!‚Äô.</p>
<p>Getty Kanye has toyed with the idea of running for president in the past ‚Äì most notably in 2015.
