<p>CLOSE In honor of fathers everywhere, here are ten facts about the day we spend celebrating them. 10Best</p>
<p>Finding the right gift for Father’s Day can be a challenge. Most times, if you ask Dad what he wants, if he’s anything like mine, he’ll shrug and say, “I don’t need anything.” But dads should be recognized for all the sacrifices they have made through the years.</p>

If you’re looking to get the most out of your workout, make sure you’re lacing up the correct shoes before you get started. Wearing the appropriate sneakers for your specific routine is crucial to achieving your performance goals and preventing injury.</p>
<p>When shopping for a cross training shoe, there are key factors to consider. Look for styles that offer stability, complete with features such as a wide base, anatomically-correct toe boxes and outsoles that support lateral movements during activities like strength training and dance fitness. Silhouettes with moderate cushioning also tend to be ideal as they offer support without feeling too bulky. Choosing the right pair, however, really comes down to finding one that fits comfortably for you.</p>
<p>During your shopping experience, it’s a good idea research all of the brands that cater to what you’re looking for. Athletic powerhouses such as Nike, New Balance and Under Armour all have something to offer, and you can also pick up a pair from smaller brands including Nobull and Altra.</p>
<p>Below, find 15 of the best functional cross-training sneakers for women you can buy.</p>

<h3 id="11-best-crossfit-shoes-for-women-in-2019--2020-per-trainers">&ldquo;11 Best CrossFit Shoes for Women in 2019 &amp; 2020, Per Trainers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/best-crossfit-shoes-for-women-1571239697.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
CrossFit workouts involve lifting heavy barbells and doing many power training exercises, including box jumps, burpees, kettlebell swings, and even sprinting on a treadmill. In fact, many CrossFit workouts—or Workout of the Day (WOD), as they call it—combine weightlifting exercises with rowing, running and HIIT. That means you need a pair of supportive and durable shoes that can absorb weight while also helping you move freely.</p>
<p>How to shop for the best CrossFit shoes</p>
<p>Unlike running shoes, CrossFit shoes tend to have a flatter heel and a wider sole that&rsquo;s heavier and more durable. This allows you to firmly plant your feet on the ground and transfer energy when doing deadlifts, front squats, and other weightlifting exercises. Jonathan Rouse, DPM, a podiatrist based in Chicago, fellow at the American College of Foot &amp; Ankle Surgeons, and CrossFit athlete, says his number one rule is to make sure your feet don&rsquo;t slide around in the shoe. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to lose a toenail and cause permanent damage and have thickened nails if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>That said, CrossFit shoes with a roomy toe box is also key, as your feet need to be able to expand to distribute weight. Dr. Rouse recommends going a half size up if your find that your CrossFit shoes are too tight; he says that many CrossFit shoes tend to run small. This allows a little more space for your feet to breathe, preventing foot pain. &ldquo;If your shoes feel too tight in the store, they are going to be too tight when you&rsquo;re trying to work out. Place a sports orthotic in them if you want to make them more comfortable,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Lastly, your shoes should also have a flexible midsole, so your feet are able to move freely when performing lateral and explosive movements, like parallette jumps. To help you find the right pair of cross trainers for you, we rounded up the best CrossFit shoes, according to trainers and reviewers.</p>

<h3 id="the-best-workout-shoes-for-every-type-of-exercise-according-to-fitness-trainers">&ldquo;The best workout shoes for every type of exercise, according to fitness trainers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cnet3.cbsistatic.com/img/jvhi_EbhTWONwIEgiFez-sDMd_I=/756x567/2020/01/22/af1bffb5-7ae2-47f8-b7f3-086b6584bd0d/gettyimages-1131209578.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Whenever you start a new workout or training program, one of the first things you should do is figure out the best workout shoes to wear. The right type of shoe can be crucial to your workout (and your feet, from heel to midsole to toe), even if you just plan on weight lifting, cycling, or you just need walking shoes. Making the right choice with footwear like sneakers is even more important if you want to run or do CrossFit workouts or HIIT classes, where you need gym shoes that are breathable, offer comfort and support your weight and joints.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to working out, chances are you&rsquo;re a bit lost about which gym shoes will be the best to support you and your feet in your new workout. And you don&rsquo;t want just any pair of gym shoes, especially if you&rsquo;re going to be investing a lot of time (and potentially money) into your new training routine. Do you need breathable mesh, anti-slip rubber or a rubber outsole? Do you need shoes for women or men&rsquo;s workout sneakers? Do you go for the big brands like Nike, Reebok and Adidas? The options are endless.</p>

<p>Sneakers can ultimately be a personal preference. But if you&rsquo;re looking for some suggestions, the best people to ask (in my humble opinion) are fitness trainers. Why? Trainers pretty much spend 24/7 in gym workout shoes and likely have tried all the sneakers out there. They know which sneakers to skip, which sneakers to invest in, and oftentimes can save you from a headache (in your head or your feet) when you&rsquo;ve just bought four different pairs of sneakers but hate to wear all of them.</p>

<p>So let these fitness training experts save you some precious time (and hopefully money, and pain in your feet, including the dreaded plantar fasciitis) by checking out their recommendations for the best workout shoes to wear for every kind of exercise. No matter if you&rsquo;re running, boxing, dancing, doing high-intensity interval training, or lifting weights and weight training &ndash; this guide to sneakers has you (and your feet) covered.</p>
<p>Amazon &ldquo;For trails, I prefer Salomon XA Pro 3D GTX. These are Gore-tex to keep your feet dry and have firm soles for added stability on the trails. The toe box is also reinforced to keep you from stubbing your toe. As these shoes are sturdier, they are good for indoor cycling and some indoor exercise classes. With a firm sole, some activities (such as calf raises) might be difficult in these shoes.&rdquo; &ndash; Mollie Millington, runner and certified personal trainer.</p>

<p>Amazon &ldquo;I love the Asics Kayano as they provide additional ankle stability for people with muscle imbalances, which we all have. Once the ankle and knees are supported correctly, the proper shoe can relieve pain in the knees and ankles and help correct over-pronation which is when your foot rolls inward, causing shin splints and can cause knee pain and swelling. &ldquo;A good stability shoe will help minimize the rolling inward and help the heel-to-toe transition slowly, correcting your running form over time. &ldquo;I personally love how light this model has become over the years. The shoe has transformed into a fashionable and light shoe while helping correct the form of our feet while we run while improving the pressure on our joints while we run with added cushioning. Every client I put in these shoes loves them, as they can be worn while strength training or running.&rdquo; &ndash; Holly Roser, certified personal trainer.</p>

<p>NoBull &ldquo;There are two main things you look for in a CrossFit shoe: durability and versatility. A good CrossFit shoe takes you from squats to rope climbs to burpee box jumps all in one workout. A good pair of CrossFit shoes feels just as comfortable during an 800-meter run as it does during a couplet of deadlifts and push-ups &ndash; and NoBull surpasses standards for all of the above. &ldquo;NoBull shoes have a reputation for being heavy-duty yet comfortable, supportive yet flexible. Plus, they&rsquo;re sleek and simple, and you can choose from high-top, mid-rise and regular to find your perfect fit,&rdquo; &ndash; Amanda Capritto, CrossFit Coach, certified personal trainer and CNET writer.</p>

<p>Asics &ldquo;My fave sneaker model is the Asics Gel Nimbus. They were the first pair of shoes I bought when I started training with DanceBody in 2016, and I&rsquo;m seriously committed to them. I&rsquo;ve tried a bunch of different sneaker brands and models, but I always come back to the Gel Nimbus. &ldquo;They have amazing shock absorption for high-impact movements, but are light enough that they don&rsquo;t feel like clunky moon shoes; the perfect balance for dance cardio.&rdquo; &ndash; Sam Ostwald, trainer and instructor at DanceBody</p>
<p>Amazon &ldquo;For boxing workouts, these are super-comfortable and feel like you&rsquo;re walking on clouds! I also like that they can be slip-on and not tied with laces. I do a lot of strength training and high-impact moves and have loved these shoes for the past four years. I still wear them whenever I do boxing workouts, drills and high-impact training,&rdquo; &ndash; Amanda Alappat, former pro boxer and personal trainer.</p>
