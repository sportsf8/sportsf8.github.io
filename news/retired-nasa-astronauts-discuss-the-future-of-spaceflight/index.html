<p>A new generation of spaceflight</p>
<p>People around the world are waiting with bated breath as Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley prepare for Saturdays’ SpaceX launch — which got pushed back from Wednesday due to poor weather. When SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, tipped with an occupied Crew Dragon capsule, lifts off from the historic Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, space fans will all be hoping for a successful launch.</p>
<p>But for Stott, this mission has an even greater meaning.</p>
<p>“I am especially excited about the fact that Bob and Doug are two of my astronaut classmates from the class of 2000,” says Stott. “Their wives are [also] two of my classmates, so this feels like a family event happening.”</p>
<p>Stott went on two missions to the International Space Station during her 27-year career at NASA. She was also the last crew member to return home on the space shuttle Atlantis, which marked the temporary end of humans launched from within U.S. borders. But now, Stott’s excited all over again as she gets to follow her friends as they pioneer the next generation of spaceflight.</p>
<p>Coleman, who joined NASA in 1992, logged more than 179 days in space during her 24 years as an astronaut. But just like Stott, Coleman is looking forward to what using private spaceflight will mean long-term.</p>
<p>“It’s really exciting because we’ve spent time designing and building together, and now we’re going to see if everything works the way we hoped it would.”</p>
<p>If Saturday’s mission goes off without a hitch, NASA will finally have an affordable, reusable option to ferry NASA astronauts and their international colleagues to the ISS. This would free up funding and time to focus on other missions, such as the upcoming launch of the Perseverance Mars rover this summer, a Moon landing in a few short years as part of the Artemis program, and an ambitious rotorcraft that hopes to fly just above the surface of Saturn’s largest moon Titan.</p>
<p>SpaceX isn’t going to be the only game in town for long, though. Boeing is also working on a spacecraft that can carry NASA astronauts to orbit. The company is close to passing their final un-crewed test before they can bring humans into low Earth orbit. And once they pass, Boeing and SpaceX will continue to shuttle astronauts back and forth, expanding the research and science output of the ISS.</p>
<p>The future of women in space</p>
<p>When NASA unveiled their plans for the Artemis program, they knew they were paying homage to the former Apollo program. After all, Artemis is the twin sister of Apollo in Greek mythology. This name, though, also hints that the next lunar landing will feature the first woman to walk on the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p>NASA has promised that at least one of the astronauts returning to the Moon will be a woman, but Stott has another idea.</p>
<p>“Why not make it two?” she says.</p>
<p>Women have always been a part of NASA but were usually kept behind the scenes. In recent decades, women took on larger roles as astronauts; however, it wasn’t until 2019 that the world saw the first all-female spacewalk.</p>
<p>And the journey to this point wasn’t simple. Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian female cosmonaut, crossed the boundary of space in 1963. But it would take until 1983 before Americans finally sent astronaut Sally Ride into orbit.</p>
<p>Now women serve at many high-level roles at NASA and are part of almost every mission on the ISS. “The rocket ship doesn’t care if you’re a boy or a girl,” Stott says.</p>
<p>While there may not be any women on Saturday’s planned mission, there are a number of women working to make sure this launch goes smoothly. Plus, astronaut Nicole Mann has been assigned to the flight team of Boeing’s first crewed mission to the ISS, planned for later in 2020.</p>
<p>“I think that NASA, in general, has done a really good job since women have been a part of the office of incorporating and assigning women to the missions,” says Stott.</p>
<p>This next decade will showcase the wonders of human innovation, as well as highlight what working together can achieve. During it, humanity will see the next generation of moonwalkers, as well as the development of a new wave of technology that will help us better explore our cosmic neighborhood.</p>
<p>“I hope everybody is watching [the SpaceX launch Saturday],” says Stott. “I hope everybody realizes how meaningful this is to all of us.”</p>
<p>You can watch the historic launch, called “Launch America” on National Geographic or ABC on Saturday, May 30. You can also livestream the event directly below, courtesy of NASA TV.

<h3 id="whos-flying-in-the-spacex-crew-dragon-meet-astronauts-bob-behnken-and-doug-hurley">&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s flying in the SpaceX Crew Dragon? Meet astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.heraldtribune.com/storyimage/LK/20200519/NEWS/200518001/AR/0/AR-200518001.jpg" alt="img">
Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley will break the nine-year drought on crewed flights from Kennedy Space Center on May 27.</p>
<p>It’s not every day that you get to see your husband fly to space. And it’s even more unusual when you can relate to that experience, as well.</p>
<p>But that’s what’s in store for NASA astronauts Megan McArthur and Karen Nyberg when their spouses, Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, break the nine-year drought on crewed flights from Kennedy Space Center on May 27.</p>
<p>From the safe confines of KSC, McArthur and Nyberg, along with their sons, will watch as Behnken, 49, and Hurley, 53, blast off from pad 39A on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule for a historic mission to the International Space Station that will place them in the Astronaut Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>They will know the excitement running through Behnken&rsquo;s and Hurley&rsquo;s veins as they become the first astronauts to fly to space from U.S. soil since the shuttle program ended in 2011 and the first to command an entirely new spacecraft since the debut of the shuttle in 1981.</p>
<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s next launch will officially have astronauts on board</p>
<p>And yes, McArthur and Nyberg will know the dangers that come along with human spaceflight, too.</p>
<p>For Behnken and Hurley, the flight is a career-capping opportunity that&rsquo;s even more special because of their long-time friendship, which began when they joined the astronaut class in 2000.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, Behnken, who is from Missouri and Hurley, who is from New York, have developed a close bond. Not only were they military test pilots before becoming astronauts, they also met their future spouses in the same astronaut class and even attended each other&rsquo;s weddings. Hurley was Behnken&rsquo;s best man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man named Duane Ross was the lead for the astronaut selection process. In some sense, he picked my spouse for me; he picked my friends for me,&rdquo; Behnken told The Atlantic in 2019.</p>
<p>The close-knit astronaut couples, who currently reside in Houston, have learned to balance work and family while simultaneously dealing with the occasional spaceflight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That’s one of the things that is unique in our relationships: We have spouses that have the same job. If you even just look at our wedding planning, my wife and I were balancing space flights and a lot of stuff going on back here in Houston. Her flight got delayed a little bit and we found a window where we could get out to San Diego and have our wedding,&rdquo; Behnken told the magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doug and Karen have to work their personal life around their space flights. And same thing for us. I know what he&rsquo;s going through. We both have sons in elementary school; we&rsquo;re balancing the same challenges. That lets us predict how to best support each other as we work through pulling off our next space flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are not the only astronaut couples. Others like Rhea Seddon and Hoot Gibson, Bill and Anna Fisher, and Steve Hawley and Sally Ride, who were all part of the first shuttle astronaut class to include women, also got together when they were in the space program, according to Air &amp; Space Magazine.</p>
<p>Even the first woman in space, Russian Valentina Tereshkova, married fellow cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev, who became the third Russian to fly to space. They later divorced in 1980.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes it easier to get along (with other astronauts) because you come from similar backgrounds &hellip; and when you arrive as a brand new astronaut, you know a little bit about the astronauts who are already there,&rdquo; former space shuttle astronaut Winston Scott told FLORIDA TODAY.</p>
<p>This will be Behnken and Hurley&rsquo;s first spaceflight together, and it will be unlike past trips.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll be in a capsule rather than a shuttle. They won&rsquo;t be wearing the traditional orange shuttle suits. And they won&rsquo;t head to the launch pad in the famous silver astronaut transfer van, or &ldquo;Astrovan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, on the day of launch, they&rsquo;ll don SpaceX&rsquo;s white-and-gray futuristic spacesuits and ride in Teslas — SpaceX CEO Elon Musk&rsquo;s other company — to the pad where they will pave the way for a new type of spaceflight: one where astronauts fly on commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Under NASA&rsquo;s Commercial Crew Program, SpaceX beat Boeing to be the first contender to fly astronauts to the station. This mission, dubbed Demonstration Mission 2 or Demo-2, is a historic milestone aimed at proving SpaceX can send humans safely to space.</p>
<p>Behnken and Hurley say it helps that both are seasoned astronauts familiar with launching from KSC. Behnken’s last flight was in 2010 aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour. Hurley’s was more recent: he piloted the final shuttle mission on Atlantis, taking off from pad 39A on July 8, 2011.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think for both Doug and I, with our careers with the shuttles launching off the Florida coast, that&rsquo;s probably the thing that&rsquo;s very different from a mission perspective,&rdquo; Behnken told reporters during a video teleconference from Houston. &ldquo;When we launched on our first flight, it was kind of repeated to fly from the Florida coast, that was the normal thing, that&rsquo;s what we grew up with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have a different perspective of the importance of coming to Florida, launching again on an American rocket from the Florida coast and generations of people who maybe didn&rsquo;t get a chance to see a space shuttle launch, getting a chance again to see human spaceflight in our own backyard is pretty exciting to be a part of,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Dragon spacecraft is a capsule, more like the Russian Soyuz spacecraft and NASA&rsquo;s Mercury, Gemini and Apollo capsules from the &rsquo;60s and &rsquo;70s.</p>
<p>Class of 2020: SpaceX, NASA want your photos. They&rsquo;ll fly them to International Space Station</p>
<p>And when they maneuver the capsule, the astronauts won’t be pulling a lever — they’ll be working with a touchscreen. That’s a first for Behnken and Hurley who are used to using a stick to fly a vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Growing up as a pilot my whole career, having a certain way to control the vehicles, this is currently different, but you know we went into it with a very open mind,&rdquo; Hurley said during the teleconference. &ldquo;The difference is that you&rsquo;ve got to be very deliberate when you&rsquo;re putting an input with a touchscreen relative to what you would do with a stick because when you&rsquo;re flying an airplane, for example, by pushing (the stick) forward, it&rsquo;s going to go down, (but now) I actually have to make a concerted effort to do that with a touchscreen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prospect of putting Dragon through its paces as its first occupants is, in some ways, an astronaut’s dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you told us when we were students at test pilot school that we would get an opportunity not only to fly a new developmental aircraft, which we both were able to do while we were test pilots but then get to fly the first flight of a spaceship, I think we would have told you you were crazy,&rdquo; Hurley said.</p>
<p>Scott, who was a naval aviator before joining the astronaut class in 1992, admitted he wouldn’t mind flying on SpaceX’s vehicle if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as pilots, as test pilots, you always like to do something new. So these guys are going to be the first ones that pilot a brand new spaceship into space and dock with the International Space Station so I know they&rsquo;re very excited about that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>In typical astronaut fashion, neither Hurley nor Behnken got too personal during NASA’s meet the crew virtual news conference. Their astronaut spouses didn&rsquo;t come up.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to look far to see excitement is building among those who know them best. Hurley’s wife, Nyberg, retweeted her husband&rsquo;s tweet of a drawing their young son Jack did of the capsule that will take his father to space. It included a fiery tail propelling the Dragon onward and a brightly colored Earth.</p>
<p>Our son’s version of Crew Dragon. I love it. pic.twitter.com/GIYRRMOXd4</p>
<p>— Col. Doug Hurley (@Astro_Doug) April 30, 2020</p>
<p>When the date for the Demo-2 launch was announced, Nyberg wrote on Twitter, &ldquo;It is fantastic to see a launch date for Crew Dragon Demo-2! Jack and I are so proud of (Doug) and are excited to support him through this historic mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nyberg flew to space twice, including a long stay on the ISS in 2013 while Behnken’s wife, McArthur, flew on the final Hubble servicing mission in 2009.</p>
<p>Once Behnken and Hurley arrive at the space station, which is scheduled to occur within 24 hours after liftoff, they will be greeted by NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy, who flew to the space station last month and is currently the only American on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be excited to see Bob and Doug,&rdquo; Cassidy told reporters last month. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known them for many years, we&rsquo;ve worked together, they&rsquo;re friends and with their families as well, so it&rsquo;ll be really special to have such a historic moment for our nation and such a cool personal event for me greeting them at the hatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassidy flew with Hurley on STS-127 in 2009 and then flew with Nyberg on their long-duration mission in 2013. As Nyberg said via Twitter, &ldquo;Flying with Chris is a family affair for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This historic launch doesn&rsquo;t come without a caveat, however.</p>
<p>Previously, the expectation had been nearly half a million people descending into Brevard County to watch this special occasion, but the coronavirus pandemic has changed plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally, the disappointing aspect of all of this pandemic is the fact that we don&rsquo;t have the luxury of our family and friends being there at Kennedy to watch the launch. But obviously, it&rsquo;s the right thing to do in the current environment,&rdquo; Hurley said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I would also say that the last five years for Bob and I working on commercial crew and then the last two specifically with SpaceX, it&rsquo;s been a long road to get here and I don&rsquo;t think either one of us would have predicted that when we were ready to go fly this mission that we would be dealing with this as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NASA has urged people to stay and watch the launch from home and will not provide the public access to KSC in an attempt to reduce crowds. But officials say they&rsquo;ll do everything else to ensure Americans recognize the importance of the moment of returning crewed spaceflight to U.S. soil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly didn&rsquo;t expect to fly again (and) I certainly didn&rsquo;t necessarily have a plan to fly again,&rdquo; Hurley said. &ldquo;Once again, I think Bob and I are very humbled to be in this position.&rdquo;</p>

The hundreds of people who have been to space have traveled on just a handful of vehicles, eight in all over nearly six decades of spaceflight.</p>
<p>Soon, a ninth will take flight, as SpaceX&rsquo;s Crew Dragon is scheduled to blast off from Florida on May 27 carrying two NASA astronauts in a test mission to the International Space Station. Four crewed vehicles to date have been American spacecraft, a point NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine emphasized in remarks made during a May 1 news conference about the upcoming SpaceX launch, called Demo-2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think about Mercury, Gemini, Apollo and then space shuttle: Those are really the four times in history where we have put humans on brand-new spacecraft, and now we&rsquo;re doing it for a fifth time,&rdquo; Bridenstine said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time since we put humans on a brand-new spacecraft, but that&rsquo;s what this is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a spin through the company Crew Dragon will join.</p>

<p>Vostok (USSR, 1961)</p>

<p>The Vostok capsule carried the first-ever human to make a spaceflight, the Soviet Union&rsquo;s cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin , who launched on April 12, 1961 and clocked in with just over one full orbit of Earth.</p>
<p>Vostok could carry just one astronaut in its main spherical cabin , which perched atop a belt of life-support gas tanks and a pyramidical instrument module that was jettisoned before the cabin reentered Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. A window near the astronaut&rsquo;s feet allowed them to observe Earth during flight.</p>
<p>The capsule had no landing gear; instead, Gagarin and his successors ejected from the capsule during the reentry process, although the Soviet Union hid that fact lest the mission not be considered a true spaceflight.</p>
<p>Vostok translates as &ldquo;East;&rdquo; Gagarin&rsquo;s capsule went by the call sign Swallow, according to NASA . Six Vostok capsules in all carried cosmonauts to orbit between 1961 and 1963; the capsule&rsquo;s final flight carried Valentina Tereshkova , who became the first woman in space.</p>

<p>During the Cold War space race , the U.S. strove to beat the Soviet Union&rsquo;s Vostok capsule with its own crewed vehicle in Project Mercury.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union met the milestone first with Gagarin&rsquo;s flight; three weeks later , the U.S. launched astronaut Alan Shepard on a suborbital flight aboard the Freedom 7 capsule. A crewed Mercury vehicle didn&rsquo;t reach orbit until John Glenn&rsquo;s flight in February 1962 aboard the Friendship 7 capsule.</p>
<p>Mercury capsules were approximately conical, with a cylindrical segment interrupting the cone&rsquo;s sides. When on the ground or atop a rocket, the cone stood upright and the astronaut lay on his back near the bottom; in orbit, the capsule rotated to seat the astronaut upright with a window panel more or less at eye level. The capsule&rsquo;s heat shield was at the astronaut&rsquo;s back, along the circular base of the cone.</p>
<p>Unusually, Mercury capsules had individual names beyond the series itself; others included Liberty Bell 7, Sigma 7 and Aurora 7. The final crewed Mercury capsule flew in 1963.</p>

<p>Voskhod (USSR, 1964)</p>

<p>The Voskhod capsule was based heavily on the design of Vostok but adapted to carry more crewmembers, and later to facilitate spacewalking, the next milestone achievement the USSR had set its sights on.</p>
<p>First, the USSR needed to squeeze multiple crewmembers into the small capsule. To accomplish that, spacecraft engineers ditched the ejection seat and replaced it with stable couches and a landing system, according to NASA . Voskhod first carried humans in 1964, launching with a crew of three: a pilot, a medical doctor and a spacecraft engineer. To accommodate the tight conditions, the trio did not wear space suits.</p>
<p>A second version of the Voskhod capsule was adapted for a spacewalk, carrying an inflatable airlock. The USSR flew an uncrewed test mission for the vehicle, then in 1965 launched Voskhod 2, which carried two cosmonauts in pressure suits on a 26-hour flight. One of those cosmonauts, Alexei Leonov , exited the inflatable airlock and spent about 12 minutes in space, clinching the accomplishment of first spacewalk . The mission was Voskhod&rsquo;s last flight.</p>

<p>Gemini (US, 1965)</p>

<p>Like the pair of Soviet vehicles, Gemini was at heart an adapted version of the Mercury capsule designed to let more astronauts tackle more advanced tasks. The larger capsule flew humans for the first time in March 1965, just a few days after the Voskhod 2 mission.</p>
<p>Gemini capsules were designed to carry two astronauts, rather than just one, and their primary task was to teach engineers how to dock spacecraft in orbit , which NASA believed would be necessary to land humans on the moon.</p>
<p>Two other vital tasks for the Gemini vehicles were extending the duration of spaceflight and permitting spacewalks. The second crewed Gemini mission, Gemini 4 , lasted for four days and included the first American extravehicular activity, a 23-minute sortie by Ed White.</p>
<p>By Gemini 7, missions were stretching longer than a week to help scientists understand the consequences of lengthier spaceflights, according to NASA . In 1966, the program tackled the other key goal of the Gemini program, docking in space, when two Gemini 8 astronauts latched their vehicle onto an uncrewed Agena spacecraft.</p>
<p>The final Gemini mission, Gemini 12 , launched in November 1966 and included three separate spacewalks and docking maneuvers with another uncrewed Agena. After that success, NASA deemed itself ready to start tackling lunar missions.</p>

<p>Soyuz (USSR/Russia, 1967)</p>

<p>The Soyuz capsule , which still ferries cosmonauts into space today, began flying shortly after the retirement of the Voskhod vehicle. Its first crewed launch was in 1967, although that mission&rsquo;s sole cosmonaut was killed during reentry by a parachute malfunction.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Soyuz capsules flying today are not identical to those of the 1960s. (The name means &ldquo;union.&quot;) The USSR and Russia have developed a total of 10 different crewed Soyuz models over the decades.</p>
<p>However, each of those variants has followed the same basic three-part recipe . At the center is the descent module, which astronauts sit in during launch and which is the only component to return to Earth at the end of a mission. To one side of that module is the orbital module, which includes crew living space and the docking mechanism to attach to other spacecraft. To the other side is the propulsion module, which carries fuel, engines and solar power panels.</p>
<p>All told, Soyuz spacecraft have made nearly 150 crewed flights since the vehicle design was introduced. The vehicle also docked with an Apollo command module in 1975 to mark the end of the Cold War space race.</p>
<p>Soyuz capsules have been the mainstay of Russia&rsquo;s long-term space exploration goals. The vehicles visited the Salyut and Mir stations for decades and still visit the International Space Station. Since the space shuttle retired in 2011, NASA astronauts have caught rides to the orbiting laboratory on Soyuz capsules along with their international colleagues.</p>

<p>Apollo/Lunar Module (US, 1968)</p>

<p>The Apollo program and its command module were meant to carry humans to the moon in the final leg of the Cold War space race; the vehicle was also meant to pull together lessons learned with the Mercury and Gemini capsules and further increase crew sizes.</p>
<p>The main crew capsule of the Apollo program, called the command module , slightly tweaked the shape of the previous vehicles, discarding the straight segment that stretched out the cone and giving the capsule a rather more squat profile.</p>
<p>The command module was meant to serve only as a transport vehicle, carrying three astronauts during launch, Earth orbit, lunar orbit and landing. The spacecraft that aimed at lunar landings were accompanied by separate vehicles dubbed lunar modules, which were designed to fly two astronauts only in space, to and from the moon&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>Apollo&rsquo;s first crewed launch was meant to be Apollo 1 in 1967, until disaster struck during a preflight test and a flash fire in the command module killed the mission&rsquo;s three crewmembers. NASA stepped back to investigate the accident and improve fireproofing on the capsule, waiting nearly two years to get back to the launch pad.</p>
<p>The command module successfully flew with humans on board in 1968 on a mission dubbed Apollo 7 , an Earth-orbital flight to test the command module and the docking maneuvers that would be necessary on later flights.</p>
<p>By the milestone Apollo 11 flight that landed humans on the moon for the first time, missions consisted of three separate spacecraft: the command module, a workhorse service module and the lunar module that handled the landing itself.</p>
<p>The lunar module , in a first for spacecraft engineering, was designed only to operate beyond Earth, so it included no aerodynamic shaping. Instead, it was often compared to a large metallic bug. But then, in April 1970, three crewmembers on the Apollo 13 mission experienced an explosion in the service module on the third day of flight, when the spacecraft was about 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) away from Earth.</p>
<p>NASA scrambled into rescue mode and eventually, with the service module out of commission and the command module running low on power, the three astronauts piled into the lunar module and headed for the scenario the vehicle hadn&rsquo;t been designed for: returning to Earth. The lifeboat plan worked, carrying all three astronauts safely home.</p>
<p>The last Apollo mission, Apollo 17 , flew in December 1972; the Apollo capsule made its final flight in 1975.</p>

<p>Space Shuttle (US, 1981)</p>

<p>After the Apollo program ended in 1972, NASA took a break from human spaceflight for nearly a decade, not launching another crewed vehicle until the early 1980s. That vehicle was the space shuttle , the first reusable crewed spacecraft. NASA built five separate shuttles that reached space on a total of 135 crewed missions between 1981 and 2011.</p>
<p>The shuttles (technically known as the Space Transportation System) also marked the first big design jump in crewed spacecraft. The main shuttle body, which looks rather like a plane, was the orbiter itself. During launch, that orbiter was joined by three other pieces, one massive fuel tank painted a distinctive rust orange (the only component not reused) and two thinner white solid rocket boosters.</p>
<p>The orbiters included two decks, an airlock and a massive cargo bay. Most crews included seven astronauts. At the end of a mission, the orbiter returned to Earth, taking the heat from the reentry process on its protective belly tiles.</p>
<p>Of the five shuttles, two were destroyed during fatal accidents. First, in January 1986, Challenger suffered an anomaly during launch; then, in February 2003, Columbia fell to pieces during reentry. Each disaster killed all seven astronauts on board and prompted internal investigations at NASA, and the legacy of these two flights has contributed to NASA&rsquo;s deeply rooted safety culture.</p>
<p>NASA decided to retire the three remaining but aging shuttles in 2011.</p>

<p>China joined the crewed vehicle owners with its Shenzhou vehicle line. The name translates as &ldquo;divine vessel,&rdquo; according to NASA.</p>
<p>The Shenzhou spacecraft are built in a rather similar manner to the Russian Soyuz vehicles, with a three-part design of orbital, reentry and service modules. The first crewed Shenzhou to fly launched in 2003 and made China the third country with the capability to launch humans to orbit. That flight carried one taikonaut, the Chinese term for an astronaut, who orbited for nearly a day.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s next crewed flight carried two taikonauts; the third flight carried three taikonauts and included a spacewalk. Then China pivoted the vehicle&rsquo;s focus to rendezvous with the nation&rsquo;s first two independent space stations.</p>
<p>A total of six Shenzhou spacecraft have carried humans, with the most recent launch occurring in 2016.</p>

<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s Crew Dragon capsule , scheduled to launch two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station on May 27, will — if all goes well — become the first commercially built vehicle to carry humans to space.</p>
<p>Crew Dragon is based heavily on SpaceX&rsquo;s long-flying cargo ship, the Dragon , which the company built under NASA&rsquo;s commercial cargo delivery program and which made its first full-fledged delivery run in 2012 .</p>
<p>Crew Dragon was built under the agency&rsquo;s commercial crew program, and made a successful uncrewed test flight to the space station in March 2019.</p>
<p>Two key modifications for the crewed version are that the spacecraft docks itself to the International Space Station, rather than relying on being snagged by the laboratory&rsquo;s robotic arm, and, of course, the addition of life-support systems. Crew Dragon can seat up to seven people, according to SpaceX.</p>

<p>Suborbital bonus</p>

<p>Two types of vehicles have also carried astronauts into space on suborbital missions. These are much shorter flights, but do cross the altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometers) that is currently considered to represent the boundary of space.</p>
<p>NASA&rsquo;s X-15 test plane accomplished the feat during the 1960s. Although the vehicles flew a total of 199 missions, most didn&rsquo;t cross the boundary. The highest altitude the plane reached was 67 miles (108 km). The vehicle is considered a crucial stepping stone to the space shuttle, since it proved that a plane-like vehicle could survive atmospheric reentry.</p>
<p>Related: Photos: X-15 rocket plane Reaches space in test flights</p>
<p>Much later, SpaceShipOne was the first commercial vehicle to officially reach space, in 2004. The vehicle and its successor, SpaceShipTwo, now owned by Virgin Galactic, are designed for suborbital flights only, not orbital flight, and launch in the air, after being lifted by a carrier plane.</p>
<p>SpaceShipOne retired shortly after its historic flight; SpaceShipTwo made crewed tests beginning in 2010 and carried the first non-pilot passenger to space in 2019. Virgin Galactic&rsquo;s latest SpaceShipTwo vehicle, called VSS Unity, is in the final phases of its test campaign and could start flying operational, passenger-carrying missions as early as this year.</p>

<p>While the pace of new vehicle introductions has been slow in recent years, a few other orbital and suborbital vehicles are checking off developments toward crewed flights.</p>
<p>SpaceX&rsquo;s counterpart in NASA&rsquo;s commercial crew program, Boeing, launched an uncrewed test flight of its Starliner vehicle to the space station in December 2019, but failed to dock to the orbiting laboratory . The company plans to make another such flight later this year before attempting a crewed flight. Unlike Crew Dragon, the Starliner capsule was designed from scratch.</p>
<p>Internationally, China tested a new crewed vehicle, as yet unnamed, during an uncrewed flight early in May. That capsule is meant to facilitate the country&rsquo;s plans to build a new, three-module space station.</p>
<p>Closer to Earth, Blue Origin is testing what it intends to become a crewed tourist vehicle for suborbital flights, New Shepard . The company, started by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has flown a dozen uncrewed flights and hoped to launch humans last year .</p>

US astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir left the International Space Station (ISS) together on Friday to make a repair, becoming the first all-female team to do a spacewalk.</p>
<p>“Christina, you can get out of the depressurization chamber,” said fellow astronaut Stephanie Wilson from mission control in Houston, according to images broadcast live on the channel by the US space agency.</p>
<p>After routine security checks on suits and tie downs, the spacewalk officially started at 11:38 am (local time) and is expected to last several hours in order to change a battery charging and discharging unit (BCDU, for which stopped working last weekend.</p>
<p>The ISS converts sunlight into electrical energy through photovoltaic panels, but during its orbit it spends much of its time without receiving light directly, and it is in these periods that it uses the energy stored in the batteries.</p>

<p>Koch, an electrical engineer, leads Meir, a PhD in marine biology, who is conducting her first spacewalk, which is also known as “extravehicular activity.”</p>
<p>The first joint outing for two female astronauts, which included Koch and Anne McClain, was scheduled for March, but NASA had to cancel it four days earlier because they did not have two suits prepared in the proper sizes.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that space is available to everyone, and this is another milestone in that evolution,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a conversation with the press just minutes before Koch and Meir began their historic mission.</p>
<p>“I have an 11-year-old daughter, I want her to see herself as having the same opportunities that I had when I was growing up,” she added.</p>
<p>Women to the Moon</p>
<p>NASA, traditionally dominated by men, received criticism from several fronts after the failed female mission in March, which for those voices represented proof of the sexism implicit in the culture of the US space agency.</p>

<p>In 1983 Sally Ride became the first American woman to travel into space, as a member of the seventh space shuttle mission. Today, the number of female astronauts of American origin exceeds that of any other country.</p>
<p>But the one who holds the record for being the first woman in space is the cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova from the Soviet Union in 1963, who was followed by her compatriot Svetlana Savitskaya in 1982, who two years later would be the first woman to perform a spacewalk.</p>
<p>The United States is currently developing a mission called Artemis, Apollo’s twin sister in Greek mythology, with which she intends to return to the Moon after more than 50 years, and will include women in her astronaut teams, and possibly also includes a mission. made up only of women.</p>
<p>The expected date for the first of these new manned moon landings, considered by several experts as unlikely, is 2024.

<h3 id="new-violin-dedicated-to-russian-former-cosmonaut-valentina-tereškova">&ldquo;New violin dedicated to Russian former cosmonaut Valentina Tereškova&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://dnan0fzjxntrj.cloudfront.net/Pictures/2000x2000fit/7/6/6/15766_ciajka_619085.png" alt="img">
A new violin has been dedicated to Valentina Tereškova, the Russian national heroine, who, on 16 June 1963, became the first woman to fly into space.</p>
<p>Created by Tereškova’s long-time acquaintance, the Cremonese violin-maker Andrea Schudtz, the instrument is known as ‘Ciajka’ (meaning ‘seagull’), the code name chosen by Tereškova for her radio connections to Earth during her space mission. Accordingly, its fingerboard is illustrated with a seagull, while the instrument’s inner body has been used as a canvas for a picture of the cosmonaut. The violin was commissioned by Tereškova’s daughter Elena, who, like her mother, has always been a music lover. Its official presentation took place on 4th November at the International Kogan Festival in Jaroslavl, central Russia, where Tereškova grew up.</p>
<p>Born in 1937 in the Bolshoye Maslennikovo, a village on the Volga River, Tereškova grew up with no ambition of becoming a cosmonaut. After leaving school at 17, she worked at a tyre factory and at a textile mill. But she was also secretly training as a competitive parachutist - an experience that later contributed to her selection for the Soviet space program. In 1963 she was chosen from more than 400 applicants and five finalists to pilot Vostok 6. She orbited the Earth 48 times, spent almost three days in space, and remains the only woman to have been on a solo space mission.

MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin says he supports a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow him to seek another term and remain in power.</p>
<p>Putin gave his support Tuesday to the amendment put forward by Valentina Tereshkova, a lawmaker who as a Soviet cosmonaut became the first woman in space. Tereshkova proposed either scrapping presidential term limits or amending the Russian Constitution to let Putin run again. A series of constitutional amendments are going to a nationwide vote on April 22.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Valentina Tereshkova was hailed as a hero when she became the first woman in space in 1963.</p>
<p>FILE PHOTO: Russian cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, the first woman cosmonaut, attends a news conference in Star City outside Moscow, June 7, 2013. REUTERS/Sergei Remezov/File Photo</p>
<p>Now 83, she has became a hate figure for some Russians after this week putting forward a constitutional amendment that could allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036.</p>
<p>At least two online petitions have been launched against her, one calling for a street named after her to be renamed and another asking for one of her honorific titles to be revoked.</p>
<p>She has also been widely mocked by critics on social media.</p>
<p>“Tereshkova - the first woman who bravely traveled into cosmic cold and darkness, and then brought the entire country there,” read one message on Twitter reposted by Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p>Opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov wrote: “This whole obscene fuss over the constitution was conceived for the sake of one moment &hellip; two new terms for Putin. Tereshkova, who still remembers (Soviet dictator Josef) Stalin well, did not disappoint.”</p>
<p>A household name in Russia, Tereshkova, who holds an array of state honors including a Hero of the Soviet Union medal, became the world’s first female astronaut in June 1963, spending 71 hours in orbit on board a Soviet Vostok spacecraft.</p>
<p>A staunch backer of Putin and the traditional values he has espoused, she has been a lawmaker in the lower chamber of parliament since 2011.</p>
<p>Her amendment, since backed by both houses of parliament, allows Putin to ignore the current constitutional limits and run for president again in 2024, potentially opening the way for him to serve two more six-year terms consecutively.</p>
<p>The moves has been applauded by Putin’s admirers but critics have accused him of plotting to stay in power for life and have blamed Tereshkova.</p>
<p>One petition, that has garnered nearly 8,000 signatures, calls for Tereshkova to be stripped of her title of “honorary citizen” of Tutayev, a town northeast of Moscow near where she was born.</p>
<p>“&hellip;Tereshkova actively took part in the show that some people are calling a state coup,” it says, adding she had discredited the honor of the town’s residents.</p>
<p>Another, with over 3,000 signatures, calls for a Tereshkova Street in the town of Artyomovsky to be renamed.</p>
<p>Neither of the petitions has legal force.</p>

<p>Putin allies, including the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, and the speaker of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, have rallied to her defense, praising her proposal and decrying the attacks on her as unpatriotic and orchestrated from abroad.</p>
<p>Tereshkova has branded her critics unpatriotic.</p>
<p>“I don’t even want to talk about these people who don’t love the country,” she was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.
