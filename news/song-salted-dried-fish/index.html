<p>Synopsis: A struggling filmmaker agrees to make a film for a big shot, accepting the latter’s condition that he cast his daughter as the heroine.</p>
<p>Review: After getting too preachy in his previous film, Gouravam, Radhamohan is back with what can be described as his forte — a light-hearted comedy that feels like a spiritual sequel to his debut film Azhagiya Theeye, even if this one feels slightly watered-down compared to the earlier film. What if the aspiring filmmaker of that film, who was also named Chandran, had become a failure, with his first film a box office flop and the next stalled mid-way? That is what has happened to this film’s Chandran (Karunakaran), who considers his next project — whenever it happens — will be his “last bus”. So, when his manager Pandian (Mayilsamy) takes him to Ayya (MS Bhaskar), a big shot in the fishing community who wants to produce a film, he instantly agrees (his sister’s impending marriage also forces his hand), even though there is a catch — Ayya wants him to cast his daughter, Maha (Nandita) as the heroine. Has Chandran bargained for more than what he had asked for?</p>
<p>Thematically, Uppu Karuvadu feels like a Jigarthanda-meets-Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam (KTVI). As in the former, it is about a filmmaker who makes a compromise with a gangster-figure to make his film, and his exasperation trying to make a non-actor act provides the humour; and like the latter, the scenes are mainly discussions — that serve as genteel commentary on the film industry — that the filmmaker and his team have as they try to get a script ready for the film. But in place of the visual stylishness of Jigarthanda and the structural bravado of KTVI, the scenes here play out like a series of comedy sketches, giving it the feel of a stage drama that has been taped on camera. The music (by guitarist Steeve Vatz) is a complete let-down while the images look flat. Interestingly, the cinematographer is Mahesh Muthuswami, who was behind the arresting visuals of Mysskin’s earlier films. You could watch this film on the big screen or on your TV or mobile and your experience will be the same.</p>
<p>But this has been Radhamohan’s approach in his other films as well, and if you have to be less critical, you could qualify it as an understated visual style. And the director, with help from his dialogue writer Pon Parthiban, does make up for it with a constant stream of laughs delivered via gags and one-liners. Some are laugh-out-loud funny (Mayilsamy’s mannerism of calling every sound as a good omen), some just about make us break into a smile (Tata Sumo-ku puncture podalam; Titanic kappal-ku unnala puncture poda mudiyuma?) while a few are been-there-done-that (the scenes involving the fake godman who counsels Ayya). And the casting is also spot on. Karunakaran brings the right amount of seriousness to the role while Nandita captures the spoilt child aspect of Maha. Chawms and Narayan as Chandran’s associates convey the right amount of cluelessness, while Mayilsamy shows that he could be a fine replacement for Thambi Ramaiah. And the Radhamohan constants, Kumaravel, as a former gangster who ingratiates himself into the story discussions and turns out to be the best contributor, and MS Bhaskar as the big shot with a penchant for poetry, are impressive as ever. The standout is Doubt Senthil, as a naïve assistant director who keeps using the wrong similar-sounding English word — bald for bold, impotent for important, Akila Kurosawa for Akira Kurosawa and so on. In the end, despite the considerable failings, it is these touches that ensure that we leave the theatre with a smile on our face.</p>

Filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon has put his singing ability to good use by crooning a number in filmmaker Radha Mohan’s upcoming Tamil comedy “Uppu Karuvadu”.</p>
<p>Filmmaker Gautham Vasudev Menon has put his singing ability to good use by crooning a number in filmmaker Radha Mohan’s upcoming Tamil comedy “Uppu Karuvadu”.</p>
<p>“The music director of my film is a good friend of Gautham. He suggested that we use Gautham’s voice for the song as it would be apt,” Radha Mohan told IANS.</p>
<p>“When we had approached Gautham, although he was interested, he couldn’t take out time to record as he was busy with the release of his film ‘Yennai Arindhaal’.</p>
<p>“Since Gautham was busy, my music composer Steve sang the song for the shoot. Later, Gautham called and asked if he could still sing, provided I want to record his voice. I instantly agreed and we record the song in his voice,” he added.</p>
<p>The song has lyrics by Madhan Karky.</p>
<p>“Uppu Karuvadu” features Nandita, Karunakaran and Satish in important roles.</p>

Leading dance choreographer - actor Sathish Krishnan was recently seen in Uppu Karuvadu, directed by Radha Mohan. He played an aspiring actor who gets his maiden break in the film that Karunakaran sets out to direct with Nandita as the female lead. We have a small interview with the actor about his Uppu Karuvadu experience and the feedback that he has been getting,</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one is ridiculing the film with trolls and memes. That itself is a big deal in this day and age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On director Radha Mohan and the other veteran comedy actors in the film,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Radha Mohan sir is such a chilled out person with a natural ingrained humor sense. I thought that he was a serious person as I didn&rsquo;t know him much before this film, but he has a nice casual way of extracting work from his actors.</p>
<p>Mayilsamy sir is forever filled with wisecracks whenever he speaks. It would be uninhibited comedy, just being around him. Chaams has a serious face while delivering his lines but his screen presence does the trick. I did learn a few things about comedy from them.</p>
<p>The comedy scenes which are being appreciated now by the audiences just happened in the moment and didn&rsquo;t require many takes. The natural spontaneous factor of comedy goes down if a scene is done across many takes. It is so tough to do comedy actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More on his role and what was required from him,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to just behave as myself for this role. For some scenes, I did few gestures with my legs and hands to add to the scene&rsquo;s funny mood. When I had to enact certain scenes from Karunakaran&rsquo;s film (the film within the film), it had to have a commercial flavor and I imbibed what heroes like Suriya sir do in their commercial films. l admire Suriya sir a lot and it looked apt for the character as an aspiring actor who has influences of other actors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sathish would be seen next as an actor in Gautham Menon - Simbu&rsquo;s Achcham Yenbathu Madamaiyada and is also choreographing all songs in Kabali.

<h3 id="what-sets-dilruba-apart-from-other-instruments">&ldquo;What sets Dilruba apart from other instruments?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/tkv17h/article25565683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23frdilrubajpg" alt="img">
Saroja could well be one of the few artistes playing the dilruba. Daughter and disciple of P.V. Shanmugam and grand daughter of Vellasamy, Saroja has been practising the instrument for the past 35 years. She is perhaps the only solo recording artiste operating on the instrument that has a near soprano human voice and is often used as an accompaniment.</p>
<p>Ideally suited to express pathos, dilruba found happy use in the hands of A.R. Rahman. ‘Urvasi Urvasi,’ (Kadhalan) becoming a hit. ‘Haira haira hairabba’ (Jeans), ‘Poongatrile’ (Uyire) and ‘Uyire Uyire’ (Bombay), ‘Pachai Kili Padum Ooru’ (Karuthama) ‘Uppu Karuvadu’ (Mudhalvan) ‘Nilavae Mugam Kaattu’ (Yajaman) ‘Megham karukkudu’ (Kushi)&hellip; the list is endless. All followed in quick succession which gave her a chance to play her instrument to the hilt.</p>
<p>Innovative styles</p>
<p>In 1995, she performed with the Belgium Orchestra in the U.S. and in Europe with composer Hans Vermeerch. It was indeed a great comeback for the ancient instrument. The 12-member orchestra which performed Ramayana at the U.S. on July 6,1995, was one of its kind. In 2008, Saroja had performed with Paul Jacob’s Sangamam in China. There were 38 of them and she was able to bring out folk style tunes on tharshehnai and dilruba. A bit of Pop style on dilruba was quite an innovation.</p>
<p>Speaking of recordings, she had the privilege of recording with M.S. Viswanathan, Ilayaraja, A.R. Rahman, Deva, V. Kumar, Anu Malik, Yuvan Shankar Raja, Karthick Raja, Devi Sri Prasad, Harris Jayaraj, Hamsalekha, Keeravani, Shankar Ganesh, Chandrabose, Upendra Kumar, Dina and Gibran. The ease with which Saroja handles the 19 frets, moving them to make minute adjustments and then working on 22 sympathetic strings while strumming the madhyama string, speaks volumes of her proficiency.</p>
<p>Saroja excels in presenting the melodic structure in all its entirety, delineating the mood in the essential passages, with a variant, giving it a distinctive stamp. Ragas that stand out in her repertoire are Keeravani, Kannada and Subha Pantuvarali.</p>
<p>“There were always moments of anxiety. For instance, during my trip to the U.S. the instrument went missing and was recovered three days later,” says Saroja. Receiving the Mirchi Music Award from Rahman was a high point. She describes as rewarding the trip with Ilaiyaraja to the U.S. and Canada in 1993 and later on to Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Dilruba is related to sarangi, taus and Esraj. The story goes that it was blessed by the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh and became a regular part of the Sikh devotional music. While the Esraj became popular in Bihar, Bengal, Orissa and Assam, dilruba is more popular in Western India.</p>
<p>Some prominent musicians to have used dilruba with great effect are: Ashesh Banerjee, Pt. Shiv Dayal Batish, Pt. Ranadhir Ray, Kalipada Ghoushal, Buddhadeb Das, Master Sri Chinmoy, Pt. Ravi Shankar, SN. Bose, Shubhayu Sen Majumdar, Abir Singh Khangura, Alexandre Jurain, Jonathan Kay, Sougata Das, and Joel Goldsmith. The Beatles used it in ‘Within you without you’.

<h3 id="picture-the-song-we-say-yes-yes-yes-to-yenna-solla-pogirai-from-kandukondain-kandukondain">&ldquo;Picture the song: We say yes, yes, yes, to ‘Yenna Solla Pogirai’ from ‘Kandukondain Kandukondain’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s01.sgp1.digitaloceanspaces.com/facebook/870214-83184-rvrbiistii-1519740535.jpg" alt="img">
Shankar Mahadevan’s voice has a distinctive quality to it – it tends to fill the ears and embody a kind of surround sound quality.</p>
<p>Among the first times Mahadevan’s voice boomed through the screen was when hairstylist Deva (Prabhudeva) cries his heart out in the song Vennilave Vennilave in Rajiv Menon’s 1997 romantic drama Minsaara Kanavu. (The happier version was sung by Hariharan). Music composer AR Rahman knew that Mahadevan’s resonant and full-throttle singing would work perfectly for a moment of heartbreak. Mahadevan’s ability to hold higher and lower notes with equal strength and depth was remarkable.</p>
<p>Rahman has given Mahadevan some of the most memorable tracks of his multi-faceted career – Varaha Nadhikkarai Oram from Sangamam (1999), Uppu Karuvadu from Mudhalvan (1999), September Maadham from Alaipayuthey (2000), Thaniye from Rhythm (2000), the title track of Thenali (2000). These tracks highlight the classically-trained yet playback-ready voice of Mahadevan, who had by then established himself as a acclaimed composer along with Ehsan Noorani and Loy Mendosa and a versatile, multi-lingual singer.</p>
<p>The song that brought out the best of both Mahadevan as well as Rahman is from 2000, and is again from a Rajiv Menon film. Rahman composed Yenna Solla Pogirai from Kandukondain Kandukondain in Misra Kirvani raga and set it to a haunting rhythm with fascinating instrumental interludes. Menon visualised the song against the pyramids of Giza, which allows Mahadevan’s voice to echo and reverberate among the ancient monuments. Ajith and Tabu, dressed in Rajasthani outfits, convincingly play passionate lovers yearning to be together.</p>
<p>Yenna Solla Pogirai is the theme song of Manohar (Ajith) and Soumya (Tabu) in Kandukondain Kandukondain. Snatches of the song appear right from the moment when Manohar sets his eyes on Soumya. She mistakes him to be her prospective groom and agrees to the alliance. Manohar, an aspiring filmmaker, has come to ask if Soumya’s house can be rented out for a film shoot, and he feels sorry when Soumya realises the embarrassing truth. But it is love at first sight for both: he realises it, she is reluctant to admit it.</p>
<p>After they run into each other a couple of times, a determined Manohar confronts Soumya and asks her if she feels the same way as he does. Soumya mumbles a no, at which point Manohar breaks into Yenna Solla Pogirai.</p>
<p>The song begins with Mahadevan’s two-line solo before the instruments kick in. His voice matches Ajith’s searching and intense eyes as he asks Soumya what her final answer is going to be. In true filmmaker style, Manohar slips into a dream sequence in which they are star-crossed lovers in a desert. By the end, Soumya does give her consent to Manohar. Who would possibly turn down such a passionately sung proposal?</p>
<p>Mahadevan won a National Film Award for the track.

<h3 id="rahmans-musical-balm-for-chennai">&ldquo;Rahman’s musical balm for Chennai&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article13963166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mp18lead1jpg" alt="img">
The title couldn’t have been better. The concert was titled ‘Nenje Ezhu’, originally a song written for Tamil film Maryan, but could have well been reflective of the times Chennai underwent during the recent floods.</p>
<p>Music composer A.R.Rahman, who by his own admission has not performed much in his hometown, seemed to reserve all his energies for such rare occasions and got Chennaiites on their feet with his pulsating numbers at YMCA, Nandanam, on Saturday evening. It was a concert for a cause alright – the composer made it clear that it was like a slogan to cheer people and given them hope – but that wasn’t stopping him, or thousands of his fans, from having their share of fun, dancing and swaying to some foot-tapping numbers.</p>
<p>It was a musical treat to all those fans that had waited for the big day with bated breath, participated in contests, stood in long queues and arriving at the venue post much anxiety. But once in, all that was forgotten; all that they cared for was that one man on stage with microphone in hand.</p>
<p>Rahman might have gotten older – he turned 49 just a couple of weeks ago – but his songs from the 90s are an integral part of many Chennaiites’ childhood memories. Take ‘Mustafa Mustafa’, billed the ‘friendship anthem’, for instance. The popular ‘Oh Oh…’ catchphrase had the crowd swaying to it, their cellphone lights up in the air. Or the classical-based ‘Nila Kagirathu’ from Indira that had melody lovers go ‘ooh aah’ at every variation, every improvisation.</p>
<p>‘Nenje Ezhu’ was a musical mix of the composer’s works not just over the years but also across genres. Perhaps to do justice to them, singers from different backgrounds and experiences were roped in; if you had an accomplished Hariharan getting his fair share of attention with songs like ‘Kurukku Chiruthavale’ and ‘Vennilavae’, there was also youngsters like Haricharan and Sid Sriram getting the crowd on their feet, delivering ‘Uppu Karuvadu’ and ‘Yennodu Nee Irunthaal’ with panache.</p>
<p>Youngsters who tuned in to the composer’s tunes in recent years weren’t disappointed either; there was the fast-paced ‘Mersalayitten’, the sultry ‘Maiya Maiyaa’ and the melodic ‘Aye Sinamika’. Singer Sid Sriram (remember ‘Adiye’ from Kadal?) sprung a surprise on the unsuspecting audience by unleashing into ‘Thalli Pogathey’, his brand new song in the much-awaited Gautham Menon-Rahman offering Accham Enbathu Madamayada.</p>
<p>It was meant to be a pure Tamil concert, but Rahman made an exception by delivering an experimental version of ‘Dil Se’. Accompanied by a posse of talented musicians on stage, the song struck an instant chord with the audience.</p>
<p>The classical-inclined weren’t ignored either; there was the raga-based ‘Sowkiyamma’ on offer. The spirited, full-of-feel rendition of ‘Innum Konjam’ by Vijay Prakash and Shweta Mohan had their ears perked up as well. Folk lovers got more than what they would’ve expected, sampling songs like ‘Usilampatti’ and ‘Uppu Karuvaadu’.</p>
<p>‘Nenje Ezhu’ will also be presented in Coimbatore on January 23. The Hindu is the associate sponsor for the event. Part of the funds from the concert will go towards post-flood rehabilitation.</p>
<p>‘Let’s talk about love’</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the evening was the informal, fun setting of four accomplished singers – Srinivas, Karthik, Vijay Prakash and Haricharan – interacting with the Mozart of Madras, albeit musically. The song they chose was one forgotten melody Rahman fans dote on; ‘Pennalla Pennala’ from Uzhavan. The renditions were magical and a true throwback to his melodic magic in the 90s.</p>
<p>Making up for SPB</p>
<p>What can one do when a legendary singer like S.P.Balasubrahmanyam isn’t able to perform for a concert as scheduled? You get three young singers, and hope the audience will like the rendition for its fresh treatment.</p>
<p>SPB’s presence was missed at the ‘Nenje Ezhu’ evening, but the now-popular stars of film music made up by joining hands (or voices, should we say) for the superhit numbers. Those used to SPB’s energetic voice in numbers like ‘Oruvan Oruvan’ and ‘Ballelaka’ were in for a pleasant surprise as they saw Karthik, Benny Dayal and Haricharan dishing out special performance.
