<p>Former MTV Asia VJ Casey Miller (AKA KC Montero) and his wife were among 121 Filipinos and foreign nationals who were arrested at an upscale Makati City bar yesterday for alleged mass gathering, currently prohibited due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Makati police raided the 18th-floor roof deck of the watering hole Skye in Salcedo Village after it received reports that exclusive gatherings were being conducted at the posh lounge bar. At least 100 patrons, who were reportedly drinking alcohol, were arrested at around 5:35pm for allegedly violating social distancing rules. Aside from the customers, the establishment’s employees were also nabbed by the authorities.</p>
<p>Makati City bars, as well as other similar businesses in Metro Manila, are prohibited from operating under the general community quarantine. Restaurants and cafes however are allowed to accept up to 30% of their maximum number of customers.</p>

<p>One of the bar’s unnamed owners, who was among those arrested, told media that no violation was committed and said that as a restaurant, they were allowed to operate at a reduced capacity, maintaining that about 200 people were inside Skye during the raid when the place could accommodate up to 800 people.</p>
<p>According to reports, Montero said he and his wife Stephanie Dods went to Skye to have dinner and once the couple saw that it was opened, they assumed that drinking was allowed.</p>
<p>Makati Police refused Coconuts Manila‘s request for comments pending an investigation.</p>
<p>The purported violators were brought to the Makati City Police Station for booking procedures. A complaint could possibly be filed against them by the authorities for alleged violation of Republic Act No. 11332 or the Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases and Health Events of Public Health Concern Act.</p>

ARESTADO ang actor-host na si KC Montero at 120 iba pa dahil sa paglabag sa community quarantine guidelines at health protocols.</p>
<p>Isa si KC o Casey Miller sa tunay na buhay sa mga hinuli ng otoridad sa isang high-end resto-bar sa Makati kahapon dahil sa umano’y pagsasagawa ng “mass gathering.”</p>
<p>Ayon sa mga operatiba ng Makati police, nagsagawa sila ng operasyon sa nasabing resto-bar na matatagpuan sa 18th floor sa isang condominium sa Salcedo Village, Barangay Bel-Air base sa natanggap nilang intelligence report.</p>
<p>Nabatid na ilang beses na umanong nagsasagawa roon ng exclusive gatherings na hindi sumusunod sa health protocol, partikular na ang physical distancing.</p>
<p>Sa isang panayam kay KC, naroon sila ng asawa para mag-dinner lang, “That place was open before so parang feeling ko, okay. Why were they open if they’re not allowed to open?</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s my fault, I didn’t do my research. So feeling ko, they’re allowed to be open. So I went,” aniya.</p>
<p>Sinabi rin niya na nakasuot sila ng face mask at meron ding social distancing bukod pa sa magkakalayo ang mga mesa.</p>
<p>Base sa ulat, 91 customer ng resto bar at 19 empleyado nito ang hinuli at dinala sa Brgy. Guadalupe Nuevo Gym para ma-observe pa rin ang social distancing.</p>
<p>Na-inquest na sila kaninang umaga at posibleng makasuhan ng violation of Republic Act 11332 o ang Mandatory Reporting of Notifiable Diseases Law.

Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, April 29) — Aspiring lawyers scheduled to take the Bar examinations later this year will have to wait a little longer, with the Supreme Court postponing the conduct of the tests to &ldquo;sometime in 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Associate Justice Marvic Leonen, who chairs the 2020 Bar examinations panel, issued Bar Bulletin No. 11.S.2020 on Wednesday announcing the postponement of this year&rsquo;s Bar examinations due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the recommendation of the 2020 Bar Examinations Chairperson and in view of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the country, as well as the social and economic disruption caused by the pandemic and the resulting enhanced community quarantine, the Supreme Court en banc resolved to postone the 2020 Bar Examinations. This is to give the Court ample time to determine the necessary adjustments and to make adequate preparations for the safe and orderly conduct of the examinations,&rdquo; the bulletin read.</p>
<p>The announcement came on the same day the high court released the list of passers of the 2019 Bar exams.</p>
<p>The exams are held on four consecutive Sundays in the University of Santo Tomas campus in Manila. Results are usually released around March or April of the succeeding year.</p>
<p>The top court said the new schedule for the series of tests will be announced by June 2020 &ldquo;when the current adjustments to the present pandemic becomes clearer,&rdquo; adding that the examinations will &ldquo;definitely be held sometime in 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next round of tests for law students will be held in Manila as well as in Cebu City.

Parañaque city hall, court to handle only limited transactions on Monday Share it! Share Tweet</p>
<p>By Jean Fernando</p>
<p>The Parañaque City government announced that the city hall and the court only have limited transactions on Monday.</p>
<p>In an interview with City Administrator lawyer Ding Soriano, he said the offices of the city government will be handled by a skeletal force.</p>
<p>On the closure of some night spots and bar-and-grills located in the city last Friday night, the recommendation was made by the police to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID19).</p>
<p>Soriano said after the recommendation was made by the police, Mayor Edwin Olivarez immediately came out with an order to close all the night spots and bar-and-grills in the city.</p>
<p>Soriano said the police conducted a visit to the night spots and bars last Friday and found that those establishments were not following the protocols to prevent virus spread, such as having on the premises thermal scanners, alcohol, and hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>The city administrator also admitted that they have a number of persons under investigation (PUI) in some hospitals in the city, but could not give the number or any other details.</p>
<p>Soriano added that with the recommendation from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for the temporary closure of malls and other establishments with public gatherings, the Task Force against COVID19 will convene on Monday to set guidelines.</p>
<p>He also added that the city government will heed the recommendation of the MMDA for the temporary closure of malls and other establishments, but that some studies have to be made.</p>
<p>“For the recommendation of the MMDA to implement curfew, we still have to set some guidelines,” Soriano said.
