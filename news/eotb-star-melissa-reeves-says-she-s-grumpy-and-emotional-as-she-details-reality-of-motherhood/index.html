<p>Melissa Reeves has shared a candid insight into her &lsquo;hard&rsquo; first few weeks as a mother after revealing she and her newborn daughter battled sepsis during labour.</p>
<p>The former Ex On The Beach contestant, 26, said she was &lsquo;grumpy and emotional&rsquo; as she admitted she wanted to be transparent with her followers about the realities of what it&rsquo;s like to be a new mum.</p>
<p>In one Instagram post, Melissa shared an image as she breastfed her three-week-old baby girl, Vienna Simpson Reeves, noting her breast milk had leaked through her bra overnight.</p>
<p>New mum: Melissa Reeves has shared a candid insight into her first few weeks as a mother after revealing she and her newborn daughter battled sepsis during labour</p>
<p>She captioned the honest snap: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m probably gonna get a lot of stick for posting this but I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I post a lot of glamorous pics of me &amp; my baby, but that&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t the reality of motherhood, and I feel like I shouldn&rsquo;t create a false illusion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Motherhood is hard, it&rsquo;s worth it but it is hard. This is the reality&hellip;.Messy greasy hair, dark circles around my eyes, my boobs are veiny, and huge because I was lucky enough for the baby not to wake up much during the night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unlike the night before where I got absolutely no sleep. The sleep deprivation makes me cranky, feel grumpy, and sometimes even emotional.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this picture my milk has leaked right through my bra because I some how lost my nipple pad in the night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I smell like baby sick, and there&rsquo;s pee on my bed where she decided to pee whilst I was changing her nappy during the night.</p>
<p>Honest: In another post, Melissa revealed that she had decided to start pumping in order to share the load of feeding occasionally if she needs a break</p>
<p>Sharing an image of herself using the pumps, she wrote: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to start pumping to take some weight off my shoulders so that someone else can occasionally feed Vienna if I need a break or if I need someone to baby sit her&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is what it&rsquo;s like having a newborn, &amp; I wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. No matter how tired I feel, or how many poo explosions there are. My baby girl is worth absolutely all of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Melissa shared snaps taken during three-day labour and revealed that both she and her daughter battled sepsis following an emergency C-section.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all glamour! The Ex On The Beach contestant, 26, admitted that she wanted to be transparent with her followers as she posted the realities of what it&rsquo;s like to be a new mum</p>
<p>Taking to Instagram, the TV personality admitted &lsquo;nothing went smoothly&rsquo; and her &lsquo;birth plan went out the window&rsquo; alongside photographs of her struggling with the pain while attempting to have a water birth, before sharing a link to a YouTube video.</p>
<p>Melissa captioned the photographs: &lsquo;This time last week I was going through one of the most surreal experiences of my life&hellip;. Labour!</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a completely different experience than I ever could have ever imagined, my birth plan went out the window &amp; absolutely nothing went smoothly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can honestly credit my hypnobirthing course I did with @thismumliverpool for keeping me calm throughout this entire process.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lots of people have messaged asking why my baby &amp; I had to stay in hospital for 5 days so I&rsquo;ve done a YouTube video just talking about my labour and explaining why we had to stay in the hospital. The link is in my bio.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Candid: Earlier this month, Melissa shared snaps taken during three-day labour and revealed that both she and her daughter battled sepsis following an emergency C-section</p>
<p>Melissa described her labouring journey, which began on on a Thursday, with her baby arriving three days later on Sunday May 24.</p>
<p>After struggling to get over 2cm dilated for days, having a hormone drip to help bring on active labour and an epidural to help with the pain.</p>
<p>Eventually, after doctors suggested she should consider a caesarean, Melissa was taken into surgery within 20 minutes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could feel the sensation of them cutting me open and moving around trying to get the baby around.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was so scared but as soon as I heard that baby cry it was like everything just went away.</p>
<p>Saying it how it is: Melissa praised hypnobirthing for helping keep her calm throughout</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t scared anymore. Nothing mattered. And they pulled out the little curtain in front of me and I got to see the baby for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was so surreal that I forgot that I was just lying on a theatre table with my belly open.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing mattered. The pain I&rsquo;d been going through for the past three days didn&rsquo;t matter. The love I felt was overwhelming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After the caesarian. I was 39.6 degrees celsius. Baby had a temperature. I was going a bit faint. It turned out there was an infection in my womb.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They took baby away and gave baby some antibiotics. They gave me some antibiotics. We were treated for sepsis. That&rsquo;s why we were in hospital for 5 days.</p>
<p>Melissa&rsquo;s babies infection rate started at a terrifying 56 but five days later was down to 6, and the pair were allowed to return home.</p>
<p>New mum: Melissa took to Instagram to announce that she had given birth to a baby girl</p>
<p>Melissa&rsquo;s video came after she took to social media to announce that she had given birth to a baby girl, sharing the happy news with her 149k followers.</p>
<p>The Liverpool-born reality star welcomed her daughter with footballer Danny Simpson, 33, after a short-lived romance between the pair.</p>
<p>Melissa shared an adorable picture with her newborn as she discussed her traumatic labour experience.</p>
<p>She penned: &lsquo;24/05/2020 My world changed forever my baby girl arrived right on her due date words can’t describe how in love with this little angle [angel] I am. I feel so happy and blessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was in labour for 3 days, then we had to opt for a C section because it turns out she is one big baby, she’s 8lb 11!!&rsquo;

<p>Why Dr. Melissa Reeves from Twister looks so familiar</p>
<p>Some movies just get memory holed. Big budget event films that don&rsquo;t seem to say anything beyond the confines of their 90-minute-plus run time or zeitgeisty movies that fade with the fads they rode in on become less of a film and more of a trivia question. So it was with Twister, the disaster movie rewritten as a romcom that exuded also-ran in everything it did. It was the second-highest grossing film of 1996, eventually losing out on its effects and production Oscar noms to movies like Independence Day. The movie seemed destined to inspire vague recognition from some people and blank stares from anyone born after 1990.</p>
<p>But Twister is back in the conversation over two decades after its release, as a testament to Netflix&rsquo;s ability to start discussion. The Bill Paxton-led effects bonanza was added to the streaming service this month, and has fans snapping at their screens trying to recall why some of its supporting characters seem so familiar.</p>
<p>Bill Paxton has a deep catalog to pull from, Helen Hunt was a pop culture fixture of the &rsquo;90s, and Cary Elwes will always bring The Princess Bride to mind. Jami Gertz, though, is more of a reach. Still, anyone with more than a passing familiarity with &rsquo;90s television or &rsquo;80s teen movies has definitely seen her before.

<p>&ldquo;24/05/2020 My world changed forever 💞 my baby girl arrived right on her due date 💗 words can’t describe how in love with this little angel I am. I feel so happy and blessed. 👶🏼 🍼 ,&rdquo; Reeves captioned a may 25 Instagram photo of herself nursing her baby girl in a hospital bed. &ldquo;I was in labour for 3 days, then we had to opt for a C section because it turns out she is one big baby, she’s 8lb 11!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image zoom</p>
<p>Although Reeves, who competed on Total Madness, announced her daughter&rsquo;s arrival one day after the birth, she waited more than a week to &ldquo;properly introduce&rdquo; her followers to the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’d like to properly introduce you all to my baby girl&hellip;.. Her name Vienna Simpson Reeves 🥰,&rdquo; she captioned a snap of herself gazing at her daughter while lying down beside Vienna. &ldquo;Born on 24/05/2020 weighing 8lb 11 👶🏽 For years Iv heard people say that there’s no love like a mothers love, and for the first time in my life I finally understand that. From the second she was born I felt this lioness motherly instinct kick in. I am completely besotted with her 🥰.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image zoom Melissa Reeves with her newborn daughter Melissa Reeves/instagram</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’ve known your dad for such a long time now, I never would have imagined that one day he would give me this perfect little girl. We are so lucky and blessed to have created such a beautiful, healthy baby girl. We love you Vienna ❤️ @dannysimpson,&rdquo; she said, tagging English soccer player Danny Simpson. (He has yet to comment about the birth on social media.)</p>
<p>Reflecting on her baby&rsquo;s birth in a May 31 Instagram post, Reeves admitted that it &ldquo;was a completely different experience than I ever could have ever imagined&rdquo; and that &ldquo;my birth plan went out the window &amp; absolutely nothing went smoothly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while the new mom was loving soaking up quality time at the hospital with the newborn, she was unable to have visitors due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So me &amp; baby only have 2 more nights left in hospital until we can finally go home 💗 As much as I’m absolutely loving having her all to myself whilst staying in hospital It’s also been really hard not being able to have any visitor’s because of #coronavirus,&rdquo; she captioned a May 28 post of herself and the sleeping infant at the Liverpool Women&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s sad that our loved ones haven’t even been able to meet her yet. We did have a Simba moment at the hospital window so my dad could meet his granddaughter. As nice as it was for him to be able to see her, I felt so bad on him that he can’t meet her yet and give her a cuddle,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I feel like Iv been living in my own bubble since she was born. I can’t put into words how happy &amp; blessed I feel to have her. I just sit and stare at her in awe of how perfect she is. I feel so lucky. She really is the love of my life ❤️.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that Reeves is at home with little Vienna, the mom and daughter are enjoying lots of cuddle time.</p>
<p>In a post shared over the weekend, Reeves wore a pink robe that matched her baby girl&rsquo;s swaddle as they enjoyed a &ldquo;lazy Sunday&rdquo; at home.</p>
<p>In mid-January, the British reality star announced that she was pregnant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mini me coming summer 2020 👶 🍼&rdquo; she captioned a bikini photo of herself cradling her bump.</p>
<p>According to Reeves&rsquo; Instagram profile, she is raising her daughter as a single mother.

<p>Melissa shared an adorable picture with her newborn as she discussed her traumatic labour experience.</p>
<p>She penned: &lsquo;24/05/2020 My world changed forever my baby girl arrived right on her due date words can’t describe how in love with this little angle [angel] I am. I feel so happy and blessed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was in labour for 3 days, then we had to opt for a C section because it turns out she is one big baby, she’s 8lb 11!!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Baby daddy: The Liverpool-born reality star welcomed her daughter with shamed footballer Danny Simpson, 33, after a short-lived romance between the pair</p>
<p>At the end of last week, Melissa revealed that she &lsquo;was in the early stages of labour&rsquo; and had a sweep - a procedure which is intended to kick-start labour.</p>
<p>Taking to Instagram with a stunning shot of herself in a polka-dot dress, she wrote: &lsquo;I had a sweep &amp; my midwife told me I was already 2cm dilated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had every sign of labour except for my waters haven&rsquo;t broken &amp; my contractions are irregular.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were regular enough to keep me awake most of the night but I am still only in the early stages of labour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Footballer Danny has become a father for the second time following the birth of his baby with Melissa as he shares daughter Skye, 8, with his ex-girlfriend Stephanie Ward.</p>
<p>Back in March, Melissa took to her Instagram Stories and posted an ultrasound image which included the title: &lsquo;Baby of Melissa and Danny,&rsquo; hinting that Danny Simpson was the mystery father of her then-unborn child.</p>
<p>A close friend of the reality star confirmed the father&rsquo;s identity to MailOnline, revealing at the time that he &lsquo;hadn&rsquo;t given ANY financial support&rsquo; during her pregnancy to date.</p>
<p>One long weekend! Taking to Instagram at the end of last week, alongside a stunning shot of herself in a polka-dot dress, Melissa revealed that she &lsquo;was in the early stages of labour&rsquo;</p>
<p>Melissa, who announced in January that she was pregnant, has not yet publicly confirmed who the father is, and the Huddersfield Town pro, hasn&rsquo;t commented on the reports either.</p>
<p>A close friend of the reality star-turned DJ told MailOnline: &lsquo;Melissa hasn&rsquo;t had any outside help or support throughout her pregnancy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She paid for her baby shower herself and has never asked for a penny from Danny.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s looking forward to raising her daughter as a single mother, and can&rsquo;t wait to meet her baby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although the footballer and the reality star are not in a relationship, friends of the right-back have claimed that he is standing by her.</p>

<p>A friend of Danny&rsquo;s reportedly told The Sun: &lsquo;Danny and Melissa&rsquo;s relationship didn&rsquo;t work out but he has vowed to support her financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They have agreed to co-parent their little girl as best they can. It&rsquo;s a shame they haven&rsquo;t worked things out as a couple.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the insider: &lsquo;Melissa understands why Danny is not publicising the fact that he&rsquo;s the father of her child — but she said he&rsquo;s been great behind the scenes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not in the picture: According to the source close to Melissa, the reality star &lsquo;has never asked for a penny from Danny&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the source, former Leicester City player Danny &lsquo;picked up the tab&rsquo; for Melissa&rsquo;s recent white themed baby shower at Hope Street hotel, in Liverpool - something which her friends strongly refute.</p>
<p>Danny&rsquo;s friend also claimed that the footballer has assisted the reality star in kitting out her home in preparation for the baby&rsquo;s arrival, insisting Melissa has &lsquo;wanted for nothing during her pregnancy&rsquo; - again, a claim which her friends say is untrue.</p>
<p>MailOnline contacted Melissa Reeves&rsquo; representatives for comment at the time.</p>
<p>Danny Simpson&rsquo;s representatives declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.</p>
<p>Independent woman: &lsquo;She paid for her baby shower herself&rsquo; Melissa&rsquo;s pal told MailOnline following her recent white party at Hope Street Hotel to celebrate her upcoming arrival</p>

<h3 id="melissa-reeves-praised-for-breastfeeding-picture-in-honest-post-about-motherhood">&ldquo;Melissa Reeves praised for breastfeeding picture in honest post about motherhood&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article22175214.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Mel-Reeves.jpg" alt="img">
Melissa Reeves has been applauded by fans after sharing an honest post about the realities of looking after a newborn baby.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Ex On The Beach star took to social media to explain to her fans that she didn&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;create a false illusion&rsquo; about her experience of motherhood.</p>
<p>In the picture, the first time mum looked loving at her tiny newborn daughter, Vienna Simpson Reeves, while breastfeeding.</p>
<p>The blonde bombshell, who welcomed her baby with footballer Danny Simpson, acknowledged that she didn&rsquo;t care about receiving criticism over the candid snap.</p>
<p>Wearing just a bra, the first time parent went on to detail the reality of what was going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m probably gonna get a lot of stick for posting this but I don’t really care,&rdquo; she began in her lengthy post.</p>
<p>(Image: Instagram)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I post a lot of glamorous pics of me &amp; my baby, but that’s isn’t the reality of motherhood, and I feel like I shouldn’t create a false illusion. Motherhood is hard, it’s worth it but it is hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the reality&hellip;.Messy greasy hair, dark circles around my eyes, my boobs are veiny, and huge because I was lucky enough for the baby not to wake up much during the night.</p>
<p>Melissa added that she had experienced lots of sleepless nights and plenty of emotions since welcoming her baby.</p>
<p>She continued: &ldquo;Unlike the night before where I got absolutely no sleep. The sleep deprivation makes me cranky, feel grumpy, and sometimes even emotional.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this picture my milk has leaked right through my bra because I some how lost my nipple pad in the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell like baby sick, and there’s pee on my bed where she decided to pee whilst I was changing her nappy during the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is what it’s like having a new born, &amp; I wouldn’t change anything. No matter how tired I feel, or how many poo explosions there are. My baby girl is worth absolutely all of it,&rdquo; Melissa concluded.</p>
<p>Since sharing the honest post, the television star has been inundated with messages from doting fans who praised the candid topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The realness. just shows your too busy being a good mama to care about anything else,&rdquo; wrote one fan.</p>
<p>Another added: Love this. This is REAL motherhood thank you. I’m a mom of three. I know the struggle and love.&rdquo;</p>
