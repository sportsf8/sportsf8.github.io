<p>Ankita Lokhande had found love in the co-owner of the Mumbai team of the Box Cricket League, Vicky Jain, whom she had met through common friends. Ankita and Vicky had eventually become friends and had started hanging out with each other. In a Bombay Times interview, Ankita Lokhande had confessed that she and Vicky Jain are very much in love but there are no plans to get married anytime soon. Ankita had stated, &ldquo;Love is really important for me because I believe in it. I believe in giving love to everyone, including my family, dogs and myself, and not just the person I get married to. Relationships are very important because that&rsquo;s the bond you share with someone and that&rsquo;s how love grows between people. Marriage has always been my dream. I have always wanted to get married. But at this point, my priorities have changed. I am really looking forward to more films.&rdquo; (Also Read: Anurag Kashyap Tries To Copy 19-Year-Old Daughter, Aaliyah&rsquo;s Dance Steps, Leaves Her Laughing Hard)</p>
