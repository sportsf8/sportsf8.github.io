Dolly Parton Wants To Cover Playboy Again For Her 75th Birthday!

Let’s get one thing clear: Dolly Parton has no intention of slowing down anytime soon!

The beloved country music star, 74, recently sat down for an interview with 60 Minutes Australia where she opened up about her storied career and revealed she doesn’t ever plan on retiring from music. Considering her continued accolades over the years, this may not come as a surprise to some! In fact, she is feeling so good about herself these days, she’d jump at the chance to recreate an iconic moment from her past.

The Jolene singer admitted:

“I don’t plan to retire. I just turned 74 and I plan to be on the cover of Playboy magazine again.”

Well, okay then! Get it, girl!

Parton continued:

“See I did Playboy magazine years ago and I thought it’d be such a hoot if they’ll go for it — I don’t know if they will — if I could be on the cover again when I’m 75.”

Hypothetically, we’d have to wait a whole year to see this happen as Dolly just celebrated her last birthday in January. But viewers could be in for a treat as she joked about possibly recreating the original cover — racy costume and all! When asked about the outfit, she quipped:

“I could probably use it. Boobs are still the same.”

As she mentioned, Parton appeared on the magazine’s October 1978 cover decades ago when she was 32 years old. The 9 to 5 singer sported the brand’s iconic bunny outfit and ears as she became the first country star to grace the glossy’s cover, an accomplishment she’s clearly still proud of!

WATCH her reminisce about it all in the clip (below):

“Well, I don't plan to retire. I just turned 74!“ With her signature charm and unique voice, it’s so easy to see why fans will always love @DollyParton #60Mins pic.twitter.com/RlPme7tumJ — 60 Minutes Australia (@60Mins) March 8, 2020

Ahh, what’s not to love about that timeless charm and sense of humor? We’re so intrigued by this idea. Sure, the mag has moved on to putting the likes of Kylie Jenner on its front page, but let’s consider this a throwback for the ages!

Later in the interview, Parton got candid about aging and the plastic surgery she’s had done over the years. Explaining why she’s content with her look as she continues to grow older and why she likely won’t be going under the knife again, the septuagenarian said:

“I’ve had about all the nips and tucks I can have. The good part with me though, I have my own look. I look kind of cartoonish and cartoons don’t really age that much.”

Good point! She continued to describe her signature look:

“Even when I’m 90, I’ll still probably look about the same way. Just thicker make-up and bigger hair.”

Nice! As you may or may not be aware, Parton has a new A&E documentary special coming out titled Biography: Dolly. It is said to follow her inspiring journey to stardom and will premiere on the network on April 12 at 8 p.m. EST. Here’s to hoping we get more funny and candid moments like this throughout!
