Actor Harry Hains died from an accidental fentanyl intoxication, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner.

The 27-year-old, who died on Jan. 7, was best known for his roles in "American Horror Story" and "The OA."

Hains isn't the only young star to die recently from the drug, which the Center for Disease Control describes as "a synthetic opioid pain reliever." In January, rising Twin Cities rapper Lexii Alijai died at 21 as a result of an overdose of fentanyl and alcohol, according to a medical examiner's report. In October, TobyMacâ€™s son, Truett Foster McKeehan, died at 21 after accidentally overdosing on fentanyl and amphetamines, according to autopsy and toxicology reports.

Hains' mother, actress Jane Badler, broke the news of his death in an Instagram post at the time.

"On Jan. 7 my beautiful son died. He was 27 and had the world at his feet. But sadly he struggled with mental illness and addiction," she wrote. "A brilliant spark shone bright too short a time ... I will miss you Harry every day of my life ... "

Celebrities and non-celebrities alike took to the comment section to send their thoughts and prayers.

Actress Lois Robbins wrote, "Love you Jane. My heart breaks for you and your family. RIP beautiful Harry."

Actor Shawn Ashmore wrote, "I am so sorry for you loss Jane!!"

Actress Celia Freijeiro wrote, "I am so deeply sorry for your loss, Jane. Sending you and your family love and support."

In addition to "American Horror Story" and "The OA," the Melbourne-born star was also known for his role in the 2016 drama "The Surface."

Badler is best known for playing Shannon Reed in the "Mission: Impossible" television series from 1989 to 1990 and playing Diana in the television series "V" from 1984 to 1985.
