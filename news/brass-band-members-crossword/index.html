<p>A few months ago, the band hall at Loveland High School would be packed at lunchtime. After hauling their meals from the cafeteria or bringing their bagged lunch, students would plop down on the floor, leaning against the walls of instrument lockers. It was a break from the day to just talk, eat, play games and listen to music. Simpler times.</p>
<p>Lunch period may seem like a distant memory now that families have been isolating in their homes due to the coronavirus pandemic. Schools across the U.S. have resorted to online learning for their students. But don’t worry, Loveland’s band students have found another place to hang out.</p>
<p>Twice a week, 30 to 40 kids log into Mr. Freesen’s &ldquo;office hours&rdquo; on Google Meet to chat, play trivia, share a digital crossword puzzle—one kid even showed off their pet duck. Kyle Freesen heads up the band program at Loveland. And lately, there have been a lot of questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the big questions is, &lsquo;Is there going to be marching band?'&rdquo; Freesen says. He doesn’t have an answer for that.</p>
<p>The Loveland clarinets practicing in 2019</p>
<p>As school districts ponder if and when students can return safely, for marching bands, practice for next season was scheduled to start as early as June. Without official word from state governments, summer rehearsal time is at stake. It could mean huge changes for their September shows. As time ticks on, band directors wonder if they should shelve their entire show and just wait until 2021. But what would that mean for students?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to be incredibly disappointed,&rdquo; says Janis Gregoire, whose 15-year-old daughter Emma found her identity with the marching band at Loveland High School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She’s generally quiet and shy, and I was a little concerned that she&rsquo;d get lost in high school,&rdquo; Gregoire says, explaining how Emma had gotten a head start as a freshman by participating in summer band camp. &ldquo;She started her first day of high school with 200 best friends of all different grades that she knew from band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the risk of disappointing everyone in the class, the predicament has put band directors in a pickle. Stay home or start practicing to keep up with their competition?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want these kids to have this experience because they love it, but at the same time, you don’t want to get any kids sick,&rdquo; James Shuman, band director at Rocky Hill High School in Connecticut, says. Connecticut is nearing 40,000 COVID-19 cases, as of this writing.</p>
<p>With the marching band community at risk, what can schools do to make sure kids stay safe but don’t miss out?</p>
<p>Marching Six Feet Apart</p>
<p>Social distancing measures are likely whenever school returns, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but getting a band together to expel air doesn&rsquo;t exactly sound like the safest thing to do. Certainly, schools don’t want a repeat of March&rsquo;s infamous choir practice in Mount Vernon, Washington, where 87 percent of the group contracted COVID-19 from one person. The choir quickly became one of the first examples for social distancing.</p>
<p>However, could it be easier for marching bands to social distance, given they practice outdoors where kids can space out and air isn&rsquo;t so stagnant?</p>
<p>Sure, formations can adjust for the CDC’s six-feet-apart recommendation, but that’s about it, says Shuman.</p>
<p>Rocky Hill High School&rsquo;s marching band at a championship competition in 2019</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone’s seen any kids in marching band, as soon as you stop rehearsing, they’ll clump together and they’re all over each other,&rdquo; Shuman says. &ldquo;They’re gonna be kids. They&rsquo;re gonna be holding hands and pushing each other and playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s travel, too, which would be pretty costly. &ldquo;It would take five, maybe six buses to actually have six feet of social distancing,&rdquo; says Carl Wylie, who leads the Travelers Rest High School band in South Carolina. Wylie reports that one day-long outing could set them back nearly a thousand dollars per bus.</p>
<p>Masks aren&rsquo;t an option for students while playing, but there has been some non-scientific talk of devices that could minimize the spread of droplets. One company in Maryland has started to market their bell coverings for brass instruments—usually used for decorative purposes—as &ldquo;Corona Virus Bell Covers&rdquo; with the tagline &ldquo;It’s a face mask for your bell.&rdquo; Scientific tests on these products are either ongoing or haven&rsquo;t started.</p>
<p>So far, only Texas schools are projected to start practice on June 8.</p>
<p>Teaching Music From Afar</p>
<p>Since you can&rsquo;t really conduct band from a laptop, teachers are getting creative. We&rsquo;re talking practice journals, music theory worksheets, listening assignments and music history readings. Shuman even created a bracket for students to battle out which song from Star Wars is the best. Anything to keep the kids stimulated. But it&rsquo;s a struggle. Band has lost the essence of collaboration; instead, it’s mutated into individual study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can feel that even our music classes are becoming more and more a class to sit and observe instead of participate in,&rdquo; says Sarah Wake, an 11th grader who was actively involved in band at Delaware Academy in New York before lockdown.</p>
<p>The collaboration problem can be patched up, but not fixed. Wylie instructs his students to write music for their friends to play. Shuman&rsquo;s seniors even edited together a performance of &ldquo;Pomp and Circumstance&rdquo; to play at their own virtual graduation. But those assignments don&rsquo;t fill the void of band practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss the chaos that we all complain about, the corny jokes told by our band director that we all roll our eyes at,&rdquo; Wake says. &ldquo;I miss complaining about playing a scale other than concert Bb, quietly laughing with my section when we should be listening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And not every kid thrives with distance learning—there are too many outside forces at play.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don’t know what’s happening in their homes,&rdquo; Wylie says. &ldquo;I don’t know what their internet is. I don’t know what their family lives are. I don’t know what their other struggles are… It’s hard to teach like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From a kid’s perspective, it’s just as bleak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is really easy to fall into the dark place of this doesn’t matter, grades don’t matter, my teacher won’t notice or care if I don&rsquo;t turn something in, which can quickly become my teachers don’t notice me, I don’t matter,&rdquo; Wake says.</p>
<p>Online Marching Band</p>
<p>Teaching marching band, specifically, is something completely different. It’s like holding football practice online. It just doesn’t work.</p>
<p>First, there’s recruiting and auditions—both nearly impossible if students accidentally left their equipment at school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of the percussionists are like, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m tired of playing on the floor. I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m not getting any better,'&rdquo; Freesen says.</p>
<p>Freesen linked up with a &ldquo;band dad&rdquo; to hitch up a trailer and distribute instruments—because even though percussionists can practice with pots and pans (some students even drew cardboard keyboards of their marimbas), it’s clearly not the same.</p>
<p>Incoming Loveland High School freshman, Konnor S. doesn&rsquo;t have a marimba at home so he built a practice keyboard</p>
<p>Even getting the word out about color guard has been difficult for Freesen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There’s no kid that&rsquo;s picked up a flag before,&rdquo; Freesen says, adding that he’s depending on band members to recruit their friends. &ldquo;&lsquo;Hey, we’ll drop a flag off at your house and send you videos on how to do color guard.&rsquo; It’s just so weird.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>After online auditions comes online rehearsal, or &ldquo;marching band prep,&rdquo; as Freesen calls it. The visual staff makes choreography videos for students, and when the kids learn each phrase, they send back a video for scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The staff go on and say, &lsquo;Great job, Hannah, make sure you watch your left hand,'&rdquo; Freesen says.</p>
<p>One such staff member is Kelci Hartz, a recent music education graduate from Colorado State University, who works part-time at Loveland High School teaching choreography. Hartz believes there&rsquo;s actually a positive to this way of learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It definitely isn&rsquo;t the same as teaching in person, but I do think there&rsquo;s benefit in the students having a video that they can slow down and replay as many times as they need to,&rdquo; Hartz says. &ldquo;This helps them to self-differentiate based on the way they learn best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kelci Hartz breaks down choreography for marching band students at Loveland High School</p>
<p>As deadlines near, band directors are sketching out &ldquo;plan A through E,&rdquo; Freesen says. Will they have enough time to learn their show? Will their routines be cut? Will competition hosts be friendly to them considering the circumstances?</p>
<p>The answer to the latter is, well, yes. A representative at Bands of America, an organization that runs major regional marching band competitions in the midwest, told the Recording Academy that they are loosening up their guidelines for shows, like time requirements. BOA is also considering alternatives to live competitions. Perhaps they will delve into the virtual world as well.</p>
<p>Needless to say, when bands are finally able to reunite, they’ve got work to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we get back together to make music, I expect it to be pretty wonderful no matter how it sounds,&rdquo; Wylie says. &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause we’ll be back doing what we do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Money Problem</p>
<p>While Bands of America is making it easier for bands to march on, there’s still one big question mark lingering over schools across the nation: money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assume most districts are going to be slashed quite a bit,&rdquo; Shuman says. &ldquo;You have so many people out of work. Tax money drives what we do. So without that money there, can you fund a season? Will we be allowed to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marching band isn’t a cheap extracurricular, as budgets of top division bands rival those of athletic programs. There&rsquo;s uniforms, uniform cleaning, music copyright, staff (arrangers, drum line coaches, show designers, etc.), meals and travel—not only for the kids, but for their massive amount of equipment. Fees for a single BOA competition range from $300 to $975. One blogger proclaimed marching band “The Most Expensive Sport In America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Loveland High School&rsquo;s impression formations</p>
<p>Some bands require individual fees to join, and those could run quite high. At Loveland High School, it costs $585 (which is on the high end in Colorado, low end for marching band-obsessed states like Indiana and Texas, Freesen says).</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we have kids who say, ‘I want to be in marching band but my parents can’t afford $600&rsquo;?&rdquo; Freesen says. &ldquo;We have to figure out how to make that work. We still have to pay our staff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sponsors are crucial, but getting a local business to contribute in the middle of an economic crisis—the latest unemployment report shows 36.5 million Americans out of work—doesn’t seem like an easy task.</p>
<p>Essential fundraisers have already been canceled as well. Freesen hopes that they can carry on with contact-less fundraisers, like the fireworks sales they do every summer. But performance-based fundraisers are less likely. At the end of the May, Rocky Hill lost out on the usual $2,000 they normally would make at their jazz band dinner. For Travelers Rest High School, fundraisers account for 70 percent of their revenue, Wylie says. But without fundraisers, bands will have to pare down drastically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to do this low budget,&rdquo; Wylie says. &ldquo;We’re going to have to keep the cost of bussing down. We’re going to have to not do as many props as I want. I’m buying inexpensive stock productions. I’m not paying thousands of dollars to an arranger or a drill writer. We do a lot of stuff in-house. We keep our staff down. I&rsquo;ve known bands to walk onto the field with $150,000 they&rsquo;ve spent on their shows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But cutting down a show poses a problem too. With arrangers, drill, drum teachers and choreographers all depending on part-time work across multiple schools, they could be out of a job. Drum Corps. International, which hosts a tour and competition over the summer, has already canceled their events until 2021, resulting in layoffs. BOA&rsquo;s parent organization Music For All also had to furlough 38 percent of their full-time staff.</p>
<p>With money in question for music programs, bands will have to rely on school budget—a.k.a. the money they get from taxpayers. When it comes down to it, Freesen hopes taxpayers realize how much the music program means to students. School is so much more than the classroom, and he hopes future voting reflects that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re giving them a place to be that&rsquo;s warm and safe, with adults that are safe and care about them,&rdquo; Freesen says. &ldquo;Not every kid has that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>School also provides kids with meals, which Freesen sees firsthand when his students gather in his band room—and he worries for the student who told him that they hate breaks because there&rsquo;s no food at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can’t fully understand what it’s like to go, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m bummed to have spring break&rsquo; when the kid who sits next to you is going to Hawaii for spring break and you’re worried you’re not going to have enough food,&rdquo; Freesen says.</p>
<p>Until school opens up again, Freesen’s office hours remain hoppin&rsquo; with kids aching to get back on the field… or at least back into the band room for a lunchtime hang.</p>

<h3 id="brass-band-boogie-and-beer-mardi-gras-crawl-consumes-el-cajon-boulevard">&ldquo;Brass band, boogie and beer: Mardi Gras Crawl consumes El Cajon Boulevard&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/130e3ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+330/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5b%2F7e%2Fba6e63304feb9fbc3ad6e3fdd16f%2Fsd-photos-1staff-497072-sd-me-marid-gras-001.jpg" alt="img">
Hundreds of San Diegans donned purple, green and gold beads, feather boas, elaborate masks and top hats on Sunday for the third annual Boulevard Mardi Gras Crawl along El Cajon Boulevard in North Park.</p>
<p>Folks sucked down pints of beer and ate crawfish around noon at The Beer Igniter where the event started, with more than 300 people following members of the Euphoria Brass Band on a tour of local businesses.</p>
<p>The event — held two days before Mardi Gras in New Orleans — culminated in a dance party at the historic Lafayette Hotel on El Cajon Boulevard at Louisiana Street.</p>
<p>“It’s a fun day,” said county Supervisor Nathan Fletcher, who helped lead the parade with his wife, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, as the event’s grand marshals. “In a time when it seems like so much of what we’re obsessed with is dark and divisive, it’s just nice to see people out having a good time and supporting local businesses.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The event was organized by the El Cajon Boulevard Business Improvement Association and included, among other local companies, Pariah Brewing, Folk Art Rare Records, JuneShine Kombucha and Asian-Cajun restaurant Shrimp Heads.</p>
<p>Beryl Forman, marketing and mobility coordinator for the business association, said she was inspired to help put on the event after visiting New Orleans and taking part in the second line parades, which are also usually held on Sundays.</p>
<p>“It’s very much about bringing in the business community and showcasing it, building that center around El Cajon Boulevard where the residents see it as their downtown,” Forman said.</p>
<p>Shirley Ng, 33, owner of Shrimp Heads, which opened a year ago on El Cajon Boulevard at Utah Street, doled out seafood at the start of the event for those looking to fuel up before the parade.</p>

<p>“We’ve seen a lot of regulars today giving us props,” she said. “It’s really cute.”</p>
<p>The brass band was in full swing when the march down El Cajon kicked off. Drummer Ron Bocian, who moved to San Diego from New Orleans in 2006 after Hurricane Katrina, participated in the crawl for his third year.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a little piece of home,” said the 51-year-old. “It’s a great thing to have this here locally.”</p>
<p>Andrea Ryan, 53, a North Park resident, said it was her second year attending the event.</p>

<p>“I could be sitting home on the couch watching Netflix or I could be out in the sun on a beautiful Sunday enjoying live music and dancing and friends and alcohol,” she said with a big grin.</p>
<p>Taylor Pondy, who moved to San Diego from Arizona a few years ago, said she happened upon the event while walking around North Park.</p>
<p>“I was just looking around and saw this,” said the 24-year-old. “I love Mardi Gras, so I just decided to join the party and have fun.”</p>
<p>The parade comes as the business association has pursed a campaign to encourage pedestrian activity along the boulevard. It recent years, many new businesses have moved into the area, while walkable housing developments have popped up. Most recently, the city opened a bus-only lane along El Cajon Boulevard between Park Boulevard and Fairmount Avenue.</p>

<h3 id="hoover-high-band-overcomes-obstacles-wins-fifth-straight-state-championship">&ldquo;Hoover High band overcomes obstacles, wins fifth straight state championship&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3030860/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+181/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2Fdd%2Fb969b2964f7fbf1bc8eb9f091241%2Ftn-photos-handouts-tn-gnp-me-hoover-state-band-championship-2.jpg" alt="img">
It may be difficult to envision a four-time state champion as an underdog, but Hoover High School band members, parents, directors and supporters certainly didn’t think of themselves as the favorites in the finals of a state band competition last Saturday.</p>
<p>The band program had lacked a full-time music director until late September and finished outside the top five in the previous week’s semifinals, but the Hoover musicians rallied to win a California State Band Championship Division 4-A title at Huntington Beach High School.</p>
<p>Overall, Hoover just nudged past Bell Gardens, 88.85 to 88.1, in a division for bands between 70 and 90 students.</p>
<p>The state crown is the fifth consecutive one for Hoover, which won 4-A titles in 2018 and 2017 and 3-A titles in 2016 and 2015.</p>
<p>Hoover’s band has 73 students, including those who play instruments, such as horns and drums, the color guard and the front ensemble, which includes marimbas and xylophones. The squad’s experience levels vary from beginners to those who have played for years.</p>
<p>“We were pleasantly surprised with the results because we didn’t expect it,” said Dan Baker, the band’s director of percussion studies and a school alumnus. “For that, you have to access the entire season in perspective.”</p>
<p>Perhaps no person was more instrumental to Hoover’s musical dominance than former director of instrumental music Martin Rhees, who stepped down after 10 years in June.</p>
<p>“Martin brought all this success to Hoover, but, when he left, there was this huge void in leadership and in band competitive experience,” said Harkmore Lee, booster president of the Hoover band. “What was amazing was the 73 students and about eight part-time staffers, if you will, they joined forces and said ‘we’re going to do this, even without a director.’”</p>
<p>The school did not hire Rhees’ replacement, Byran Lackey, until late September, well after summer practices.</p>
<p>Baker, who normally held a percussion program during the summer for five weeks, supervised other band students, such as brass and woodwind players, who attended practices on their own accord.</p>

<p>The district’s long-term substitute teacher also became the unofficial band director during the transition period that eventually led to Lackey’s hire.</p>
<p>It appeared the challenging times had no ill effect because, according to Baker, Hoover won every competition it entered heading into the state semifinals on Nov. 16 at Capistrano Valley High School.</p>
<p>However, while Baker’s percussion unit shined, taking first place, the Tornadoes fizzled, finishing eighth overall with 85.52 points, well behind winner Bakersfield Liberty High (90.90) and runner-up Bell Gardens (90.25).</p>
<p>“It had been a long time since we finished so low,” Baker said. “We came in with high expectations, and we really adjusted them for the state finals.”</p>
<p>After coming in at eighth place, Baker said he thought the band would finish fourth or fifth at the state contest.</p>
<p>When it came time to announce the scores in Huntington Beach, Hoover band members listened anxiously to hear their school’s name.</p>
<p>“I was waiting after they announced eighth place, then seventh, then sixth, then fifth, and then when fourth came around, I was nervous,” Baker said. “The butterflies were in my stomach and didn’t leave until they said first place.”</p>
<p>Hoover’s victory qualified the squad to the combined championship that same day for divisions 4A, 5A and 6A, in which the Tornadoes finished ninth, with 85.550 points.</p>
<p>District rival Crescenta Valley High topped Hoover in the combined finals as the Falcons took fifth with 89.3 points.</p>
<p>Earlier that day, Crescenta Valley High placed sixth in Division 5A, for bands with roughly 90 to 120 members, with 87.05 points.

<h3 id="trumpet-teacher-forms-a-virtual-brass-ensemble-with-40-quarantined-students">&ldquo;Trumpet teacher forms a virtual brass ensemble with 40 quarantined students&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/acfd206/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+76/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F35%2Fe3fa31d74c2c962d6a51351b936c%2Ftim-saeger-2.JPG" alt="img">
What happens to a trumpeter and music teacher who loses all of his concert gigs, school contracts and private students virtually overnight due to the COVID-19 pandemic?</p>
<p>In the case of San Diego resident Tim Saeger, 35, he found a way to both make music and connect with his students by creating a virtual orchestra online.</p>
<p>Last week, 40 of Saeger’s middle- and high school-age trumpet students made cellphone videos of themselves playing parts he assigned them from a chorale for trumpets by Johann Sebastian Bach. Then he assembled all the individual videos into a multi-track master video with all of the students playing together in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>A video and audio editing hobbyist, Saeger had experience with multi-tracking, having created several merged videos of himself with other musicians and one video of himself playing eight different parts of “America the Beautiful.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>The newly formed online trumpet ensemble has given Saeger something to occupy his time and has given the students, all now sequestered in home isolation, something to do with their instrument. Up next, they’ll collaborate on a recording of “Amazing Grace.”</p>
<p>Saeger — who lives in Rancho Peñasquitos with his wife, Dessie, and their two dogs — said the experience has lifted his spirits and encouraged him to reimagine how he may be able to teach lessons in the future.</p>
<p>“It provided a challenge for me. I was looking for solutions and I got the idea to adapt and overcome by doing something online,” he said. “The kids are stuck and home and bored and the parents were very excited.”</p>

<p>Ethan Olim, 17, of Rancho Penasquitos has been taking trumpet lessons from Saeger for the past eight years. He loves the trumpet for its versatility.</p>
<p>“It has this incredible range. You can be this destructive overwhelming power in an orchestra or have a smoky, mysterious quality in a jazz ensemble or be this light dancing delicate instrument alone,” said Olim, a senior at Westview High School in Rancho Peñasquitos.</p>
<p>While Olim said he at first enjoyed having more time to read and work out after schools shut down last week, he misses the human contact of being around his friends and classmates. So when Saeger contacted him about doing a multi-track recording last week, he was thrilled.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“He’s been putting out those videos for a few years and all of his students saw his level of recording, editing and technical skill. So when he reached out to us to put together something ourselves it was really exciting,” Olim said.</p>

<p>Sammy Levy, a 17-year-old junior at Westview High, has been studying with Saeger for five years. Levin said the 90-second Bach chorale piece that Saeger chose for the multi-track video is something that all of the trumpet students use as a warm-up during practice, so there would be no learning curve required for their first experiment with multi-tracking.</p>
<p>To keep everyone playing at the same tempo, Levy said Saeger instructed all of the students to wear headsets or earbuds playing a metronome counting at 72 beats per minute.</p>

<p>“It was really satisfying seeing how everyone’s hard work paid off and it turned into such a masterpiece, Levy said.</p>
<p>Olim said he imagined that with 40 students playing in their own homes, the intonation and coordination would fall flat. He was wrong.</p>
<p>“I expected lots of problems with tuning and out-of-sync releases and attacks, but I was so impressed at how clean all of that stuff was,” Olim said.</p>
<p>Also taking part in the project was Sienna Barker, 14, a freshman at Westview High who began taking lessons from Saeger three years ago. She is first chair trumpet in Westview’s ninth grade band and played in the marching band last fall.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Barker grew up playing piano, but had to pick a new instrument when she joined her middle school orchestra. She picked the trumpet, thinking it had to be the easiest instrument to learn with only three buttons. It wasn’t, but she fell in love with the trumpet anyway.</p>
<p>“It’s a really pretty instrument and it can be so versatile,” she said. “It can have a bright and exciting sound and it can also be deep and rich.”</p>
<p>Barker praised Saeger’s teaching style because he’s interested in his students both as musicians and individuals.</p>
<p>“While he cares about your improvement as a musician, the first questions he’ll ask at a lesson are: ‘How are you doing? How’s your life? Anything new?’ Then he’ll ask, ‘how’s your trumpet playing going?”</p>
<p>Born and raised in San Diego, Saeger started playing trumpet in the fifth grade and attended San Diego State University on a performance scholarship. The longtime professional musician is a contract player for the San Diego Symphony and its Summer Pops season, as well as the Pacific Symphony, the San Diego Winds Concert Band and multiple brass ensembles, Classics 4 Kids, La Jolla Playhouse, The Old Globe and San Diego Zoo, among others.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Since 2008, he has been teaching trumpet at middle and high schools in the San Diego and Poway school districts. He now coaches the trumpet sections for Westview, Mt. Carmel and Del Norte high schools. He also has a private teaching business with between 50 to 60 students.</p>
<p>Saeger said he was devastated when all of his income evaporated overnight, but fortunately his wife has a job so they’re OK financially. That has given him the time to figure out how to use technology to perhaps begin doing lessons online. Performing concert music together over an app doesn’t work well due to the unpredictable lag time associated with the signal transmission. But the positive response he received from the first online trumpet ensemble performance has given him confidence to experiment.</p>
<p>I’m exploring virtual lessons,” he said. “The economy isn’t the same as it was before. A lot of students’ parents are now out of work. But we’ll do more of these online concerts. Everyone has been very complimentary, so I want to do more.”</p>

<p>A brass band from Stockport playing dance-music classics at the suggestion of a Turner prizewinning artist beneath the stadium of a Premier League football team. If you wanted more proof of our cross-fertilising culture, this was it. The idea of the artist Jeremy Deller, whose involvement these days appears to be spiritual at best, Acid Brass combine considerable skill with a necessary gameness. The project is made up of members of the respected, award-winning Fairey Brass Band. Many can’t be old enough to remember acid house; the ones who were probably weren’t regulars at the Haçienda. Yet they brought an appropriately down-to-earth energy to Under the Bridge, the venue attached to Chelsea FC’s Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/20/arts/20listings-pop/20listings-pop-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
MELISSA ALDANA AND AARON DIEHL at Dizzy’s Club (Dec. 21, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Both Aldana, a tenor saxophonist, and Diehl, a pianist, are decorated young musicians with fearsome chops and deft, judicious styles of improvising. (Aldana won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 2013, and Diehl has played on multiple Grammys-winning albums with the vocalist from his work alongside the vocalist Cecile McLorin Salvant.) They have occasionally performed as a duo at the downtown basement club Mezzrow. Saturday’s show will mark their first appearance at Dizzy’s in that format.</p>
<p>212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys</p>
<p>PATRICIA BRENNAN’S MOCH at National Sawdust (Dec. 26, 7 p.m.). A percussionist and composer whose main instruments are the vibraphone and marimba, Brennan has recently started to make her presence known on the New York avant-garde, working with such prominent bandleaders as Matt Mitchell and Michael Formanek. Here she will perform an eight-part audiovisual suite titled “Raíces Jarochas,” inspired by the music of her native Veracruz, a hub of Mexico’s Afro-Latino population. Moch, the band she’s assembled for the performance, features Formanek on bass, Mauricio Herrera on percussion and Noel Brennan on turntables, electronics and video. This show is part of National Sawdust’s continuing John Zorn’s Stone Commissioning Series.</p>
<p>646-779-8455, nationalsawdust.org</p>
<p>ROY HARGROVE TRIBUTE BIG BAND at the Jazz Gallery (Dec. 20-21, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Roy Hargrove’s death last year at 49 left the jazz world bereaved. In January, a tribute concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center stretched into the wee hours, a reminder of how many musicians — older as well as younger — had been touched by his influence. One of the most stirring moments of that concert came when the vocalist Renée Neufville sang a tribute song that she and the saxophonist Justin Robinson had finished writing that same day. This weekend at the Jazz Gallery — which Hargrove co-founded in 1995 — an ensemble featuring many musicians who played with Hargrove at various points in his career will perform, with Neufville featured as a special guest.</p>
<p>646-494-3625, jazzgallery.nyc</p>
<p>CARMEN LUNDY at Jazz Standard (through Dec. 22, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Lundy established herself in the early 1980s as a talented multi-instrumentalist, restlessly inventive composer and husky-voiced singer ready to pick up the mantle from the likes of Carmen McRae and Sarah Vaughan. She never became a household name on that level, but she remains one of the most respected jazz voices of her generation. At Jazz Standard this weekend, she is celebrating the release of “Modern Ancestors,” a fine new album of 10 original compositions. At these shows her band includes Andrew Renfroe on guitar, Matthew Whitaker on piano, Kenny Davis on bass, Kassa Overall on drums and Mayra Casales on percussion.</p>
<p>212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com</p>
<p>REBIRTH BRASS BAND at Brooklyn Bowl (Dec. 20-21, 8:30 p.m.). For over 35 years, the Grammy-winning Rebirth Brass Band has boisterously carried forward the marching-band tradition of New Orleans, covering everything from traditional Mardi Gras fare to modern jazz and R&amp;B hits. On Friday, Rebirth will share the bill with Erik Deutsch, a pianist and bandleader who plays a kind of jam-band music not far from the sound of Galactic. On Saturday, the opening band will be the Chicago-based Lowdown Brass Band.</p>
<p>718-963-3369, brooklynbowl.com</p>
<p>PHAROAH SANDERS at the Iridium (Dec. 27-29, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). A paragon of spiritual jazz since the 1960s, when he was in some of John Coltrane’s last ensembles, Sanders, 79, still knows how to flit gracefully from serene balladry to tone-splitting eruptions. Often singing and dancing onstage when the tenor saxophone is not at his lips, Sanders can make a two-chord vamp feel like a flotation device. At these concerts, which fall in the middle of Kwanzaa, his quartet will include the pianist Benito Gonzalez, the bassist Nat Reeves and the drummer Johnathan Blake.</p>
