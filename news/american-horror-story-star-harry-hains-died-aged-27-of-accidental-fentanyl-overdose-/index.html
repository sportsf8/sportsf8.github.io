HARRY Hains passed away earlier this year as a result of "fentanyl intoxication" reports the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner.

An autopsy report obtained by The Sun listed the manner of death as "accident" after a two-month long investigation.

Harry's place of death was listed as 'hospital' and there were no causes listed in the report other than the "fentanyl intoxication."

The sudden death of the 27-year-old star of American Horror Story came as a shock to many back in January.

His social media depicted a young man who was happy and having fun in the days before his death.

"To 2020! The new era has already begun. So let's all keep only moving forward, staying so present to enjoy each and every moment throughout this beautiful new beginning," he captioned the Instagram photo of him and a friend ringing in the new year.

"Happy New Year, peeps. So much love and gratitude for all in my life."

The troubled 27-year-old had "struggled with mental illness and addiction," according to his mother, actress Jane Badler, who announced his death on Instagram January 7.

"He was 27 and had the world at his feet. But sadly he struggled with mental illness and addiction.

"A brilliant spark shone bright too short a time... I will miss you, Harry, every day of my life."

Harry had also been very open about his "disrupted childhood" in an interview last March, when he revealed he'd suffered from Idiopathic Insomnia, a chronic form of insomnia, as a child.

The rare sleep disorder left him sleepless for much of his youth until he started taking sleeping pills at just 12 years old.

He described the havoc sleep deprivation wreaked on his mental health, telling UK menswear magazine Boys By Girls that his condition created "a lot of phobias."

His personal ghosts "came back to haunt him" in some ways, the model admitted.

"I couldn't sleep for my entire childhood until I started taking sleeping pills at twelve/thirteen.

"So I was tortured by sleep deprivation and I had a lot of phobias.

"It affected me in a very severe way as a child."

Harry had also begun to present himself as a "gender-fluid robot" called ANTIBOY in the months before his death.

This alter ego served as his musical persona, and first popped up min october of last year.

"I HAVE SO MANY MENTAL DISORDERS BUT DON'T WE ALL?" wrote Harry on that post.

Harry was raised in Melbourne, Australia, before moving to New York and then Los Angeles to pursue his acting career.

He was a pre-med student at the University of Melbourne until 2014, but left school to chase his artistic dreams.

The multi-talented star was due to release his debut album, A Glitch in Paradise, later this year.

He performed as his alter-ego ANTIBOY on that album.
