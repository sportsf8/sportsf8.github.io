<p>The Nobel Prize-winning scientist who looked at raw data and correctly predicted Ireland&rsquo;s death and infection rate would &ldquo;burn itself out&rdquo; in the last two weeks of May is back to reassure people there will be no second wave.</p>
<p>Dr Michael Levitt (73) was speaking as he prepared to jet off on his summer holiday travelling in Europe.</p>
<p>The Nobel Laureate made world headlines when he found that the number of people infected with coronavirus in any given region was not growing exponentially. He also correctly calculated the demise of China&rsquo;s spread long ahead of most health experts.</p>
<p>Read More</p>
<p>And this weekend he told the Sunday Independent: &ldquo;Ireland is done&rdquo; with Covid.</p>
<p>The Stanford University professor said it was vital to make the distinction between cases among a generally healthy population and deaths among the vulnerable when deciding if the virus is a threat to a country.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I think people are very excited about finding cases but obviously we will be able to find coronavirus on people forever now because you can find other kinds of coronas and you can find influenza on people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most important thing is how you define when it&rsquo;s over and I think the only logical way to define it is when the &lsquo;excess deaths&rsquo; get back to normal. And if you look at the whole of the European area for the last 10 weeks, there has been no excess deaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means that the deaths that are occurring are actually just&hellip; they are called &lsquo;Covid deaths&rsquo; but they are deaths that would have occurred normally. And I am sure that happened in Ireland even before I said it was over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excess deaths&rsquo; refers to the number of deaths over and above what is normally expected for that time of year.</p>
<p>Last month, analysis by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) found that excess deaths in Ireland from March to June were &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; less than the officially reported Covid-19 figures.</p>
<p>Hiqa said this could be due to the inclusion within official figures of people who were infected with coronavirus but whose cause of death may have been predominantly due to other factors.</p>
<p>The study found that, while there were 1,200 more deaths during that period, this was almost a third less than the 1,709 people originally recorded as having died from coronavirus.</p>
<p>Dr Levitt said: &ldquo;I have a soft spot for Ireland and I keep an eye on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;Ireland is a well-managed country. I don&rsquo;t see any massive new outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the vulnerable people have, sadly, not made it. And it does seem that there is some level of immunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The current picture is, and this is just a rough number, but about 80pc are actually resistant [to the virus] from the very beginning - they don&rsquo;t get it easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other 20pc, if we manage to get 15pc of them infected, then it is a safe range to be in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in Ireland, if you just take the number of cases that you have had so far and multiply it by 10, you will find that it has affected about 15pc of the population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the Government excluding popular holiday hotspots such as Spain and France from the Green List of safe destinations, Dr Levitt said: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all politics. I am about to go travelling right now. We are flying to the UK and then we are going to fly to Portugal and have a vacation there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am in no way concerned. My sons live in the Algarve. So it will be beautiful and it will be great to see my six grandchildren and my wife will see her four grandchildren in Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked to recommend safe zones to visit, he said: &ldquo;I would gladly go to Greece, Cyprus, Italy. Italy is very, very safe now&hellip; If a place completely escaped [Covid-19] the first time, then that&rsquo;s probably not a great place to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And asked what the Government should do if cases start to rise again, he said: &ldquo;If there is an outbreak, then the smart thing to do would be to just let it go and make sure that you don&rsquo;t overcrowd the hospitals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;If I was in the Government, I would say the time now is to worry about the economy and tourism. And be sensible. When deaths start again, then you have to be careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ultimately,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the virus is going to get to where it has to get to. All you can really do is to affect the speed it takes to get there and delay things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, you know, if the delay is very expensive, like closing down the economy, then it is not a good idea.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://www.independent.ie/incoming/d1f50/39417765.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/page12_odea.jpg" alt="img">
Fianna Fáil&rsquo;s leading backbench TDs have redoubled their criticisms of coalition partners Fine Gael and the Green Party as the discord inside Government showed little sign of easing.</p>
<p>Former Fianna Fáil minister Willie O&rsquo;Dea criticised the Fine Gael Tánaiste and his predecessor for clinging to perks associated with their previous positions. Mr O&rsquo;Dea said Tánaiste Leo Varadkar &ldquo;has no need of an aide-de-camp&rdquo; which was associated with his previous role as Taoiseach, nor had the former Tánaiste, Simon Coveney, the need for a garda driver.</p>
<p>The Limerick TD again insisted that travel controls on people receiving Covid-19 welfare payments were &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; and these factors contributed to the new Coalition&rsquo;s faltering start. Mr O&rsquo;Dea said all these factors had contributed to public anger in reacting to the new Government.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sligo Fianna Fáil TD Marc MacSharry was scathingly critical of two Green Party TDs - one a junior minister - for their failure to vote with the Government last week on housing legislation.</p>
<p>Mr MacSharry derisively referred to the Greens&rsquo; &ldquo;free love&rdquo; attitude to fulfil their obligations for voting with the Government they has joined.</p>
<p>But speaking for the Green Party, Children&rsquo;s Minister Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman said there would be no repeat of last Thursday&rsquo;s voting incident.</p>
<p>He said the two party TDs, Neasa Hourigan and Joe O&rsquo;Brien, undertook not to repeat their actions and Green Party colleagues would work on better communications. &ldquo;We need a united Government to deliver on the Programme for Government and that programme was ratified by our party members; 76pc in favour of it and there is a lot of really good things in it that our members support and I support, while there is stuff that Fianna Fail and Fine Gael members would find difficult,&rdquo; he told the Irish Independent.</p>
<p>Mr O&rsquo;Gorman acknowledged the difficulty his party colleagues had in supporting some measures backed by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. But it would also happen that these two parties would be obliged to support measures put forward by the Green Party which they disliked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know in the last number of weeks we have had a Government that was formed in the middle of a pandemic. I know that the Government has had to have a lot to deal with this week and I know that is part of the reason why we have had these breakdowns in communication internally within the party and we have to do much more to address that,&rdquo; he told Newstalk radio&rsquo;s &lsquo;On The Record&rsquo; show in an earlier interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going forward, I think it is absolutely essential that the entire Green Party - and indeed all parties - are supportive of the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday, Tánaiste and Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar said the new Government got off to a &ldquo;rocky start&rdquo; and made &ldquo;unforced errors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr O&rsquo;Gorman said some of the Government&rsquo;s mistakes overshadowed its achievements. Separately, he said he was committed to ending the direct provision system for asylum seekers and hoped for progress on this soon.</p>

<h3 id="ireland-must-review-eu-tax-powers-for-covid-fund-to-work-says-hogan">&ldquo;Ireland must review EU tax powers for Covid fund to work, says Hogan&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.independent.ie/incoming/41156/39279854.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/Phil-Hogan.jpg" alt="img">
Ireland can improve its projected €3bn take from EU coronavirus aid - but it must also seriously consider giving Brussels taxing powers, EU Commissioner Phil Hogan has warned.</p>
<p>Mr Hogan said several member states - including Ireland - must review total opposition to EU taxation powers if the €750bn Covid-19 aid package is to work.</p>
<p>Mr Hogan stood over comments made in a jointly written article with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in the Irish Independent. In the article they argued that a historic concession has been made allowing the commission to borrow heavily on world money markets for the first time - but this borrowing can only be repaid via new taxes paid directly to Brussels.</p>
<p>The Brussels tax options include a levy on big tech giants like Apple, Google, and others, which are big employers and payers of tax revenue in Ireland. Other EU revenue-raising options include a plastics tax and a carbon levy on imports from countries which have less ambitious climate-change plans.</p>
<p>Mr Hogan insisted he was not trying to tell the Irish government what to do. He also said that Ireland - or any other member state - cannot be coerced into conceding national tax powers reversing their long-standing positions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I am saying is that we have a historic EU initiative to tackle what risks becoming the biggest economic crisis since 1929 with an aid package worth €750bn aimed at supporting the states which are worst hit. But that is going to cost money,&rdquo; the former Fine Gael minister said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not telling Ireland - or any member state - what they should do. I am saying that there is a menu of options there. It is a matter for all the member states which have traditionally opposed EU taxation powers to review their stance in the face of an extraordinary set of events,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Mr Hogan said Ireland - and all other member states - still had an &ldquo;effective veto&rdquo; over EU changes on taxation. He added that whatever changes might be agreed must also be ratified by national parliaments giving a &ldquo;double-lock&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Hogan said it was difficult to say whether Ireland could improve its projected take from the Covid-19 fund. Under the draft unveiled in late May, Ireland was deemed to be in line for €3bn, which many described as &ldquo;disappointingly low&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The updated package agreed by Taoiseach Micheál Martin last week offers the potential to improve Ireland&rsquo;s allocation - especially via a €5bn special Brexit-aid fund for countries worst hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to calculate what the final outcome will be. But there are a significant number of programmes which should prove very helpful for Ireland around research and development, rural funding, and a &lsquo;just transition&rsquo; and this is the direction Ireland should be going,&rdquo; Mr Hogan added.</p>

<h3 id="during-this-crisis-we-were-in-the-right-category-of-what-people-were-comfortable-to-spend-money-on---gymcoffee-moves-into-the-fast-lane">&ldquo;&lsquo;During this crisis we were in the right category of what people were comfortable to spend money on&rsquo; - Gym+Coffee moves into the fast lane&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.independent.ie/business/38971/39414544.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2020-08-02_bus_60881676_I1.JPG" alt="img">
According to an old Chinese proverb, a crisis is an opportunity riding the dangerous wind. And for Gym+Coffee, an Irish athleisure brand beloved by health-conscious millennials, that opportunity came during lockdown, when its online sales soared 800pc.</p>
<p>Athleisure - namely casual, comfortable clothing suitable for both exercise and everyday wear - was already the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing fashion category before the arrival of Covid-19.</p>
<p>But when offices, bars and restaurants shut and workwear and occasion wear became redundant, consumers both working from home and working out at home increasingly shopped online for athleisure.</p>
<p>This proved a boon for Gym+Coffee, a brand inspired by the active lifestyle its three co-founders enjoyed while travelling and working in Australia and California. While the company was compelled to shut its four Irish stores in March, its origins as an online-only brand, generating half of its revenue from online customers, meant it was in prime position to benefit from the athleisure craze.</p>
<p>But there was a hitch. The pandemic meant Gym+Coffee&rsquo;s suppliers in Indonesia, China and Singapore were shut for a couple of months and the cost of international freight jumped from $3 or $4 per kilo to $25 (€21) a kilo, says Niall Horgan, the chief executive and one of its co-founders. Customer orders for €65-leggings and hoodies couldn&rsquo;t be fulfilled on time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were only a certain amount of flights from Asia and you were competing with Apple and other big brands for those flights, so we couldn&rsquo;t stretch to that,&rdquo; the 34-year-old says from his hotel on the shores of Lough Derg, where he&rsquo;s relaxing on his first family holiday since the crisis.</p>
<p>With shipping taking up to 15 weeks to reach Ireland, the Corkman was in a bind. So, in April, he reached out to fellow Corkonian Liam Casey - aka &ldquo;Mr China&rdquo; - for help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were running out of options but we knew that our accountants knew Liam and his company, so we essentially threw out a Hail Mary to see if they could connect us with him,&rdquo; Horgan says.</p>
<p>Casey, the founder of logistics and supply chain giant PCH International, was more than a tad busy sourcing millions of surgical face masks, gowns and visors from China for Irish healthcare workers. Plane-loads of the personal protective equipment were landing in Ireland, funded by €10m from U2.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within 24 hours, Liam rang me himself to say he could help us out,&rdquo; Horgan says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We changed up our entire supply chain, storing products and fulfilling orders from Liam&rsquo;s warehouse and then sending them directly to the customer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-established fashion retailers like Oasis, Warehouse and Debenhams - already struggling with low margins, high rents and online competition - fell like dominoes as the pandemic restrictions swept through the high street. But even after Gym+Coffee&rsquo;s stores shut at Dundrum Town Centre, Liffey Valley, the Crescent Shopping Centre and Mahon Point, its online-first strategy helped it weather the crisis. As a result, the company has revised up its full-year growth to 300pc from 200pc and is ploughing ahead with expansion, albeit on a pared-back scale. Over the last week, Gym+Coffee opened both an Australian online store and a pop-up shop at Kildare Village, its sixth pop-up to date.</p>
<p>Horgan&rsquo;s discipline in steering the nascent brand through the crisis likely stems from a childhood steeped in the GAA. Growing up in Kerry Pike, a picturesque hamlet that&rsquo;s less than a 10-minute drive from Apple&rsquo;s headquarters on the northside of Cork city, Horgan trained up to 10 times a week with different hurling and football teams. When he was 17, he captained both the Cork hurling and football minor teams.</p>
<p>Despite coming from a family of teachers, Horgan knew his future lay in business, so he studied commerce at University College Cork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My final-year project at college was a comparison of Nike, Adidas and Puma, and how they grew over the years and the different strategies they deployed to build their business,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was fascinated by brand building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at business school that Horgan met Diarmuid McSweeney, who would go on to become a co-founder of Gym+Coffee with Karl Swaine, a one-time visual merchandiser for the fashion chain French Connection.</p>
<p>Horgan graduated in 2008, when the global economy was imploding, so he took a year off to travel and &ldquo;avoid the reality of a recession&rdquo;. He followed the well-worn backpacking route across Asia, before moving to Australia, where he worked in a café-bar, and on to New Zealand. He then flew to San Francisco and drove a campervan cross-country to New York.</p>
<p>Horgan started his career in earnest when he settled in Dublin in 2010, working as a sales executive for Sky TV. He clinched a job at Twitter&rsquo;s new Dublin headquarters in 2012, when he was just one of 10 employees in the office. As head of Twitter&rsquo;s sales partnership for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, he looked after large advertisers and revenue across more than 30 countries. The following year, he moved to Slack, the corporate chat platform.</p>
<p>It was while at Slack that he, McSweeney and Swaine developed Gym+Coffee as a side-hustle, which finally enabled Horgan to marry his passion for sport with brands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Slack, I was spending an awful lot of time in California and Vancouver, and Diarmuid was just after moving back from Australia, where he had spent a number of years working in marketing agencies. We were chatting about the lifestyles in some of these markets, particularly California and Australia, and about how passionate people were about exercise and using that as a way to socialise - it was all about getting up early, going for a run with your friends, and grabbing a coffee afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really enjoyed that type of lifestyle when we were over there and you could see that was starting to take off in Ireland. We felt there was a business opportunity because the uniform that people were wearing while enjoying this lifestyle was changing and people were getting into more international brands that were in this space. But there was no Irish brand representing that lifestyle shift and athleisure was taking off at a crazy rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a misstep that saw the trio miss the busy Christmas period of 2016, Gympluscoffee.com launched in January 2017, with their signature hoodies. They used clever digital marketing and events to spread the word, and that summer ran free outdoor workout events, which they called the Summer Stretch Series, to promote the brand. Fitness events still play a major role in Gym+Coffee&rsquo;s marketing - even if those events had to move online during the pandemic, with workouts on Instagram Live for example.</p>
<p>Then it was time for the entrepreneurs to properly commit: all three gave up their full-time jobs and invested their collective life savings into buying a stock of hoodies. They began gifting some of their products to celebrities such as Joe Wicks - otherwise known as The Body Coach - and to former rugby player Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll, who in 2019 invested in the business and became its head of community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest issue we constantly face is working capital as so much of our capital is tied up in stock and you&rsquo;re not getting much support from the banks,&rdquo; Horgan says. &ldquo;So we took seed investment from a couple of great individuals who helped bring the business to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite planning to operate Gym+Coffee as just an online brand, the entrepreneurs grabbed an opportunity in 2018 to run a pop-up store at Dundrum Town Centre. What was initially designed to be a two-week run has become a permanent flagship base. The shops, which the company calls &ldquo;clubhouses&rdquo;, are typically decorated with recycled pallet furniture and have a café vibe. Gym + Coffee often starts out with a pop-up store to see how sales perform before taking out longer-term leases.</p>
<p>Despite &ldquo;rumours of retail being dead, that certainly hasn&rsquo;t been the case for us&rdquo;, Horgan says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found that when we opened up stores, they really complemented the online part of the business. The store is a great place for us to interact with our community and customers and a great place for them to get know the brand and our clothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were nervous about launching at Kildare Village last weekend because it was our first new store post-lockdown. But it was a phenomenal weekend for us, bringing in double what we expected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Gym+Coffee&rsquo;s early ambitions to open physical outlets outside Ireland have been stymied by Covid-19. It had hoped to open an international store this year, having held talks with potential landlords in New York and London, but instead plans to unveil two new shops abroad in 2021. For now, the Dublin-based company is focusing on opening its largest-ever &ldquo;clubhouse&rdquo; at the Blanchardstown Centre in September and it expects its workforce to double to 104 by this time next year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to count our blessings that during this crisis we were in the right category of what people were comfortable to spend some money on,&rdquo; Horgan says. &ldquo;You could wear the clothing working from home and still look respectable on a Zoom call. If anything, Covid is going to accelerate that trend. I recently met a friend who is an investment banker and he was talking about how they were going casual. I thought &lsquo;well, if they are going casual, we&rsquo;re definitely on the right road&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Business lessons</p>
<p>What is the best piece of business advice you ever received?</p>
<p>If something’s not going right, it doesn’t mean it’s going wrong. What I took from that is that there are so many grey areas, that sometimes you can get bogged down when something isn’t going exactly to plan. As long as you’re moving in the right direction, you should look at the bigger picture.</p>
<p>What are the challenges and opportunities for you as an Irish apparel brand, given how few there are left in the market?</p>
<p>The challenges and opportunities are nearly the same thing for us. It’s about how we can scale the business internationally and still be a brand that Irish people are very proud of. It’s hard for a small nation like Ireland to get internationally renowned clothing brands out there, but we feel that we are in a really good position to do so.</p>
<p>Given the environment we are in now, what are your priorities for the business?</p>
<p>The first is coming out of Covid, the second is international expansion, and the third is the expansion of the team.</p>

<h3 id="virus-surge-in-13-nations-on-travel-green-list">&ldquo;Virus surge in 13 nations on travel &lsquo;green list&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.independent.ie/business/1e994/37452988.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/PANews_P-3cab94cf-71e4-4d41-97b8-696102b532c2_I1.jpg" alt="img">
The vast majority of countries on Ireland&rsquo;s &lsquo;green list&rsquo; have seen a rise in Covid-19 infections since travel restrictions were lifted.</p>
<p>Amid an alarming surge in cases of the coronavirus around the world, ministers are to consider even tougher rules around foreign travel rather than any relaxation of the current regime.</p>
<p>Read More</p>
<p>Thirteen of the 15 destinations selected by the Government as safe to travel to on July 22 are now seeing the number of cases rise again, as is ­Ireland.</p>
<p>New figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) show that the four destinations on the green list most likely to be considered as holiday hotspots for Irish tourists are now considered far more at risk than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Cyprus recorded 9.9 cases of the virus per 100,000 of the population, while Malta has seen a massive 34.6 cases per 100,000. Italy is at 6 cases per 100,000, while Greece is at 5.6 per 100,000.</p>
<p>In Ireland, where the number of cases of the infection is also on the rise, the rate per 100,000 is 7.3.</p>
<p>This has caused concern for medics and the Government which must decide tomorrow whether to allow pubs to ­reopen on August 10.</p>
<p>Cabinet ministers will this week discuss random testing of passengers at Irish airports in a bid to reduce the number of cases being imported.</p>
<p>The green list is not likely to be extended.</p>
<p>This means travellers from most countries into Ireland must continue to quarantine for 14 days after arrival.</p>
<p>Globally, cases of Covid-19 are on the rise. The government of the Australian state of Victoria declared an official “state of disaster” and imposed new lockdown restrictions yesterday.</p>
<p>As of last night, Melbourne was under a stage-four lockdown. The city has a night-time curfew between 8pm and 5am in a bid to crack down on illegal gatherings.</p>
<p>And in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is considering new lockdown measures for London.</p>
<p>Government ministers here will resume discussions on plans for a scheme of Covid-19 testing at airports when they meet again tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, a well-placed source said it is “most unlikely” this already minimal green list will be expanded as a result of airport testing.</p>
<p>“The developments and trends are all going in the other direction right now. We don’t expect a significant relaxation here,” the source told the Irish Independent.</p>
<p>Health Minister Stephen Donnelly yesterday said the Government is introducing random testing of passengers at Irish airports.</p>
<p>“We’re introducing random testing at the airports and an increased public health presence, and we are examining other options, as well, for further restrictions on non-essential travel.</p>
<p>“The international situation is becoming more volatile, we’re looking at what has been happening in the United States and Latin America and even closer to home – Spain, Germany, France and parts of England and Australia.</p>
<p>“We’re taking a cautious approach and we’re continuing to take a cautious approach.”</p>
<p>The Department of Health announced 53 more confirmed cases of Covid-19 yesterday, bringing the national total so far to 26,162 cases.</p>
<p>There were no deaths reported yesterday.</p>
<p>Some 45 of the new cases are associated with outbreaks or close contacts of a confirmed case, while four have been identified as community transmissions.</p>
<p>Dublin saw 25 of the new cases, while there were 19 in Laois, six in Kildare and the remaining three were spread across two other counties.</p>
<p>Of the cases recorded, 27 are men and 26 are women, and 80pc are aged under 45, showing a continuing trend of younger people being affected.</p>
<p>Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the source of transmission for more than 90pc of the cases had been identified.</p>
<p>“This is a positive development in light of the number of cases reported over the past few days.</p>
<p>“However, our five-day average for cases reported is now 47. We all need to continue to adopt a prevention mindset and continue making good choices to protect ourselves and others while trying to live safely with Covid-19.</p>
<p>“People are still susceptible, this virus has not changed.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the issue of reopening “wet” pubs on August 10, Mr Donnelly said the Government will make a decision based on advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).</p>
<p>The Cabinet is to decide whether the country can proceed to phase four, which will allow pubs that do not serve food to reopen and for gatherings of more than 50 people.</p>
<p>Mr Donnelly said he did not want to pre-judge what Nphet advises, and the Government is focused on reopening schools.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to make any comments on that because that is something for Nphet to come to me with a view on on Tuesday, but it is certainly the case that decisions could be made if Nphet deemed necessary in order to keep the opening of schools on track,” he said.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to prejudge what Nphet may decide. Certainly, the number-one focus is getting the schools reopened.”

<h3 id="covid-19-ireland-53-new-cases-confirmed-and-no-further-deaths">&ldquo;Covid-19 Ireland: 53 new cases confirmed and no further deaths&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.independent.ie/incoming/119b3/39417044.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/WORLD-Co-273.jpg" alt="img">
THERE have been no new deaths from Covid-19 but there has been 53 new cases, according to the latest figures.</p>
<p>As of midnight Saturday, there were 53 confirmed cases of Covid-19.</p>
<p>There is now a total of 26,162 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.</p>
<p>There has now been a total of 1,763 Covid-19 related deaths in Ireland.</p>
<p>Read More</p>
<p>45 of the cases are associated with outbreaks or close contacts of a confirmed case.</p>
<p>And 80pc of cases are under the age of 45. Four cases have been identified as community transmission.</p>
<p>25 cases are located in Dublin, 19 in Laois, six in Kildare and the remaining three are spread across two other counties.</p>
<p>The HSE said it is &ldquo;working to identify any contacts the patients may have had to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr Ronan Glynn, Acting Chief Medical Officer, from the Department of Health, said; “The source of transmission for over 90pc of cases reported today has been identified. &ldquo;This is a positive development in light of the number of cases reported over the past few days.</p>
<p>“However, our five day average for cases reported is now 47. We all need to continue to adopt a prevention mindset and continue making good choices to protect ourselves and others while trying to live safely with COVID-19.</p>
<p>“People are still susceptible, this virus has not changed. We know how to break the chains of transmission. Let’s stay the course by physically distancing, washing hands regularly, wearing a face covering where appropriate, avoiding crowds and doing all we can to protect each other.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said random Covid-19 testing at airports will be introduced due to the “volatile” situation internationally.</p>
<p>Speaking on This Week on RTÉ Radio One this afternoon, he said that an increased public health presence will be seen at Irish airports.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;re introducing random testing at the airports and an increased public health presence and we&rsquo;re examining other options as well for further restrictions on non-essential travel because&hellip; the international situation is becoming more volatile,” he said.</p>
<p>When he was asked if pubs who do not serve food will reopen on August 10, he said that the government will make a decision based on Nphet advice.</p>
<p>Mr Donnelly said that he did not want to prejudge public health advice.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that it was a really difficult situation facing pub owners and that he had sympathy with them and added that Nphet will look &ldquo;at all options&rdquo; with &ldquo;a view to keeping the reopening of schools on track&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Donnelly stressed that this remains priority.</p>
<p>“The number one focus is getting the schools reopened,” he said.</p>
<p>“Decisions could be made if Nphet deem them necessary in order to keep the opening of schools on track.”</p>
<p>He said international experience shows that when pubs reopen the number of cases go up.</p>
