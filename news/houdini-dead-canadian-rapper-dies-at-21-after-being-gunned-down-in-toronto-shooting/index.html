<p>Canadian rapper Houdini has died aged 21 after a shooting in Toronto.</p>
<p>The Up and coming hip-hop star was gunned down on Tuesday outside a hotel in the downtown area of the city and died from his injuries.</p>
<p>A woman, 27, and a 15-year-old boy were also injured in the attack but are expected to recover.</p>
<p>News of Houdini&rsquo;s death was confirmed by fellow Toronto rapper Tony Yanez, who wrote on Instagram : &ldquo;I’m trying, and I can’t fight the tears from falling&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can’t even find the words for a speech right now .. YALL TOOK MY F<em><strong>ING N</strong></em>* AND ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS LIVE !!!!!! #RIP Houdini 4 Ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was also mourned by rapper Meek Mil, who wrote: &ldquo;Rocked WIT YOUNGBULL VIBE AS A PERSON RIP! PRAYERS TO HIS SIDE!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: houdini/Instagram)</p>
<p>Toronto Police Chief Mark Saunders called the shooting &ldquo;very brazen&rdquo; and revealed cops responded to reports of gunfire at around 4pm yesterday.</p>
<p>He claimed the attack was planned and suspects had been waiting in their car for around 40 minutes before opening fire.</p>
<p>Saunders explained: &ldquo;It turns out the suspect vehicle, based on the evidence we have right now, was waiting for about forty minutes for the occupants of another vehicle to arrive to their vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they did, the suspect vehicle made a U-turn, came out, and started firing at this group of individuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: houdini/Instagram)</p>
<p>He went on: &ldquo;This was very brazen, this offence that took place,” he said. “However, it’s very solvable&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a driver of the suspect vehicle and we know that the shooter got out on the passenger side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He believes the gunman exited the vehicle and let off the shots before climbing back into the car and driving off.</p>
<p>A witness told CP24 : &ldquo;What we heard was like a bunch of fireworks. There were lots of echoes – about six to 10 shots. It was quite startling and then you hear all the sirens afterwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a lot of people have power outages in this area too, so people were out for a walk I guess. It’s quite shocking to see in this area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: houdini/Instagram)</p>
<p>A firearm was recovered from the scene and police are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
<p>Houdini was one of Canada&rsquo;s most streamed independent rappers with 19.2 million plays on Spotify in 2019.</p>
<p>He is best known for tracks including Late Nights, Myself and Backseats.</p>
<p>The rapper started his career in 2016 and signed to Robin Banks&rsquo; UpTop Movement Inc for upcoming artists a year later.</p>
<p>Late Nights was released in 2018 and the video garnered more than a million views on YouTube,</p>
<p>His debut mixtape, Hou I Am, dropped in 2019 and it was followed by a second, Hou Woulda Thought, later in the year.</p>
<p>His EP underGROUND was released in March.

<h3 id="book-review-houdini-the-elusive-american">&ldquo;Book Review: &lsquo;Houdini: The Elusive American&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.wshu.org/sites/wshu/files/styles/medium/public/202005/houdini.jpg" alt="img">
The king of escape Harry Houdini still fascinates us even though he died 94 years ago on Halloween this year. A new biography, “Houdini: The Elusive American,” takes a fresh look at his life and ambition to be remembered.</p>
<p>The book, by Adam Begley, is part of the the Yale University Press book series Jewish Lives. Houdini, whose birth name was Ehrich Weiss, was the son of a German-speaking rabbi from Hungary who emigrated to small-town Appleton, Wisconsin, four years before his eldest child arrived from Budapest. Harry, however, told everyone he was born in Appleton. He told everyone a lot of untruths and different versions of the same apocryphal tales. He was, as Begley shows, “a compulsive exaggerator” and “a serial prevaricator” with an “insatiable hunger for attention.” A 5’4” handsome, muscular man with an outsized ego, Houdini was a mystery. No one knew what drove him to perform such masochistic acts.</p>
<p>Even Houdini’s once friend, then antagonist, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle said Harry was “ by far and away the most curious and intriguing character” he had ever met. A man of “strange contrasts,” it was impossible to foresee or understand the “tangle of motives” that propelled him, said the creator of Sherlock Holmes, who nonetheless believed in Spiritualism. Fascination with Houdini has certainly fueled other biographers, filmmakers, fan-fiction novelists, some of whom still advance a conspiracy theory that Houdini died at the hands of Spiritualists who were furious at his crusade against them.</p>
<p>Houdini saw their attempts to connect with the dead as cruel manipulations of the lonely and bereaved. Illusions, unlike his own, that hurt others. He was obsessed with his mother, caring about his long-time devoted wife whom he cheated on just once – with Jack London’s widow, then broke it off. But, as Begley writes, the world’s greatest escape artist never tried to escape from his heritage. In 1917, he joined Irving Berlin and Al Jolson in a war effort benefit called “Rabbis’ Sons Theatrical Benevolent Association.”</p>
<p>But how to explain his unceasing “raw ambition and relentless drive,” his fanatic quest for heroism and fame? At 17, taking the name of the great illusionist Robert-Houdin – Houdini adding the “i” because he was told it meant “like” – he later turned on Robert-Houdin, calling him a “fraud, a mere trickster.” Never a top-ranked magician or illusionist, Harry wanted to be the one and only great escape artist. Forever. In 1921, Funk and Wagnall’s Dictionary gave him that wish by introducing the verb “to Houdinize” – meaning “to release or extricate oneself from confinement, bonds or the like, as by wriggling out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Begley says his book doesn’t try to answer how Houdini did his tricks but why, he really doesn’t say why. His use of Houdini’s own words is minimal. And, as the title puts it, Houdini was elusive. He kept performing to massive crowds into his fifties, liberating himself from locks, chains, handcuffs, burial under six feet of dirt.</p>
<p>He did not, by the way, die, after challenging a fan to punch him in the abdomen, but of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix. Begley debunks this myth, along with others, though he can’t help musing on some psychoanalytical motives or recounting dubious anecdotes because they are simply too entertaining to pass up. It’s admirable though that he pushes no theory and just seems to marvel at the mystery of the man.

Dimarjio Jenkins was known as Houdini</p>
<p>Police have identified the man shot dead Tuesday on King st. West as Dimarjio Jenkins, a rapper. Mr. Jenkins place in the world of rap rankings as Houdini is unknown but his death seems to bring back a grim truth to many people tweeting Wednesday. Man dead, 2 others hurt in savage ambush at King and Peter</p>
<p>Never heard of this rapper if I&rsquo;m going to be honest with you all, but either way RIP to Houdini. I just hate seeing these rappers get shot or overdose on drugs. I wish we would have more of that uplifting and positive energy in the hip-hop/rap community. — 𝕧𝕚𝕔.𝕒𝕥𝕚_ (@VicenteAtilano2) May 27, 2020

The Britain’s Got Talent judges could only look on in shock after an escape act attempted to beat Harry Houdini’s underwater record in one of the most dangerous auditions yet.</p>
<p>Christian Wedoy’s death-defying stunt, which will air on Saturday night’s BGT, will see him stuck and padlocked underwater as he attempts to beat the record.</p>
<p>The Norwegian illusionist explained to Simon Cowell: ‘Houdini’s record was three minutes 30 seconds and at that time, there is a possibility of dying.’</p>
<p>And just like the infamous escape act himself, Christian is padlocked to the bottom of the tank by his assistant Hans.</p>
<p>He then gives five keys to the judges, and as you can imagine only one of those five keys can open the lock.</p>
<p>As the clock ticks beyond Houdini’s time, Hans explained to the judges and audience: ‘If we go over four minutes, we’re in a very bad place.’</p>
<p>I can’t look! (Picture: Tom Dymond/ITV)</p>
<p>The judges just looked on in horror (Picture: Tom Dymond/ITV)</p>
<p>Ant McPartlin can only look on as he exclaimed: ‘This is danger time now.</p>

<p>‘It’s hard to watch.’</p>
<p>Harry Houdini was a Hungarian-born American illusionist and stunt performer, famous for his amazing escape acts.</p>
<p>His first ever ‘trick’ was when he challenged the police to keep him locked up.</p>
<p>Soon after he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, straitjacket underwater stunts, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a milk can with water in it.</p>
<p>Britain’s Got Talent returns next Saturday at 8pm on ITV.</p>

<p>Advertenties Eigen cookies Om advertenties zo relevant mogelijk te maken voor u, gebruiken we cookies om op basis van uw klikgedrag op onze websites een beeld te krijgen van uw vermoedelijke interesses. Op basis van deze interesses kan u opgenomen worden in bepaalde segmenten, zoals ‘man, leeftijdscategorie 30 tot 45 jaar, getrouwd en kinderen, interesse in voetbal’. U krijgt vervolgens uiteraard andere advertenties te zien dan de segmenten ‘vrouw, leeftijdscategorie 20 tot 30 jaar, ongetrouwd, interesse in reizen’. Wanneer u op onze websites een account aanmaakt, kunnen we ook uw woonplaats, gender en leeftijd gebruiken om u in de juiste categorieën onder te brengen. We gebruiken hiervoor cookies van de volgende partners: Google Analytics</p>
<p>Salesforce DMP Cookies van derden Aan onze adverteerders staan we toe om door middel van cookies statistieken bij te houden over de effectiviteit van hun campagnes op onze sites, bijvoorbeeld om te meten hoe vaak er op hun advertenties geklikt is. Daarnaast werken we samen met advertentienetwerken en mediabureaus, die optreden als tussenpersoon tussen adverteerders en websitebeheerders. Deze partijen plaatsen cookies op onze websites om advertenties te kunnen uitleveren, wat ze kunnen doen op basis van informatie die ze eerder over u verzamelden op andere sites. Aan sommige advertentiepartners staan we toe om u ook te herkennen en te bereiken op andere websites. Dit betekent dat u op andere websites advertenties kan zien op basis van uw surfgedrag op onze websites.

Onze advertentiepartners kunnen op onze sites enkel informatie over uw toestel, zoals uw IP-adres, type browser, type besturingssysteem, en informatie over uw klikgedrag verzamelen, zoals de pagina’s die u bezoekt. Om adverteerders te laten beslissen of ze u willen bereiken, sturen we hen beperkte segmentinformatie door (bijvoorbeeld: man, 20-30 jaar oud). Hierbij worden nooit uw naam, telefoonnummer, thuisadres of e-mailadres gedeeld. Onze advertenties op andere websites Tenslotte maken we ook gebruik van cookies van derden om u advertenties over onze eigen websites en diensten te kunnen tonen op andere websites. Zo kan u bijvoorbeeld elders advertenties zien over onze proefabonnementen wanneer u een bepaald aantal artikels gelezen heeft op onze krantenwebsites. Hiervoor werken we samen met volgende partners: Facebook</p>
<p>Google Ad Words</p>
<p>Sociale media De artikelen en video’s die u op onze website bekijkt, kan u door middel van buttons delen via social media. Voor het functioneren van deze buttons wordt gebruik gemaakt van cookies van sociale media netwerken, zodat deze u herkennen op het moment dat u een artikel of video wilt delen. Daarnaast plaatsen sociale media netwerken ook cookies wanneer we hun content integreren in onze artikels, bijvoorbeeld wanneer een Instagram-filmpje wordt ingeladen. Voor de cookies die de sociale media netwerken plaatsen en de mogelijke data die zij hiermee verzamelen, verwijzen we naar de verklaringen die deze partijen op hun eigen websites daarover geven. Concreet gaat het om cookies van de volgende partijen: Facebook</p>

<p>Uw keuzemogelijkheden In het instellingen-scherm kan u zelf bepalen voor welke doeleinden u toelaat dat onze websites cookies plaatsen. Functionele cookies zullen steeds geplaatst worden omdat ze nodig zijn om de website te doen werken. Statistische cookies worden ook steeds ingeladen, omdat de gegevens die we daarmee verzamelen niet persoonsgebonden zijn. Cookies voor alle andere doeleinden kan u weigeren door te kiezen voor niveau 1. Let wel: u zal nog steeds advertenties zien, alleen zullen ze context-gebonden zijn en dus niet afgestemd zijn op uw voorkeuren. Mogelijk ziet u hierdoor ook vaker dezelfde advertenties. U kan het cookie instellingen menu steeds opnieuw oproepen via een link onderaan onze websites om een andere instelling te kiezen. In de meeste populaire browsers zoals Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge en Safari kan u in de instellingen bepalen welke cookies u op uw computer of toestel wil toestaan. U kan in elke browser er ook voor kiezen om alle cookies die reeds op uw computer staan te verwijderen. Let er wel op dat u deze instellingen voor elke browser op elk toestel dat u gebruikt apart moet aanpassen. Indien u ervoor kiest om in uw browser geen enkele soort cookies meer toe te laten, inclusief functionele cookies, kan dit een negatieve impact hebben op de werking van onze websites.</p>
<p>Tot slot nog dit… Het cookiebeleid hierboven zullen we af en toe moeten aanpassen, omdat bijvoorbeeld onze website of de regelgeving omtrent cookies wijzigt. U vindt op deze pagina altijd de meest recente versie, en u zal opnieuw gevraagd worden een cookiekeuze te maken wanneer dit cookiebeleid wijzigt.
