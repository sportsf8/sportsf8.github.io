<p>Chuck Berry circa 1958, Courtesy: Wikicommons. This is supposed to be a humor column. Granted, nobody has ever admitted to finding it funny, but that’s the general idea. But this week I’m not really feeling particularly humorous. Fortunately for me, it’s also kinda a column about music history now,…

<h3 id="the-story-behind-the-song-chuck-berrys-maybellene-a-hot-rod-romance">&ldquo;The Story Behind The Song: Chuck Berry’s ‘Maybellene’ a hot rod romance&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chuck_Berry_circa_1958.jpg?fit=800%2C567&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Noted as one of the first rock and roll songs of all time, Chuck Berry’s iconic tune ‘Maybellene’ was recorded on this day in 1955. It still stands the test of time as a fire-breathing party starter, but what is at the heart of this dancefloor ditty?</p>
<p>We’re taking a look at ‘The Story Behind The Song’ of Chuck Berry’s now famed number which, as well as being the archetypal rock and roll tune, acted as a unifying moment in integrated clubs and the hope of more peaceful times. Precisely because that’s exactly what Chuck Berry and Chess Records intended it to be.</p>
<p>Ten years on from the horrors of World War 2 and the world was beginning to heal itself, in fact, America was enjoying an unprecedented economic boom. It left the kids of America with a few extra nickels in their pocket, money they would happily put towards a new record. The perfect opportunity arose with the rise of integrated clubs that allowed black and white audiences to mix and opened up, not only a larger market for people like Leonard Chess, but the chance at a brief window of unity.</p>
<p>Berry had been playing integrated—or “salt and pepper” as he called them—clubs for some time when he noticed that his particularly bouncing version of Bob Wills’ Western Swing song ‘Ida Red’ was getting audiences up on their feet and dancing together. It encouraged him to record a version of the track which he renamed ‘Ida May’.</p>
<p>Moving forward it would take a little more encouragement from a certain Muddy Waters for Berry to bring the song to anyone’s attention though. Eventually, after pressure from Waters, Berry took ‘Ida May’ and a blues song ‘Wee Wee Hours’, which Berry had written, taking inspiration from Big Joe Turner’s ‘Wee Baby Blue’. Berry was confident that the blues number would “fit” Berry’s career and that this is where Leonard Chess, the head of Chess Records, would put his faith.</p>
<p>He was, of course, completely wrong. Chess was uninterested in ‘Wee Wee Hours’ and instead was captivated by the market opportunity of a “hillbilly song sung by a black man”. With the emergence of the newfound sociological term ‘teenager’ now coming complete with a blank cheque, every record producer in the business was trying to find something which had mass appeal. This fusion of genres was Chess’ shot.</p>
<p>From that moment on Berry and Chess worked extremely closely on the song. The pair were keen to change the name of the track after Chess described ‘Ida May’ and ‘Ida Red’ as “too rural”. The story goes that the team were knocking around ideas when, according to Berry’s pianist Johnny Johnson, Chess spotted an old mascara box on the floor and said: “Well, hell, let’s name the damn thing Maybellene”. They changed the spelling of the name to avoid a lawsuit and were soon in the studio.</p>
<p>To grab the attention of teenagers, Chess and Berry knew the song needed a big beat. On top of that, Chess was also confident that the track needed new lyrics. Back in 1955, there were only three things on a teenagers mind, a big beat, hot rod cars and teen lust. “The kids wanted the big beat, cars and young love,” Chess recalled. “It was the trend and we jumped on it.”</p>
<p>‘Maybellene’ was an instant smash and Chess’ changes were vindicated. It became one of the first records to be a hit on the rhythm and blues, country and western, and pop charts at the same time, highlighting it’s unifying properties.</p>
<p>Featuring some inimitable Chuck Berry riffs, the kind of riffs that would dictate guitar playing for decades, as well as some blues-style picking on a guitar and Johnson’s piano, which added a hummable rhythm to the steady backbeat, ‘Maybellene’ became a pivotal moment in rock and roll history. An exciting fusion of a rhythm-and-blues beat with a rural country style had become the catalyst of the rock and roll movement and a hint of more peaceful times.</p>
<p>Chuck Berry ‘Maybellene’ lyrics:</p>
<p>Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>Oh Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>You’ve started back doing the things you used to do.</p>
<p>As I was motivatin’ over the hill I saw</p>
<p>Maybellene in a coup de ville.</p>
<p>A Cadillac a-rollin’ on the open road,</p>
<p>Nothin’ will outrun my V8 Ford.</p>
<p>The Cadillac doin’ ’bout ninety-five,</p>
<p>She’s bumper to bumper rollin’ side by side.</p>
<p>Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>Oh Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>You’ve started back doing the things you used to do.</p>
<p>Pink in the mirror on top of the hill,</p>
<p>It’s just like swallowin’ up a medicine pill.</p>
<p>First thing I saw that Cadillac grille</p>
<p>Doin’ a hundred and ten gallopin’ over that hill.</p>
<p>Offhill curve, a downhill stretch,</p>
<p>Me and that Cadillac neck by neck.</p>
<p>Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>Oh Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>You’ve started back doing the things you used to do.</p>
<p>The Cadillac pulled up ahead of the Ford,</p>
<p>The Ford got hot and wouldn’t do no more.</p>
<p>It then got clody and it started to rain,</p>
<p>I tooted my horn for a passin’ lead</p>
<p>The rain water blowin’ all under my hood,</p>
<p>I knew that was doin’ my motor good.</p>
<p>Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>Oh Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>You’ve started back doing the things you used to do.</p>
<p>The motor cooled down, the heat went down</p>
<p>And that’s when I heard that highway sound.</p>
<p>The Cadillac a-sittin’ like a ton of lead</p>
<p>A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead.</p>
<p>The Cadillac lookin’ like it’s sittin’ still</p>
<p>And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill.</p>
<p>Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>Oh Maybellene, why can’t you be true?</p>
<p>You’ve started back doing the things you used to do.

<h3 id="loves-johnny-echols-on-playing-with-little-richard-vs-chuck-berry">&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Johnny Echols on Playing With Little Richard vs. Chuck Berry&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/05/Johnny-Echols-2013-billboard-1548-1590080317-1024x677.jpg" alt="img">
Johnny Echols made his rock n&rsquo; roll name with Love, serving as lead guitarist and a writer on the iconic Los Angeles group&rsquo;s first three albums &ndash; and now leading the current incarnation of the band. Before that, however, Echols had an association with the late Little Richard, in the studio and even touring with him in Europe. The relationship actually dates back to the Memphis-born Echols&rsquo; childhood in California, and on the same day Richard was laid to rest in Alabama, Echols &ndash; one of the artists featured in Epix&rsquo;s upcoming Laurel Canyon docuseries, premiering May 31 &ndash; recalled his experiences with rock&rsquo;s indelible Quasar.</p>
<p>I met Richard the first time through my uncle. He used to manage the California Club, which was what they used to call part of the Chitlin&rsquo; Circuit, and I met Richard there. But then Richard also used to come through the neighborhood when I was a kid growing up; I think he had a relative that lived in our neighborhood, and he used to come and hand out dollar bills to the kids. I knew him from that long before I met him musically.</p>
<p>Richard was very easy to play with, I&rsquo;ll put it that way. He had a specific way of doing things. He was quite different&hellip;. Like, Chuck Berry expected everybody to know his stuff, and if you missed one note he would be all over you. Richard was different than that; He would give people the space to kind of experiment within the stuff, and after he heard it he&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;I like that&rsquo; or &lsquo;Could you do something a little bit different?&rsquo; or whatever, whereas if you played with Chuck and you didn&rsquo;t play his stuff exactly the way it was, he&rsquo;s liable to come over and slap you or something.</p>
<p>He was an absolutely different person than the rock n&rsquo; roll persona he developed and husbanded. He was a very intelligent man, a very well-spoken, soft-spoken man. And it was really strange, almost like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He would be just regular Richard and he&rsquo;s talking in a deeper voice and he&rsquo;s articulate, and all of a sudden he goes into that character where he&rsquo;s this wild, flamboyant, sexually ambiguous persona &ndash; and it was definitely kind of disconcerting, especially &lsquo;cause I was still a kid and it was kind of hard to get next to the reasoning, why he was doing that. It didn&rsquo;t seem contrived; It seemed like that was who he was, but it was totally contrived. That&rsquo;s not the way he was at all.</p>
<p>He called it campaigning. He loved wrestling and people like Gorgeous George and those wrestlers who would do that kind of thing. They were always self-promoting. And Muhammad Ali. Well, Richard did the same thing, and I think (Love frontman) Arthur Lee got that from Richard, &lsquo;cause he was always self-promoting and taking credit for stuff he never had anything to do with. I guess he learned that from Richard.</p>
<p>Richard gave us the best advice anyone could have given us, about owning the publishing of our songs because we owned Grass Roots Music, and the lion&rsquo;s share of money is made through publishing, licensing your works to someone else or people covering it or whatever. It was always, &lsquo;Johnny, you better own your stuff! Don&rsquo;t ever let them take your stuff from you!&rsquo; &ndash; that&rsquo;s how he talked. So that was something we took to heart, and we signed with Elektra because of that. We had been offered nice sums of money to sign with Capitol and Columbia and Decca, but we went with Elektra because they were the only ones that would allow us to own the publishing, and that came directly from talking to Little Richard.</p>
<p>So I will forever be grateful to Richard for doing that, because it&rsquo;s allowed me to play music as my only job my entire life, and to live comfortably. And I&rsquo;m so sorry I didn&rsquo;t get to talk to him before he died. I tried to reach him through several people I knew, but I never spoke to him before he passed. But I&rsquo;m so grateful I had the time with him that I did.

<h3 id="chuck-berry-noir-cest-noir-sur-arte">&ldquo;Chuck Berry, noir c’est noir sur Arte!&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.f1g.fr/media/eidos/629x354_crop/2020/05/22/XVMb49cff78-9b40-11ea-af8a-cd2a69af0fcb.jpg" alt="img">
Elvis avait un physique et un charisme auxquels il était difficile de ne pas succomber. Mais il n’écrivait pas de chansons. Chuck Berry était un guitariste génial, un auteur original et un interprète stupéfiant, mais il n’a pas eu la reconnaissance du premier. Pourquoi? Parce qu’il était afro-américain. C’est, en peu de mots, la thèse défendue par ce remarquable documentaire britannique signé Jon Brewer, diffusé ce soir sur Arte à 22H35. Un film qui révèle de nombreuses informations jusque-là inconnues au sujet de Chuck Berry.</p>
<p>L’homme n’avait pas bonne presse: sa réputation de pingrerie était née de son habitude d’embaucher ses accompagnateurs quelques heures seulement avant son concert. On comprend à travers leurs témoignages que les guitaristes Nils Lofgren et Steve Van Zandt, qui devinrent ensuite les deux lieutenants de Bruce Springsteen, ne gardent pas un souvenir impérissable du jour où ils ont joué derrière leur maître, même si celui-ci reste pour beaucoup l’inventeur du rock’n’roll.</p>
<p>Maux de tête</p>
<p>Chuck Berry ne s’est pas employé à cultiver sa légende, c’est vrai. Il s’en fichait. Un extrait du film Hail! Hail! Rock’n’roll le montre méprisant à l’égard de Keith Richards, qui le vénérait comme un dieu. «Il me donnait encore plus de migraines que Mick Jagger», explique le Stone, qui avait monté un concert hommage en 1986. Seul Eric Clapton et John Lennon, que l’on voit partager la scène avec leur aîné, semblaient avoir ses faveurs. Ce dernier a dit: «Si le rock’n’roll avait un autre nom, il faudrait l’appeler Chuck Berry.»</p>
<p>Son épouse, ses enfants et petits-enfants peignent un tableau plein d’admiration pour ce type qui a souffert de démêlés avec la justice toute sa vie et dont les errements de jeunesse lui valurent un séjour en prison. «Uniquement parce qu’il était noir», affirme son avocat. CQFD.

<h3 id="rewind-white-people-stole-rock-and-roll-from-sister-rosetta-tharpe-and-chuck-berry">&ldquo;REWIND: White people stole rock and roll from Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Chuck Berry&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://riffmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1208-Chuck_Berry_circa_1958-604x345.jpg" alt="img">
This is supposed to be a humor column. Granted, nobody has ever admitted to finding it funny, but that’s the general idea. But this week I’m not really feeling particularly humorous.</p>
<p>Fortunately for me, it’s also kinda a column about music history now, at least after the original premise ran out of years. So, good news! It’s Black History Month now and it will continue until I say it’s not.</p>
<p>This week, we learn about how white people stole rock and roll.</p>
<p>Sister Rosetta Tharpe — “Strange Things Happening Every Day”</p>
<p>This is generally accepted as being the very first rock and roll song. Released in 1945, a full decade before Elvis broke out, this clearly set the template. It’s guitar-driven, it has the dance beat and the piano that was common to early rock and roll.</p>
<p>You’ll also notice it’s being performed by a Black woman. Who’s playing the guitar.</p>
<p>How many Black women do you know who lead rock bands now? How many Black women do you know who play lead guitar? Well, there should be more, because one of them started it all.</p>
<p>Jimmy Preston — “Rock the Joint”</p>
<p>But maybe you disagree. You don’t think Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first rock star for some incorrect, misguided reason.</p>
<p>Well, might I direct your attention to Jimmy Preston.</p>
<p>This may sound to you like Bill Haley and the Comets, one of the quintessential early rock and roll bands. That’s because the spectacularly white Bill Haley did an inferior cover of this song in 1952—three years after Preston. When he played it at a jazz club the Black members of the audience, familiar with Preston’s version, walked out.</p>
<p>And, honestly, wouldn’t you? It would be like if Tiffany Trump decided to cover Beyonce’s “Formation.”</p>
<p>Big Mama Thornton — “Hound Dog”</p>
<p>“Wait a second,” you may say. “Sure, Bill Haley covered ‘Rock the Joint’ and it wasn’t very good. But he was known for ‘Rock Around the Clock’ and that was his! He didn’t steal that!”</p>
<p>Well while he was stealing a Black hit from 1949 in 1952, Big Mama Thornton was innovating. You may recognize this song. Go ahead, claim it wasn’t important to Elvis four years later when he released his cover.</p>
<p>This is why I specifically say rock and roll was stolen rather than, say, appropriated, or brought into the mainstream. The Beastie Boys and Eminem “brought hip-hop into the mainstream” by being white, but at least they wrote and recorded their own songs. This is like if the first single off the Beastie Boys’ License to Ill was just an uncredited cover of “The Message” by Grandmaster Flash, or if Eminem’s debut was him doing Tupac’s “Dear Mama.”</p>
<p>Chuck Berry — “Johnny B. Goode”</p>
<p>“OK, fine, all the music was stolen,” you mockingly concede. “But what about Elvis’ stage presence? The dancing? The hips? That was all innovative! Unprecedented!”</p>
<p>I invite you to watch that video above. Especially from the one-minute mark through the end of his guitar solo at 2:10. You’ll be convinced he’s a time traveler.</p>
<p>He begins as, basically, Elvis. But Elvis had already been around by this point, though at no point in his life was he this good at playing the guitar. But as the solo goes on you see every guitar player all the way to today. You can see shades of Jimi Hendrix, of Bruce Springsteen, of Eddie Van Halen, of Jack White. You can see things that would impress me on stage today.</p>
<p>Forget Marty McFly inspiring Chuck Berry. Chuck Berry was still ahead of his time when “Back to the Future” came out in 1985. There are some guitar players who should be studying old videos of his performances right now.</p>
<p>Arthur “Big Boy” Crudup — “That’s All Right”</p>
<p>This isn’t a rock and roll song. It’s pretty clearly the blues. But I’m including it for two reasons. First, I want to emphasize that Elvis stole pretty much all his early music from Black people. He also covered Crudup’s “So Glad You’re Mine” and “My Baby Left Me,” because why not keep dipping into that well?</p>
<p>Second, Crudup is the quintessential example that, when white people stole rock and roll from Black people, they literally stole it. They didn’t just start playing it, too; Black people didn’t get to keep it or the profits.</p>
<p>While Elvis shot to fame on the strength of his songs, Crudup was barely getting by. He quit recording in the mid-’50s because, to quote the man himself, “I realized I was making everybody rich, and here I was poor.”</p>
<p>Reduced to working as a laborer and bootlegging to make ends meet while ironically being trumpeted as “The Father of Rock and Roll,” Crudup began fighting for royalties in 1968. First a record company agreed to pay him $60,000, but at the last minute refused to sign. In 1970 activists helped him sue but he lost.</p>
<p>Arthur Crudup died in 1974, still barely scraping by. Elvis Presley died in 1977 in his mansion with a net worth of about $5 million, the equivalent of $22 million today.</p>

<h3 id="jcs-revisited">&ldquo;JCS revisited&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hudsonvalleyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Jesus_Simon__l%C3%A4rjungarna_Jesus_Christ_Superstar_1972-e1591838916127.jpg" alt="img">
In the late Sixties, visceral, unpretentious old rock music began grappling with the forms and narrative ambitions of opera. Folk art aimed high. High art went slumming. Everyone got all mixed up. Even Hoyt Axton has a concept album about, as far as I can tell, Chinese communism. But Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s Jesus Christ Superstar might be the grandest expression of pop-culture values that pop culture has ever produced.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the first rock opera. Tommy preceded, and there are other claimants as well. But JCS might have been the first to come at it from the opera side. Webber studied at the Royal College of Music, not at the duck-walking feet of Chuck Berry with Mick and Keith.</p>
<p>To liken the life and struggle of Jesus to the living myth of the modern superstar was a pure pop-culture ejaculation. Webber and Rice weren’t timid. They could have moved from their first collaboration, the tepid but often pretty Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, to another myth with a distinctly modern, celebrity-culture resonance. Orpheus comes to mind. But no, they went right for the big JC. It was risky, but in the aftermath of Vatican II, not that risky.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Around the same time, the revelations of comparative mythology and Jungian symbolism were finally reaching popular consciousness, providing us plain folk with some heroic alternatives to the familial and sexual microfocus of Freudian self-understanding. Freud had been in the drinking water for so long that we were all unwitting Freudians — even those who couldn’t tell Sigmund from a sea monster.</p>
<p>But here, in the mind-blowing psychedelic age, that Joseph Campbell idea — that all-stories-are-one-story-and-it’s-your-story — exposed all myths, even the most active and sacred ones, to free culture play and the applications of personal psychology. Don’t tell me about your mother, tell me about this sea monster.</p>
<p>Jesus and superstars enjoy an implicit simpatico. They straddle the worlds and struggle to reconcile their ordinary humanity and their divinity. In 1970, the same year that Jesus Christ Superstar came out on vinyl, with Deep Purple’s Ian Gillian simply slaying the title role, one of our most tortured superstars (the one who had declared himself “bigger than Jesus”) had famously sung, “Who in the world do you think you are? A superstar? Well, right you are!”</p>
<p>So superstars are Everyman, but an Everyman who has gone to a place mortals probably shouldn’t go, and from which there is no easy return or revocation. In the opera, Jesus has his eloquent “Why me?” and “I want out” moment in the Garden of Gethsemane, but the savior/superstar bargain, kinda like the devil’s, has no out clause.</p>
<p>Tim Rice’s Judas implores Jesus to accept his purpose as political, historical and revolutionary, not as divine. Don’t believe the hype, he says, in so many words. You are Guevara, not God. And like Guevara, Jesus is bound for tee-shirts and bumper stickers and general commodification. Thus enters another late-stage counterculture theme: revolutionary co-optation, a pop culture process by which the genuinely transgressive becomes product.</p>
<p>JCS rocks but is not quite rock, exactly. It’s rock as it has always occurred to the ears of musical theater folk: badass fuzzed riffage and big square beats and, most of all, screams! An orgy of rock screams! Everybody gets to scream in this one. The first one comes halfway through the preamble of the opening song, Judas’ epic “Heaven on Their Minds,” and the very first word screamed (it will always be Murray Head for me) in this opera of ecstatic screaming is “Jesus!” Game on.</p>
