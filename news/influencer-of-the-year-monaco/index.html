<p>Inside Monaco: Playground Of The Rich</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>I May Destroy You</p>
<p>Rating:</p>
<p>Prince Albert of Monaco is a clutterbug. If he were living on benefits in Hull, you might see him on some programme with a title like The Nightmare Hoarder Next-Door, with piles of rotting clothes and magazines blocking every window.</p>
<p>But as he is the son of Grace Kelly and ruler of a ludicrously wealthy principality on the Riviera, no one dares tell him to give his office in the palace a tidy — certainly not the obsequious film-maker behind the camera of Inside Monaco: Playground Of The Rich (BBC2).</p>
<p>Albert’s desk is heaped with towers of books and folders of papers. The sideboard is buried under photographs, their frames stacked like LPs in a record shop.</p>
<p>Prince Albert of Monaco is a clutterbug. If he were living on benefits in Hull, you might see him on some programme with a title like The Nightmare Hoarder Next-Door, with piles of rotting clothes and magazines blocking every window</p>
<p>Every spare inch of wall space is hidden by framed medals and certificates. Most precarious of all are the tables crammed with ornaments: glass globes, porcelain statuettes, china birds, bottles, marble balls, lacquered boxes and all manner of tat.</p>
<p>You can’t really blame him. His whole domain looks like that: barely bigger than Hyde Park, Monaco is stuffed with so many buildings that one visitor described it as ‘luxury Legoland’. Space is at such a premium that extendable helipads have been constructed over the water, to give pilots extra room for landings.</p>
<p>Albert granted director Michael Waldman permission to film behind the scenes in the palace and to attend a party or two. This three-part documentary is simply happy to slip past the silken entrance rope and squeeze inside.</p>
<p>In return for access, there are no difficult questions or sharp observations. A couple of brief, fawning interviews with the Prince allow him to get away with saying practically nothing.</p>
<p>Inside Monaco amounts to a promotional video: you can imagine it on a loop in the hotel foyers, an endless cavalcade of air kisses and supercars.</p>
<p>You can’t really blame him. His whole domain looks like that: barely bigger than Hyde Park, Monaco is stuffed with so many buildings that one visitor described it as ‘luxury Legoland’</p>
<p>Waldman was curious to know only what everything cost.</p>
<p>From off-camera, we kept hearing a voice ask: ‘Any idea how much this would be?’ like a nosy customer wasting the sales staff’s time in a jewellery shop.</p>
<p>Thus we learned that a harbour berth for a megayacht is two grand a night, that the biggest bottle of champagne at a reception cost £28,000 and the white truffle in the kitchen is worth £35,000 — the same price as a night in the Princess Grace suite at the Hotel de Paris — and that every Monaco resident must keep half a million in a current account at all times.</p>
<p>Also, the monthly rental of a one-room apartment is . . . oh, really, who cares? The interviewee who reluctantly told us most was a yacht worker called Tommy who refused to reveal the name of his employer: ‘I don’t want to have a horse’s head in my bed tomorrow morning, know what I mean?’ Yes, we get the picture.</p>
<p>One of the parties was an awards ceremony for social media’s Influencer of the Year — the kind of event where you might find Arabella, played by Michaela Coel in her drama serial I May Destroy You (BBC1).</p>
<p>Arabella is a writer, feted for a novel created on Twitter, who goes out clubbing in London with friends and regains consciousness with her phone smashed and her face bleeding.</p>
<p>Slowly, she begins to fear she was drugged and sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Arabella is a writer, feted for a novel created on Twitter, who goes out clubbing in London with friends and regains consciousness with her phone smashed and her face bleeding</p>
<p>The story is told in half-hour bites, and the first wasn’t enough to gauge yet how engaging it will be.</p>
<p>But Coel is a powerful actress, and I May Destroy You is based on traumatic personal experience.</p>
<p>Give it a couple of weeks: this could be the new Fleabag.</p>
<p>Flimsy evidence of the night: True crime documentary Murder In The Outback (C4) gave us a lot of innuendo to discredit the story Joanne Lees told police about the disappearance of her boyfriend Peter Falconio — but very little hard fact. Frustrating.

He is the ruler of one of the wealthiest and most glamorous countries on Earth with a personal fortune estimated at more than $1 billion. Prince Albert of Monaco has a problem, however. His subjects are getting too old.</p>

<p>There is a powerful moment in Stephen S Thompson’s real-life drama about the Windrush scandal when Janet (Nadine Marshall) looks at marks on the wallpaper where her pictures once hung, her stable, happy life turned to shadows. She has been forced to leave her home after her partner, Anthony Bryan (Patrick Robinson) is told he is not a British citizen, despite legally travelling from Jamaica as an eight-year-old to join his mother in 1965.

<p><img src="https://www.abouther.com/sites/default/files/2019/10/24/main_-_influencer_awards.jpg" alt="img">
Earlier this month, over 600 invitees attended the Influencer Awards Monaco 2019 Gala Dinner, where influencers from around the world were welcomed and recognized for their dedication and influential qualities in a number of categories including; Fashion, Beauty, Fitness, Food, Travel, Philanthropy, Photography, Lifestyle and more. The glamorous event took place at Monte Carlo’s infamous “La Salle des Etoiles,” and was an invitation only, black tie event.</p>
<p>Sponsored by APM Monaco, the Influencer Awards Monaco is now in its second year, as it first launched last year with an objective to highlight the best influencers on an international scale. The concept was conceived and created by Belgian entrepreneur, Lolita Abraham and on this year’s jury panel, she welcomed, Princess Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies, as well as the likes of Mickey Boardman, British fashion designer Julien MacDonald, and author of popular bestseller, “The Kim Kardashian Principle,” Jeetendr Sehdev.</p>
<p>The Influencer Awards Monaco has amassed over 81 million views on social media and 7 million interactions since it’s inauguration, and that number continues to grow. Lolita Abraham had been born into the fashion industry and grew up surrounded by successful and inspirational entrepreneurs. Taking that influence, she created new shopping experiences for concept stores throughout Asia via her visual intelligence agency in Monaco, Monacolab.mc alongside her partner, influencer, PR Agent and Entrepreneur Maureen Kragt.</p>
<p>One of the most highly anticipated awards was “2019 Influencer of the Year,” and it happened to be awarded to Jonathan Kubben Quiñonez of @momimfine. The influencer and entrepreneur, uses social media and his platform to spread messages of compassion, positivity, and love. Jonathan also aims to raise awareness about living in a socially and environmentally conscious way, and uses his sustainable, fair trade brand, “MOM I’M FINE – THE LABEL,” to raise money for the Mom I’m Fine Foundation to build a community center in Mexico from recycled plastics for children. His vision for the community center will focus on educating children on education, arts, sports, culture and environmental issues.</p>
<p>Beauty and fashion were the categories that also gained a lot of traction and the Beauty Influencer of the Year Award was won by New York based hair artist, Jennifer Yepez. Her forte is to craft dramatic and adventurous hair styles and is often employed by celebrity clients who want to turn heads at red carpet events, some of which include Victoria’s Secret model, Emily Ratajkowski, Sophia Vergara, Jennifer Lopez star of “Euphoria,” Zendaya. Yepez’s work can be found across a number of publications and brand campaigns such as Vogue, NARS and CELINE.</p>
<p>The Fashion Influencer of the Year Award went to Erica Pelosini Leeman, an extroverted Italian stylist, editor and creative director who is recognized for her bed-head hairstyle and couture wardrobe. She is idolized for her head turning style and perfectly posed social media pictures.</p>

<h3 id="influencer-awards-monaco-2019-digital-oscars-for-influencers">&ldquo;Influencer Awards Monaco 2019: «digital Oscars» for influencers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomonaco.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Skiss-1134.jpg" alt="img">
Influencers are a 21st century phenomenon that even the world’s largest brands don’t dare to ignore today. Having built their images within social networks, these young and successful representatives of the «digital generation» have achieved recognition from their followers by the millions. Today the label of being a «Celebrity» is not only reserved to Hollywood’s rich and famous but has transcended to being «Instafamous» as well.</p>
<p>The Principality of Monaco is a place where key actors from different industries meet on a regular basis. Since 2018, «digital entrepreneurs» have their own annual event to officially celebrate their achievements, the Influencer Awards Monaco.</p>
<p>On October 6, Monaco hosted the 2nd Influencer Awards ceremony, which received an incredible response from around the world. We spoke with Lolita Abraham, founder of IAM who shared some statistics with us: «Last year, we organized the 1st edition of IAM and the impact was amazing. We reached about 7 million people and had over 81 million interactions which really put Monaco in the spotlight».</p>
<p>Since her childhood, Lolita has been involved in the fashion industry and has grown up amongst entrepreneurs. 2 years ago she came to the conclusion that the work of influencers was underrated and while searching for her next project, decided to create IAM.</p>
<p>In Lolita’s quest to further structure the digital world surrounding influencers, next year the young entrepreneur plans to create a charitable foundation, which in the future will support associations collaborating with influencers and bring to light another key aspect of their work and dedication.</p>
<p>And if that wasn’t enough, Lolita teamed up with Monaco-raised Maureen Kragt and the pair co-founded MonacoLab, a leading Agency in transformative visual identity and communications.</p>
<p>Maureen who has also been an integral part of the IAM team since its beginning heads up the influencer press relations; she told us what made the 2019 edition so special.</p>
<p>«The 2nd edition was exceptional; twice as many influencers as the first year and over 30 nationalities gathered in the Principality. IAM’s vision grows with each edition. This year we gained credibility as an awarding body, thanks to the hard work and dedication from everyone involved. Our main goal has always been to provide support and recognition to all of the influencers and their commitment to these «digital» careers that have developed with the boom in Social Media, especially Instagram.</p>
<p>This year, we wanted to «up the game» and put extra effort into making the main Gala event unforgettable. It was amazing to be able to work with exceptional partners like Ali Bakhtiar who has been designing events and interiors for almost 3 decades, working with VIPs and royalty across the globe».</p>
<p>According to Maureen, this year’s edition saw new categories emerge like «Gaming» and «Best brand marketing campaign». It is important to recognise brands who are influencer friendly and reward them for being pioneers of their time, recognizing the power that influencers have on society.</p>
<p>This year, winners were selected in 14 categories. Among the influencers honoured during the ceremony were Hofit Golan, Tony Kelly, Maya Malnar and many others.</p>
<p>This year, Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies presided over the jury. Exclusively for HelloMonaco, she highlighted the selection criteria for the winners and pointed out that influencers’ work is mistakenly regarded as superficial.</p>
<p>«The influencers are so devoted. It’s a job. I mean, people think that being an influencer is superficial. Actually, not at all. It’s a real job, it takes dedication. You work 24 hours a day. No holidays!»</p>
<p>What does a representative of the Italian royal family have to do with the digital industry?</p>
<p>«You see, I come from a background of traditions, values, and history. The way I explain it to my husband, who is a member of the Italian royal family, is that I want to become a bridge of sorts between modern times and the past», explained the wife of Prince Carlo of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.</p>
<p>Winners are selected according to definite criteria. «We know how many followers people have», Princess Camilla continues. «But it’s especially the quality of their Instagram feed, of what they post every day that matters». The quality and frequency of publications, the absence of fake followers and a powerful message behind their Instagram feed: these are the main criteria of success for every influencer.</p>
<p>Another jury member shared with us his vision of being a «digital businessman». Jeetendr Sehdev knows what it means to be an influencer firsthand, because he is the author of the bestselling book «The Kim Kardashian Principle», where he explained what popularity depends on. Jeetendr is a pop-culture expert and a columnist at the Financial Times. He told us what it means to him to be an influencer:</p>
<p>«I think being an influencer is a big responsibility. But the power of influencers comes from the fact that they are very much living their lives on their own terms and doing what they want to do. And I think that is a very inspiring message, that’s a very responsible message to youth audiences today. They say ‘Look, we have this life, we have to be grateful for it, we’ve got to make the most of it, and we’ve got to carve out our own path, so we don’t necessarily have to conform and do what everyone else is doing’. I think that’s their largest responsibility».</p>
<p>After the success of the 2nd IAM edition, it’s quite clear that this event, organized by young, ambitious and influential people, will take root in the Principality for years to come.</p>

<h3 id="iam-2019-beauty-influencer-of-the-year-jennifer-yepez">&ldquo;IAM 2019 Beauty Influencer of the Year: Jennifer Yepez&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thebeautyinfluencers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/JYepez.jpg" alt="img">
On Oct 6th, more than 600 guests attended the Influencer Awards Monaco 2019 Gala Dinner at the legendary “La Salle des Etoiles” (Sporting Club) in Monte-Carlo. Influencers from around the globe were awarded for their hard work and dedication throughout various categories including: Entertainment, Beauty, Fashion, Fitness &amp; Wellness, Food, Entrepreneurship, Gaming, Lifestyle, Philanthropy, Travel, Visual Arts. The highlight of the invitation only black tie event was the announcement of the 2019 Influencer of the Year.</p>
<p>This year, the Influencer of the Year Award went to Jonathan Kubben Quiñonez of @momimfine –a movement that distances itself from negativity and focuses on uniting people by spread a positive message of love and compassion in a socially and environmentally conscious way, and encouraging people to share and wear their empowering message through their sustainable and fair trade clothing brand: MOM I’M FINE – THE LABEL. A portion of the money raised from their label supports the Mom Im Fine Foundation which plans to build a community center for children in Mexico out of recycled plastics focusing on culture, education, arts and sports while raising awareness of environmental issues and helping children understand how they can change their daily actions to make a positive impact on our world.</p>
<p>And the IAM2019 Beauty Influencer of the Year Award was presented to Jennifer Yepez @jennifer_yepez –the international, New York-based hairstylist artist who some may remember from her many years working with Redken’s Guido Palau. Yepez’s talent in creating bold, dramatic looks is often called upon by clients who want show-stopping fashion moments on the red carpet, including Zendaya and Emily Ratajkowski. In addition to working with publications like Vogue and clients including Versace and Nars, she has also keyed fashion shows and presentations for Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Céline. Her sexy, voluminous hair looks have been seen on the red carpets from the Cannes Film Festival to NYFW and the Met Gala. Latina-American, Yepez has worked with many Latina-American stars including Salma Hayek, Sophia Vergara, Jenifer Lopez and Jessica Alba.</p>
<p>Yepez told us, “Its an honor -especially in my field, where its a man’s world. As a woman, and at that a Latina woman, I am grateful and truly honored! I am proud to represent women in the beauty industry and I have definitely worked hard and earned my place to be here. What I think that’s so special is to be recognized worldwide –especially in Monaco. To look at someone like me from New York and to be recognized for my passion and talent, well, I am truly blessed, and I hope that more women can win this award in years to come. Women on the rise!”</p>
<p>We congratulate this woman on the rise, Jennifer Yepez!</p>
