<p>The noted singer who comes from the famous Kakkar background had roped in Kumkum Bhagya actress Leena Jumani for his last song titled Tera Crop Top. Itâ€™s now been known that famous tik tok star Nisha Gurgain who holds more than 20 million followers as her fan base will be Nitz&rsquo;s muse for Sarita Bhabhi.</p>
<p>Nitz Kakkar shared, â€œSarita Bhabhi is a fun loving, romantic number set in the background of Delhi. The music video will see Sarita Bhabhi (played by Nisha) and her husband (played by me) and his struggle to manage to get into the house without the keys, where he requests her to unbolt the door with his friends helping him throughout. This song will be shot in a typical North Indian set up where hanging in and around the balcony, a guy and a girl talking through eye contact across the road are very common.&rdquo;
