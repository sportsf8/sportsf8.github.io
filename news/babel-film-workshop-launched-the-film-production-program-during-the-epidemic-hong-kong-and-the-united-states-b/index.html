<h3 id="babel-film-workshops-filmmaking-initiative-brings-together-hong-kong-and-us-students-amid-pandemic">&ldquo;Babel Film Workshop&rsquo;s Filmmaking Initiative Brings Together Hong Kong and US Students Amid Pandemic&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/img/favicon-TN3.png" alt="img">
HONG KONG, CHINA - Media OutReach - 27 July 2020 - Over the past five months, students from Hong Kong and New Haven have been participating in a stay-at-home filmmaking program that guides them to create short films about their experiences during the pandemic. The initiative, called Film Stylo, was started by Jeremy Hung, founder of Babel Film Workshop, amid an arts residency at Yale, and has resulted in an international archive of student films documenting this historic time.</p>

<p>In January, Jeremy arrived at the university for a fellowship administered by the Yale-China Association and supported by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York. Jeremy had begun working with US students to promote arts and cultural exchange, but school closures in March abruptly cancelled his plans. Under lockdown at home, Jeremy launched Film Stylo as an online filmmaking initiative to address students&rsquo; emotional wellness and foster intercultural empathy through filmmaking.</p>
<p>Over 200 students worldwide have since signed up. &ldquo;Many of our students have produced their best work as a result,&rdquo; said Kieran Ryan, Head of Film at King George V School. The films have been shared with other student filmmakers across the globe. &ldquo;I feel like I can relate to others who participated in the initiative,&rdquo; reflected Yareli Calderon Romero, a junior at a New Haven Public School. &ldquo;It made my experience feel a lot better and less lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Eunice Yuen, a Child Psychiatry Fellow at the Yale Child Study Center, has also contributed to the initiative&rsquo;s design. &ldquo;One of our goals is to foster the psychological concept of mentalization through self-reflection, sharing, and discussion,&rdquo; Dr. Yuen said. &ldquo;Mentalization helps students nourish a healthy sense of self and others in the world, promoting empathy, diversity, and inclusion in our next generation of students.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After his fellowship, Jeremy plans to develop Film Stylo into a global filmmaking platform that provides visual literacy education and facilitates arts and cultural exchange between classrooms around the world. &ldquo;The pandemic has made it clear that students&rsquo; lives today are dominated by technology, so it&rsquo;s more important than ever that we teach them to keep sight of what makes us human,&rdquo; said Jeremy. &ldquo;As the world&rsquo;s most powerful communication medium, filmmaking is the best way of doing that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Babel Film Workshop</p>
<p>Babel Film Workshop began advocating and advancing visual literacy education for Hong Kong students in 2018. Since then, it has provided opportunities for hundreds of students to engage in the most powerful communication medium in the world by teaching film as a universal language. Its team of filmmakers and educators is dedicated to promoting film culture as a crucial way to increase our empathy of others.

<h3 id="18-of-the-best-film-scenes-to-test-picture-quality">&ldquo;18 of the best film scenes to test picture quality&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NQspwS4NAXc7DSFkkVhcXP-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
You&rsquo;ve followed our &lsquo;How to set up your TV and get the best picture&rsquo; guide and you&rsquo;re ready to put your incredible new TV through its paces. All you need now is the content to prove it was money well spent (and a room full of people to show it all off to) - the best film scenes to test picture quality is why you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>Every TV and projector that passes through our home cinema rooms is tested using some of the latest and greatest 4K Blu-rays, so we&rsquo;ve put together a list of some of our favourite film scenes which we use for revealing just how worthy the display we&rsquo;re watching really is.</p>
<p>Some are helpful for examining colour and contrast, others are better tests of detail and motion handling, but all will let you see for yourself just how good your TV or projector is at its job.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: please do try this at home.</p>
<p>Alien Covenant (2017, chapter 1)</p>
<p>(Image credit: 20th Century Fox)</p>
<p>A white room with a black piano, one man dressed all in white, one dressed all in black - this is not a scene that&rsquo;s going to test your TVs ability to produce colours, or motion for that matter. The opener of this Alien film is all about contrast and detail.</p>
<p>A poor TV will render this as a fairly simple display of monochrome but a good quality HDR set should have the lighting levels just right and so much to see in the light and dark areas that it becomes a rich palette unto itself.</p>
<p>Look out for textures - the actors&rsquo; clothing, the marble of the statue, the polished concrete floor, the lacquer of the piano and the bone china tea set. Nothing should be lost. Then for straight 4K detail there&rsquo;s skin details of the close-ups and the glory of the lakeside window view. It&rsquo;s a lovely, wide, piece of cinema.</p>
<p>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017, chapter 1)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Marvel)</p>
<p>Skies are great for testing out picture quality and this MCU classic opens with a big ole Missouri one. It&rsquo;s the only Earth-bound sequence in the film as we follow an afternoon with lovers Meredith Quill and Ego. Look for your TV&rsquo;s ability to handle contrast in the renders of the clouds. You&rsquo;re after a subtle shading rather than dramatic patches of dark and light.</p>
<p>Then, looking to the ground, do the brown earth and the green grass and the yellow crops all look a convincing and natural colour balance? Can you see the dark details in Ego&rsquo;s clothing once we&rsquo;re zoomed in on the couple, and can the motion processing in your set handle the movement of their blue car without giving it too much judder or the home video look? Within three minutes, this film will tell you everything about your TV that there is to know.</p>

<p>Spider-man: Homecoming (2017, chapter 10)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Marvel)</p>
<p>The Staten Island Ferry scene is one of the most enjoyable sequences in the MCU. Action-packed and entertaining with plenty of sharp dialogue and superhero crossover, it&rsquo;s also an excellent sight to behold in 4K.</p>
<p>Right off the bat, it&rsquo;s a brilliant test of colour and texture with the future fabric look and feel of Spidey&rsquo;s suit an excellent counterpoint to the yellow riveted hull of the ferry and the bright blue New York City sky.</p>
<p>When we move into the action, it&rsquo;s all about motion processing and whether your TV can hang on to all that fantastic 4K detail as Spider-man, the Vulture and, ultimately, Iron Man, take to the air.</p>
<p>Blade Runner 2049 (2017, chapter 11)</p>
<p>Denis Villeneuve’s belated sequel to Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is very much its own beast and while the original benefitted from Jordan Cronenworth’s neon-dipped visuals, 2049 brings its ‘A’ game with Roger Deakin’s Oscar-winning cinematography.</p>
<p>Use of HDR appears to be minimally applied; it’s the use of Wide Colour Gamut (WCG) that takes centre stage here. 2049 has a rich, textured look and striking use of lighting techniques throughout and none is that more apparent than in the impressive Las Vegas scene.</p>
<p>Covered with the fallout of a dirty bomb, the rusty orange haze of the Las Vegas setting should provide a good test of your TV’s control over tint and hue. Get it wrong and you won&rsquo;t be able to appreciate the many layers within the image.</p>
<p>Detail and clarity will also get a workout as, despite the prevalence of orange, you should be able to make out the details on K’s (Ryan Gosling) face as well as the erosion of the battered surfaces and cracked statues that surround him.</p>
<p>Casino Royale (2006, chapter 2)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Sony Pictures)</p>
<p>The motorbike chase in the opening to Skyfall is a strong contender but it’s the elaborate parkour pursuit from Casino Royale we find most telling.</p>
<p>It’s eight enthralling minutes of fast, blink-and-you-miss-it action as Bond and the bad guy jump from crane to crane, demanding a smooth handling of motion from your display.</p>
<p>This is where motion processing – a system&rsquo;s ability to analyse the image and insert repeated frames or blank ones into the video sequence to prevent a jerky end result – can be helpful. Just be aware that high levels in less efficient TVs can cause blurry halos around the moving image.</p>
<p>Deadpool (2016, chapter 4)</p>
<p>(Image credit: 20th Century Fox)</p>
<p>One of Marvel&rsquo;s most beloved superheroes, Deadpool is all spectacle and sarcasm – the former of which makes this 4K Blu-ray such a strong test disc.</p>
<p>The 12-bullet countdown scene on the freeway not only entertainingly introduces the anti-hero&rsquo;s character but also lays your display&rsquo;s transparency bare. That&rsquo;s largely down to the vibrancy and textures of his red spandex suit – impressive enough to awaken the fashion designer in you – and slow-mo sequences, in which the sparkle of shattered glass on the floor and the gleam of bullets should be obvious to the eye.</p>

<p>Dunkirk (2017)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Warner Bros.)</p>
<p>Such are the limited locations and the way that this film is cut together, that almost any chapter of this wartime epic is an excellent test picture power. Texture, colour, contrast, motion control, light and dark detail - this film pushes it all and, shot in IMAX, much of it fills your whole screen too with no letterbox black bars at the top or bottom.</p>
<p>The best sequences to look out for are those in the Spitfires. Of course, it’s the shading of the clouds and the sea that are the most obvious things to look out for but the texturing of the pilot’s outfits is a superb opportunity for your TV to shine. The costume department on Dunkirk did an amazing job with the wardrobe throughout the cast, and a good TV will give a wonderfully realistic, thick and coarse feel to the army fatigues and a genuine sense of handmade stitching to the leather.</p>
<p>Look out for the dark details on Kenneth Branagh’s Navy overcoat, the wonderful colours as the stalled pilot comes in to land on the great wide sands and the four flagpoles on the beach at the end of chapter 1 which judder like mad unless your motion processing is right on the money.</p>

<p>The Fall (2006, chapter 6)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Roadside Attractions)</p>
<p>A film about a hospitalised stuntman in 1920s California who befriends an imaginative young girl and tells her an epic tale about five mythical heroes, The Fall delivers some serious eye-candy - it&rsquo;s one of the most stunning Blu-ray transfers in our collection.</p>
<p>With the dazzling hues of the utopian landscapes as well as flamboyant costumes, the tribal chant scene is a banquet of eye-popping colour that will test your kit’s ability with a rich palette. Lush green gardens should pop amidst desert valleys, and the vast vistas also lay bare your TV or projector’s perception of depth.</p>
<p>Gravity (2013, chapter 2)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Warner Bros.)</p>
<p>Alfonso Cuaron’s thrilling sci-fi flick may have lost out to 12 Years a Slave as Best Picture in the 2014 Academy Awards, but it’s not surprising Gravity won Best Visual Effects.</p>
<p>The scene with the space-walk is especially telling of contrast and dark detail, with the whites of the spacesuits and spaceship just pixels apart from the blackness of space. Do whites bleed into black or are they clear-cut? Earth&rsquo;s edges should look bright and well-defined, and when Doctor Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) detaches, you should see a smattering of stars shining at different intensities.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of 3D then there&rsquo;s even more to enjoy. It’s a convincing and immersive watch, and your TV will need stability and clarity for space debris to be distinct as it flies past your face – and as Bullock swings around the screen.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: The Final Cut (2017, chapter 17)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Warner Bros.)</p>
<p>Unlike most people approaching middle age, Blade Runner can confidently say it&rsquo;s 35 years old and has never looked better. That&rsquo;s something it can thank the powers that be for, as studios haven&rsquo;t been shy in giving older films the 4K HDR treatment for their Ultra HD Blu-ray reissues.</p>
<p>Aspects of the film&rsquo;s picture that appeared fuzzy on the standard Blu-ray are rendered with startling clarity on this transfer (which was mastered from the 4K digital intermediate re-worked under the supervision of Ridley Scott.)</p>
<p>HDR has been added to the equation too – and to good effect. When Deckard chases Zhora through the strip-mall, the extra colour intensity and nuance, as well as the bolstered contrast between the naturally dark, dingy setting and the neon lights that blaze against it, give the scene a sense of revitalisation.</p>
<p>Logan (2017, chapter 11)</p>
<p>(Image credit: 20th Century Fox)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an unflinchingly brutal, violent and bleak film. But it’s surprisingly colourful. Going against the grain of dark, cool-toned superhero films, Logan - at most times - is bathed in sunlight and warm tones.</p>
<p>The first major fight scene in chapter 11 is a perfect example of this: dust and blood against a backdrop of perfect blue sky and fluffy white clouds. From the textures of dirt and desert sand clinging to Logan’s black suit and his grizzly, scarred face to the various shades of brown in their surroundings, it’s a test of your screen’s ability to deliver crisp and nuanced detail.</p>
<p>The bright, sunlit scenes will show off how well your TV handles contrast, especially when the action cuts to gloomier shots inside the car. There’s depth to the dusty blacks and the blood splattered across Laura’s jumper. And when Logan and Laura start stabbing their enemies, you’ll hope your screen has a firm grip on motion handling.</p>
<p>Murder on the Orient Express (2017)</p>
<p>(Image credit: 20th Century Fox)</p>
<p>This latest version of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express from Kenneth Branagh is an OK-ish adaptation of the famous story. But it does differ from prior adaptations in one way – its use of 70mm cinematography.</p>
<p>Branagh decided to go widescreen (taking a few cues from a film he worked on: Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk) and gives the story a lavish treatment and this native 4K HDR rendition really is a sight for sore eyes.</p>
<p>Taking place mainly on the Orient Express of the title, the scene where we’re first introduced to all the characters is a prime one for black performance, detail and colour.</p>
<p>The punchiness of the colours, use of impressionistic lighting and the added detail 70mm can scrub up will give a good test for how adept your TV is.</p>
<p>Raid (2011, chapter 15)</p>
<p>(Image credit: SinemArt)</p>
<p>Forget Karate Kid. This Indonesian action movie, in which a police squad raid a tower block to capture a notorious crime lord is 100 minutes of high-adrenalin Pencack Silat action (that&rsquo;s Indonesian martial arts to you and me).</p>
<p>The three-man final fight is a humdinger. Not only are its hit-a-second sequences a great test for motion but, as it also takes place in a dimly lit run-down apartment, this scene really separates the TVs that are able to extract dark detail from those that hide it in the shadows.</p>
<p>Playing with contrast and brightness settings will pay off here because, trust us, you’ll want to see that fatal throat slice in all its gory. Well, we do.</p>
<p>Interstellar (2014, chapter 13)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Paramount)</p>
<p>Mann&rsquo;s planet is an excellent place to test out HDR. Its frozen landscape is a brilliant mix of very light and very dark within the same frames, and your TV will need a broad contrast range to be able to handle it all properly and render each shot with the light and dark details that they deserve.</p>
<p>Look for definition and form to the ice clouds compared to the frost on the ground and their texture in comparison to the charcoal coloured rocky surface. The result should be a bold, punchy image that still doesn&rsquo;t scrimp on shading and subtlety, and allows each small accent colour on the uniforms and equipment to really pop.</p>
<p>As a bonus, watch out for some beautiful 4K detail on the water droplets on Dr Mann&rsquo;s helmet. Cosmic.</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 (2011, chapter 12)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Warner Bros.)</p>
<p>The Dark Lord in almost total darkness - this chapter begins with Voldemort and his Death Eaters, all black robed, on a dark hillside, in the middle of the night. And it doesn&rsquo;t get much brighter as the scenes go on. If you can see much more than their pale faces against the blanket of black, then you&rsquo;re doing well.</p>
<p>The temptation is to boost the brightness levels, during the siege on Hogwarts, until you can see what&rsquo;s going on but, on a poor TV, that will most likely destroy the black depth, and any bright details will become blown out once you finally reach a lighter moment.</p>
<p>Instead, a quality picture should give you just enough on-screen detail while maintaining the intensity of the darkness, and when the first volley of spell-fire explodes on the Hogwarts shield, it should look, well, magical.</p>
<p>Stoker (2013, chapter 3)</p>
<p>(Image credit: Fox Searchlight)</p>
<p>You don’t always have to use the latest, flashiest, CGI-filled sci-fi films to test your kit’s picture quality. Thanks to its subdued, natural-looking colour palette, Park Chan-wook’s psychological thriller Stoker is a demanding workout for any screen.</p>
<p>The shadows clinging to the vast, empty house give the film its tension, and the TVs and projectors that can dig up the finest detail and deliver subtle, deep blacks will offer the best sense of depth and drama. The pale skin, the glossy wooden polish on the piano, the pastel green wallpaper and the natural lighting that seeps through the house – do they all look real and convincingly solid?</p>
<p>Take note whenever you see someone standing near the staircase: is there a convincing distance between them? Lesser screens will make the staircase look flat, and won’t quite draw you into the strange drama unfolding within this family. The DVD transfer is decent too, making it a good test of your TV or Blu-ray player’s scaling.</p>
<p>Life of Pi (2012, chapter 1)</p>
<p>(Image credit: 20th Century Fox)</p>
<p>The opening of film this is a riot of colour and wonderful 4K detail. It&rsquo;s the title sequence which shows shot after shot of the glorious wildlife in Pi&rsquo;s family Pondicherry zoo.</p>
<p>It almost seems like a demo video as we see a shocking pink flamboyance of flamingos (genuine collective noun), the fine hair of the wobbly-nosed Proboscis monkey, the glistening water on the noses of the tapirs and even the bright painted palm tree bases and the orange of the southern Indian soil should be a treat to behold.</p>
<p>If this sequence doesn&rsquo;t wow you, then you might need to play with your colour settings. Or a buy a new TV, of course. Need some advice?</p>

<p>The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (2011, chapter 2)</p>
<p>3D may be out of fashion but we think this Spielberg animation is a great example of how immersive, rather than distracting, 3D video can be when it&rsquo;s done right.</p>
<p>An incredible &lsquo;one-shot&rsquo; chase towards the middle of the film is impressive, but we love the charming scene at the beginning where our hero Tintin first comes across a fateful model ship - the Unicorn. It&rsquo;s a masterclass in animation. Tintin’s reflections in the multiple mirrors look startlingly real, while the slow pan around the Unicorn in its glass case will reveal judders if your screen isn&rsquo;t rock-solid with motion. The artificial sheen you get when cranking up a TV’s motion processing settings tends to be less noticeable with animation than with live-action films, so feel free to tweak away to reduce those motion blurs or judders.</p>
<p>The 3D effect is subtle but totally pulls you into the world of the movie, and provided your screen is set-up correctly you&rsquo;ll find yourself wanting to be strolling down the market street in the bright sunshine, haggling with crotchety old men about the price of a ship.</p>

<h3 id="nayakan-one-film-to-rule-them-all">&ldquo;Nayakan: One film to rule them all&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/7/27/w600X390/Nayaga00n.jpg" alt="img">
Sujatha Narayanan By</p>
<p>This week, this column is about a film that has gone on to shape my future lists of favourite films and actors, favourite writers and directors. In a world where cinema exists only in our minds and TV screens, nostalgia is a great pool to dip into and evoke that same effect you once had when you saw a film for the first time. My first such &lsquo;film awakening&rsquo; moment arrived with Nayakan. An entire generation’s cinematic sensibilities were awakened along with mine, with this one film.</p>
<p>I was 12 years old when I saw this film in a preview screening as the producer was a family friend. The opening of the film was a story of a boy who perhaps was the same age as me then, but whose life was beset with a life-threatening situation!</p>
<p>I was hooked to Velu’s story. Nayakan left me bewildered, bewitched and shook my understanding of cinema. That one movie made me feel all &lsquo;grown up&rsquo;. Mani Ratnam made me revisit a Mahendran, Bharathiraja and K Balachander.</p>
<p>On a parallel note, Kamal Haasan set a whole new idiom to the term &lsquo;actor&rsquo; with this film. It was only after Nayakan that I even sat down to see The Godfather. I’ve seen both these films multiple times ever since and I’ve a list of favourite things to draw up from Coppola and Mani Ratnam as much as Brando and Haasan.</p>
<p>Not to forget the music of Nino Rota and Ilaiyaraaja and the cinematography of Gordon Willis and PC Sreeram! When the preview show ended, I was a mixed bag of emotions&ndash;I looked for something easier to toy with in my mind.</p>
<p>I wanted to forget Nayakan and go back to liking my usual song and dance films, and the fights in them. I also wanted to go back to what was easier to like in terms of how I’ve always seen a ‘hero’ on screen. Velu Nayakar was not likeable in the conventional sense&ndash;he was the most intimidating man I had ever seen up until then.</p>
<p>Here was a guy beaten to pulp by a rogue cop, covered in blood, but one who displayed both restraint and power when he says, &ldquo;Naan adichcha nee sethruve.&rdquo; And indeed, he keeps up his warning to the erring cop, as much as he keeps up his word right through- -be it to Selvam or Neela or the people in his city who go to him for help.</p>
<p>Kamal Haasan played Nayakan albeit as a tribute to Brando but this role is a mix of Brando’s Vito Corleone, Pacino’s Michael and a hat-tip to De Niro’s portrayal of the younger Vito in The Godfather 2.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been 33 years since Nayakan released and this is one performance which remains unmatched by any actor across Indian cinema, where the entire life span of a character stands testimony to an actor’s repertoire. Nayakan and Kamal Haasan are inseparable as proof of what magic a synergy of direction and acting can bring to the movie marquee.</p>
<p>As much as Brando made the lines written by Mario Puzo and Coppola, his own, when he delivered them in his method, Kamal Haasan brought his persona and strength of language to the actions and words and of writer Balakumaran and Mani Ratnam. The fact that there is one Nayakan which stands as tall as three parts of The Godfather is proof enough of how much talent there is in Indian cinema that can be put out to the world. Mani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan have taken their own trajectories ever since but Nayakan remains that ‘constant’ in both their careers.</p>
<p>Mani Ratnam always acknowledges the contributions made by Haasan to this film, in which he went beyond the purview of lead actor, and Haasan never fails to mention the focus and sharpness with which Mani Ratnam went about his work&hellip; a camaraderie which perhaps began in Hassan&rsquo;s Eldams Road residence where many a movie would be seen, discussed and debated.</p>
<p>Rudraiyah’s Aval Appadithaan was one such dream. So was Mahendran’s Mullum Malarum which didn’t star Haasan but which happened because he gave Mahendran the necessary and timely help to begin and complete the movie which has my favourite version of Rajinikanth till date.</p>
<p>There are days when I think of the way Brando succumbs to the bullet midway through the movie and the way he dies pre-climax. The focus in both scenes is not on his face as much as it is on his whole body, and yet, your heart cries on losing the man.</p>
<p>I catch myself quickly thinking of the way Kamal Haasan brings in the same heart-wringing reaction in me when he meets his daughter. When he replies to his grandson who asks him, “Neenga nallavaraa kettavara?” and he says with a broken voice “theriliye paa”&hellip; his countenance appeals to your goodness, asking for atonement for his sins which he’s committed while protecting you.</p>
<p>Don Vito Corleone and Velu Nayakar are those bad guys who appeal to our goodness, villains from another perspective, and yet, we remain standing atop our chairs, clapping for them, decades after we first set eyes on them on screen.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/o3G-UWDlLSDY5wgNCstwXak8M6o=/0x674:2832x2149/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/07/original-5/original.jpg" alt="img">
Blue Steel (1990, directed by Kathryn Bigelow)</p>
<p>Some of the best films presenting police officers as heroes are the ones that do so while challenging the flaws of the institution they belong to. Blue Steel is one of Kathryn Bigelow’s most underrated works, following rookie cop Megan (Jamie Lee Curtis) as she tries to track down a Magnum-wielding serial killer but is hindered by her own bosses’ sexism and apathy. Bigelow understands the iconographic appeal of the character, lovingly showcasing Megan’s shiny badge and crisp uniform in the film’s early scenes, but she’s careful to balance that out with the brutality and unfeeling violence Megan encounters from her colleagues. Megan ultimately succeeds in her mission—but it’s despite, not because of, the department she supposedly serves.</p>
<p>The River Wild (1994, directed by Curtis Hanson)</p>
<p>The only straightforward action movie in Meryl Streep’s long career, Curtis Hanson’s gripping thriller follows a dysfunctional family taking a rafting trip in Idaho. Gail (Streep) booked the trip in an effort to fix her marriage with workaholic Tom (David Strathairn), but things quickly get more intense after they encounter two violent criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) looking to escape downriver after a robbery. The film has top-notch cat-and-mouse antics, genuinely great white-water-rafting sequences, and terrific scenery-chewing from Bacon; it also remains one of the most underappreciated entries in Streep’s acting canon.</p>
<p>Attack the Block (2011, directed by Joe Cornish)</p>
<p>Filmgoers were introduced to John Boyega in Joe Cornish’s bitterly funny, awesomely thrilling piece of sci-fi horror, in which a teenage gang does battle with invading aliens in their South London tower block. Cornish writes dialogue that sounds like lines actual teenagers might say (he did similarly great work with his follow-up, The Kid Who Would Be King), and he stages action inventively even on a small budget. But Boyega’s energetic, impassioned performance as Moses is Attack the Block’s best feature, the kind of electrifying work that got him cast in The Force Awakens, which was released four years later.</p>
<p>BASED ON A TRUE STORY</p>
<p>Lust, Caution (2007, directed by Ang Lee)</p>
<p>A thematic departure for Ang Lee, Lust, Caution is a shockingly sexy spy thriller based on Eileen Chang’s novella of the same name, a tale of deception and double-crossing in World War II China. Noted for its extremely explicit sex scenes, which generated controversy and censorship in China, the film is a lush but brutal ballad about the ideals and limits of political resistance. The central hero is Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei), who bands with other university students to resist the Japanese puppet government that controlled China from 1940 to 1945; her target is Mr. Yee (Tony Leung), whom she lures into a “honey trap.” Lee stages every love scene as a battle of wills, one where the slightest false move could give Chia Chi away. Tang’s performance, in her feature-film debut, is astonishing, especially given that she’s going up against one of Hong Kong’s best-known cinema legends in Leung.

<h3 id="coronavirus-disney-delays-blockbuster-films-due-to-pandemic">&ldquo;Coronavirus: Disney delays blockbuster films due to pandemic&rdquo;</h3>

Image copyright Walt Disney Studios Image caption The next Mulan is a live action remake of the animated hit movie</p>
<p>Walt Disney has delayed and postponed the release of three major films, dealing a fresh blow to cinema operators struggling amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>The new Avatar and Star Wars films have been delayed by a year, while Mulan has been removed from schedules completely.</p>
<p>Mulan, already delayed because of cinema closures, had been scheduled for release at the end of August.</p>
<p>A rise in virus cases in the US and the impact globally on film production forced the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s become clear that nothing can be set in stone when it comes to how we release films during this global health crisis,&rdquo; a Disney spokesman said. &ldquo;Today that means pausing our release plans for Mulan as we assess how we can most effectively bring this film to audiences around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rise in virus cases in the US and the impact globally on film production forced the change.</p>
<p>News that the release of three major Walt Disney films will be delayed or postponed is a fresh blow to cinema operators struggling amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>It had been hoped that Mulan might spark a late-summer rebound in cinema-going. The Avatar sequel is now set to debut in theatres in December 2022, and the next Star Wars movie in December 2023.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the AMC and Cineworld cinema chains pushed back the reopening date for their US outlets until at least mid-August, from the end of July.</p>
<p>New York City and Los Angeles, the two biggest markets in the US, have no concrete plans for reopening cinemas.</p>
<p>While cinemas in England were allowed to reopen from 4 July - as long as social distancing guidelines were followed - the picture across North America is much more uncertain.</p>
<p>In China, the world&rsquo;s second largest movie market, cinemas started to reopen this week after being closed for six months due to social distancing measures.</p>
<p>One film expert said the delay in Mulan was a &ldquo;blessing in disguise&rdquo; for Disney given the rising tensions between the US and China.</p>
<p>Chris Fenton is the author of Feeding the Dragon, a book about the power struggle between China and American business, particularly Hollywood film studios.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No film based on Chinese mythology, set in China, and full of Chinese faces would perform well in America given the current state of anti-Chinese sentiment,&rdquo; Mr Fenton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in China, the same underperformance would be reciprocated due to hostility towards the US and American-made products, of which, Mulan is one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Warner Bros Image caption John David Washington stars in Warner Bros&rsquo; Tenet, alongside Elizabeth Debicki (seated)</p>
<p>The Mulan delay follows Warner Bros&rsquo; decision to postpone the August release of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s thriller Tenet. Cinema owners were pinning hopes on the two films to salvage part of the lucrative summer season.</p>
<p>Avatar 2 would have been one of next year&rsquo;s biggest films. It is the follow-up to James Cameron&rsquo;s 2009 blockbuster, which is the second highest-grossing film of all time.</p>
<p>Another delayed Disney film is Ridley Scott&rsquo;s historical thriller The Last Duel, which stars Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. That has been shifted from December of this year to October 2021.

<h3 id="disneys-mulan-the-latest-film-to-fall-off-the-calendar">&ldquo;Disney&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mulan&rsquo; the latest film to fall off the calendar&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_ada6d509-0fde-40ab-b257-22e938ec2786.jpg?h=630&amp;w=1200&amp;fit=crop&amp;bg=999&amp;crop=faces" alt="img">
Disney has taken its action-adventure &ldquo;Mulan&rdquo; off the August release calendar, ending hopes that Americans will return to movie theaters en masse this summer.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the company said the film, which had most recently been set for release Aug. 21, was now &ldquo;unset.&rdquo; No new release date was announced.</p>
<p>The move came three days after Warner Bros. said it would wait at least a few more weeks to release its expected blockbuster &ldquo;Tenet&rdquo; and hours after AMC, the world&rsquo;s largest chain of theaters, said it would postpone its planned reopening to mid-August, tying the new opening date to the release of &ldquo;Mulan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tenet.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Mulan&rdquo; delay could push the theater chain to wait until Labor Day weekend, when Paramount — for now — plans to release &ldquo;A Quiet Place Part 2.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Originally scheduled for late March, &ldquo;Mulan&rdquo; was one of the first major pictures postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic and has served as a bellwether of the Hollywood uncertainty that followed in its wake. After several delays, the film had landed in late August, when the prospect of a summer release provided some reassurance that the industry would at least not lose two full seasons because of the virus.</p>
<p>But surges in California, Florida and Texas have made such a release increasingly impractical. Disney executives have also been watching the closing of theaters in Beijing due to outbreaks there; with Chinese stars and locations, &ldquo;Mulan&rdquo; is expected to generate much of its income in that country. China has begun to reopen theaters in the capital, but only in low-risk areas.</p>
<p>In contrast with rivals such as Universal, Disney stopped short last week of making wholesale changes that would have suggested it has given up on 2020 as a time of mass moviegoing. Although it pushed back movies in the top-tier &ldquo;Avatar&rdquo; and &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; franchises to 2021 and 2022, it kept Marvel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Black Widow&rdquo; and Pixar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Soul,&rdquo; both scheduled for November, on the calendar.</p>
<p>And it did not give a 2021 date to &ldquo;Mulan,&rdquo; leading experts to believe Disney would still like to release the movie in 2020.</p>
<p>The announcement had the kind of low-key quality reflective of how common uncertainty has become in American business during the coronavirus era. In contrast to the most recent &ldquo;Mulan&rdquo; delay a month ago, when studio Chairs Alan Horn and Alan Bergman gave a statement that the pandemic &ldquo;has not changed our belief in the power of this film and its message of hope and perseverance,&rdquo; Disney announced the change last week as part of schedule moves for a variety of movies.</p>
<p>The company did not say it was moving &ldquo;The New Mutants,&rdquo; a film in the X-Men series that could stay on the calendar for Aug. 28 and draw moviegoers in U.S. theaters that are open.
