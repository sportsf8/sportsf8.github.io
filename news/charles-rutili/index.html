<p>LUXEMBURG</p>
<p>CHRISTIAN SPIELMANN</p>
<p>Von gut bis schlecht: luxemburgische Kurzfilme auf VOD.lu</p>
<p>Wie es Samsa Film und „Les Films Fauves“ bereits vormachten, indem sie „Tune into the Future“ und „Jumbo“ für die Video-Plattform VOD.lu freigegeben haben, hat sich das „Luxembourg City Film Festival“ mit diesem Anbieter geeinigt und weitere Filme ausgewählt, wie „Norie“ von Yuki Kawamura, „Dreamland“ von Bruce McDonald und „Cuentos del Rio“ von Julie Schroell. Um diese Filme sehen zu können, muss man allerdings 2,99 Euro bezahlen. Dagegen sind einige Kurzfilme, die auch während des Festivals zu sehen waren, gratis, bis auf den Film „Halligalli“ von Govinda Van Maele. Generell muss man allerdings feststellen, dass kein Film wirklich hervorsticht und einige sogar für Kopfschütteln sorgen.</p>
<p>Der Beste vorab</p>
<p>Auch wenn „Lupus“ von Laurent Prim Lichtjahre von einem Meisterwerk entfernt ist, hebt sich der von Skill Lab produzierte Kurzfilm von den anderen ab. Der alte Bauer Marcel (Pol Greisch) sieht seine verstorbene Frau Sarah (Claire Johnston) in seinen Träumen. Sein Sohn (Luc Schiltz), ein Polizist, ist besonders besorgt, als sein Vater glaubt, ein Wolf würde seine Hühner reißen. Filmisch ist der Film sauber gedreht, von Greisch ganz ordentlich interpretiert, und er erzählt zumindest eine Geschichte.</p>
<p>Stilistisch kann auch „Faleminderit“ von Nicolas Neuhold teilweise gefallen. Nur hier wird vergessen, die Geschichte, die, wie im Vorspann zu lesen, auf historischen Halbwahrheiten basiert, genauer zu situieren und Namen zu nennen, wie den des Hauptprotagonisten, einem Kartographen (Maximilien Jadin), der Albanien vermisst und eine neue Karte zeichnet. Laut Angaben des Produzenten Calach Films heißt er Charles Schaeffer. Diese neue Karte diente 1921 bei der Konferenz der Botschafter in Paris, die Grenzen neu zu bestimmen. Der Filmtitel bedeutet auf Albanisch „Danke“.</p>
<p>Die weniger Guten</p>
<p>Als bedingt annehmbar kann man den Animationsfilm „Abigail“ von Nicolas Debray bezeichnen, der in den Studios von Melusine Productions entstand. Zwei ältere Männer, Daniel und David, sitzen auf einer Bank und unterhalten sich. David ist allein und beneidet Daniel, der mit Abigail verheiratet ist. Durch das Streicheln einer Katze wird Daniel jünger. Zu Hause muss er feststellen, dass die Katze seine Frau nicht jünger macht. Charles Suberville (Daniel), Anita Rutili (Abigail) und Norbert Rutili (David) leihen den Figuren ihre Stimmen.</p>
<p>Zu Beginn von „Westwand“ von Philip Krieps rudert ein Mann, Alikhan (Alikhan Malsagov), mit seinem Kanu durch einen Fluss. Er ist aus Russland nach Luxemburg immigriert und wartet seit Jahren auf seine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung. Ein Briefträger (Daniel Omes) verirrt sich jedoch im Wald auf der Suche nach der Alikhans Behausung. Hier muss man sich alles Wichtige aus den Fingern saugen.</p>
<p>Ebenfalls rätselhaft ist der animierte Kurzfilm „Glow“ von Fred Neuen und Mik Muhlen. In einer kargen Landschaft werden drei Männchen von einer Maschine „aufgetankt“. Eines begegnet einem Origami-Falter, der es in eine mysteriöse Welt geleitet mit weiteren glühenden Faltern und einem Fisch. Doch seine Kumpane zerstören alles, was ihnen unbekannt ist.</p>
<p>Larisa Fabers „Daca Ne De?teptam“ (If We Smarten Up) spielt in Rumänien. Es dauert eine Zeitlang, ehe man begreift, dass Maria (Coca Bloos) die Hausfrau eines verstorbenen Mannes ist, dessen Wohnung von der Familie verkauft wird. Maria zieht sich in einen Abstellraum zurück. Dem Film fehlt jeglicher Hintergrund, mit dem der Zuschauer etwas anfangen könnte.</p>
<p>Komplett am Zweck vorbei bewegt sich auch „Absence“ von Florian Beros, der vom CNA und dem SNJ produziert wurde. Zwei lesbische Frauen (Claire Tison-Massenet und Xénia Katina) leben zusammen. Auch hier fehlt der Name jener Frau, die sich von der blonden Noémie trennen will, da sie sich in Henry (Stéphane Belhandouz) verliebt hat. Diese wirre Geschichte hat 2019 beim Crème-fraîche-Wettbewerb gewonnen.</p>
<p>Leider haben die meisten jungen Regisseure und Regisseurinnen vergessen, dass auch in einem Kurzfilm eine Geschichte wichtig ist. Es genügt nicht nur, sich stilistisch zu beweisen. Vielleicht klappt es beim nächsten Mal.

<h3 id="grant-hill-caron-butler-among-retired-nba-players-thriving-financially">&ldquo;Grant Hill, Caron Butler among retired NBA players thriving financially&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MDA3MjkwNjcxMjc3MzI5/grant-hill-chris-paul-retired-playersjpg.jpg" alt="img">
Ten years ago Sports Illustrated published a haunting feature on the dark reality of many professional athletes’ finances. Lucrative contracts consistently melted into the exhaust pipes of luxury vehicles. Hundred-thousand dollar investments in quirky inventions quickly evaporated. Full fortunes were sliced through divorce settlements. “It was f&mdash;ing trial and error with millions of dollars,” says two-time All-Star Caron Butler. Within a half decade of retirement, an estimated three out of five former NBA players were going broke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixty percent is a ballpark. But we&rsquo;ve seen a lot of guys who&rsquo;ve really come into hard times five years after they leave the league,&rdquo; Roy Hinson, a former NBA player and current NBPA senior regional director, told the Toronto Star in 2008. &ldquo;The problems are, for a lot of guys, they have a lot of cars, they have multiple houses, they&rsquo;re taking care of their parents. They&rsquo;re taking care of a whole host of issues. And the checks aren&rsquo;t coming in anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The union says that number is no longer accurate, and although it did not provide a current statistic for this story, the NBPA, NBA and the National Basketball Retired Players Association have since instituted organizational structures and initiatives to combat what was once considered a financial pandemic. Since the 2011 collective bargaining agreement negotiations, the NBPA has implemented new or improved bridge annuity, pension, 401(k) match, health insurance and tuition assistance programs. Membership within the RPA doubled from 2012 to 2016. The salary cap boom, which resulted in 70.8% growth for the deals of top-25 players from 2011 to 2018, has placed an even greater emphasis on financial literacy.</p>
<p>“As an older player, a lot of young guys, at least the conversations in the locker room, were more about finances and sharing and exchanging ideas and talking about wealth preservation and various things,” says Hall of Fame forward Grant Hill, who retired in 2013. “Technology and having accessibility to information, that means the horror stories, the examples of those who didn’t fare so well and learning about the nuances of the success stories of wealth creation. It helped in terms of being a valuable resource.”</p>
<p>Virgil Rutili is a Chicago-based wealth advisor, serving nearly 20 NBA and NHL players holding salaries from $100,000 to $6 million. “We’re patient,” Rutili says. “We try to get the banking and the budgeting and the planning right for the player so that everything is easy and simple.” His Centric Wealth Management focouses on educating those players on how to understand the markets. The firm sends daily emails with a movement summary. “We’re spending a lot of time educating these guys and then we have to build a significant liquidity cushion, because there’s a ton of uncertainty,” Rutili says. “You take risk where you can withstand it. I just don’t think these young guys who aren’t established can.”</p>
<p>Instead, Centric helps its clients construct automatic savings plans, fully funding their 401(k)s and capitalizing on after tax contributions NBA or NHL plans allow, rolling that money into a Roth IRA. “We turn some people off because they want to get in the game right away and they want to see their money make money,” Rutili says. After establishing that foundation, the firm layers other savings into customized, risk-managed portfolios.</p>

<p>When Butler was released from prison at 16 years old, having served a year for firearms and cocaine possession, he found work at a local Burger King, flipping patties and working the boiler steamer. “Doing it all, bro,” he recalls. Less than a decade later, during the 2005-06 season as a member of the Washington Wizards, a 25-year-old Butler invested $600,000 with Ramsell Dining to purchase an ownership stake in 16 franchises of the same fast food giant. “We started seeing the passive income off that,” Butler says. He failed to play more than 67 games during each of his next three seasons in D.C., nagging ailments plaguing the burgeoning All-Star. “You think you can play forever and when the injuries start, you get a real, clear-glass perspective on your life,” Butler says. “What’s next? What are you gonna do with all that time?”</p>
<p>Along the way, he crossed paths with Rob Skinner, a fellow UConn alum and wealth manager at First Republic Investment who oversees $400 billion in capital from significant wealth clients. Skinner preached the importance of creating financial legacy for Butler’s family and diversifying smart investments. A flush professional athlete can amplify his wealth far more efficiently by hitting a ton of singles, rather than striking out swinging for investment home runs. And, of course, that&rsquo;s easier to do as an active player. “When you put the word ‘ex-‘ in front of your name, it’s tough to get on a certain platform and get into certain circles,” Butler says. “I always made myself available playing professionally, every city I created a crazy network.”</p>
<p>While supporting the Lob City high-wire act in Los Angeles, Butler strolled over to a courtside Mark Wahlberg during a 2012 Clippers game. As a teammate lofted free throws, Butler asked to pick the entertainment mogul’s brain. Wahlberg ventured back to LA’s locker room following the contest. A few days later, Butler was on the set of the movie 2 Guns as Wahlberg and Denzel Washington filmed the action thriller. “I was just in awe,” he says. Today, Wahlberg has signed on as the executive producer of Butler&rsquo;s biopic, Tuff Juice.</p>
<p>Butler earned over $84 million throughout his entire playing career. The original Burger King investment whet the appetite of Butler and his wife, Andrea, and motivated them to search for high-reward, secondary-income opportunities. “The grind drives me,” Butler says. “Seeing things coming to fruition, that’s everything to me.” Real estate particularly intrigued the swingman. “Growing up always having eviction notices on our home, I always wanted to own my own property,” he explains. Butler is an equity owner of Graduate Hotels. With 15 near- or on-campus locations worldwide, the company’s hotels replicate the college experience for alumni, sprinkling time capsules and relics from historic moments at each school and region. It recently closed a deal on UConn’s campus, which Butler says requires roughly $420 million to launch, netting returns as high as 20% each year. He also holds equity ownership stakes in a company producing all-natural ingredient cleanse drinks, and in a vegan restaurant, Fala Bar, which has three locations in California.</p>
<p>Similarly, Hill parlayed relationships he developed during his own career into several business ventures, particularly an Orlando-based mezzanine fund. Writing checks anywhere between $4 and 8 million, the fund provides growth capital to small businesses and ultimately exits after turning a profit. Hill&rsquo;s real estate company also amassed 2,500 multi-family apartment units across six different complexes in three states. “It was really just through relationships that had been nurtured over years and having done some one-off deals,” Hill says.</p>
<p>The soul of Hill’s post-retirement career, in addition to broadcasting this year’s Final Four, has been curating an expansive collection of African-American art. “We like to say it’s pretty serious,” he laughs. Emulating the artwork his father hung around his childhood home, the unguardable scorer began buying prints of Ernie Barnes’s paintings for his Duke dorm room. When he reached the NBA, Hill began purchasing originals from Jacob Lawrence, John Biggers, Charles White and Charles Alston. “A lot of the real, sort of pioneers and masters of the genre of African-American art,” he says. His collection today has swelled to over 100 pieces, most of which are stored in a climate-controlled, secure facility. Hill has rotated the art between storage and his homes, but he and his wife, Tamia, have tried to organize and display their pieces in exhibits. “One of the challenges is that art is meant to be seen,” he says.</p>
<p>Getty Images</p>
<p>The Retired Players Association used to struggle to be seen as well. Yet since its dramatic membership increase at the onset of this decade, it has steadily maintained close to 1,000 members. The RPA is not a union, leaving members to pay yearly dues of $250 or one-time lifetime fees of $3,500. Any player who has held an active NBA or WNBA roster spot can join for education and career development programs, social activities at major NBA calendar events, community outreach programs, paid opportunities and royalties.</p>
<p>“There’s been a transformative shift in the way we serve former players,” says RPA CEO Scott Rochelle. “It hasn’t been about building players back up after they failed, the conversation is built more around, ‘Hey, I want to make sure my next move is a really good one that can sustain me and my family and keep me engaged for the rest of my life.'&rdquo; Roughly 75% of the RPA&rsquo;s budget is derived from a group licensing agreement with the NBA. Video game licensing dollars from EA Sports and 2K Sports, jersey sales, photo and image usage and trading cards are all funneled to each of it members, like a residual check from a hit television show. Video games fees can pay tens of thousands of dollars per year. Bimonthly, the organization runs health screens at an NBA team facility, with 150 players annually receiving EKG and stress tests, blood work and other orthopedic evaluations that are provided for every retiree.</p>
<p>The NBPA made national headlines in 2016 when its representatives voted unanimously to fund health insurance for all retired NBA players with at least three years of service in the league. Since 2001, the NBPA has deposited large sums into its players’ health reimbursement accounts, reserved for any health expense for them or their families. Some accounts have soared reached the high six figures. The union is hoping to soon debut a long-term care benefit.</p>
<p>In 2011, the NBPA launched its bridge annuity program, partitioning 1% of basketball-related income for its pool of retirees from the time they officially walk away from the game until they reach the age of 50. With annual BRI surging to well over $7 billion, that would leave greater than $70 million to be redistributed into the annuity program with Principal Financial Group. “The amounts have gone up significantly,” says Ron Klempner, senior counsel at the NBPA. The union pays any existing taxes on those funds, and active players can invest up to 10% of their salary into that annuity as well. “You couldn’t go out on the street and buy an annuity like that,” Klempner says. The league’s pension fund was recently supersized to the maximum allowed by law and the most aggressive interest rate available. The benefit stands at over $850 a month for each year of service a players holds, meaning a 10-year veteran can gross $8500 a month, or about $100K a year. Through Voya, the union’s 401(k) matches at 140%.</p>
<p>As of 2016, the union will reimburse a player $101,000 in tuition to finish an incomplete undergraduate degree. They offer programs in entrepreneurship and broadcasting with Syracuse University. It holds a coaching program at the NBPA Top 100 camp at the University of Virginia, where active players who hope to later pivot into basketball operations can coach the nation’s premier prospects. The union’s leadership development program in Las Vegas during Summer League introduces players to the NBA’s leading front office executives as Klempner teaches them about the inner workings of the CBA, salary cap and free agency.</p>
<p>Four retired players, TJ Ford, Bobby Simmons, Jeff Lamp and Lloyd Walton serve as regional representatives, attending games and team meetings, solely focusing on career transition for the players. A fifth has personified all of the efforts from the league, union and RPA. “Antonio wraps everything together,” Klempner said.</p>
<p>Twelve-year veteran Antonio Davis has spearheaded the NBPA’s Off The Court program. The power forward was keen on packaging the idea as a way to help expand players’ horizons, rather than prepare for the day one must forever untie his sneakers. “I didn’t want guys feeling like, when I talked to them, I was gonna be like the grim reaper,” Davis says. The program generally assesses players in an exit-interview setting, helping players maintain their families, mental health, physical health and finances off the court.</p>
<p>After retiring in 2006, Davis realized a slew of players seeking one last paycheck overseas, or through general disengagement from basketball, were becoming entirely detached from the union, ignoring the menu of benefits the NBPA provides. Last October, Davis flew six players to New York for a workshop, breaking down the full benefits package, updating their contact info for their annuity, and educating them on the newly established healthcare system. Several players were unaware they qualified for the union’s free services. “We started solving some issues right there,” Davis says.</p>
<p>He has continued polling active players about their financial needs and charitable endeavours. Davis has jetted around the country to discuss life insurance and estate planning with athletes. How can he help their post-career development? What do they want to do with their lives? Davis is the latest actor in a confluence of efforts to combat the pitfalls that were once synonymous with NBA retirements. “Everybody knew that the issue was there,” he says. “I just don’t think anybody knew about how to approach it.”

To help raise money for the staffs of now-closed comedy clubs, comedian, and modern-day chronicler of dad life Mike Birbiglia is having conversations and workshopping jokes in real time with such fellow comedians as Roy Wood Jr., John Mulaney, Maria Bamford, and Nikki Glaser on his Instagram. Tuning in feels like overhearing delightful banter between funny, clever friends. And that’s exactly what it is.</p>
<p>TOUR: Our National Parks. “The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks,” a joint venture between the National Park Service and Google, lets you virtually wander around some of the most beautiful protected areas in the U.S, from the surreal spires at Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, to the white sand beaches (and abandoned jail) of Dry Tortugas in Florida, to the green-splendor of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.</p>
<p>RIDE: A Rollercoaster. A bunch of great front-row-point-of-view videos of Rollercoasters are on YouTube, ready for you to experience virtually. Our favorites include the Incredicoaster at Disney’s California Adventure, the Manta Flying Coaster at Sea World in Orlando, the Sky Scream in Germany, to the Takabisha coaster in Japan. Make like this dad and put your kid in a laundry basket and hold them up to the screen to simulate the experience.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>PLAY: Pub Trivia. Pub Trivia is a religion in the UK. Now, some pubs are bringing services online. Every night at 7pm (which means every U.S. weekday at 2 p.m EST) the team from Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes is live-streaming some trivia sessions on Instagram. People can fill out answers on a google form to play along and win prizes. But the real joy is partaking in some very Scottish trivia while chatting with a bunch of various people around the world. Yeah, you’ll probably want a pint in front of you.</p>
<p>LIVE-STREAM: An Intimate Concert. In light of coronavirus, Rolling Stone started a new series called “In My Room”. Every day, a new musician or musical group tapes themselves performing a 10-minute or so concert in their home. And it ain’t a bunch of nobodies: So far, they’ve featured Brian Wilson, Graham Nash, John Fogerty, Nicole Atkins, and more all performing intimate concerts.</p>
<p>WATCH: Tiger King: This Netflix documentary television series about Oklahoma zoo-owner Joe Exotic and all of the people drawn into his atmosphere is a series too strange to believe. We won’t spoil it. But there are lions, tigers, murder, tattoos, mullets, animal-themed music videos and one of the craziest cat ladies you ever did see. It’s perhaps the only reality that is weirder than our own current one — and somehow, that’s comforting.</p>
<p>READ: Cold Storage It might be strange to read a book that centers around a virus-like organism that could end humanity. But in this tight thriller by Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp has all the beats of a popcorn flick. It’s also fun, too-silly-to-believe, and a great way to kill a few days with a Kindle.</p>
<p>LISTEN TO: “Home Cooking:” A new “emergency” podcast by Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat star and author Samin Nosrat, Home Cooking offers advice and tips on how to make delicious meals with the items that are in your pantry. It’s great.</p>

<p>LEARN SOME GUITAR: In an attempt to #flattenthecurve, Fender is offering three months free of their Fender Play tutorial service. It offers lessons for all types of guitarists in a variety of styles, from acoustic to heavy metal. Rock out.</p>
<p>PLAY: Exploding Kittens. The popular card game, which is sort of like UNO except there are, well, exploding kittens that you must defuse before they blow and eliminate you from the game, has an app. Get your friends to play, FaceTime to talk some trash as you compete to enjoy a game night from home.</p>
<p>PLAY: Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The chillest of chill games, this sequel to the wildly popular Animal Crossing lets you hang out with friends on relaxing island. Players create avatars and live among the humanoid animals who populate the island. Players can scavenge for materials, construct houses and other buildings, and interact with the various characters. Did we mention it’s super chill? Play along with the kids or just escape there yourself.</p>
<p>MAKE Pasta with an Italian Grandma. Nonna Nerina, who lives in outside of Rome and runs one of the most popular pasta-making classes for tourists, is now offering her “Pasta with Grandma” classes online. The 84-year-old Nonna doesn’t mess around.</p>
<p>GET PRISON FIT: with Conbody. Coss Marie, a former drug kingpin and three-time felon, devised a workout system that helped him stay in shape in a very small, confined space. The company offers live streamed and pre-recorded workouts ($9/month) to stay fit.</p>
<p>BINGE: Community. All six seasons of this NBC comedy, which spawned from the brain of Dan Harmon, just hit Netflix. It’s well worth a deep dive. Starring Joel McHale, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Donald Glover, Chevy Chase (well, until he left), and a cast of fantastic characters (including the one and only Jim Rash as Dean Pelton), this show is one of the weirdest, funniest, sweetest, most inventive comedies on television.</p>
<p>FREE YOUR MIND. Or at least try to with UCLA’s free guided meditation courses. The university offers a number of meditation workouts, from simple breathing exercises to those that intend to help you evaporate work stress.</p>
<p>GIVE CONGRESS A HAND: The Library of Congress’ By the People project lets citizens lend a hand by transcribing, reviewing, and curating items from their digital archives in the hopes of building a deeper archive of American history.</p>
<p>SIT FRONT ROW AT THE NATIONAL THEATER: Every Thursday at 7p.m. EST, London’s famed National Theater will upload one free-to-watch-for-a-week production under the name “National Theater at Home.” The first, One Man, Two Guvnors launched the career of James Corden. But if farce isn’t your thing, there will be uploads of everything from their acclaimed runs of Hamlet, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, Coriolanus, starring Tom Hiddleston, and more.</p>
<p>STREAM: Jeopardy! The quiz show, streaming on Netflix, might be boring in its incredibly routine format. But there’s something so damn comforting about the combination of Alex Trebek’s soothing voice, the bloop-bloop-bloop sound effect that happens when the categories are announced, and focusing your brain on questions that aren’t of the COVID-19 kind.</p>
<p>TRACK GIRAFFES IN KENYA. Seriously. Wildwatch Kenya, an open-source opportunity for Internet users all over the world to look at — and classify — field photos of various wildlife captured by trail cameras in hopes of helping the conservation efforts.</p>

<p>ATTEND A CLASS: at Harvard. Want to learn about moral and political philosophy? Understand the human response to conflict and disaster? Brush up on your quantitative reasoning skills — or just understand what the hell those words actually mean? Harvard offers these and many more classes online that you can enroll in for free.</p>
<p>PLAY: Cards Against Humanity online. The wildly popular party game, which is like Apples to Apples except the cards have way more sex, swear words, and weird prompts, can be played online with up to six people. Simply head to this link, share the room code with your friends, and get started. It’s not as fun as the real-life game, but with a web cam set up to chat, it can feel pretty damn similar.</p>
<p>WATCH: Baseball. Our National Pastime might not be on, but Ken Burns’ Baseball is online to stream. The 1994 documentary is fantastic. And oh-so-soothing.</p>
<p>LEARN: How to be a Disney Imagineer. Khan Academy and Pixar joined forces to launch “Imagineering in a Box”, a free course that offers lessons and advice on Disney park design as well as a behind-the-scenes look at everything from how they created their rides and theme park attractions.</p>

<p>LISTEN TO: “The Dropout”. The podcast tells the wild, brain-scrambling story of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, the once-darling of the startup world who said she had created a simple, affordable testing kit that could determine a host of diseases from one drop of blood. Come for the fall from grace. Stay for the absolutely wild Silicon Valley stories.</p>
<p>WATCH: MTV Unplugged at Home. Similar to Rolling Stone’s “In My Room” series, MTV is airing intimate live-streamed acoustic performances from a variety of artists. The shows will be available on MTV’s YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram channels. So far Wyclef Jean, Melissa Etheridge, Shaggy, FINEAS and more artists have agreed to appear.</p>
<p>FIND YOUR CENTER: with JB Smoove. The comedian, best known for his stint on Curb Your Enthusiasm, launched Guided Meditation with JB Smoove on Instagram TV. It’s meditation, but with a lot of swearing (As soft music swells, he begins the three-minute session with “It’s time…to get on your ass”) It’s exactly the kind of expletive-laden relaxation we could all us right now.</p>
<p>READ A STORY: with Josh Gad. Every evening during quarantine, the comedian and voice of Olaf in Frozen is reading a children’s book on Twitter. Just let it go and give it a try.</p>
<p>LISTEN TO: “Staying in With Emily and Kumail.” Emily V Gordon and Kumail Nanjiani, the married writers, actors, and comedians who are no strangers to the podcast world (they previously hosted the podcast “Indoor Kids”), launched this podcast during quarantine. In it, they offer tips for avoiding cabin, recommend movies, books, and games, and engage in witty banter.</p>
<p>WATCH: “Some Good News.” John Krasinksi, who some of you may recognize from a show called <em>checks notes</em> The Office?, launched this YouTube channel to highlight some positive news stories from around the globe.

<p>PLAY: Mario Kart Tour. Mario Kart is perhaps the most universally beloved game of all time. Mario Kart Tour brings the action to anyone with a smartphone or tablet (free-to-start on iOS and Google Play devices) and features all the wild cartoonish characters and tracks that make the series so much fun for all ages. Recently — and talk about good timing — Nintendo updated the app with multiplayer. So, hit the gas and work out some family grievances on the track. Wa-hoooo!</p>
<p>LISTEN TO: “Murder Most Foul.” Bob Dylan, yes that Bob Dylan, dropped this nearly 17-minute track last Thursday. It’s a big, complex, poetic, and genuinely beautiful song about the murder of President John F. Kennedy. Listen to it. Then listen to it again. Then kill some more time trying figure out all the allusions baked into the track.</p>
<p>ESCAPE with Echoe Mine, the new album by Califone. Califone is one of those bands that sneaks up on you. Their sound — atmospheric, twangy, full of percussions, capped with the beautiful voice of Tim Rutili— is absolutely unique. Echoe Mine feels like a walk in a foreign land, which is exactly where we are right now.</p>
<p>WATCH: Sharks, otters, and more aquatic life do their thing. California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium offers has 10 different live streams, including an aviary cam positioned on the aquarium’s ocean-view deck to see ocean birds; a Kelp Forest Cam, which features, among other things, looks at leopard sharks and sardines; an Otter Cam, which looks out on Abbi and the other famous sea otters at the museum; and a Shark Cam, which, well, shows off their finned family. Best of all might be the Jellyfish Cam, which provides a rare look at pods of the invertebrates bouncing around in their tanks.</p>
<p>ENJOY SOME BEATS: At Club Quarantine. <em>Stefan voice</em> The coolest club in New York right now is…Club Quarantine. Famed DJ D Nice started a live-streamed dance party from his Bronx apartment on Instagram TV called Club Quarantine. Last weekend, hundreds of thousands of people tuned in to enjoy the tunes Nice spun, including Will Smith, Michelle Obama, Queen Latifah, Mary J. Blige, and more. Better than the actual set is watching Nice’s reactions when he sees who pops up in the chat. “Michelle Obama! FLOTUS in the house!”</p>
<p>READ: The Wax Pack: On the Open Road in Search of Baseball’s Afterlife. Writer Brad Balukjian bought a pack of Topps baseball cards from 1986. He opened up the eBay-purchased pack, and in 2015, drove cross country, following up with 14 baseball players from said pack 30 years later. Like all good sports books, this isn’t really a book about sports. It’s about fathers, sons, life, and lessons therein. It’s a great read.</p>
<p>WATCH: Battlestar Galactica. One of the best space-operas to ever air, BG is a rich, entertaining exploration of everything from intergalactic politics to religion to marriage. It’s also constantly surprising, realistic, and full of the well-crafted Sci-Fi escapism that we all need right now.</p>
<p>CHECK OUT: “Martin Guitar Jam in Place.” The guitar company is also getting into the live-streamed concert game, asking a variety of brand-players to perform sets from their home. It’s worth tuning in for Bluegrass Artist Molly Tuttle alone, who casually lays down some seriously skilled acoustic playing.</p>
<p>JAM OUT TO: Real Estate. Real Estate is the best background music you’ll ever put on. That’s a compliment. There’s nothing offensive in their chill, catchy tunes that jam on and on. The new album The Main Thing is like a pleasant afternoon walk on the beach.</p>

<p>MAKE: The Retox. A riff on the Margarita by NYC Bartender Sother Teague, author of I’m Just Here for the Drinks. Yes, as its name suggests, the drink also takes inspiration from the juicing trend the Master Cleanse. So, here’s to your health.</p>
<p>BASK IN THE BARD’S WISDOM: with Sir Patrick Stewart. Every day, Jean Luc Picard/Charles Xavier/one of the finest Shakespearian actors of his time, is reading one of Shakespeare’s sonnets #ASonnetADay on his Twitter page. Want gravitas? Oh, you’ll get gravitas.</p>
<p>DO a pilates workout with Kit Rich. Rich is a celebrity trainer whose workouts consist of a combo of pilates, plyometrics, and yoga. It’s an ass-busting workout that is unlike any cardio conditioning or weightlifting you’ve done before. Rich published 14 days of pilates workouts ranging from 30 minutes to a full hour that will be on YouTube until the end of April, all of which are low to no equipment.</p>
<p>PLAY: Overcooked 2. This sequel available for Xbox, Playstation, and more devices, is chaotic fun. As in the original, 1-4 players (It’s fun for kids, too) are part of a team of chefs whose job it is to prep, cook, and serve food in a busy kitchen. The kitchens on each level feature different layouts and obstacles, from moving walkways to magic portals, that get progressively more complex as you and your family make your way through the game.</p>
<p>LEARN SOME COOKING TECHNIQUES: On the Los Angeles Times Food Instagram account. Every day at 6 p.m. PDT, the newspaper’s food team is sharing techniques and recipes to help us all cook better food in these very bizarre times.</p>
<p>STAY IN SHAPE: With Retro Fitness. Retro Fitness is offering free livestream classes Monday through Friday at 6pm on its Facebook page.</p>
<p>GROUP-STREAM A SHOW WITH FRIENDS: With the Netflix Party app. It allows up to seven users to watch and chat about any Netflix title at the same time in a private room.</p>

<p>Eine Anzahl faszinierender Bilder von Gabi Weigl sind in den Geschäftsräumen der Firma Baur Optik in Wertingen zu sehen.</p>
<p>Eine Künstlerin aus Allmannshofen stellt bei Baur Optik in Wertingen aus.</p>
<p>Wertingen Treffender hätten die Räumlichkeiten für die Ausstellung „Augenblicke“ von Gabi Weigl nicht sein können. Die Firma Baur Optik bietet seit 35 Jahren heimischen Künstlern die Möglichkeit, ihre Werke auszustellen. Die Tradition führt man in Wertingen seit sechs Jahren fort.</p>
<p>Eine Anzahl faszinierender Bilder von Gabi Weigl sind in den Geschäftsräumen zu sehen. Im Schaufenster wurden außerdem bei der Gestaltung modische Brillen einerseits und Kunstwerke andererseits miteinander in Einklang gebracht.</p>
<p>Chemieingenieurin mit Liebe zur Malerei</p>
<p>Gabi Weigl, geboren im Jahre 1968, ist verheiratet und hat drei Söhne. Sie lebt mit ihrer Familie in Allmannshofen. Nach der Ausbildung zur Chemieingenieurin fand sie den Weg zu ihrer künstlerischen Ader, die ihr Leben immer begleitet hat, voll und ganz zurück. Es begann mit Buntstiften und führte über Aquarell zu verschiedenen Techniken. Inspiration erfuhr sie in Frankreich, wo sie einige Jahre verbrachte. Dort entdeckte sie und begeisterte sich für die Acrylmalerei, die ihr „Monsieur Charles Rutili“, ein Künstler aus Marseille näher brachte. Der Lehrer ermunterte sie auch zum Experiment „Sehen mit dem Herzen“.</p>
<p>Leidenschaft für den Impressionismus entdeckt</p>
<p>Durch Rutili entdeckte sie ihre Leidenschaft für den Impressionismus und er gab ihr weitere Grundlagen für ihre künstlerische Entwicklung.</p>
<p>Zeichnerisches Talent, Werke, die jedem Büro eine besondere Note geben würden, verträumte Aquarellbilder und farbenfrohe Acrylwerke zeigt Gabi Weigl in ihrer Schau in Wertingen. (pm)</p>

<h3 id="femu-a-corsica-élit-son-huitième-conseil-territorial-à-ajaccio">&ldquo;Femu a Corsica élit son huitième conseil territorial à Ajaccio&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.corsenetinfos.corsica/photo/art/grande/30955237-29349561.jpg?v=1550783034" alt="img">
Femu a Corsica poursuit son avancée dans la lignée qu’il s’est fixée le 2 décembre dernier. À savoir bâtir un grand parti politique susceptible de peser de tout son poids dans le discours mais aussi le rapport de force avec Paris. Ainsi, après la création du parti et une phase de réunions explicatives, Femu est entré dans une troisième phase, celle des élections dans chacun des huit territoires. Et celui du Grand Ajaccio, qui monte d’un côté jusqu’à Osani et de l’autre Bastelica et Bastelicaccia, pour un total de 55 communes concernées manquait encore à l’appel. L’élection des conseillers de ce huitième territoire s’est effectuée ce jeudi dans la salle dédiée aux conférences, du CSJC.</p>
<p>Elargir le débat et continuer à construire</p>
<p>Devant une soixantaine de militants et après une minute de recueillement à la mémoire de Dominique Subrini, Jean-Félix Acquaviva, député de la deuxième circonscription de la Haute-Corse et surtout Secrétaire National du Parti, a présenté cette échéance. « Le territoire du Grand Ajaccio se met en valeur. Nous devons avoir conscience du contexte politique, économique et social de la Corse. La situation est difficile depuis la prise de pouvoir de l’actuelle majorité territoriale. Femu a Corsica réunit aujourd’hui, 2000 militants ce qui en fait le premier parti de Corse. Partout dans l’île, des réunions ont lieu hors temps électoral. Ce sont les fondations de quelque chose qui va s’enraciner et se déployer. Nous avons, pour ambition, d’élargir le débat et de continuer à construire. Pour cela, nous devons former, informer et transmettre mais cela passe aussi par une présence importante sur le terrain… »</p>
<p>L’élection du secrétaire général et des membres du huitième territoire s’est effectuée à main levée, une seule liste s’étant présentée. Sans surprise, Le Grand Ajaccio sera conduit par Patrick Lugrezi. À ses côtés, 12 élus du territoire (François Alfonsi maire d’Osani, Dany Antonini, Muriel Fagni, Romain Colonna, Nadine Nivaggioni et Véronique Arrighi conseillers territoriaux, Jean-Nicolas Antoniotti conseiller municipal à Cuttuli, Pierre-François Bellini maire de Carbuccia, Mathieu Ceccaldi adjoint à Marignana, Stéphane Mattei adjoint à Sari d’Urcinu, Hélène Paoli conseillère municipale à Letia et Nicolas Rutili, maire d’Ortu) et 12 membres sans mandat effectif (Pierre Acquaviva, Nathalie Lanfranchi, Aurélien Maroselli, Sébastien Masala, Marie-Ange Milleliri, Sandrine Miniconi, Stéphanie Nesa, Stéphane Pinelli, Charles Santucci, Nathalie Serra, Marie-Paule Mondoloni-Tomasi et Petru Natale Vellutini).</p>
<p>Objectif renforcer sur le terrain l’action des élus et porter la voix du parti. Une mission que le conseil territorial veut s’attacher à mettre de suite en place…

Customisable solutions in trade credit insurance</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share</p>
<p>CAPE TOWN – Customisable solutions in trade credit insurance can greatly aid companies in managing their credit and counterparty exposure while also supporting growth in new markets or with existing clients. Many companies are also entering new markets and extending their supply chains across multiple regions, all of which further increases the need to protect themselves from risks involving commercial trade debts. What is Trade Credit Insurance? Trade credit insurance indemnifies a seller against losses from non-payment of trade debt arising from slow pay, insolvency and political risk in case of cross border transactions. Coverage is designed to prevent disruptive losses, reduce risk of key account concentration levels and provide risk transfer of bad debt issues. A recent industry panel debate hosted by Aon South Africa drew leading trade credit insurance experts together to unpack the key trends facing businesses of all sizes in a global economy that is facing unprecedented economic, political and social upheaval. The following are some of the key issues unpacked by the panel of experts:</p>
<p>Market Conditions</p>
<p>Accounts receivable are often the largest uninsured asset on a company’s balance sheet, even though it is also the primary source of revenue. The global economic outlook coupled with local pressures and fluctuating markets are putting accounts receivable at risk and constraining cash flows. It would also be foolhardy to believe that large businesses don’t default on payments as recent corporate failures have shown – Maria Teixeira , Trade Credit Business Unit Manager at Aon South Africa.</p>
<p>, Trade Credit Business Unit Manager at Aon South Africa. High rates of payment default to be the new normal and we expect our policyholders to practice due care and implement risk management strategies to mitigate risk – Charles Nortje , CGIC.</p>
<p>, CGIC. Business is adjusting and focusing more on gathering information, talking about financial situations with buyers and being risk cautious – Jacqui Jooste , Coface.</p>
<p>, Coface. There are still good risks to be found, despite the situation. Business owners understand their business much better than we ever will, it’s all about being on the same team and talking about the turbulent water – Gareth Joubert , Hollard.</p>
<p>, Hollard. The need for co-insurance models where the risk is shared is steadily growing against a tough economic backdrop – Menso Kwint, Lombards.</p>
<p>Trading in Africa</p>
<p>Africa offers an avenue of investment, with many multinationals investing in many African countries. But in the face of economic, political and regulatory uncertainty across the continent, it can be very difficult to recoup losses in unfamiliar territories. A professional trade credit insurer is able to assist clients in vetting potential clients or buyers in cross-border transactions, set credit limits and provide debt collection services if needed, significantly mitigating potential risks on foreign soil – Maria Teixeira , Aon South Africa.</p>
<p>, Aon South Africa. To grant trade credit insurance in Africa, you need an expert on the ground that thoroughly understands the local risks, language, economy and cultural nuances. It’s crucial to develop those relationships – Donna Furmidge , Santam.</p>
<p>, Santam. Gathering information on African buyers is futile. It is vital for trade credit insurers to visit the country, assess the market position and confirm what they have to lose if they don’t pay their debt – Charles Nortje , CGIC.</p>
<p>, CGIC. Obtaining quality information on an African country is complicated as it is a melting pot of diverse legislation and political issues. The support of clients can greatly aid in making these efforts meaningful, though it remains a time-consuming undertaking – Stephane Rutili, Euler Hermes.</p>
<p>The use of trade credit insurance as a finance facility</p>
<p>The use of trade credit insurance as a means to secure a finance facility is steadily growing from a global perspective. Up to 60 percent of our new enquiries into trade credit insurance come from financing enquiries directly or indirectly linked, where clients are wanting to achieve access to more competitive lending rates. In certain instances, banks are insisting on credit insurance before lending - Maria Teixeira , Aon South Africa.</p>
<p>, Aon South Africa. A trade credit insurance policy provides clients with the ability to trade on a more secure basis. It also illustrates that they have good business and credit management principles in place, which makes the business a more attractive prospect when it comes to securing credit and loan facilities – Jacqui Jooste , Coface.</p>
<p>, Coface. This type of approach is quite new to South Africa, but growing traction – Stephane Rutili , Euler Hermes.</p>
<p>, Euler Hermes. This approach is a valuable instrument in the hands of an SME. The root cause for failure of an SME is a lack of business acumen and capital, with risk mitigation through trade credit insurance being a valuable solution – Charles Nortje, CGIC.</p>
<p>Securing the market for start-ups and SMEs</p>
<p>There’s a misconception that trade credit insurance is only suited to large corporate companies and that it is expensive. The reality is that even small businesses can insure from as little as R4 000 and up. Small and medium businesses are certainly at greater risk if a major debtor defaults as their balance sheets usually cannot carry them through a major default – Maria Teixeira , Aon South Africa.</p>
<p>, Aon South Africa. There is a lot of growth and demand in this market, though it remains difficult to underwrite the SME market from a risk perspective as governance protocols are often not as strict as they need to be. It’s often best to start with a small credit facility and build it over time – Jacqui Jooste , Coface.</p>
<p>, Coface. In the SME market, it’s not so much about the actual business but the people they deal with. If you take a small basket of SMEs whose interests are aligned, you will find they are very careful who they deal with and treasure their key clients – Charles Nortje, CGIC.</p>
<p>The value of trade credit</p>
<p>With trade credit insurance in place, companies can enhance their bank financing by improving their lending relationship, improve their balance sheet by insuring their debtors and gain access to more capital at reduced rates. Trade credit solutions can also support sales in new or riskier markets, grow existing accounts, and strengthen customer relationships by helping buyers with letter-of-credit requirements gain credit terms. Trade credit across borders can cover political risks such as currency inconvertibility, importation risk, conflict and repudiation risk – Maria Teixeira , Aon South Africa.</p>
<p>, Aon South Africa. As a trade credit insurer, you are on the ground investigating risks to gather first-hand information. It forms the basis of solid risk management disciplines and provides us with the means to make an informed decision on whether a risk is worth taking – Donna Furmidge, Santam.</p>
<p>The need for trade credit insurance magnifies in tough economies</p>
<p>South Africa is currently experiencing difficult political and economic conditions, which has a direct impact on the financial and trading performance of businesses. Vulnerabilities to external shocks have also increased in a post-downgrade economy, with the impact of it slowly manifesting in financing becoming more difficult to secure and dwindling foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>“It paints a picture of a distressed economy where the occurrence of defaulting debtors on a company’s books is increasing in response to the weak trading conditions. Regardless of whether a business operates locally or across borders, and whether it is a large or small business, trade credit cover is essential to manage and mitigate the credit risks associated with customer debtor debt. The failure of a major customer or even several smaller customers to pay their dues can severely impact the financial health of a business,” says Maria Teixeira, Aon South Africa</p>
<p>In the current environment where credit facilities are increasingly in demand, credit insurance becomes a necessity. Payment protection through properly scoped credit insurance is a non-negotiable given the current market volatility and threats to business sustainability.</p>
