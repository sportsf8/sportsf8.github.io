<h3 id="su2c-bake-off-youtube-star-faints-in-the-tent">SU2C Bake Off: YouTube star faints in the tent</h3>
<p><img src="https://bakeryinfo.co.uk/images//22846.photo.2.jpg" alt="img">
SU2C Bake Off: YouTube star faints in the tent</p>
<p>Even if we could roam freely right now, Bake Off was worth staying in for last night.</p>
<p>It got off to a strong start. Sadly, the same could not be said for YouTuber and Strictly Come Dancing star Joe Sugg who, within minutes of the signature challenge starting, cut his finger while peeling an apple and promptly fainted. Waking up on the tent floor must be a surreal experience.</p>
<p>Naturally, he got a lot of sympathy from the hosts and judges.</p>
<p>“Just to clear this up, I’m a vampire,” said Noel. “So, when you were out, I helped myself.”</p>
<p>Still standing up in the tent, and competing alongside Joe (pictured above), was former Big Brother contestant and TV presenter Alison Hammond, TV presenter Alex Jones and singer James Blunt.</p>
<p>“Have you all washed your hands?” Alison asked. Apt. And a reminder for viewers at home as well.</p>
<p>The contestants were tasked with making a traybake that depicted a scene. James, keen to bake his first-ever cake, sought to make a vanilla sponge with raspberry jam and a fondant scene of a plane flying through the country in honour of his pilot dad. Alison went for fudgy chocolate brownies with hearts on top, while Joe opted for a space-themed apple and biscuit spread cake. Yum.</p>
<p>Alex, using her imagination, created a coconut and pineapple cake that looked like a swimming pool. “It’s the only thing I could of that was rectangular,” she said.</p>
<p>At least she didn’t lose the oven door like Alison (pictured below). “Everything’s going smoothly. This is going to make really boring TV. Hold on, where’s the oven door gone?” she said.</p>
<p>Having located the oven door (it slides into the bottom of the oven because it’s fancy), she produced what the judges deemed a “decent brownie”. Despite talking to his cake, literally putting his ear up to it and asking questions like a lunatic, James’ offering was slightly overbaked, albeit very neat. Alex’s was a tad dry, but had a lovely tropical flavour.</p>
<p>Having recovered from his injury, Joe was looking to impress. Miraculously, it worked. He even got a coveted Hollywood handshake. Biscuit spread, aka Biscoff Lotus Spread, makes everything better.</p>
<p>“What a turnaround,” Joe beamed. “The comeback kid of the baking world!”</p>
<p>On to the technical, and Prue was getting filthy. “What we’re after is 12 perfectly filled holes.”</p>
<p>Cue sniggering from the contestants (and my sofa) as the celebs were tasked with creating 12 mini Yorkshire puddings complete with rare steak and a horseradish cream. The hole filling was made funnier by a rather phallic-shaped horseradish presented by Noel.</p>
<p>It is safe to say I have never wanted to eat a technical more. Yorkshires are my weakness, my true love. They’re the best bit of every roast (yes, every – they belong with chicken as much as beef).</p>
<p>“I normally ask this woman called Bessie to provide them,” said Alex. I don’t discriminate. My love for a Yorkshire pudding ranges from homemade delights to Aunt Bessie’s.</p>
<p>Despite, in my mind at least, Yorkshires being a staple creation, the contestants seemed uncertain. Some of Alex’s looked like crisps, James’ varied wildly in size and Joe opened the oven early, which I was led to believe was a Yorkshire pudding no-no. Yet, they rose beautifully.</p>
<p>The challenge led to one of the best lines ever uttered in the tent: “I’m going to have to un-beef them,” Alex declared.</p>
<p>For context, she’d forgotten to put horseradish cream under the beef. It didn’t help her though. Paul declared her creations “ridiculous”. At least she didn’t nearly kill the judges with a hefty hit of horseradish, like James did. Between that and other misgivings, he landed in last place, with Alex in third, Joe in second and Alison securing first place in the technical.</p>
<p>Showstopper time meant creating a 24-biscuit, 3D masterpiece that depicted what the contestants wanted to be when they grew up.</p>
<p>James, having recently fulfilled his childhood dream of being a pub landlord, set about making a gingerbread pub; Alex went for a lime and coconut travel agency; Joe an archaeological gingerbread dig; and Alison a police station.</p>
<p>Cue Alex’s final showdown with a KitchenAid mixer. Having struggled with it in previous rounds, now she couldn’t lock in the giant glass bowl. The mixer fought back, smashing the bowl in spectacular fashion, destroying her biscuit dough and cutting her hand in the process. At least she didn’t faint.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t make this up, could you?” she said.</p>
<p>Watching Alison and Alex (above) piece-build their “biscuit fantasies”, as Noel called them, was an experience: haphazardly breaking biscuits to meet the requisite 24, trying to glue them together with buttercream (which was never going to hold properly) and furiously, but messily, icing them.</p>
<p>Alison, unfortunately, did not pull it off successfully. “It is a bit like a five-year-old has been given a lot of biscuits to decorate,” said Paul. It was a fair comment.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Prue was quite pleased with Alex’s, even if the “grouting” wasn’t very good.</p>
<p>But it was the men in pinnies that stole the showstopper. Joe’s dig was “exquisitely done” and “delicious”, while Prue declared James’ fondant rug “the best use of fondant I’ve ever seen” even if the biscuits were a bit underbaked and some of the icing quite abstract.</p>
<p>“That’s just how they look to me after a few pints,” James replied.</p>
<p>It was a close call, taking into consideration the highs and lows of all three rounds, but Joe was the recipient of the prized Star Baker pinny. Hopefully, that should go some way to making up for all the Gillian McKeith comparisons right now.</p>

Joe Sugg cuts his finger on an apple-peeler, while Alex Jones’ unhappy relationship with her electric mixer leads to a second appearance by the on-set medic. They’re joined by singer James Blunt and presenter Alison Hammond, and the showstopper is to create a scene out of biscuits depicting what they wanted to be when they grew up. The only contestant to have fulfilled this childhood dream is Blunt, who’s recently bought a pub where, he jests, they put on “You’re Beautiful” to clear out the punters at closing time.</p>

<p>Art Mysteries With Waldemar Januszczak</p>
<p>8.30pm, BBC Four</p>
<p>Vision After The Sermon is post-impressionist Paul Gauguin’s most mysterious picture. Painted in Brittany, before he left for Tahiti, it shows a group of Breton women in traditional dress sharing a vision of Jacob wrestling with an angel. But what does this famous work have to do with Victor Hugo’s Les Misérables and with a 17-year-old girl called Madeleine, wonders Waldemar Januszczak as he investigates.</p>
<p>Georgie is back in Afghanistan on Our Girl (Photo: BBC)</p>
<p>Our Girl</p>
<p>9pm, BBC One</p>
<p>Georgie (Michelle Keegan) helps with a polio inoculation programme, but the thought that Elvis’s killer is still at large continues to plague her (and us) with flashbacks. Providing security for a doctor providing vaccinations in the remote mountains, the mission goes awry – giving Prof (so called because he reads books and knows classical music) the chance to prove himself to his more earthy colleagues.</p>
<p>Five Guys A Week</p>
<p>9.15pm, Channel 4</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of this dating show is that it’s not always the obvious matches that make it to the end of the week, and, having stated a preference for olive-skinned, dark-haired men, the only chap matching this description fails to cut it as far as 68-year-old widow Susan is concerned. But enough spoilers – the other sexagenarian suitors spending the week at Susan’s Georgian cottage in Yorkshire include a rock guitarist, a retired car salesman and a tantric masseur (complete with ponytail), while their self-styled romantic hostess probably wouldn’t be charmed to hear that “she has a lovely pair of legs… no varicose veins there”.</p>
<p>The Trip To Greece</p>
<p>10pm, Sky One</p>
<p>It’s the end of the road for Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan’s facsimiles of themselves, as well as (probably) Michael Winterbottom’s sublime faux-realist travelogue. Brydon suggests a detour to Olympia, but Coogan refuses on the grounds that it will be full of tourists. Instead, they head to Pilos, home of King Nestor, stopping at a suitably envy-inducing waterside restaurant for a snack. As they are admiring the view, Coogan receives a call bearing some bad news…</p>
<p>The Windsors</p>

<h3 id="the-funniest-celebrities-to-follow-on-twitter-from-james-blunt-to-mindy-kaling">The funniest celebrities to follow on Twitter: From James Blunt to Mindy Kaling</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/24/18/jamesblunt.jpg" alt="img">
Because our world is unfair, some people were born with a multitude of talents.</p>
<p>This has never been more evident than in the age of the internet, when famous people can show us directly and immediately that not only are they leaders in their respective art form… but they’re funny too.</p>
<p>We’ve compiled a list of 11 of the funniest celebrities to follow on Twitter, if you’re looking for a way to brighten up your timeline.</p>
<p>James Blunt</p>
<p>The You&rsquo;re Beautiful singer has almost found a second career through his Twitter, on which he regularly posts hilarious, often quite self-deprecating quips about his singing career.</p>
<p>Nothing captures that more perfectly than Blunt’s recent tweet about social distancing&hellip;</p>
<p>Phoebe Bridgers</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter and “meme lord” Phoebe Bridgers is consistently hilarious on her Twitter account, which stands in stark contrast to her devastatingly vulnerable brand of folk.</p>
<p>Like many other touring artists who have had to cancel their upcoming dates, Bridgers is now tweeting about going stir-crazy in self-isolation. A few gems are below.</p>
<p>Chrissy Teigen</p>
<p>A list about funny Twitters wouldn’t be complete without Chrissy Teigen; in fact, Teigen is so funny on Twitter that I’d wager some people discovered her via the platform rather than through her career as a model.</p>
<p>Teigen - who is married to singer John Legend - is wonderfully candid on the platform, and isn’t afraid to boldly criticise major figures like the US president.</p>
<p>Cher</p>
<p>Cher doesn’t entirely count, because we’re not sure if the comedy of her account is entirely intentional. But the chaotic energy of her timeline is such a balm in these hectic times, we had to include her.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s just&hellip; perfect.</p>
<p>Alright, one more.</p>
<p>Perfume Genius</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Perfume Genius has also found himself a side career as a supreme tweeter, balancing the beautiful queer opulence of his music with inexplicably brilliant online quips.</p>
<p>His specialty is tweets that are super specific, but somehow universal.</p>
<p>Mindy Kaling</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s unfair for the others on this list to include Mindy Kaling, because she actually does have a background in comedy - but her posts are just too good not to include.</p>
<p>A recent gem:</p>
<p>Charli XCX</p>
<p>Charli XCX is a pop star whose online presence is symbiotic with her musical output. Her feed is wild, endlessly creative, and hilarious - just like her recent “submission” for the Gal Gadot Imagine video.</p>
<p>Lewis Capaldi</p>
<p>Brit Award winner and chart-topper Lewis Capaldi is a breath of fresh air in a crowd of pop stars who normally only allow a polished version of themselves online. Not Capaldi.</p>
<p>He’s self-deprecating, infinitely hilarious, and refreshingly real.</p>
<p>Nicola Coughlan</p>
<p>The Derry Girls scene-stealer is just as charming and funny in real life as her character is on the show. One does not need to look much further than her recent viral tweet, which perfectly encapsulated our collective anxiety as we entered into lockdown.</p>
<p>Anna Kendrick</p>
<p>Kendrick is an infrequent tweeter, but when she surfaces, it’s always with something golden.</p>
<p>The art of restraint, personified.</p>
<p>Ryan Reynolds</p>
<p>Another rare Hollywood actor who regularly posts online, Reynolds charms his fans with frequent updates about his life as a father of three and husband to actress Blake Lively.</p>
<p>It doesn’t get much better than Reynold’s now-iconic post for Lively’s birthday back in 2017, when he honoured his wife with beautiful photo of the pair… with Lively cropped out.</p>
<p>And there’s a whole lot more where that came from - in fact, it’s a running theme of his account.

<h3 id="james-blunt-does-us-all-favour-and-wont-perform-live-streamed-concert">James Blunt does us all favour and won’t perform live-streamed concert</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PRI_147662825_1585142978.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
James Blunt has ruled out a live-stream concert amid lockdown (Picture: Redferns)</p>
<p>Many artists have been entertaining their fans with live-streamed performances from their homes, but James Blunt isn’t about to be one of them.</p>
<p>The You’re Beautiful singer, 46, told his followers: ‘During lockdown, while many other artists are doing mini-concerts from their homes, I thought I’d do you all a favour and not.’</p>
<p>It comes after several artists have started going live on Instagram to give their followers dome light relief amid lockdown.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson enforced the stricter measures in the UK on Monday, telling the public they must stay in their homes except for infrequent trips to buy food or medication, one form of daily exercise, trips to and from work for key workers and trips for medical appointments.</p>
<p>Many artists also suffered cancellations to their shows for the foreseeable future as gatherings of people were stopped in order to slow the spread of coronavirus within the UK.</p>

<p>Among the artists who took their concerts online after the cancellations were Chris Martin from Coldplay, Yungblud and Christine and the Queens.</p>
<p>During lockdown, while many other artists are doing mini-concerts from their homes, I thought Iâd do you all a favour and not. — James Blunt (@JamesBlunt) March 25, 2020</p>
<p>James however doesn’t feel the need to do the same, and had earlier joked about how the banning of large gatherings hasn’t affected his shows.</p>
<p>He shared a poster with an image of him performing to an empty venue, telling his followers: ‘They can ban large gatherings, but as you can see here, it doesn’t seem to affect my shows.’</p>
<p>What does self-isolation mean? Self-isolation means staying indoors and avoiding all contact with other people for 14 days, according to the NHS. It means no going to work, school, the shops or even to the park for some fresh air, in order to minimise the risk of passing on Covid-19. Public transport and taxis are a no-no and you shouldn’t have visitors over, even if you just stay at home. Anyone in self-isolation is advised to ask friends, family and delivery drivers to pick things up for you and drop them-off. You should put a sign outside telling people you are self-isolating and everything should be left on the floor outside your front door to avoid the risk of further infections. You should leave a sign outside your property if you have to self-isolate (Picture: PA)</p>
<p>Those who are self-isolating are still advised to stay away from their pets as much as possible and to wash their hands before and after touching them. If you live in a house share and have to self-isolate, the advice is to stay in your room with the door closed and only emerge to use communal kitchens, bathrooms and living areas if absolutely necessary. Who should self-isolate? The government advises anyone returning from Category 1 areas (Hubei, Iran, Italy and Daegu or Cheongdo in South Korea), to go straight home and self-isolate, even if they don&rsquo;t display any symptoms. Travellers should use the 111 online coronavirus service to find out what to do next. Anyone returning from Category 2 areas should self-isolate and call 111 if they have Covid-19 symptoms. You can find the list of those places here.</p>

<p>Celebrities have been putting their skills to use by providing free resources to fans to help entertain their children amid lockdown, with Joe Wicks providing daily PE classes, Myleene Klass teaching music and David Walliams releasing a daily audio story.</p>
<p>The UK is currently in lockdown for three weeks to try and combat the spread of coronavirus by enforcing social distancing to prevent the virus spreading from person to person at such a rapid rate.</p>

<h3 id="remember-youre-beautiful-singer-james-blunt-hes-friends-with-prince-harry">Remember ‘You’re Beautiful’ Singer James Blunt? He’s Friends with Prince Harry</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Prince-Harry-and-James-Blunt.jpg" alt="img">
Singer James Blunt has an amazing voice that is a pleasure to listen to. Fans can surely remember his hit song “You’re Beautiful,” released as the second single in 2005 from his debut album, Back to Bedlam. While it is widely speculated the song is about a former girlfriend of Blunt’s, he has never confirmed if this is the case.</p>
<p>We don’t hear about the English singer and songwriter very much, although many people enjoy his music tremendously. To this day, “You’re Beautiful” still remains wildly popular in both the United States and the United Kingdom. One of the most significant things about Blunt is that he has been a very private person, despite his success. We don’t often get a glimpse into his personal and private life, which is why a lot of the details remain a mystery. Let’s take a look at one of the things we do know about “You’re Beautiful” singer James Blunt: the fact that he is friends with none other than Prince Harry.</p>
<p>How did James Blunt and Prince Harry meet?</p>
<p>Prince Harry and James Blunt | Chris Jackson/Getty Images</p>
<p>While it is true that they both resided in England, how exactly did the singer and the grandson of Queen Elizabeth cross paths in the first place? According to Smooth Radio, they actually met while serving together in the British Army. It was then that they became good friends and haven’t looked back since. Their friendship runs so strong that Prince Harry sent Blunt a text message in 2016 asking him to perform at his annual sporting event, the Invictus Games, which Blunt happily accepted. While serving together in the armed forces, it turns out that Blunt was actually Harry’s superior. Harry was required to address him as “sir.”</p>
<p>Has James Blunt said anything about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepping down from royal duties?</p>
<p>It is no secret that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle won’t be known as “their royal highnesses” for much longer. So, what does Blunt have to say about Megxit? Well, as we would expect, he fully supports his good friend and his wife. Hello! reports that Blunt has said he is well aware of the pressures of constantly being in the spotlight, and he acknowledges the fact that it isn’t easy.</p>
<p>He definitely sympathizes with Meghan and Harry. He even went so far as to say that they both are hard workers who don’t deserve the negative treatment that they were getting. This is one of the first times that Blunt has really ever opened up about his personal life. It was wonderful to hear about how he feels, and how he knows that things have been difficult for Prince Harry and Markle for quite some time now. Sounds like Blunt is one loyal friend.</p>
<p>James Blunt and Prince Harry still remain good friends</p>
<p>Prince Harry’s days of serving in the military may be behind him, but that doesn’t mean his friendship with Blunt is over. They are such good friends, that Blunt and his wife, Sofia Wellesley, were guests at Prince Harry and Markle’s wedding. It is really no surprise that Blunt has nothing but good things to say about his friend. According to Yahoo!, he knows just how good of a person Prince Harry is. Fame is difficult and Blunt knows that all too well. Now that Markle and Prince Harry are going to be stepping down and living a more private life that they have dreamed of for years, we can only imagine that Blunt will remain good friends with the couple.
