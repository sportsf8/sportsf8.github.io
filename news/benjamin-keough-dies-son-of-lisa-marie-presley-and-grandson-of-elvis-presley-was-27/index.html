<h3 id="lisa-marie-presleys-son-benjamin-keough-dies-at-27">&ldquo;Lisa Marie Presley&rsquo;s Son, Benjamin Keough, Dies at 27&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2020/07/presley3.jpg" alt="img">
He was the son of musician Danny Keough, grandson of Elvis and Priscilla Presley and brother of actress Riley Keough.</p>
<p>Benjamin Keough, the son of Lisa Marie Presley and grandson of Elvis Presley, has died, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed. He was 27.</p>
<p>Presley&rsquo;s rep told The Hollywood Reporter: &ldquo;She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter, Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TMZ reported that Keough died Sunday in Calabasas, Calif., from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to the Los Angeles County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department for comment.</p>
<p>Keough also was the brother of actress Riley Keough and son of musician Danny Keough. (Lisa Marie Presley and Danny Keough divorced in 1994.) His maternal grandmother is Priscilla Presley.</p>
<p>Benjamin Keough at one point may tried to follow in his famous grandfather&rsquo;s footsteps, reportedly signing a $5 million record deal with Universal in 2009 to record up to five albums. However, the label denied at the time that any such deal had been struck.</p>
<p>In 2013, Lisa Marie Presley told the Huffington Post that she was letting Benjamin Keough do &ldquo;his own thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He’s doing his own thing right now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I’m going to let him decide when he wants to go out and do what he wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keough also has twin sisters, Finley and Harper Lockwood, 11, whose father is Lisa Marie Presley&rsquo;s ex-husband Michael Lockwood.</p>
<p>Ben reportedly inspired his mother&rsquo;s 2012 song Storm &amp; Grace (his middle name is Storm). The song&rsquo;s lyrics include: &ldquo;You have the most beautiful heart/That I’ve ever known/It kills me you can’t ever show it/And a shell has been grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2012, Keough and his siblings all were featured in the video for Lisa Marie&rsquo;s &ldquo;duet&rdquo; with Elvis of his 1954 song &ldquo;I Love You Because” through archival footage.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie also posted a family photo in June 2019 with all her children, with the caption: &ldquo;Mama Lion with cubs.&rdquo;

Benjamin Storm Keough, the 27-year-old son of Lisa Marie Presley and the grandson of Elvis and Priscilla Presley, was found dead Sunday in Calabasas, California.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie Presley&rsquo;s manager, Roger Widynowski, confirmed the death in a statement, and reported that Lisa Marie was &ldquo;beyond devastated&rdquo; over the death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life,&rdquo; Widynowski said. (Lisa Marie and her fourth husband, Michael Lockwood, are the parents of twin girls, Harper and Finley.)</p>
<p>The death of Keough was an &ldquo;apparent suicide,&rdquo; due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the celebrity news site TMZ, but the cause of death had not been confirmed by official sources by early Sunday evening.</p>
<p>A musician who signed a $5 million recording contract with Universal when he was 17 but apparently released no music commercially, the Tampa-born Benjamin Keough is the younger brother of 31-year-old actress Riley Keough (&ldquo;Mad Max: Fury Road,&rdquo; &ldquo;American Honey&rdquo;). Benjamin and Riley are the children of Lisa Marie and musician Danny Keough, who married in 1988 and divorced in 1994.</p>
<p>Benjamin Keough had visited Memphis in the past, with members of his famous family. On Jan. 8, 2010, with temperatures in the teens and snow lightly falling, Riley and Benjamin Keough cut a five-tier birthday cake during a public ceremony at Graceland in recognition of the 75th anniversary of Elvis&rsquo; birth.</p>
<p>In 2009, he discussed his recording contract with a British newspaper, the Daily Telegraph. &ldquo;The music will be nothing like Elvis, nothing like him at all,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Benjamin Keough mostly avoided the limelight, even as fans on social media in recent years made much ado about his resemblance to his world-famous grandfather.</p>
<p>When he did appear in the news, it usually was in connection to his family. For example, as a child in 2002 he was in present at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and Bungalows on the Big Island of Hawaii when his mother married actor Nicolas Cage.

<p>DIVORCING NICOLAS CAGE</p>
<p>They finally finalized their divorce in 2004. Speaking about the failed marriage at the time, Presley said: “I’m sad about this, but we shouldn’t have been married in the first place. It was a big mistake.”

<p><img src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/bldHCxt6xpgg_9S0m5fgULLcDdA=/1000x0/filters:focal(3041x484:3051x494)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/BQX772GXERA7NGSDYQCU6VO4WY.jpg" alt="img">
Benjamin Storm Keough, segundo hijo de Lisa Marie Presley y nieto de Elvis y Priscilla Presley, fue hallado muerto este domingo en su domicilio de Calabasas, al norte de Los Ángeles. Tenía 27 años. Según las primeras hipótesis de la policía, se suicidó de un disparo.</p>
<p>La noticia fue adelantada por la publicación TMZ. Un representante de Presley dijo a The Hollywood Reporter: “Está con el corazón destrozado, inconsolable y más que devastada, pero intentando mantenerse fuerte por sus gemelas de 11 años y su hija mayor, Ridley. Adoraba a ese muchacho. Era el amor de su vida”.</p>
<p>Para pertenecer a la realeza del mundo del espectáculo en Estados Unidos, Benjamin Keough mantuvo un perfil mediático muy bajo durante toda su vida. Nació en 1993 del matrimonio entre Lisa Marie Presley y el músico Danny Keough. Ella es la única hija, a su vez, del intérprete norteamericano más famoso del siglo XX, Elvis Presley. Las pocas imágenes que existen de él como adulto muestran un parecido sorprendente con su abuelo. Su madre contaba que la gente se hacía fotos con él porque “es clavado”.</p>
<p>Benjamin tenía una hermana mayor, la actriz Riley Keough, de 31 años. Lisa Marie estuvo casada brevemente con Michael Jackson y con Nicholas Cage. Las dos hermanastras pequeñas son dos gemelas nacidas en 2008 de su último matrimonio, con el músico Michael Lockwood.</p>
<p>La última vez que Lisa Marie Presley publicó una foto con todos sus hijos fue en junio del año pasado, con una frase que decía: “Mamá leona con sus cachorros”.

Lisa Marie Presley, 52, trauert um ihren Sohn, Benjamin, †27. Laut einem Bericht des US-Online- Portals “TMZ” starb Benjamin Keough, der Enkel von Elvis Presley, †42, am Sonntag in Calabasas, Kalifornien, an einer selbst zugefügten Schusswunde. Er war Schauspieler und Musiker.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie Presley: Sie ist untröstlich</p>
<p>Lisa Presleys Manager, Roger Widynowski, sagte gegenüber TMZ: &ldquo;Sie ist völlig untröstlich, verzweifelt und zutiefst erschüttert, aber sie versucht, für ihre 11-jährigen Zwillinge und ihre älteste Tochter Riley stark zu bleiben. Sie hat ihren Sohn verehrt. Er war die Liebe ihres Lebens.&rdquo; Ein offizieller Polizeibericht wurde noch nicht veröffentlicht. Lisa Marie Presley ist auch die Mutter der Schauspielerin Riley Keough, 31, die wie Benjamin aus der Ehe mit Danny Keough, 55, hervorging sowie den elfjährigen Zwillingstöchtern Harper und Finley, die Lisa Marie mit Ex-Mann Michael Lockwood, 59, teilt.</p>
