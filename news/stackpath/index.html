<h3 id="derms-explain-the-differences-between-restylane-and-juvéderm">&ldquo;Derms Explain the Differences Between Restylane and Juvéderm&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/70427-restylanejuvedermfillersjpg.jpg" alt="img">
In the great big world of facial fillers, two of the most popular—Restylanë and Juvéderm—often get conflated. Patients often ask, “Is one better than the other? Do they both work in the lips, cheeks? Does one last longer than the other?” We turned to the pros for the breakdown.</p>
<p>The two fillers are created by different companies—Allergan makes Juvéderm, and Galderma produces Restylane—but both are forms of hyaluronic acid (HA) that add volume to depressed areas and help boost collagen over the long-term. “While each filler has its own unique properties—the HAs have a different cross-linking structure—I don’t think one is superior to the other,” says Bannockburn, IL dermatologist Heather Downes, MD.</p>

<p>Fort Lauderdale, FL dermatologist Dr. Matthew Elias says some dermatologists may prefer one brand over another, “especially for certain areas like the tear troughs or lips, but for the most part, they’re considered interchangeable.”</p>
<p>For example, Fort Lauderdale, FL dermatologist Dr. Igor Chaplik explains that Juvéderm tends to attract water from its surroundings, so he likes placing it in areas he would want to swell, hydrate or be more pillowy, such as the lips, temples and mid-cheeks. “I would not use Juvéderm under the eyes or on the jawline,” he adds. “I find Restylane to be better for support and definition, so I prefer using it on the jawline, lateral cheekbones, philtrum [vertical groove between the nose and upper lip], and occasionally under the eyes.”</p>
<p>Germantown, TN dermatologist Purvisha Patel, MD says, “In my experience, I do see more immediate swelling with Restylane, but the end result is the same. I’ve also seen that Restylane can create more of a Tyndall effect [the skin takes on a blueish color] when placed too superficially in the tear troughs, but that is of course due to the person wielding the syringe rather than the filler itself.”</p>
<p>Danville, CA dermatologist Jerome R. Potozkin likens the two fillers to Coke and Pepsi and says, “no matter which product is used, what’s most important is the person doing the injections.” Pittsburgh dermatologist Dr. Ashley Kittridge agrees. “The bottom line: Patients should be making sure they are getting a legit product purchased within the U.S. from a legit injector with the experience and knowledge to be able to select the safest, most effective treatment. A board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon will know these differences.”</p>

<p>Each brand also has its own suite of products “that span the range from least volumizing for superficial wrinkles to most volumizing for deeper placement,” says New York dermatologist Robert Finney, MD. There’s not only Juvéderm, but also Juvéderm Ultra, Juvéderm Voluma, Juvéderm Vollure, Juvéderm Volbella, etc. Each one has a unique molecular structure and indication. The newest products in the portfolio—Voluma, Vollure and Volbella—feature vycross cross-linking technology that experts say causes less swelling.</p>
<p>“Juvéderm Ultra was my workhorse for years before Voluma was made—Voluma lasts longer [ up to 18 months] and works wonders in the cheeks and temples,” says New York dermatologist Lilly-Rose Paraskevas, MD. Volbella is a popular option for the lips, as “it gives them a soft, natural look that isn’t as easy to achieve with other fillers,” says Dr. Kittridge.</p>
<p>The same multiproduct situation goes for Restylane: Other fillers in the toolkit include Restylane Refyne, Restylane Defyne, Restylane Silk and Restylane Lyft. “I prefer the newer products from Restylane, such as Refyne and Defyne,” says New Orleans dermatologist Mary Lupo, MD, noting that they also feature the modern cross-linking method.</p>
<p>“I have found that they produce less swelling and maintain a natural look more so than other products. I love Refyne for under the eyes and in the lips, whereas I use Defyne more often in the smile lines. Restylane Lyft is a thicker filler that can be placed deeper, often on the bone, to provide nice support in the jawline, chin or cheeks.”</p>
<p>If you’re wondering about pricing, it’s not as straightforward as you think. The cost for each depends on the area you’re having treated, how many syringes are used, and often, the region you live in. Your doctor can give you a more precise idea of cost during your consultation.</p>

<p>Interior - Front</p>
<p>The front doors of the Carnival open and shut in a triple-stage action. The build quality is &ldquo;proper premium car&rdquo; good, and the doors also have some heft to them. They shut with a nice sound. Occupants will not have any problem while getting in or out - you just have to walk into the car and sit. Cabin space is enormous. There is enough headroom at the front and a LOT of width between you and the front passenger. The driver does have to stretch to access the touchscreen, but crucial controls are provided on the steering wheel itself. And remember, this car is also sold in the USA, so even in terms of seat adjustment, it goes all the way back. 6+ footers should be comfortable and totally at home.</p>
<p>The windshield is large and the base of the windows is low. Unlike newer cars, the dashboard is not set too high, which means that the frontal visibility is good, even for those of average height (the low dash + windowline show the car&rsquo;s age). Shorter drivers will be alright too as the driver&rsquo;s seat climbs up enough. The large glass area means that you have fantastic all-round visibility. The rear windows are huge (like the size of a house window) and with the dual sunroofs, there&rsquo;s ample light entering the cabin.</p>
<p>The interior design is straight-forward, user-friendly and ergonomic, with some sweet silver highlights thrown in. Its not futuristic though. The dashboard has black on top and beige below, with chrome, piano black and wooden inserts. The quality is absolutely premium! Owners will be very happy and there will be no complaints at all.</p>
<p>Interior quality is luxury car good. It has soft touch surfaces almost everywhere. The entire black portion on the dashboard has soft touch material. The buttons feel premium and some parts (like the window controls) feel like they could have been out of a Mercedes or BMW. All controls feel superb to use and all surfaces are premium.</p>
<p>Kia has loaded the interior with features such as UV-cut front door glasses and windshield, an 8.0-inch touchscreen head-unit with telematics (UVO), 3-zone climate control, 8-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, electric sunroof, Smart Pure air purifier with perfume diffuser, wireless charging for your cellphone, 10-way powered driver&rsquo;s seat, driver&rsquo;s seat ventilation and lots more. However, some features such as a powered front passenger seat, passenger seat ventilation, and illumination / cooling for the glovebox are conspicuous by their absence.</p>
<p>Steering looks good and is well-sized, like that of a sedan. It gets piano black inserts, but GTO felt that it should have gotten a wooden insert on the top and / or bottom, to make it a little more premium. The</p>
<p>The steering can be adjusted for height &amp; reach, both:</p>
<p>Engine start button is backlit in red. It gets a chrome ring around it:</p>
<p>Twin-pod instrument cluster with chrome outlines looks fab. Fonts are really easy to read, even on the go:</p>
<p>The 3.5-inch MID is almost the same as what is seen on the 1st-generation Creta, with only a few minor changes. It shows average and instant fuel consumption, distance-to-empty counter, digital speedometer &amp; outside temperature reading. The trip meter shows the distance travelled, average consumption and time taken on the current drive. Don&rsquo;t miss the urea level graph. At this price point, a full colour MID is sorely missed:</p>
<p>Also shows a compass, the tyre pressure, and can be used to change a few user settings:</p>
<p>The MID shows warnings for the bonnet and tailgate too:</p>
<p>Stalks exude quality. Wiper and light stalks are from the Hyundai-Kia family. While automatic headlamps have been provided, there are no automatic wipers, which the Seltos gets!!!</p>
<p>Side air vents get a silver surround and chrome inserts. It also gets air volume control:</p>
<p>Controls for the dash illumination, headlamp level adjustments, (rear) 220V power outlet &amp; fuel lid release are below. Don&rsquo;t ever disable the traction control, unless starting off on slippery surfaces like slush &amp; snow:</p>
<p>The fuse box is placed on the right side of the dashboard. Has the master on / off switch we&rsquo;ve seen in Hyundais:</p>
<p>Thin, yet sturdy bonnet release lever is located below the dash:</p>
<p>The front quarter glass. Too small to enhance visibility though:</p>
<p>Just like the dashboard, the doorpads get a beige &amp; black colour theme. Wooden insert adds some richness &amp; yes, there is soft touch material on the doorpad too. Lot of storage space available, including big door pockets and another small storage spot above it (to the right of the speaker in this image):</p>
<p>Window controls feel like they have been taken from a Mercedes or BMW! They have a damped operation. The Limousine variant gets all four power windows with Auto Up / Down and anti-pinch safety:</p>
<p>The main door pocket can be used to store a water bottle and the knick-knacks. You could dump the odd item in the smaller pocket above too:</p>
<p>Extremely classy silver door sills. This car exudes quality wherever you look:</p>
<p>Dual-tone black and beige Nappa leather seats are available only on the Limousine variant. The perforated seats get orange contrast stitching and look + feel nice. The driver&rsquo;s seat offers excellent support (especially so with the adjustable lumbar support). Long distance tourers will appreciate it. Only the driver&rsquo;s seat gets cooling though (your spouse will be miffed):</p>
<p>10-way powered driver&rsquo;s seat - one thing I like is that the adjustments are on the quicker side. When you want to adjust the backrest or the fore and aft slide, it starts moving quickly. This is unlike the usual case where the electric adjustment is so slow that you end up annoyed:</p>
<p>Basic manual adjustments for your spouse / date. Should have been electric too, for a car in this price range:</p>
<p>Center armrest has a soft leather cladding. While it is not adjustable, the armrest is conveniently placed &amp; most drivers will find it comfortable to use. Still, that&rsquo;s no excuse - in a car as well-equipped, this important driver tool should have been adjustable:</p>
<p>Seatbelts are height-adjustable. Both front seatbelts get pre-tensioners:</p>
<p>Footwell has lots of space. Dead pedal is perfectly angled and one of the biggest we&rsquo;ve seen! Someone @ Kia must really have a thing for dead pedals:</p>
<p>An OBD port is located on the underside of the dashboard (below the steering wheel). There is a second port in the engine bay:</p>
<p>The ORVMs are well-sized, providing a good view of the action behind:</p>
<p>Like we saw in the Kia Seltos, the IRVM houses 3 buttons - SOS will place an emergency call to Kia customer care, the button with the tow truck will call Kia Roadside Assistance, and the third button will launch UVO (telematics). Auto-dimming functionality has been provided:</p>
<p>Center fascia tilts slightly towards the driver:</p>
<p>All variants come with an 8.0-inch touchscreen HU. The touchscreen is way too small for a cabin of this size! It should have been about 2-3 inches bigger. Even these center air-con vents have flow adjusters (not usually the case with all cars):</p>
<p>ICE &amp; climate control buttons feel quite premium to use. The volume control knob operates in a rich manner too. All 3 climate zones can be set from here. You can &ldquo;lock&rdquo; the rear air-con if you so wish (i.e. rear passengers can&rsquo;t change the settings when locked):</p>
<p>Wireless smartphone charger is placed at the base of the centre fascia. Remember, your smartphone needs to have the wireless charging function for this feature to work. There&rsquo;s also a USB port next to it which can be used to connect your smartphone to the infotainment system (e.g. Android Auto):</p>
<p>Bird&rsquo;s eye view of the center console:</p>
<p>The centre console houses controls for the parking assist, ECO mode, auto-hold (no need to continuously keep the brake pedal pressed when stopping in traffic), driver&rsquo;s seat cooling as well as the e-parking brake (</p>
<p>Two well-sized cup holders with a chrome surround. In a model built for the USA, you can bet that everything is &ldquo;big&rdquo;:</p>
<p>A storage cubicle to keep odd items is available in front of the centre armrest:</p>
<p>The deep armrest storage area has a 12V port as well as a USB charger. The sides are covered with felt too! This area is measured at 18.8 litres capacity:</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a dedicated spot to store your expensive sunglasses. It is wrapped in felt:</p>
<p>Lots of storage space available in this cabin. The Carnival has two gloveboxes:</p>
<p>The upper glovebox is small, but has a non-slip pad at the bottom, which is a good thing if you want to keep your loose items here. They wont slip around and it also minimizes rattling sounds. Even the way that the upper glovebox&rsquo;s lid shuts is so premium. Kia is really building its brand with such quality touches:</p>
<p>These grooves (on the opening / closing mechanism) contribute to the premium feeling action:</p>
<p>Lower glovebox is well-sized, but there&rsquo;s no illumination or cooling! Quite a simple box for such an expensive car:</p>
<p>There is more storage in the front passenger footwell! Your spouse gets another storage area along with a 12V charging socket:</p>
<p>Both the sunvisors come with big mirrors and are illuminated. Don&rsquo;t miss the clip to hold tickets. Further (pun intended), they get an extension:</p>
<p>The roof bezel houses controls for the interior lights and the front + rear sunroofs. Interestingly, you can open the powered rear doors, or lock their operation entirely. Tailgate can also be opened from here:</p>
<p>A conversation mirror is provided as standard on all variants. No need to turn your head to talk to your passengers:</p>
<p>Cabin gets 6 airbags in all:</p>
<p>We love sunroofs! And we like it even more when there are two of them. Your kids will go crazy:</p>

Fonts are really easy to read, even on the go:The 3.5-inch MID is almost the same as what is seen on the 1st-generation Creta, with only a few minor changes. It shows average and instant fuel consumption, distance-to-empty counter, digital speedometer &amp; outside temperature reading. The trip meter shows the distance travelled, average consumption and time taken on the current drive. Don&rsquo;t miss the urea level graph. At this price point, a full colour MID is sorely missed:Also shows a compass, the tyre pressure, and can be used to change a few user settings:The MID shows warnings for the bonnet and tailgate too:Stalks exude quality. Wiper and light stalks are from the Hyundai-Kia family. While automatic headlamps have been provided, there are no automatic wipers, which the Seltos gets!!!Side air vents get a silver surround and chrome inserts. It also gets air volume control:Controls for the dash illumination, headlamp level adjustments, (rear) 220V power outlet &amp; fuel lid release are below. Don&rsquo;t ever disable the traction control, unless starting off on slippery surfaces like slush &amp; snow:The fuse box is placed on the right side of the dashboard. Has the master on / off switch we&rsquo;ve seen in Hyundais:Thin, yet sturdy bonnet release lever is located below the dash:The front quarter glass. Too small to enhance visibility though:Just like the dashboard, the doorpads get a beige &amp; black colour theme. Wooden insert adds some richness &amp; yes, there is soft touch material on the doorpad too. Lot of storage space available, including big door pockets and another small storage spot above it ():Window controls feel like they have been taken from a Mercedes or BMW! They have a damped operation. The Limousine variant gets all four power windows with Auto Up / Down and anti-pinch safety:The main door pocket can be used to store a water bottle and the knick-knacks. You could dump the odd item in the smaller pocket above too:Extremely classy silver door sills. This car exudes quality wherever you look:Dual-tone black and beige Nappa leather seats are available only on the Limousine variant. The perforated seats get orange contrast stitching and look + feel nice. The driver&rsquo;s seat offers excellent support (especially so with the adjustable lumbar support). Long distance tourers will appreciate it. Only the driver&rsquo;s seat gets cooling though (your spouse will be miffed):10-way powered driver&rsquo;s seat - one thing I like is that the adjustments are on the quicker side. When you want to adjust the backrest or the fore and aft slide, it starts moving quickly. This is unlike the usual case where the electric adjustment is so slow that you end up annoyed:Basic manual adjustments for your spouse / date. Should have been electric too, for a car in this price range:Center armrest has a soft leather cladding. While it is not adjustable, the armrest is conveniently placed &amp; most drivers will find it comfortable to use. Still, that&rsquo;s no excuse - in a car as well-equipped, this important driver tool should have been adjustable:Seatbelts are height-adjustable. Both front seatbelts get pre-tensioners:Footwell has lots of space. Dead pedal is perfectly angled and one of the biggest we&rsquo;ve seen! Someone @ Kia must really have a thing for dead pedals:An OBD port is located on the underside of the dashboard (below the steering wheel). There is a second port in the engine bay:The ORVMs are well-sized, providing a good view of the action behind:Like we saw in the Kia Seltos, the IRVM houses 3 buttons - SOS will place an emergency call to Kia customer care, the button with the tow truck will call Kia Roadside Assistance, and the third button will launch UVO (telematics). Auto-dimming functionality has been provided:Center fascia tilts slightly towards the driver:All variants come with an 8.0-inch touchscreen HU. The touchscreen is way too small for a cabin of this size! It should have been about 2-3 inches bigger. Even these center air-con vents have flow adjusters ():ICE &amp; climate control buttons feel quite premium to use. The volume control knob operates in a rich manner too. All 3 climate zones can be set from here. You can &ldquo;lock&rdquo; the rear air-con if you so wish (i.e. rear passengers can&rsquo;t change the settings when locked):Wireless smartphone charger is placed at the base of the centre fascia. Remember, your smartphone needs to have the wireless charging function for this feature to work. There&rsquo;s also a USB port next to it which can be used to connect your smartphone to the infotainment system (e.g. Android Auto):Bird&rsquo;s eye view of the center console:The centre console houses controls for the parking assist, ECO mode, auto-hold (no need to continuously keep the brake pedal pressed when stopping in traffic), driver&rsquo;s seat cooling as well as the e-parking brake ( we aren&rsquo;t fans ). The blank button to the left of the parking brake houses controls for the passenger&rsquo;s seat ventilation in international models. Kia should have offered it here for sure. Hope the brand isn&rsquo;t already developing the mentality of skipping features for India:Two well-sized cup holders with a chrome surround. In a model built for the USA, you can bet that everything is &ldquo;big&rdquo;:A storage cubicle to keep odd items is available in front of the centre armrest:The deep armrest storage area has a 12V port as well as a USB charger. The sides are covered with felt too! This area is measured at 18.8 litres capacity:There&rsquo;s also a dedicated spot to store your expensive sunglasses. It is wrapped in felt:Lots of storage space available in this cabin. The Carnival has two gloveboxes:The upper glovebox is small, but has a non-slip pad at the bottom, which is a good thing if you want to keep your loose items here. They wont slip around and it also minimizes rattling sounds. Even the way that the upper glovebox&rsquo;s lid shuts is so premium. Kia is really building its brand with such quality touches:These grooves (on the opening / closing mechanism) contribute to the premium feeling action:Lower glovebox is well-sized, but there&rsquo;s no illumination or cooling! Quite a simple box for such an expensive car:There is more storage in the front passenger footwell! Your spouse gets another storage area along with a 12V charging socket:Both the sunvisors come with big mirrors and are illuminated. Don&rsquo;t miss the clip to hold tickets. Further (pun intended), they get an extension:The roof bezel houses controls for the interior lights and the front + rear sunroofs. Interestingly, you can open the powered rear doors, or lock their operation entirely. Tailgate can also be opened from here:A conversation mirror is provided as standard on all variants. No need to turn your head to talk to your passengers:Cabin gets 6 airbags in all:We love sunroofs! And we like it even more when there are two of them. Your kids will go crazy: Last edited by GTO : 5th May 2020 at 09:18 .

The star had her lip fillers removed in June but has been sporting a very plump pout again…</p>
<p>She insisted she felt ‘liberated’ when she had her lip fillers removed in June after five years of plumping her pout.</p>
<p>But showcasing her new blonde hair in a Boomerang video on Instagram last week, Lauren Goodger sparked speculation she’d returned to her old ways when she displayed a very swollen pout.</p>
<p>MORE: Frankie Essex talks to Now about her recent weight loss</p>
<p>Speaking in June, Lauren said: ‘2016 was the year to get my lip fillers removed after nearly five years of constant top-ups. I have lovely, full natural lips so it’s finally time to embrace them.’</p>
<p>When Lauren was snapped in October displaying a very large bottom – sparking speculation she’d had butt implants – she still had a natural looking pout.</p>

<p>So has Lauren, 30, gone back on her word? Nurse and Save Face Accredited Practitioner Rachel Scotney tells Now: ‘This most recent photo of Lauren shows a rather pouty, swollen look – which is classic of a post 24-hour lip augmentation.</p>
<p>‘The defined Cupid’s bow and philtrum [vertical groove between the base of the nose and the upper lip] are all signs of a filler injection too.’</p>

<h3 id="lip-piercing-inspirations-you-can-take-from-these-celebrities">&ldquo;Lip Piercing Inspirations You Can Take From These Celebrities&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dailyhawker.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kim_kspeech.jpg" alt="img">
A lip piercing is a piercing worn by both men and women, this is not surprising since there are so many types of lip piercings that can suit any face. In fact there are endless options in and around the mouth for a decorative piercing. So our guide for the different types of lip piercings might inspire you to finally get one.</p>
<p>What is a lip piercing?</p>
<p>Lip piercing is a body modification type which is pierced either on the lips, the surrounding area or the lip frenulum. The formed opening is decorated with beautiful lip jewelry.</p>
<p>Did you know that there are at least 14 different types of lip piercings from which you can choose, if you want to get your lip pierced? Most of the options fall into the category of “bites”, but every bite is positioned differently, and there are several other lip piercing types besides bites that you can get. Let’s take a look at each of the lip piercing types, what differentiates them from each other, and what kind of celeb lip piercing you like.</p>
<p>Lip Piercing Types</p>
<p>Labret</p>
<p>A labret is a lip piercing done with a single puncture, located under the bottom lip. Although ‘Labret’ is actually the name of the jewellery piece itself, it is also the location of the piercing opposite of the Medusa which sits in the middle under the lip. It is worn with a labret, ball closure ring and/or circular barbell.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 6 to 8 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$65</p>
<p>Cara Delevingne wears a labret lip ring or hoop.</p>
<p>Christina Aguilera’s labret piercing stud.</p>
<p>Monroe</p>
<p>One facial puncture, located above the upper lip on the left-hand side. Probably the best-known lip piercing there is, the monroe piercings are named for Marilyn Monroe because they mimic the beauty spot she had on one side of her upper lip. It sits on either side of your upper lip, but the right side tends to be the more popular side.</p>
<p>Pain: 3/10</p>
<p>Healing: 8 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $30-$50</p>
<p>Medusa / Philtrum</p>
<p>Medusa is a single piercing, located above the upper lip, under the philtrum. The piercing is done just below the nose septum, which is called “philtrum”. Medusa is located in the groove under the upper lip and, therefore, the beautiful lip shape is well highlighted.</p>
<p>Pain: 4/10</p>
<p>Healing: 3 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$85</p>
<p>Lower lip puncture, located in the middle of the lip and below it. Labret piercings go straight through the skin below the lower lip but vertical labret piercings go up through the lip from bottom to top, so that the top ball of the jewelry sits atop your bottom lip. These lip piercings are typically done with short straight barbells.</p>
<p>Pain: 6/10</p>
<p>Healing: 8 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$70</p>
<p>Jestrum</p>
<p>Single puncture, centered in the upper lip.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 3 to 6 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$85</p>
<p>Dahlia</p>
<p>Double piercing, located at the mouth corners. The Dahlia is located just outside the corners of the mouth and can be worn by a labret, ball closure rings and a circular barbell. This type of piercing is often done in pairs which give the illusion of ‘bites’!</p>
<p>Pain: 7/10</p>
<p>Healing: 12 to 20 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $20-$80</p>
<p>Cyber Bites</p>
<p>Located in the groove of the upper lip and below the bottom lip, cyber bites piercings are double piercings. It’s actually a combination of a Medusa piercing and a standard labret piercing. Typically, piercers will place labret studs in both piercings. After the labret piercing is healed, you can switch to a lip loop, a circular barbell or a captive ring of some variety, if desired. It’s best to stick with a labret stud for your Medusa piercing, though, even after it’s fully healed.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 6 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $50-$80</p>
<p>Angel Bites</p>
<p>Double symmetrical puncture, located on both sides just above the upper lip.</p>
<p>An angel bite piercing is actually a pair of upper lip piercings placed to the left and right of the philtrum which is the rigid part of your lip immediately below your nose. Most commonly, labret studs are used as the starter jewelry for angel bites piercings and other upper lip piercings, since hoops may get in the way of eating, talking, kissing, and other activities that could irritate the piercings and delay the healing process. Labret studs are ideal because they have a flat backing on them on the end that’s inside your mouth and resting against your gums, and those flat backings tend to be less irritating than balls would be.</p>
<p>Pain: 6/10</p>
<p>Healing: 7 to 9 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $50-$80</p>
<p>Dolphin Bites</p>
<p>A dolphin bites piercing is two openings, made close to each other, below the lower lip. Its a pair of piercings placed immediately below the lower lip, fairly close together to the right and left of the central area where a labret piercing would be placed.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 6 to 8 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $50-$80</p>
<p>Spider Bites</p>
<p>Double puncture under the bottom lip. A spider bite piercing is a pair of piercings located close together and to the mouth corner, below the left or right side of the lower lip. When spider bites are placed that closely to the lip, you can wear hoops, circular barbells, lip loops, or even a short surface barbell instead of labret studs, if desired.</p>
<p>Pain: 4/10</p>
<p>Healing: 4 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$80</p>
<p>Snake Bites</p>
<p>Double puncture of the lower lip. It is located at an equal distance from the center and it resembles a snake bite.</p>
<p>Labret studs or hoops (like captive rings, segment rings or seamless rings) can be inserted when you get a snake bites piercing. If you opt for labret studs, go for soft and flexible PTFE labrets. They’ll be less likely to cause your gums to recede if the jewelry is constantly rubbing against your lower gum line. If you accidentally bite down on your snake bites piercing jewelry, there’s a high risk for chipping a tooth if your jewelry is made of stainless steel or titanium, which is another good reason to opt for PTFE labret studs, at least during the initial healing process. Once you’re fully healed, your piercer can insert more closely-fitting labret studs that are less likely to cause irritation or accidentally get bitten while you’re eating.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 6-8 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $50-$80</p>
<p>Danielle Bregoli features a single snake bite ( also called a side lip piercing)</p>
<p>Horizontal</p>
<p>Cardi B shows off her horizontal labret lip piercing</p>
<p>A horizontal lip piercing has two lower lip surface punctures that are usually connected by straight or curved barbells. This is any piercing that goes straight through the skin immediately below the lower lip or right above the upper lip and into the mouth. Typically horizontal lip piercings are placed off to one side of the mouth and done as a single piercing, although some people like to have 2 or more horizontal piercings placed side-by-side.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 6 to 8 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: Starts at $50</p>
<p>Shark Bites</p>
<p>Two openings, made close to each other, below the lower lip.</p>
<p>Pain: 7/10</p>
<p>Healing: 8 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $80-$90</p>
<p>Vampire Bites</p>
<p>Double piercing of the bottom lip. Looks similar to the snake bites</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 6 to 8 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $50-$80</p>
<p>Canine Bites</p>
<p>Multiple punctures, performed at four corners of the mouth. It is located on the upper and bottom lips.</p>
<p>Pain: 6/10</p>
<p>Healing: 8 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $30-$60</p>
<p>Madonna</p>
<p>One facial puncture, located above the upper lip on the right-hand side.</p>
<p>Pain: 3/10</p>
<p>Healing: 8 to 12 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $30-$50</p>
<p>Lowbret</p>
<p>Modification of the labret piercing, located at the very bottom of the chin. A lowbret piercing sounds exactly like what it is: a labret piercing placed as far down within the lower lip as possible.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 6 to 8 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$70</p>
<p>Ashley</p>
<p>Ashley lip piercing is placed in the center of the bottom lip. It goes inside the lip and shows the barbell ball outside. You may try the single, or close to each other, double Ashley piercings.</p>
<p>Pain: 6/10</p>
<p>Healing: 10 to 14 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$70</p>
<p>Smiley</p>
<p>Single puncture, located in the frenulum of the upper lip.</p>
<p>Pain: 5/10</p>
<p>Healing: 4 to 8 weeks</p>
<p>Cost: $40-$80</p>
<p>Let’s conclude with this image of a fake side lip piercing worn by JLO for her Hustlers movie. Know that you have to get the piercing your heart wants. Enjoy the piercing of your dreams and look after it!

<h3 id="40-everyday-items-you-didnt-know-had-an-official-name">&ldquo;40 Everyday Items You Didn&rsquo;t Know Had an Official Name&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/orange-juice-bottles.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
There are roughly one million words in the English language, which is more than a little bit daunting. With such a vast vocabulary, it would seem that we should all be able to describe anything in a single word. And yet, there are certain everyday items—the metal part of a pencil, the plastic on the end of your shoelaces, the bumps on a raspberry—that we all trip over. But most of these things actually do have words that describe them—you just don&rsquo;t know them. These are the words for everyday items you didn&rsquo;t realize had official names. And for some surprising word origins, learn 35 Commonly Used Words We Totally Stole From Other Languages.</p>
<p>1 The bits of plastic at the end of your shoelaces</p>
<p>Blink and you&rsquo;ll miss &lsquo;em, but those plastic or metal ends of your shoelaces are called &ldquo;aglets,&rdquo; and they serve an essential function. According to Ian&rsquo;s Shoelace Site, aglets keep your laces from unraveling and even make it easier to lace your shoes up. Can you imagine trying to lace a pair of sneakers with fraying laces? No, thanks! And for more word trivia, here are 40 Facts About Words That Will Blow Your Mind.</p>
<p>2 The metal contraption that holds the eraser to the end of a pencil</p>
<p>That small piece of metal that separates the pencil from the eraser (better known as the part of the pencil that is sometimes chewed beyond recognition) is called the &ldquo;ferrule.&rdquo; Since the early 1900s, the ferrule has made the process of writing and editing easier—and that&rsquo;s all thanks to inventor Hyman Lipman, who, according to CW Pencil Enterprise, introduced this newer, smarter version of the pencil in 1858. When he sold the patent just a few years later, he scooped up a handsome sum: $100,000 (or about $3 million in today&rsquo;s dollars). And for more on inventors, check out these 15 Common Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know Were Named After Someone.</p>
<p>3 The plastic, pronged item in the middle of most pizzas</p>
<p>All hail the &ldquo;pizza saver,&rdquo; the plastic contraption that is placed in the center of a pizza that resembles a three-pronged avant-garde side table. Without this invention—which prevents the top of the pizza box from collapsing in at the center and compromising the precious slices within—pizza as you know it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same.</p>
<p>4 The wire cage that keeps the cork in a bottle of champagne</p>
<p>The &ldquo;agraffe&rdquo; is the &ldquo;metal clip used to secure the cork in a bottle of champagne or sparkling wine during secondary fermentation.&rdquo; Basically, the agraffe&rsquo;s purpose is to prevent the cork from emerging under the pressure created by carbonation.</p>
<p>5 The cardboard sleeve on to-go cups of coffee</p>
<p>Though &ldquo;zarfs&rdquo; have been around for centuries, the newer, more practical cardboard version was patented in 1991 by Jay Sorensen. After burning his fingers on a cup of coffee, causing him to spill it all over his lap, Sorensen decided to come up with a safeguard. So, coffee lovers have Sorensen to thank for keeping our hands burn-free with zarfs. And for more words that came about recently, discover 40 Words That Didn&rsquo;t Exist 40 Years Ago.</p>
<p>6 The small cup that holds condiments</p>
<p>From the name of these condiment cups, &ldquo;soufflé cups,&rdquo; you&rsquo;d think that you&rsquo;d be consuming something far more sophisticated than mayo, ketchup, or mustard.</p>
<p>7 The loop on the belt that keeps the end in place</p>
<p>After your belt has passed through the buckle, the &ldquo;keeper,&rdquo; or the last loop on your belt, serves the second-most important function: It ensures that the end of your belt will remain snugly in place. And for words that sound different depending on where you are, check out these 50 Words People Pronounce Differently Across America.</p>
<p>8 The armhole in an item of clothing</p>
<p>As Merriam-Webster explains, &ldquo;the shape or outline of the armhole&rdquo; is called the &ldquo;armscye.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t feel bad if you&rsquo;ve never heard this word before—it&rsquo;s typically only used in tailoring and dressmaking. And for more words you&rsquo;re not familiar with, here are 33 Funny Dictionary Words You Didn&rsquo;t Know Actually Existed.</p>
<p>9 The wooden strips that separate window frames</p>
<p>The small strips of wood, plastic, or metal between individual panes of glass are called &ldquo;muntins.&rdquo; They&rsquo;re not to be confused with &ldquo;mullions,&rdquo; however, which are larger horizontal or vertical dividers placed between adjoining window units.</p>
<p>10 The chart you look at while taking an eye exam</p>
<p>Rather than simply referring to this chart as the &ldquo;eye chart,&rdquo; call it by its real name. The &ldquo;Snellen chart&rdquo; is named after Dutch ophthalmologist Herman Snellen, who designed it in the 186os. However, in recent decades, many ophthalmologists having been using another chart, the &ldquo;LogMAR chart,&rdquo; to determine more accurate vision estimates.</p>
<p>11 The division sign</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right—it&rsquo;s not just called the division sign. According to Merriam-Webster, it&rsquo;s technically an &ldquo;obelus.&rdquo; Centuries ago, the obelus was used as an editing tool to mark factually questionable passages in manuscripts.</p>
<p>12 The &ldquo;You Are Here&rdquo; mark</p>
<p>Long before the days of Waze and Google Maps, we got around by following maps emblazoned with bright red &ldquo;You Are Here&rdquo; markers. (You&rsquo;ll still find these on maps in subway stations, national parks, and museums.) Believe it or not, these markers and signs have a name: &ldquo;ideo locators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>13 The device they use to measure shoe size in retail stores</p>
<p>Today, you may order a pair of shoes online and pray to the retail gods that they fit like a glove. But back when everyone still shopped at actual brick-and-mortar stores, people measured their shoe size to a tee by using contraptions known as &ldquo;Brannock Devices.&rdquo; Invented by Charles F. Brannock in 1925, you can still find these at certain shoe stores around the globe.</p>
<p>14 The long strips that appear while peeling a banana</p>
<p>Those pesky, long strings on bananas are called &ldquo;phloem bundles.&rdquo; You might recognize the word &ldquo;phloem&rdquo; from high school biology: It describes the complex tissues that transport food and water to plants, ensuring that they remain well-fed.</p>
<p>15 The pound symbol</p>
<p>No, it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;hashtag.&rdquo; As it turns out, the pound symbol actually has a much more official-sounding name. According to Merriam-Webster, the term &ldquo;octothorpe&rdquo; is used to describe the pound symbol. &ldquo;Octo&rdquo; refers to the eight points, while the origin of &ldquo;thorpe&rdquo; is still up for debate.</p>
<p>16 The flesh around a turkey&rsquo;s neck</p>
<p>In case you were curious, that bit of fleshy skin around a turkey&rsquo;s neck is called &ldquo;snood.&rdquo; And, according to an oft-cited 1995 study in Animal Behaviour, the longer the snood on a male turkey, the more likely he is to find a mate.</p>
<p>17 The bumps on raspberries and blackberries</p>
<p>Blackberries and raspberries are among a class of fruits called bramble fruits, or fruits that are produced by any rough, tangled, prickly shrub. Bramble fruits are aggregate fruits, meaning they&rsquo;re made up of a bunch of smaller units. And those units—the little bumps you see on these berries—are called &ldquo;drupelets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18 The bumps on the surface of a ping pong paddle</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pips&rdquo; are the &ldquo;little nubs that protrude from a single side of a rubber,&rdquo; the outside material of a paddle. Pips can vary in size, but experienced players prefer shorter ones, as longer, more pronounced ones don&rsquo;t give players much control over the ball.</p>
<p>19 The groove between your nose and the middle of your lips</p>
<p>Yes, even that vertical groove between your nose and upper lip has a name. This part of your face is known as the &ldquo;philtrum&rdquo;—though it seems to have no apparent function aside from giving you a perfect pout.</p>
<p>20 The space between your thumb and forefingers</p>
<p>Originating from Northern England, the term &ldquo;purlicue&rdquo; refers to the space between the thumb and forefingers, according to Collins English Dictionary.</p>
<p>21 The space between your eyebrows</p>
<p>If you scowl often, you engage the muscles of the &ldquo;glabella,&rdquo; or the space between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>22 The inedible parts of food</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chankings&rdquo; refer to parts of food that can&rsquo;t be digested and are instead spit out: rinds, pits, seeds, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>23 The lighter, crescent-shaped part of the fingernail</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered what the white, crescent-shaped mark on your fingernail was, wonder no longer! According to Merriam-Webster, this part of the nail is called the &ldquo;lunule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>24 The prongs on a fork</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right—those prongs have a name. These pointed ends are called &ldquo;tines,&rdquo; according to Merriam-Webster. Any fan of the movie Pretty Woman is probably familiar with hotel manager Bernard Thompson (Héctor Elizondo) explaining to Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts) that &ldquo;sometimes there are two tines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>25 A small dab of toothpaste</p>
<p>When you brush your teeth, you&rsquo;re likely to use a &ldquo;nurdle,&rdquo; or a tiny, wave-like dab of toothpaste.</p>
<p>26 The outer part of the crust on a pizza</p>
<p>Though some may avoid this part of the pizza entirely, the most zealous pizza lovers will indulge in all parts of the culinary treat, including the &ldquo;cornicione,&rdquo; or the pizza&rsquo;s outer crust.</p>
<p>27 The foam on top of beer</p>
<p>You could say a poorly poured pint is overwhelmed with foam. Or, you could use the proper term and say that there&rsquo;s more barm than beer in your glass. According to Merriam-Webster, &ldquo;barm&rdquo; is the &ldquo;yeast formed on fermenting malt liquors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>28 The lines on the inside of your wrist</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever taken up the art of palm reading, you might have forgotten to address your &ldquo;rascette lines,&rdquo; or the transverse lines on the inside of your wrist. Along with the lines that arch across your palm, palm readers believe that these lines by your wrists carry other important messages about your present, past, and future.</p>
<p>29 The dent at the bottom of a wine bottle</p>
<p>According to Wine Spectator, &ldquo;punts,&rdquo; or the indentations at the bottom of a wine bottle, were first created to ensure that the bottle remained upright without toppling over. At this point, however, they no longer seem to serve a purpose, as wine bottle manufacturers have found ways to reinforce the strength of the bottles without the use of a punt.</p>
<p>30 Your little toe or finger</p>
<p>Instead of simply calling your smallest toes and fingers your little toes or pinkies, sharpen your lingo by calling them by their medical term, &ldquo;minimus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>31 The space between your nostrils</p>
<p>According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, the tissue that links the nasal tip to the nasal base is referred to as the &ldquo;columella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>32 The non-gender-specific term for a niece or nephew</p>
<p>For those of you who trip over the phrase, &ldquo;nieces and nephews,&rdquo; try this alternative: &ldquo;Nibling,&rdquo; as the Collins English Dictionary defines, is a non-gender-specific term that allows aunts and uncles to use a catch-all phrase.</p>
<p>33 Illegible handwriting</p>
<p>Calling all doctors, lawyers, and journalists—your chicken scratch can now be defined in a single term. According to Merriam-Webster, &ldquo;careless handwriting&rdquo; is also referred to as &ldquo;griffonage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>34 That hard to reach spot on your back</p>
<p>That spot on your back that you just can&rsquo;t reach to scratch? That&rsquo;s called your &ldquo;acnestis,&rdquo; or the part of the back in-between your shoulder blades.</p>
<p>35 The dot above certain letters</p>
<p>According to Merriam-Webster, the &ldquo;tittle&rdquo; is that dot above a letter &ldquo;I&rdquo; or &ldquo;J&rdquo; in lowercase. You may be tempted to draw a smiley-face tittle every time you write, but leave them out of professional business letters.</p>
<p>36 The infinity symbol</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re referring to this symbol, you don&rsquo;t need to call it an &ldquo;infinity symbol.&rdquo; Instead, refer to this figure-eight shaped curve by what Merriam-Webster says is its official name, a &ldquo;lemniscate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>37 The empty space between the bottle top and the liquid</p>
<p>That space between the top of your drink bottle to the liquid inside? That&rsquo;s called its &ldquo;ullage,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the amount that a container lacks of being full.&rdquo;</p>
<p>38 The whiskers on cats</p>
<p>You could simply call them &ldquo;cat whiskers,&rdquo; or you could call them &ldquo;vibrissae,&rdquo; which according to Merriam-Webster, are the &ldquo;stiff hairs that are located on the face and especially about the snout of many mammals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>39 The side of the hammer not used for hammering</p>
<p>Hammers have two sides: one that hammers in objects, like nails, and another that can usually remove nails. This &ldquo;usually hemispherical or wedge-shaped end of the head of a hammer that is opposite the face&rdquo; is called a &ldquo;peen,&rdquo; according to Merriam-Webster.</p>
<p>40 The symbols used to replace profanity</p>
<p>Whenever you see symbols used to replace words that are considered profanity, like &ldquo;@$#%!,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;grawlix.&rdquo; Merriam-Webster says the term was created by American cartoonist Mort Walker.

<h3 id="hospital-is-the-first-in-country-to-screen-pregnant-women-for-birth-defects-brought-on-by-drinking-alcohol">&ldquo;Hospital is the first in country to screen pregnant women for birth defects brought on by drinking alcohol&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article11326089.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS89689071.jpg" alt="img">
A hospital has become the first in the country to screen mums-to-be for birth defects brought on by alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>Tameside Hospital is leading the way in pioneering a new approach to highlight the dangers of drinking in pregnancy to unborn babies.</p>
<p>Alcohol consumed by mums-to-be is the nation’s leading preventable cause of birth defects, with an estimated one in 100 babies born with alcohol-related damage according to the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p>Now, Tameside’s HALS (Hospital Alcohol Liaison Service) and the maternity unit have developed a new programme to track the drinking habits of mums-to-be, which includes the use of hard-hitting ‘demonstration dolls’ which show the effects of drink on babies in the womb.</p>
<p>As well as being able to send out a clear ‘no alcohol equals no risk’ message from the beginning of a woman’s pregnancy, the new pathway aims to cut preventable birth defects by recording a woman’s drinking in the child’s medical notes - aiding any future diagnosis.</p>

<p>Staff will use the demonstration dolls, showing the malformation in facial development that can occur during early pregnancy, as a training resource.</p>
<p>Features include small eye openings, a smooth wide philtrum (the vertical groove between the base of the nose and the border of the upper lip) and a thin upper lip.</p>
<p>Kerry Lyons, who heads up the HALS team, said: “When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, so does her developing baby. Any amount of alcohol, even in one glass of wine, passes through the placenta from the mother to the growing baby.</p>
<p>“Developing babies lack the ability to process, or metabolise alcohol through the liver or other organs. They absorb all of the alcohol and have the same blood alcohol concentration as the mother. It makes no difference if the alcoholic drink consumed is a distilled spirit or beer, or wine.”</p>
<p>Kerry said part of the programme is to dispel myths surrounding drinking in pregnancy, such as the common held view that Guinness gives you iron - when in reality a woman would need 148 pints of the beverage to get her daily requirement.</p>
<p>She added: “Alcohol is toxic to a developing baby and can interfere with healthy development causing brain damage and other birth defects.</p>
<p>“Most babies negatively affected by alcohol exposure have no physical birth defects. These children have subtle behavioural and learning problems that are often not diagnosed at all or misdiagnosed as autism or attention deficit disorder instead of one of the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders.”</p>

<p>There are no specific figures to show the number of babies affected by FASD in Greater Manchester, but those behind the programme say it’s likely to be higher than the national percentage.</p>
<p>“We suspect in Greater Manchester it’s far greater. The number of people within the adult population drinking harmful levels is significant and that will be transferable to the maternal population.</p>
<p>“This does rely on women being honest with us but it’s about them deserving the right information at the right time and I’m not sure that’s always been the case.”</p>
<p>Monthly education programmes will be available within the hospital and the community midwifery team will be performing the screening and giving advice.</p>
<p>Karen James, Tameside Hospital’s chief executive believes the initiative will influence public health messages on drinking while pregnant and mirror the approach taken on smoking in pregnancy.</p>
<p>She said: “Drinking during pregnancy causes more harm to the unborn child than tobacco smoke according to many senior doctors.</p>
<p>“The release of this pathway is the culmination of nearly 18 months of hard work by this talented team.</p>
<p>“It ensures that there will be a seamless approach to both the identification of alcohol consumption in pregnancy and subsequent education offered to pregnant women around preventing developmental disability associated with low-level alcohol consumption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mags Deakin, specialist midwife at Tameside, added: “Tameside is an area with higher than average hospital admissions though alcohol harm so we know that this is an area of high risk.</p>
<p>“Our maternity unit has around 2,800 births per year as well as providing antenatal and postnatal support for women who reside in this area but may have their babies in other units but will still receive support via our pathway.”</p>
