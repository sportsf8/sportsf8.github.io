<h3 id="in-tweet-celtics-great-bill-russell-calls-trump-a-coward">&ldquo;In tweet, Celtics great Bill Russell calls Trump a coward&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/-nV5DTW7_c-XFOYJGJB8zU-xp2I=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/4HLGKBSDBEI6HJ2JRSYAPFLUCM.jpg" alt="img">
In the Twitter message, Russell said “ #Trump you projected your narrative that #TakingAKnee is disrespectful &amp; #UnAmerican it was never about that! You are divisive &amp; a coward. It takes true courage 2 stand 4 what is right &amp; risk your life in the midst of a #pandemic #Proud2kneel #BlackLivesMatter .”</p>
<p>Boston Celtics great Bill Russell called President Trump a coward in a recent overnight tweet, as protests demonstrating against police brutality and systemic racism continued throughout the country.</p>
<p>In the tweet, the NBA Hall-of-Famer can be seen kneeling with the Presidential Medal of Freedom bestowed on by then-President Obama in 2011, around his neck. It appears to be a photo Russell has previously tweeted. The recent message also quote-tweeted Trump saying, “We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!”</p>
<p>Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016 as a way to protest police brutality and racial injustice in the US. Kaepernick, who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl, has been exiled from the NFL in recent years, with the quarterback saying he has been blackballed for his role in starting a wave of protests. Kaepernick has insisted all along he was good enough to play in the league.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Two days ago, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was wrong for not listening to players fighting for racial equality and encourages them to peacefully protest, as a multitude of demonstrations against systemic racism unfolded nationwide.</p>
<p>Protests have continued locally. Recent demonstrations, which have been held daily in Boston for more than a week, have focused mostly on the killing of George Floyd but also on the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville and racial inequality at large.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Floyd, a 46-year-old handcuffed Black man, died on Memorial Day when a white Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee to Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Taylor, an EMT, was killed in March by police executing a “no-knock” warrant. She would have turned 27 last Friday.</p>
<p>Last week, Russell offered some candid thoughts on the recent protests in the wake of Floyd’s death.</p>
<p>Russell, who won 11 titles with the Celtics and also garnered five league MVPs, was the foundation of the team’s 1960s dynasty. A bronze statue, unveiled outside City Hall in 2013, was considered by some to be a long-overdue tribute to the basketball legend in a city Russell once considered bigoted.</p>
<p>Russell, who became the first Black coach in major professional sports in North America when he was named Celtics player-coach in 1966, has often spoken out on civil rights issues, dating back to his time in Boston. He attended the 1963 March on Washington and was a supporter of Muhammad Ali at a time when the boxer was drawing controversy over his decision not to serve in the military.</p>
<p>“Bill Russell the man is someone who stood up for the rights and dignity of all men,” said Obama at the 2011 Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony.</p>

<p>傳奇球星羅素（Bill Russell）常被球迷暱稱為「指環王」，因為其手擁11枚冠軍戒是10指也戴不完，只是即便他替波士頓帶來如此榮耀，黑人身份還是令他難逃歧視，球員時代不只曾收到死亡威脅，還曾有惡徒潛入住家搞破壞示警。</p>
<p>如今86歲的羅素已經脫離球員時代將近50多年時間，只是眼見黑人男子佛洛伊德（George Floyd）因白人警察送命，他也在推特感嘆寫下：「我太太帶我去看了幾場示威活動，她說她感受到現場滿滿情緒也期盼能帶來影響改變。」</p>
<p>「她問我，『你能相信你竟然這輩子又遇到這樣的事？』我回答她是，因為什麼都沒有真正改變，我們未來也許可以看到一些改變，但很可能根本不夠」，羅素接續表示，他也在自己推特附上一張報章新聞內容。</p>
<p>這則顯然年代久遠的報導中，當時的羅素對記者說：「我情願因某個信念而死，而不是毫無信念地活著。眼前是危機時刻，我們走到十字路口，是時候觀察中間分子跟右派人士會不會坐視不管，放任極端主義者為所欲為。」

<p><img src="https://www.sportscasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bill-Russell.jpg" alt="img">
Bill Russell doesn’t give up. He’s been that way for 86 years. The former Boston Celtics center is all too familiar with the racial tension that’s escalated since the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, was mercilessly killed at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25. Russell endured racism his whole life and it was highlighted during his time with the Boston Celtics. On Thursday, in a Twitter post, Russell said nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Bill Russell’s NBA career</p>

<p>Bill Russell might be the biggest winner in the NBA, possibly in all of sports. He ran out of fingers for his 11 NBA championships with the Boston Celtics. He was a 12-time NBA All-Star and was named the league’s Most Valuable Player five times.</p>
<p>For 10 seasons, the 6-foot-10 Russell averaged better than 20 rebounds. In five of those seasons, he led the league in rebounds per game. Russell was the second overall pick in the 1956 NBA draft by the St. Louis Hawks. He played his college basketball at the University of San Francisco.</p>
<p>Russell wasn’t just a rebounder. He averaged 15.1 points per game during his 13-year career. He was a workhorse for the Celtics, averaging better than 40 minutes per game in 10 seasons. For his career, he averaged 22.5 rebounds per game. Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975.</p>
<p>Bill Russell the activist</p>
<p>Bill Russell was a basketball player and a high-profiled one. He used his platform to do what he could to help make the world better by standing up for racial equality. While in Lexington, Kentucky for an exhibition game in 1961, Russell and his black teammates were refused service at a restaurant. They made a statement by boycotting the game.</p>
<p>In an email to The Undefeated, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar praised Russell for the way he handled attacking racism, by never using anger. “The thing that most affected me was that he approached injustice with passion, but he expressed himself rationally rather than with anger,” Abdul-Jabbar wrote. “Anger never persuaded anyone to your side, but logic did. That was an approach I tried to adopt.”</p>
<p>Current NBA player Andre Iguodala said he feels the impact Russell has made on his life. Iguodala echoed Abdul-Jabbar’s statement about Russell’s poise while making a point. “He had to really deal with that, not being able to eat at certain places or stay at certain places, not being able to react or defend himself,” Iguodala said in The Undefeated. “So just that mindset alone says a lot about a person, and I don’t think any of us would be able to keep ourselves poised and mild-mannered in that type of climate.”</p>
<p>Russell’s reaction to today’s events</p>
<p>My wife took me to see some of the #protests she said it was emotional &amp; impactful &amp; asked Can U believe U would live through this again in your lifetime? I said Yes, nothing had changed &amp; we will see some change but most likely not enough #GeorgeFloyd @MSNBC @nba @BostonGlobe pic.twitter.com/ophnSYNfgc — TheBillRussell (@RealBillRussell) June 4, 2020</p>
<p>After the brutal murder of George Floyd, Russell took to Twitter to express his condolences to the family. He also said that the senseless murder of black men and women has been a pandemic for decades. Russell then pinned a tweet that included a quote from when he was fighting for racial equality during his playing days. He had gone down to Jackson, Mississippi after civil rights activist Medgar Evers was killed by a white supremacist in the early 1960s. Russell helped open the first integrated basketball camp in the area.</p>
<p>“I’m a man,” the quote read. “If I have to be a boy to be popular, then I don’t want it. If my popularity depends on a thing like this, I don’t give a damn. This is a time of crisis and we’re closer to the crossroads. Now is the time to observe whether the moderates and liberals are going to stand by and let the extremists run wild. It doesn’t matter whether Johnson or Goldwater is president one year hence. At that time, we’ll know for sure what fate lies in store for Negroes.”</p>
<p>In the pinned tweet, Russell said his wife took him to see some of the protests. She asked him if he could believe that he would see this again in his lifetime. He said yes, nothing had changed. He said there will be some change, but likely not enough.

Bill Russell, the legendary Boston Celtics center and NBA Hall of Famer, says he’s not optimistic that “enough” change will come from the George Floyd protests, pointing to history as an example.</p>
<p>Russell, a longtime civil rights activist, shared his grim outlook on the protests that erupted following the death of Floyd, who died last week while in the custody of Minneapolis police.</p>

<p>“My wife took me to see some of the protests,” Russell said in a tweet. “She said it was emotional &amp; impactful &amp; asked ‘Can U believe U would live through this again in your lifetime?’ I said Yes, nothing had changed &amp; we will see some change but most likely not enough”</p>
<p>Russell was referencing a 1963 visit to Mississippi that he had made following the assassination of Medgar Evers, a civil rights activist and NAACP field secretary, according to Bleacher Report.</p>

<p>He shared a clipping of an article detailing his trip where he held the first-ever integrated basketball camp in the state.</p>
<p>“I’d rather die for something than live for nothing,” he said at the time. “I’m a man. If I have to be a boy to be popular, then I don’t want it … If my popularity depends on a thing like this, I don’t give a damn.”</p>
