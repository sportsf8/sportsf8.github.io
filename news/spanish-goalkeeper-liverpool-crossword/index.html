<h3 id="adrian-really-happy-at-liverpool-despite-rumours-of-spain-return">&ldquo;Adrian &lsquo;really happy&rsquo; at Liverpool despite rumours of Spain return&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/11/14/adrianliverpool1103a.jpg" alt="img">
Liverpool goalkeeper Adrian has signalled his intention to remain at the club, describing his move there last summer as &lsquo;the perfect decision&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Signed on a free transfer as back-up to Alisson Becker last August, the Spaniard has featured more than he might have expected during his maiden campaign on Merseyside.</p>
<p>Injuries to Jurgen Klopp&rsquo;s first choice between the sticks have allowed the former West Ham man to clock up 16 starts in total - most recently in a Champions League last-16, second-leg clash with Atletico Madrid.</p>
<p>A poor kick from Adrian during extra-time of that game cost the Reds a goal and, with it, control of a tie that ultimately ended in a 3-2 aggregate defeat.</p>
<p>But, while rumours that the 34-year-old might pursue a return to Spain have been rife in the aftermath of that disappointment, he seems content to remain at Anfield.</p>
<p>“This club has totally exceeded my expectations,” he told the club&rsquo;s official website.</p>
<p>“I think coming here was the perfect decision at the perfect time, to come to the best team in the world right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am really happy I took that decision, to have that patience in that moment of the summer and to be here.”</p>

<p>Adrian went on to pay tribute to the dressing room environment at Liverpool, which has him looking forward to work every day - even when the weather isn&rsquo;t quite like in Spain.</p>
<p>“It was really easy to adapt to the way the team do things outside the pitch because we have a great dressing room,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People can see big names but everyone is a hard worker, no-one feels like he is bigger than the others. That’s the first and most important feeling of the dressing room.</p>
<p>“I look forward to work every day. I love football, I love to do goalkeeper stuff. To be a goalkeeper you have to love to be in goal, love to dive, it doesn’t matter what the weather is doing – if it’s raining or not, windy or not!</p>
<p>“Sometimes obviously the weather helps you more than other days but it’s not about the weather, it’s about the mentality to enjoy doing your profession, to enjoy doing this great job.</p>
<p>“I think it is the best job in the world because we are doing something that we love, and obviously I am still looking for more in training, and to play more games and more seasons.”

<h3 id="liverpool-sign-adrián-to-replace-mignolet-as-alissons-understudy">&ldquo;Liverpool sign Adrián to replace Mignolet as Alisson&rsquo;s understudy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41d5e1e8328534e6e2ecb0067f821b31d1f867c7/0_60_3813_2288/master/3813.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=f4c5b105053ac6162ac3cb67d67ed507" alt="img">
Liverpool have given former West Ham goalkeeper Adrián the opportunity to replace Simon Mignolet as understudy to Alisson.</p>
<p>The Spanish keeper was a free agent having been released by West Ham at the end of last season and had been considering a return to his homeland with Real Valladolid.</p>
<p>But Liverpool moved swiftly to replace the Belgium-bound Mignolet and have signed the 32-year-old to provide experienced back-up to their established Brazil international.</p>
<p>Liverpool FC (@LFC) Welcome to the Reds, Adrian! 🔴🔴🔴 #LFC pic.twitter.com/bAc2UNtTKI</p>
<p>“I’m feeling really happy,” said Adrián. “Really happy to be here and to work in this great club and start doing my stuff on the pitch as soon as possible. I’m very ambitious, I come here to try to win everything, to try to push Ali from the first minute and to make us better.</p>
<p>“Obviously I want to win titles. I come here to fight for all the competitions. We have many competitions ahead – we’re going to fight for it and try to get them. I’m looking forward to playing my first game at Anfield and to win as many games as we can.”</p>
<p>Jürgen Klopp had been reluctant to lose Mignolet this summer despite the Belgium international’s determination to move in search of regular first-team football after losing his place to Loris Karius and then Alisson.</p>
<p>Transfer window 2019 – every summer deal from Europe&rsquo;s top five leagues Read more</p>
<p>Club Brugge’s offer of £6.4m rising to £8.2m with add-ons changed Liverpool’s stance, however, and Mignolet’s transfer was confirmed on Monday. He has signed a five-year deal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jordan Henderson has backed manager Jürgen Klopp’s judgement in the transfer market after a quiet summer of transfers at Anfield. Liverpool have added just the youngsters Sepp Van Den Berg and Harvey Elliott to a squad that won the Champions League and finished second to Manchester City with the third-highest points total in Premier League history.</p>
<p>“If the manager hasn’t signed anyone then he knows better than everyone else,” said Henderson. “I think we’ve got a fantastic squad of players, we’ve showed that. We can use everybody, we’ve got big players [Naby Keïta and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain] coming back from long-term injuries, which is like new signings as the manager says.</p>
<p>“We believe we’ve got a strong group in the changing room, a strong team, and we’ve just got to keep learning, keep improving on the training pitch, keep doing what we’ve been doing for a long time now, and keep staying hungry for more success.”

MADRID — Atlético Madrid scored early and then defended well to beat Liverpool, 1-0, in the first leg of the Champions League’s round of 16 on Tuesday, spoiling the reigning champion’s return to the place where it had won the European title last year.</p>
<p>Midfielder Saúl Ñíguez netted in the fourth minute, and Atlético’s defense successfully held off Liverpool’s powerful attack to give Coach Diego Simeone’s team the edge going into the second leg on March 11 in England.</p>
<p>It was at Atlético’s Wanda Metropolitano Stadium that Liverpool defeated Tottenham, 2-0, last June to lift its fifth Champions League trophy. Tuesday’s lineup was nearly identical for Liverpool, with defender Joe Gomez the only player who did not start in last year’s final.</p>
<p>Atlético, enduring one of its worst stretches under Simeone, came in as a heavy underdog against the thriving European champions.

<h3 id="jürgen-klopp-praises-liverpool-hero-adrián-after-super-cup-penalty-heroics">&ldquo;Jürgen Klopp praises Liverpool hero Adrián after Super Cup penalty heroics&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd6b223886da9ad4ee1c7931a1bea8c130cfeb4/0_238_5433_3260/master/5433.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=07bc227d1caae2f8f57ee446f5cc6d3b" alt="img">
Jürgen Klopp praised the contribution of Adrián, Liverpool’s new goalkeeper, after watching his team beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout to win the European Super Cup.</p>
<p>The Spaniard, deputising for the injured Alisson, was signed only last week and made the decisive save to stop Tammy Abraham’s kick from 12 yards, helping Liverpool win 5-4 on penalties. The final had finished 2-2 after extra time and Klopp admitted being pleasantly surprised by Adrián’s performance.</p>
<p>Christian Pulisic and N’Golo Kanté provide Lampard with reasons to be cheerful | Andy Hunter Read more</p>
<p>“When I first spoke to him (about signing) it was clear we needed to get him fit but then we had to put him straight in,” he said.</p>
<p>“He put in an incredible performance. Both goalkeepers did but for Adrián it was more surprising as there was no real preparation. I don’t even know when he last played for West Ham, to be honest. It’s so nice for him. I don’t think he won a lot in his life so to win this big one is so nice for him. Plus he showed that he is a proper personality in the dressing room. He was even louder than I was at half-time.”</p>
<p>Jordan Henderson, the Liverpool captain, added: “I’m delighted for Adrián who’s just come into the club and he’s the hero.”</p>
<p>Olivier Giroud had opened the scoring for Chelsea but Sadio Mané’s two goals gave Liverpool a 2-1 lead before Jorginho levelled the game again with a penalty.</p>
<p>“I’m the worst loser in the world and I hate it,” Frank Lampard, the Chelsea manager, said. “I’ve got nothing but pride in the team and the performance. It was a tough game against a good Liverpool team that had extra time to recover after the weekend. But sometimes football comes down to little moments of luck. Tammy needs to keep his head up because that’s part and parcel of being a top player.</p>
<p>“People keep talking about the young players at Chelsea. But let’s talk about Jorginho and Kanté, and I could name a few others. We’ve got a quality bunch in there, a really good group, and we’re working hard. I’m trying to instil the way I want to play and there were so many good things tonight.”</p>
<p>The trophy was not lifted until past 1am local time and Klopp was clearly anxious about what it meant for Liverpool before Saturday’s game at Southampton.</p>
<p>“It was a big fight,” said the German. “I didn’t know before the game how good it would feel to win it – and it’s brilliant. Now we must find a way to be ready for Saturday. Nobody wanted extra time.”

<h3 id="uefa-champions-league-liverpool-knocked-out-by-atleticos-extra-time-triple">&ldquo;UEFA Champions League: Liverpool knocked out by Atletico&rsquo;s extra-time triple&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/un5hv1/article31046458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXBRITAINSOCCERCHAMPIONSLEAGUE" alt="img">
Holders Liverpool crashed out of the Champions League in the last 16 after Atletico Madrid scored three goals in extra time to earn a shock 3-2 victory at Anfield on Wednesday that sent them through 4-2 on aggregate.</p>
<p>After falling 2-0 down on the night, substitute Marcos Llorente struck twice in extra time and Alvaro Morata added a late third to ensure a famous victory for Diego Simeone&rsquo;s side against a Liverpool team unbeaten in their last 25 home games in European competition.</p>
<p>Premier League leaders Liverpool enjoyed the greater possession, created more chances, drew a series of saves from Atletico keeper Jan Oblak and scored through Georginino Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino.</p>
<p>Yet after last season&rsquo;s memorable comeback by Liverpool against Barcelona in the semi-finals, it was the Spaniards who turned the tables this time.</p>
<p>Simeone&rsquo;s Atletico are famed for their defensive solidity and their superb organisation and those qualities were on full display, but it was their clinical finishing and remarkable spirit that proved the key elements.</p>
<p>“We don&rsquo;t know where our limit is,” said Llorente who had only scored once for Atletico before this game. “We all defended until the death and when a team all digs in like this, things like this happen. I cannot describe this feeling.”</p>
<p>Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp was not impressed with Atletico&rsquo;s approach, however.</p>
<p>“I dont understand with the quality they have the football they play. They could play proper football but they stand deep and have counter attacks,” said the German. “We accept it of course but it doesnt feel right tonight.”</p>
<p>After allowing an early chance for Diego Costa, which the former Chelsea forward drove into the side-netting, Liverpool, trailing 1-0 from the first leg, laid siege to the Atletico goal.</p>
<p>They powered forward in waves of attacks but Atletico were resilient with central defenders Stefan Savic and Felipe foiling everything Klopp&rsquo;s side threw at them.</p>
<p>The home team broke through two minutes before halftime when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain burst to the byline and pulled back a cross to Wijnaldum who powered an angled header into the bottom corner.</p>
<p>Little change</p>
<p>There was little change to the pattern of the game after the interval with Liverpool peppering Oblak&rsquo;s goal but the Slovenian proved himself up to the task, denying efforts from Mohamed Salah, Firmino and Sadio Mane while Andy Robertson headed against the bar.</p>
<p>Atletico thought they had grabbed a stoppage-time winner when Saul Niguez headed in a Renan Lodi cross but the effort was rightly flagged for offside, ensuring the game went to extra time.</p>
<p>It took just four minutes for Liverpool to take the lead in the tie with Firmino heading against the post and driving home the loose ball as Anfield got ready for a night of celebration.</p>
<p>Yet then it all went wrong for Klopp&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Adrian, standing in for the injured Alisson Becker, passed the ball out straight to Joao Felix who fed Llorente and the substitute punished the Spanish keeper with a precise shot into the far corner.</p>
<p>Llorente produced a carbon-copy finish following good work on the counter from Morata to end Liverpool&rsquo;s hopes of defending their European crown. Morata put the icing on the cake in the final moments with a cool finish after Liverpool had thrown all their players forward.</p>
<p>The pain of this exit will surely ease for Liverpool, who are 25 points clear in the Premier League and will soon win their first domestic league title for 30 years.</p>
<p>But for Atletico, who have never won Europe&rsquo;s premier club competition, this was a triumph which will have them dreaming of even greater things.</p>
<p>“This will go down in our history,” said Simeone. “It fills us with pride as a club, to be once more one of the top eight clubs in Europe.”

<h3 id="manchester-united-set-to-be-without-david-de-gea-and-paul-pogba-for-liverpool-game">&ldquo;Manchester United set to be without David De Gea and Paul Pogba for Liverpool game&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4053021&amp;origw=1440" alt="img">
Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has been ruled out of Sunday’s Premier League clash with Liverpool while goalkeeper David De Gea faces a scan and is a major injury doubt.</p>
<p>Pogba has been battling an ankle problem and United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær confirmed that the 26-year-old has suffered a setback in his recovery.</p>
<p>Solskjær told Sky Sports: “Paul had an injury, he came back, he worked really hard. He came back and played a couple of games, maybe played through the pain barrier.</p>
<p>“He had a scan after the Arsenal game and maybe needed a few weeks’ rest in a boot so hopefully he won’t be too long, but he won’t make this game, no.”</p>
<p>De Gea was forced off in Spain’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Sweden on Tuesday night with a groin injury and Solskjær admits he is also likely to miss the Liverpool clash at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>“I think he’ll be out. It certainly looked like it anyway judging on last night so it’s just one of those things,” Solskjær added.</p>
<p>United sit 12th and are 15 points adrift of fierce rivals and league leaders Liverpool ahead of Sunday’s showdown.</p>
<p>Solskjær was battling a lengthy injury list before the international break and De Gea’s issue further adds to those problems.</p>
<p>But the Norwegian is hopeful Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Anthony Martial may be fit to play some role at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you 100 per cent [who] is going to be fit as something might happen,” he added.</p>
<p>“But hopefully Aaron and Anthony will last the training this week and be available for selection. If it’s for half a game or 30 minutes I don’t know but let’s see where they’re at.”
