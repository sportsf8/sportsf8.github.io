We are publishing personal essays from CNN&rsquo;s global staff as they live and cover the story of Covid-19. Brooke Baldwin anchors the 2-4p.m. edition of CNN Newsroom. Based in New York, she was recently diagnosed with coronavirus.</p>
<p>New York (CNN) It took a full two-week beating on my body. I went to some very dark places, especially at night. Evenings would bring on an eerie melancholy, which was particularly odd for me &ndash; a glass-half-full/chemically blessed kind of gal.</p>
<p>But under the influence of coronavirus, as each day came to a close, I would often cry, unable to stave off the sense of dread and isolation I felt about what was to come.</p>
<p>Baldwin said the illness often brought her to tears. She took this photo to remember how bad she felt, physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>I was fighting constant body aches. In the evenings, I started a habit of climbing into the bathtub for 45 to 60 minutes just to try to use the hot water to distract my skin from the all-encompassing ache that would begin in my lower extremities &ndash; the kind of ache that only two extra-strength Tylenol could eventually dull. Looking back, my sense of time feels warped and inexact. Some days crawled by tortuously slowly, while others disappeared unaccounted for in my memory, lost in the wash of emotion, sleep, and illness.</p>
<p>But what preceded this haze is still crystal clear in my memory. I remember how I felt when the pandemic was first taking hold of our country and my beloved adopted hometown of New York City . I had a job to do. As a journalist, my focus and sense of purpose are galvanized during times of duress. I felt a deep responsibility to tell the stories of this pandemic, to connect our CNN audience with the facts they needed, to show them the human faces enduring this crisis right along with them.</p>
<p>In the few days before I got sick, I interviewed former Vice President Joe Biden, who talked about the urgency of flattening the curve . I interviewed a woman named Michelle Bennett who had just said her last goodbyes via FaceTime to her Covid-stricken mother . And I spoke with a nurse at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, Emily Fawcett, who told me about the ways she and other nurses were buoying each others' spirits between grueling shifts helping patients fight the virus.</p>
<p>Even in my off hours, I started a series on my Instagram account (&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in your Corona Crew&rdquo;,) recognizing immediately that a crisis like this required me to shine a light on our interdependence and connection with one another.</p>
<p>Laid very low by the coronavirus, Baldwin naps with her dog Pugsley.</p>
<p>And then, I got sick and lost my ability to do my job . I was too sick to even continue the Instagram series from my bedroom. I was suddenly cut off from my purpose, and even isolated from my own husband, left to experience the virus firsthand all by myself. Like so many others.</p>
<p>My husband and I began sleeping in separate bedrooms and using separate bathrooms. He did his best to bring me soup, toast and tea, without making too much contact. The food didn&rsquo;t matter much to me because I couldn&rsquo;t taste or smell anything anyway.</p>
<p>Brooke Baldwin kept physical distance from her husband for the first couple of days.</p>
<p>I can remember the day before I lost my ability to taste or smell. I kept smelling the acrid ammonia-like odor of jewelry cleaner. Except there wasn&rsquo;t any jewelry cleaner in sight.</p>
<p>By the next morning &ndash; wham &ndash; I couldn&rsquo;t taste the salted butter on my toast, and couldn&rsquo;t catch a whiff of the peppermint in my tea. Along with my appetite, my energy was also zapped. I slept easily 10-12 hours at night, waking many mornings soaking wet having sweat through the sheets. A golf-ball sized gland swelling under my jaw became the daily sign that my body was fighting.</p>
<p>Over two weeks, the fever, chills, and aches would sometimes leave just long enough to fool me into thinking I was finally recovering. Then they would revisit me with a vengeance. I never knew when it would end. It was relentless, scary, and lonely.</p>
<p>On the darker days, I didn&rsquo;t want to talk to anyone. After days of trying to stay physically apart from my husband, it just became impossible. He hated to see me suffer and he couldn&rsquo;t not take care of me. He began to hold me in those darker moments and let me cry, whispering: &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s going to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These simple acts of connecting with me and hugging me were restorative beyond measure. The isolation might be worse than the body aches. I am endlessly grateful that I have a selfless husband who is also lucky enough to have remained well while I was ailing. Get him one of those antibody tests because so far &laquo;knock on wood&raquo; the man has yet to get sick.</p>
<p>Baldwin tried to eat when she had any appetite, but for days she could not taste this toast or anything else.</p>
<p>Today, I truly consider myself one of the lucky ones. My version of coronavirus did not take suffocating hold of my lungs the way it has with thousands of other patients, sending many of them to the ER. I never struggled to breathe. Even though my body constantly gave me the middle finger, my lungs did not. I know hospitals are overwhelmed with patients &ndash; and nurses and doctors have been working tirelessly doing hero&rsquo;s work. I am glad I did not add to their stress.</p>
<p>And most of all I am grateful for the reminders this virus provided: First, that clarity comes from being quiet and listening to our feelings. And second, that connection is more vital to our health and happiness than we might care to admit.</p>
<p>Baldwin says this photo shows just how exasperated she got being sick.</p>
<p>In our normal lives, we&rsquo;re faced with a barrage of distractions &ndash; events on a calendar, expectations of ourselves. But during this time of Covid-induced isolation &ndash; whether you&rsquo;re sick or just socially distancing in your home &ndash; we&rsquo;ve been forced to sit still sans distraction. The clarity this can bring is more illuminating than anything I could have uncovered in my normally busy, &ldquo;full&rdquo; life.</p>
<p>When I was sick and my body came to a screeching halt, I stopped doing and started really feeling. I found myself thinking about joy (&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t I go to the beach way more often?!&quot;); about my work (&ldquo;I really would like to create a TV series helping empower women&rdquo;); about my mother (&ldquo;Mom, go get on that treadmill that has been collecting dust in your basement! I need you around a lot longer.&rdquo; And dammit, she finally did); and about the beautiful interdependence of my marriage (&ldquo;See how good it feels to let him take care of you &ndash; let him do this more. You don&rsquo;t always have to be so damn independent and self-reliant.&quot;). In the quiet of my quarantine, I was able to more purely isolate my gratitude and my values.</p>
<p>And one of those values is connection. Not just with my husband, but with my community, my friends, and extended family. I heard from thousands of you. Everyone from my parents, brother, aunts, current journalism colleagues, CNN boss, former boyfriends, old coworkers from every job I&rsquo;ve ever had, my dentist, friends I haven&rsquo;t spoken with since college and yes, even DJ Jazzy Jeff (who&rsquo;d survived a nasty dose of Covid-19 and messaged me: &ldquo;So all the prayers that people sent out for me, I&rsquo;m sending all your way.&quot;)</p>
<p>And this doesn&rsquo;t even begin to include all the thousands of Instagram comments and DMs &ndash; mostly from people who have never even met me but who cared enough to selflessly send well wishes, love and prayers. Here&rsquo;s the truth, at first, I didn&rsquo;t feel worthy of all this attention and love. I&rsquo;m a journalist. My resting state is giving someone else attention &ndash; not actually receiving it. It felt&hellip; vulnerable.</p>
<p>But as I re-read a favorite Brené Brown book from my sick bed one day, I came upon this gem: &ldquo;Staying vulnerable is a risk we have to take if we want to experience connection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baldwin credits coronavirus for forcing her to be vulnerable and accept help.</p>
<p>And I realized that sharing my own vulnerability with others online and receiving positive energy and well-wishes back brings me the gift of connection. I quickly discovered how grateful I was to all of these people showing me love. It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to learn to lean in and receive it. In my darker moments, I would log on to Instagram just to be lifted up by love.</p>
<p>It was overwhelming in a way I have never felt in my life. And it showed me how &ndash; even when the world stops and takes a collective breath &ndash; we&rsquo;re all capable of showing up for one another. And for that, I will forever be grateful.</p>
<p>So, yeah &hellip; eff Covid. But also &hellip; thank you? I wouldn&rsquo;t wish this virus upon anyone, but I hope as my smell and taste and some sense of normalcy start to return, that I will also hold onto the clarity and connection I found while I was so damn sick.

New York (CNN Business) CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin announced on Friday that she tested positive for coronavirus after experiencing symptoms a day earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am OKAY,&rdquo; Baldwin said in an Instagram post announcing her diagnosis. &ldquo;It came on suddenly yesterday afternoon. Chills, aches, fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baldwin became the second CNN anchor to test positive for the virus. Chris Cuomo tested positive earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Baldwin, who has been broadcasting from CNN&rsquo;s offices in New York City, said she had been following all the proper precautions. She explained that she has been social distancing and &ldquo;doing ALL the things we&rsquo;re being told to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still — it got me,&rdquo; she said, noting she is healthy with no underlying conditions.</p>

CNN afternoon anchor Brooke Baldwin on Monday updated her social media followers on her battle against the novel coronavirus, calling it a &ldquo;beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this rainy NYC Monday&hellip; I wanted to share with you my news: I THINK I’VE NEARLY BATTLED THIS BEAST,&rdquo; Baldwin wrote in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven’t taken Tylenol for the body aches in 36 hour. And my chief complaint right now is simply the remnants of a cough and what feels like a head cold. I am still sleeping 10 hours at night battling this thing,&rdquo; the &ldquo;CNN Newsroom&rdquo; anchor said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still can’t fully taste or smell&hellip; but I caught just the slightest whiff of peppermint in my tea this morning. #progress,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y’all, I think I’m just a <em>few days away</em> from that full feeling, and I CANNOT FREAKING WAIT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baldwin, who originally joined CNN in 2008, announced she had tested positive for the coronavirus April 3.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old anchor is based in New York, which has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S.</p>

<h3 id="brooke-baldwin-says-sense-of-smell-is-returning-in-optimistic-coronavirus-update">&ldquo;Brooke Baldwin Says Sense Of Smell Is Returning In Optimistic Coronavirus Update&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e968715300000d905154226.jpeg?cache=zdzmbuc7bq&amp;ops=1778_1000" alt="img">
CNN’s Brooke Baldwin shared an optimistic update on her remaining COVID-19 symptoms on Monday, a week and a half after announcing she had tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“I THINK I’VE NEARLY BATTLED THIS BEAST,” she wrote in a lengthy Instagram post. “I snapped this shot of myself on Easter Sunday to mark the first day (on Day 10) in which I started feeling shades of myself.”</p>
<p>To celebrate her turn for the better, the “CNN Newsroom With Brooke Baldwin” anchor said that, although she obviously didn’t break her quarantine and leave the house, she donned “actual sneakers and sunglasses to remember what it feels like to actually go OUT, as in leave my apartment, as in feel normal.”</p>
<p>Her remaining symptoms, she said, were primarily those of a head cold and a light cough, although she was still sleeping 10 hours a night. She also noted her anosmia, a symptom that has been anecdotally reported as a peculiar side effect of the illness, was finally starting to abate.</p>
<p>“I still can’t fully taste or smell&hellip; but I caught just the slightest whiff of peppermint in my tea this morning. #progress My appetite has been small&hellip; toast, soup, tea&hellip; for the day.”</p>
<p>She highlighted an analogy she’d heard from a friend as an accurate descriptor of the experience: “It just felt like their bodies were at the last rinse of a wash cycle. Like in a washing machine going hard fighting this thing. But then it stopped and they felt like clean clothes.” Y’all, I think I’m just a <em>few days away</em> from that full feeling.”</p>
<p>Last week, Baldwin shared her roller-coaster ordeal battling the virus, saying she couldn’t smell or taste any food, had high fevers and chills, and kept deteriorating after thinking she had improved.</p>
<p>She was the second CNN anchor to announce a coronavirus infection. At the end of March, “Cuomo Prime Time” anchor Chris Cuomo announced he had tested positive, and he has shared regular updates on his health while broadcasting from the basement of his home, where he has been quarantined.

CNN host Brooke Baldwin shared hope that her battle with the coronavirus is coming to an end.</p>
<p>“On this rainy NYC Monday… I wanted to share with you my news: I THINK I’VE NEARLY BATTLED THIS BEAST,” Baldwin wrote in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>Baldwin said that as of Sunday she felt a start to a turning point since initially falling ill and testing positive for the coronavirus in early April.</p>
<p>“I snapped this shot of myself on Easter Sunday to mark the first day (on Day 10) in which I started feeling shades of myself,” the CNN host continued.</p>
<p>Balwin, in the lengthy post on Monday, did share she is still not back to 100% quite yet.</p>
<p>“I haven’t taken Tylenol for the body aches in 36 hours… and my chief complaint right now is simply the remnants of a cough and what feels like a head cold. I am still sleeping 10 hours at night battling this thing. I still can’t fully taste or smell,” Baldwin added.</p>
<p>She continued: “One of my friends whose family members had coronavirus used the best metaphor: ‘It just felt like their bodies were at the last rinse of a wash cycle. Like in a washing machine going hard fighting this thing. But then it stopped, and they felt like clean clothes.’ Y’all, I think I’m just a <em>few days away</em> from that full feeling… and I CANNOT FREAKING WAIT. Thank you again for your ❤️ and 🙏🏼. It massively helped. I’m. Almost. There.”</p>
<p>The host of CNN’s Newsroom with Brooke Baldwin announced on April 3rd that she had tested positive for Covid-19, which was followed by an outpouring of support from colleagues and fellow journalists.</p>
<p>The news of Baldwin beginning to feel progress in her fight against the coronavirus comes as CNN colleague Chris Cuomo said Monday night, “I’m ready to get out of the basement. I’m sick of being sick. I’ve had it. I want to get back to work. But I’m not ready, and I don’t have a plan to be ready.”</p>

But I’m not ready and I don’t have a plan to be ready.” https://t.co/hxZmIKRlAW pic.twitter.com/H5vzjdj9KV — Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) April 14, 2020</p>

<p><img src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e90c86d250000a60e6b7924.jpeg?cache=9galhhdcf2&amp;ops=1778_1000" alt="img">
CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin shared an update on her health after she announced last week that she had tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Baldwin posted a selfie Friday on Instagram showing her lying in bed with a slice of toast in front of her.</p>
<p>“I’m a gal who needs tangible progress,” she wrote in the post’s caption. “I can get the sh*t knocked out of me — but then little by little, I know that I will recover. The tricky thing with #covid19 is&hellip; you think you’re improving and then your body gives you the [middle finger].”</p>
<p>The anchor noted that Thursday night was her worst night with symptoms, which included aches, chills and the highest fever she’s had since she developed COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Tears. It wasn’t pretty,” she added.</p>
<p>Baldwin, who hosts “CNN Newsroom With Brooke Baldwin,” later wrote that she felt “at peace” after a good night’s rest.</p>
<p>“My husband (who thus far has proven to be Superman) brought me our little routine of toast and tea — neither of which I can smell or taste — and I sat here solo just brimming with gratitude, ” she said, later adding that a “net effect” of this pandemic should be that “teachers and nurses need a serious RAISE.”</p>
<p>Baldwin was the second CNN anchor to announce a coronavirus infection. Chris Cuomo shared that he has been diagnosed with COVID-19 late last month.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, during a segment of his show, “Cuomo Prime Time,” which he now anchors from the basement of his home as he self-quarantines, Cuomo said that his symptoms, including a fever, were “depressing.”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to have a fever for 20 hours a day. It just wears you down emotionally,” he said.</p>
<p>Baldwin later expressed on Instagram her gratitude to the people who have reached out to her since she announced her diagnosis.</p>
<p>″Turns out — it’s been YOUR kindness to me that has been 100% the most overwhelming part of this experience,” she wrote. “And I just want to say from the bottom of my heart: thank you.”</p>
