<p>People often challenge me to write on Islamic mythology. These ‘challengers’ don’t realise is that Wikipedia already has an entry called Islamic mythology. And in, people speak of Islamic, Christian and Judaic mythology as freely as they talk about Greek, Egyptian and Norse mythology. This ‘challenge’ is based on 19th century definitions (myth is fiction, religion and science are true), and not 21st century definitions (myth is cultural truth of a people, indifferent to evidence). This old definition is popular in Hindutva circles, and many cult gurus propagate this in order to manufacture victimhood as part of the ‘Hindus are under threat’ discourse.Yes, in the 19th century, Hinduism was disdainfully referred to as mythology, owing to its polytheistic beliefs, while monotheistic beliefs qualified as religion. So Hinduism was classified with Greek beliefs. Christianity alone qualified as religion. Not all monotheisms were seen as religions. Europeans and Americans saw the Jewish faith was the ‘Old Testament’, hence outdated, and the Islamic faith as heathen, as Islam did not see sex as sin, and so did not value asceticism.The oft-used phrase ‘Judeo-Christian’ mythology, acknowledging common roots, is a very recent one. It was first used by Europeans and Americans only after the World War II in a spirit of apology and appeasement, horrified by the silence of the papacy over the Holocaust perpetrated by Nazis, who were Christians (a fact rarely advertised today). And the adjective ‘Abrahamic’ was used for myths only after the Gulf War, so about 20 years ago. Until late 20th century, any attempt to point to the common foundation of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and trace if further back to ancient Mesopotamian, Persian and Egyptian mythologies, would lead to uproar. But no more — in a world that values science, and is familiar with poststructuralism, every faith is seen as creating a worldview through stories. Christianity and Islam are no exceptions.In the 21st century, all theism is considered as myths, as God is not a measurable concept. If God is myth, then messenger of God (prophet) is also myth. But myth is not falsehood — it is collective fiction that enables collaboration. Just as Hindu mythology creates Hindu community, Islamic mythology creates Islamic community. Secular mythologies create secular communities. Mythologies are the key to community building. Myths serve as social glue. As Indians, it is surprising how little we know of Islam, even though one of the oldest mosque in the world is in Kerala.Why is that? We have wide exposure to Ramayana and, and even to tales from Bible, thanks to missionary schools and the Gideon’s Bible found in most hotel rooms, and to Hollywood films like Ten Commandments and Passion of the Christ.But what about Islamic myths? Doordarshan tried to produce a serial on biblical stories in 1992, but it was opposed by Kashmiri militant groups and the government stopped the telecast. The government then argued, they were respecting the Islamic ways that forbids depictions of God’s creations and his prophets in art, it was seen by many as appeasement politics — indulging and even encouraging puritanical militant Islamic groups over educated liberal Muslims! An opportunity to familiarise Indians with Islam was lost.Militant puritanical Islam forbids music and dance, and yet Bollywood thrives on talented Muslim musicians, dancers and actors. Muslim empires such as Ottomans of, Safavids of Persia anddid patronise Islamic art between 15th and 18th centuries, and even allowed depiction of stories narrated in Quran and Hadith. So clearly, Islam has a liberal side that governments have chosen to ignore, thus giving excessive power to the militant religious leaders.Few Indians know the Nabi-Vamsa, stories of prophets, composed in 17th century Bengal or the Cira-Puranam, based on life of the prophet, also composed in 17th century Tamil Nadu. Exposure to these stories would have familiarised Indians to the alternate worldview that came to India 1,400 years ago — a worldview based on one life rather than rebirth, where messengers of God told humans how to live, and heaven is reserved for the faithful and law abiding.The idea that all are equal before the law comes from Islamic culture, and influences the ‘idea of India’, where Constitution takes the place of God’s commandments.There is much similarity between Hindu and Islamic mythology. Both speak of brothers who fight constantly over property. Hindu mythology describes the conflicts between Devas and Asuras, Nagas and Garudas, Vali and Sugriva as well as Pandavas and Kauravas). Islamic mythology speaks of fraternal rivalry between Qabil and Habil (Cain and Abel),and Ismael, and Jacob (Yakub) and Esau. Such battles over inheritance remind us that despite difference in cultures and religions, we are all human.

There are two towering figures in the Torah that originate from the city of Aram in Mesopotamia. The first one is Abraham, the patriarch of the Jewish people; the second is Balaam, the gentile prophet who is the protagonist of this week’s Torah portion.</p>
<p>While Abraham and Balaam were both great prophets who hailed from Aram, they could not be moreBalaam was a man full of hate different from one another. Abraham was a man whose heart was filled with kindness, a man who spent his life teaching love for G‑d and every one of G‑d’s creations. He looked for goodness even within the wicked people of Sodom. He journeyed to what would eventually become the land of Israel, on a mission to spread the awareness of G‑d and morality. Balaam, on the other hand, was a man full of hate. He possessed an “evil eye,” the unfortunate “skill” of seeing bad within people. He journeyed toward Israel at the request of Balak, king of Moab, who hired Balaam to curse the Jews.</p>
<p>Balaam’s journey to the hills of Moab is one of the most fascinating and unusual stories in the Torah, a journey that included multiple encounters with an angel of G‑d and a talking donkey. At the start of the journey, the Torah tells us:</p>
<p>In the morning, Balaam arose, saddled his she-donkey, and went with the Moabite dignitaries.</p>
<p>When Balaam was called to Moab, so eager was he to curse the Jewish people that he didn&rsquo;t rely on his lads or servants. He saddled his donkey himself.</p>
<p>On the journey to the binding of Isaac, the climax of his devotion and love to G‑d, Abraham too saddled his donkey himself, as the Torah tells us:</p>
<p>And Abraham arose early in the morning, and he saddled his donkey, and he took his two young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood for a burnt offering, and he arose and went to the place of which G‑d had told him.</p>
<p>Rashi comments on this striking similarity in these very different circumstances:</p>
<p>[Balaam] saddled his she-donkey: From here [we learn] that hate causes a disregard for the standard [of dignified conduct], for he saddled it himself. The Holy One, blessed is He, said, “Wicked one, their father Abraham has already preceded you, as it says, &lsquo;Abraham arose in the morning and saddled his donkey.’”</p>
<p>Rashi is offering an insight that is relevant to each one of us. We sometimes experience intense negativity, similar to the hatred of Balaam, which can cause us to “disregard the standard.” The selfish, destructive forces within us can sometimes propel us to do things that are below the standard we set for ourselves, below the person we want to be. We feel helpless in the face of the intense urge “to saddle our donkey” in the service of negative energy.</p>
<p>Rashi is telling us that Abraham saddledAbraham saddled his donkey with intense passion his donkey with intense passion to fulfill the will of G‑d. And the intensity of this Abrahamic love that we all have within us “precedes” the hate of Balaam. Although we each possess both forces, the positive energy of Abraham is our essence, while the negativity of Balaam is just an externality that does not define our identity.</p>
<p>By emphasizing that both Abraham and Balaam saddled their donkeys themselves, the Torah teaches us that the way to overcome the negativity of Balaam is to awaken and reveal the Abraham within us. The Abrahamic passion will absorb the negative passion and transform it to fuel, intensifying our commitment to holiness and positivity. As described so poetically in the biblical story, Balaam’s curses were transformed into magnificent and beautiful blessings.

<h3 id="did-ancient-priests-invent-writing-before-states-co-opted-it">&ldquo;Did ancient priests invent writing before states co-opted it?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://wp-media.patheos.com/blogs/sites/944/2020/05/Quran-text-SM.jpg" alt="img">
In 1971, Shong Lue Yang, a 41-year-old Hmong “squirrel-hunting basket-maker and mountain rice-farmer” in Laos was assassinated by government soldiers.</p>
<p>This curious historical footnote was recalled in a fascinating recent article in the online e-zine Aeon, titled “The deep roots of writing: Was writing invented for accounting and administration or did it evolve from religious movements, sorcery or dreams?”</p>
<p>Shong Lue’s apparently ill-advised political leanings were among the least interesting things about him, though. More compelling, considering he was illiterate, was his development of the first true alphabet of the Hmong, a long marginalized, persecuted people living today in parts of southern China, Vietnam and Laos.</p>
<p>Like other spiritual visionaries — the Islamic prophet Muhammad comes to mind — Shong Lue believed that literacy was essential to spreading the revelations he claimed to have received from God. Muhammad had famously urged his followers to read aloud the words he said he received from Allah (God) that now comprise that faith’s holy book, the Quran — “Recite!” the prophet commanded.</p>
<p>Although some have argued that the letters of the alphabet Shong Lue is credited with inventing already existed elsewhere in Asia, his script was specifically created to capture the unique language of his people. Thousands of his followers honored him as the “Mother (Source) of Writing,” and many Hmong believed he was their long-anticipated messiah.</p>
<p>A book about Shong Lue was published in 1990 — The Mother of Writing: The Origin and Development of a Hmong Messianic Script — written by William Smalley, an anthropological linguist who lived among the Hmong, with the visionary’s chief disciple, Chia Koua Vang, and another follower.</p>
<p>All of this is not to say Shong Lue wasn’t a rather strange character. He believed he was a direct descendent of God, claimed he received the Pahawh Hmong script from a pair of supernatural twins, and insisted that those who accepted his writing system would survive and escape the hardships that led to the Loatian Civil War (1959-1975). He named himself “Savior of the Common People” and taught a message of redemption.</p>
<p>What’s of particular interest to this blog is the question of whether religious ideology was the true motivator of Shong Lue’s extraordinary invention of a new script for the language of his people — and whether religion was likewise important, perhaps essential, to the historical development of writing in general in the world.</p>
<p>Michael Erard, the author, journalist and linguist who wrote “The deep roots of writing” for Aeon, considers how writing may have emerged:</p>
<p>“The question is this: is writing the product of the state in every single stage of its evolution, invented de novo [from the beginning] by administrative elites?” Erard posits. “Or is it composed of pre-existing representational practices that expanded to fill the needs of the state and complex society?”</p>
<p>Could it have emerged randomly and spontaneously with individuals for private purposes, as it did with Shong Lu, and then been adopted by the wider culture and fully incorporated into its lifestyle and general practices?</p>
<p>Religion for long millennia has been a driving force of most cultures, and the priestly classes in antiquity were often wealthy, so Erard suggests a system of counting at least was likely necessary (e.g., to organize and manage religious commodities), ultimately spawning a more sophisticated writing system for states to communicate and preserve ideas, rules, plans and bureaucratic computations.</p>
<p>Erard views the advent of writing as a many-layered historical phenomenon that expands and becomes more complex as states expand and their management needs metastasize.</p>
<p>“… let’s realise that a sound, a syllable and a word are all things in the world that can be assigned a graphic symbol,” he writes. “This invention depends on the previous ones, and itself is made of innovations, realisations, solutions and hacks. Then comes the functional invention: let’s use this set of symbols to write a list of captives’ names, or a contract about feeding workers, or a letter to a distant garrison commander. All these moves belong to an alchemy of life that makes things go boom.”</p>
<p>“Instead, for the first 300-400 years of early cuneiform texts in the region (from about 3300-2900 BCE), Wengrow sees a bookkeeping function for managing temple-factories of the day,” Erard writes. “‘There is hardly any use of writing for what I would view as state-like functions (eg, dynastic monuments, taxation, tribute, narratives of political events) until the Early Dynastic period,’ [Wengrow] told me.”</p>
<p>As evidence for his theory of the probable religious roots of writing, Erard notes that early writing in Mesopotamia in the Middle East, one of the world first great civilizations, “had no overtly political function” (quoting archaeologist David Wengrow of University College London in his book What Makes Civilization? (2010).</p>
<p>Other archaeological research into Mesopotamian history revealed that counting systems hugely predated writing in the region. Archaeologist Denise Schmandt-Besserat in the 1960s discovered “tokens” in the area’s Neolithic sites going back to 8,000 BCE, “well before the earliest states emerged in Mesopotamia,” Erard explained.</p>
<p>The tokens were in the form of small cylinders, pyramids, discs and balls, which denoted “one cone per unit of grain, one diamond per unit of honey, and so forth.” Original, tokens were stored in groups within sealed clay balls known as “envelopes,” which, because their contents could not be checked later, eventually spurred development of another system to make an impression of the token on the outside of the envelop. Later still, the token and envelopes were done away with entirely and tabulation was done just by impressing on wet clay tablets abstract signs that only mimicked tokens.</p>
<p>Even long before Mesopotamian writing, as early as 1320 BCE, China was writing “divination texts carved into bone and turtle shell” at a time that archaeological evidence does not support the existence of a complex functioning state, Erard points out.</p>
<p>Ultimately in world history, systems with other signs emerged in various cultures to represent language sounds, words and concepts in ever more sophisticated forms of writing that we see in their linguistic descendants today.</p>
<p>“As far as the reductive argument that accountants invented writing in Mesopotamia, it’s true that writing came from counting, but temple priests get the credit more than accountants do,” Erard concludes. “‘Priests invented writing’ is a reduction I can live with – it posits writing as a tool for contacting the supernatural realm, recording the movement of spirits, inspecting the inscrutable wishes of divinities. … In fact, in various corners of the Earth and throughout history, inventors have crafted alphabets and syllabaries to resist the state.”</p>
<p>We were a little behind the writing curve in the Americas. The oldest writing sample so far discovered in the “New World,” in Mexico in the late 1990s, “is a slab of serpentine scratched with 62 symbols … similar to shamanic writing ‘devised by religious specialists, with tightly restricted, revelatory functions’” that dates to only 900 BCE, according to an article by anthropologists article written by anthropologists in Science in 2016.</p>
<p>Whatever its origins, however, human written language remains a glory of our species.</p>

<h3 id="final-speech-of-the-last-byzantine-emperor-present-your-shield-and-sword-descendants-of-greeks">&ldquo;Final speech of the last Byzantine emperor: “Present your shield and sword descendants of Greeks”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2-52.jpg" alt="img">
Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos was the last emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire, today more commonly known as the Byzantine Empire. He is not only remembered for being the last Byzantine Emperor who put up a brave last stand against the Ottomans, but also for his last speech to his officers and allies before the Fall of Constantinople on May 29, 1453 by Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II.</p>
<p>Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Christendom during the Middle Ages, the seat of the Byzantine emperor and the centre of a predominately Christian empire, steeped in Greek cultural and artistic influences, yet founded and maintained by a Roman legal and administrative system. Despite the amalgamation of Greek and Roman influences, its language and culture was Greek.</p>
<p>Although the Turkish state presents the Fall of Constantinople as an epic achievement, their narrative often omits that the Byzantine Empire was in a state of decline since the 1204 Catholic Fourth Crusade that destroyed the city. Nor does the narrative mention that it took 53 days for the Ottoman army of 100,000 to defeat the 10,000 Byzantine defenders.</p>
<p>When Constantinople’s walls were finally breached, Constantine XI knew there would be no mercy, as seen by the three day of mass murder, rape and pillage the Ottoman’s committed after the capture of the city. However, the last emperor of the more than 1,000 year old empire did not flee with the Genoese generals and many civilians to Italy, he instead died fighting in the streets of Constantinople – but not before giving one last epic speech:</p>
<p>“Most noble leader, illustrious tribunes, generals, most courageous fellow soldiers and all loyal honest citizens! You know well that the hour has come: the enemy of our faith wishes to oppress us even more closely by sea and land with all his engines and skill to attack us with the entire strength of this siege force, as a snake about to spew its venom; he is in a hurry to devour us, like a savage lion. For this reason I am imploring you to fight like men with brave souls, as you have done from the beginning up to this day, against the enemy of our faith. I hand over to you my glorious, famous, respected, noble city, the shining Queen of Cities, our homeland. You know well, my brothers, that we have four obligations in common, which force us to prefer death over survival: first our faith and piety; second our homeland; third, the emperor anointed by the Lord, and fourth; our relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Well, my brothers, if we must fight for one of these obligations, we will be even more liable under the command strength of all four; as you can clearly understand. If God grants victory to the impious because of my own sins, we will endanger our lives for our holy faith, which Christ gave us with his own blood. This is most important of all. Even if one gains the entire world but loses his soul in the process, what will be the benefit! Second, we will be deprived of such famous homeland and of our liberty. Third, our empire, renowned in the past but presently humbled, low and exhausted, will be ruled by a tyrant and an impious man. Fourth, we will be separated from our dearest children, wives and relatives.</p>
<p>This wretch of a Sultan has besieged our city up to now for fifty seven days with all his engines and strength; he has relaxed the blockade neither day nor night, but, by the grace of Christ, our Lord, who sees all things, the enemy has often been repelled, up to now, from our walls with shame and dishonour. Yet now too, my brothers, feel no cowardice, even if small parts of our fortifications have collapsed from the explosions and engine missiles, as you can see, we made all possible, necessary repairs. We are placing all hope in the irresistible glory of God. Some have faith in armament, others in cavalry, might and numbers but we believe in the name of our Lord, our God and Saviour, and second, in our arms and strength granted to us by divine power.</p>
<p>I know the countless hordes of the impious will advance against us, according to their custom, violently, confidently and with great courage and force in order to overwhelm and wear out our few defenders with hardship. They attempt to frighten us with loud yells and innumerable battle cries. But you are all familiar with their chattering and I need say no more about it. For a long time they will continue so and will also release over us countless rocks, all sorts of arrows and missiles, like the sand of the sea. But I hope that such things will not harm us; I see, greatly rejoice, and nourish with hopes in my mind that even if we are few, you are all experienced and seasoned warriors – courageous, brave, and well prepared. Protect your heads with shields in combat and battle. Keep your right hand, armed with the sword, extended in front of you at all times. Your helmets, breastplates and suits of armour are fully sufficient together with your other weapons and will prove very effective in battle. Our enemies have none and use no such weapons. You are protected inside the walls, while they will advance without cover and with toil.</p>
<p>For these reasons, my fellow soldiers, prepare yourselves, be firm, and remain valiant, for the pity of God. Take your example from the few elephants of the Carthaginians and how they dispersed the numerous cavalry of the Romans with their noise and appearance. If one dumb beast put another to flight, we, the masters of horses and animals, can surely even do better against our advancing enemies, since they are dumb animals, worse even than pigs. Present your shield, swords, arrows, and spears to them, imagining that you are a hunting party after wild boars, so that the impious may learn that they are dealing not with dumb animals but with their lords and masters, the descendants of the Greeks and the Romans.</p>
<p>You are well aware that this irreligious Sultan, the enemy of our holy faith, violated for no good reason the peace treaty we had with him and disregarded his numerous oaths without a second thought. Suddenly, he appeared and built his castle in the straights of Asomatosso so he might be able to inflict daily harm on us. Then he put our farms, gardens, parks, and houses to the torch, while he killed and enslaved as many of our Christian brothers as he found; he broke the treaty of friendship. He befriended the inhabitants of Galata, the wretches rejoice over this, as they are unaware of the parable of the farmer’s son who was roasting snails and said, ‘Oh stupid creature,’ etc.</p>
<p>Well my brothers, since he started the siege and the blockade, every day he opens his fathomless mouth and is seeking an opportunity to devour us and this city, which thrice-blessed Constantine the Great founded and dedicated to the all holy most chaste Mother of God, our lady, Mary the eternal virgin. She became the Queen of Cities, the shield and aid of our homeland, the shelter of Christians, the hope and joy of all wishes to destroy this city, which was once proud and blooming like a rose of the field.</p>
<p>I can tell you that this city mastered the entire universe; She placed beneath her feet Pontus, Armenia, Paphlagonia, The Amazonian lands, Cappadocia, Galatia, Media, Georgian Colchis, Bosphoros, Albania, Syria, Cilicia, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Palestine, Arabia, Judea, Bactria, Scythia, Macedonia, Thessaly, Boeotia, Locris, Aetolia, Arcarnania, Achaea, the Peloponnese, Epirus, Illyria, Lykhnites, the Adriatic, Italy, Tuscany, the Celts, and Galatian Celts, Spain up to Cadiz, Libya, Mauritania, Ethiopia, Beledes, Scude, Numidia, Africa and Egypt.</p>
<p>Now he wants to enslave her and throw the yoke upon the Mistress of Cities, our holy churches, where the Holy Trinity was worshiped, where the Holy Spirit was glorified in hymns, where angels were heard praising in chant the deity of and the incarnation of God’s word, he wants to turn into shrines of his blasphemy, shrines of the mad and false Prophet, Mohammed, as well as into stables for his horses and camels.</p>
<p>Consider then, my brothers and comrades in arms, how the commemoration of our death, our memory, fame and freedom can be rendered eternal.”

<h3 id="out-of-the-belly-of-hell-covid-19-and-the-humanisation-of-globalisation">&ldquo;Out of the Belly of Hell: COVID-19 and the humanisation of globalisation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-prod.opendemocracy.net/media/images/Screenshot_2020-05-20_at_12.35.40.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.png" alt="img">
The catastrophe that COVID-19 has visited on the US and UK is related to the nature of the economic ideology that both embraced, best known as ‘neoliberalism’ (I’ll say later why the term is important). Neoliberalism hollowed out the capacity of their public sectors, under-funding what it did not privatise. This created the conditions that led to the severity of the COVID-crisis for the White House and Downing Street.</p>
<p>But the underlying crisis they now confront is shared by market economies everywhere. All shut down or radically cut back up to a third of their economies and must now seek to recover, something no one expected or prepared for.</p>
<p>True to their neoliberal inheritance, the Anglo-American leaders tried hard to resist such measures. When policy towards the virus was debated in Downing Street at the “end of February&rsquo;&rsquo; it seems the government embraced the existing epidemic planning whose results were so “terrifying” when war-gamed in the 2016 Exercise Cygnus they were never published. The strategy, as presented by the Prime Minister&rsquo;s chief of staff Dominic Cummings, was summed up by a witness as, “Herd immunity, protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die, too bad”, according to the Sunday Times.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see the logic of this approach from a free-market perspective. The deaths would mostly be of the old and thus merely accelerate the termination of those of us who are anyway ‘a drain’ on social services. The less elderly victims tended to have underlying health issues, which would also eliminate costs for the NHS. A younger, fitter, cheaper population would be the outcome, preserving the economy from the punitive ‘panic’ measures of other countries. It&rsquo;s an approach implicit in Johnson&rsquo;s Greenwich speech about Britain transforming itself into Superman. But it was abandoned. Why?</p>
<p>The desire to support the economy at all costs visibly consumed Trump, who downplayed the virus at the start. Republican governors refused to ban meetings or close beaches. The party’s politicians and funders rage at restrictions. Two Trump supporters summed up their market-first approach, as Nick Paumgarten, noted in the New Yorker: Fox commentator, Glenn Beck, “I’d rather die than kill the country” and Dan Patrick, just elected as lieutenant governor of Texas, on grandparents dying for the economy: “If that’s the exchange, I’m all in”.</p>
<p>Such attitudes are characteristic of Trumpian economics with its hostility to regulation of any kind. His supporters are now pushing to open up the economy despite the deaths this will cause, especially as they believe the wealthy will be OK. But this attitude did not dominate policy making at the start.</p>
<p>China has an ageing population. What could be better than thinning it out? In 1958 over 30 million died thanks to the so-called Great Leap Forward, yet Mao never answered for it and the figures were covered up. The treatment of the Uighurs shows such ruthlessness has hardly been stilled. Why, then, did Xi and his Politburo decide the Chinese would not take the coronavirus ‘on the chin’ when Beijing’s system of party control and surveillance could have imposed this?</p>
<p>Part of the answer is that the cult of Xi’s personality and the party’s boasting of its success creates a tension within the obedience it demands. Despite the country’s immense size, when things go wrong the central authorities are held directly responsible with a ferocious anger. As the spread of infection and its mortal consequences developed in Wuhan it became clear that it could neither be covered up nor contained, given the city’s connectedness within China and with the world.</p>
<p>On 25 January, two days before the Chinese New Year, which sees the largest mass movement of people on the planet, after millions had already left Wuhan as rumours spread, the Politburo realised the days of the Great Leap Forward were over. What could once be imposed on the dispersed, immobile rural settlements of a fatalistic peasantry was not going to be tolerated by a connected metropolis. There is now something akin to public opinion.</p>
<p>In response, a country-wide lockdown was launched across China. Wuhan’s province was isolated, closing off 50 million people. Medical personnel were poured in as the precious growth targets, the key to the regime’s success, were abandoned.</p>
<p>The economy of the world’s most populous country has grown by an average of close to 10 per cent a year since 1979, an astonishing record. In the first quarter of 2020 it shrunk by over 6 per cent as the brakes were slammed on. So complete were the closures even pollution disappeared. The Politburo understood that its own life and legitimacy depended on it demonstrating that nothing mattered more to it than the lives of its people.</p>
<p>A similar reality shock confronted governments around the world. A hundred years ago, when perhaps 50 to 100 million died in the 1918-20 flu epidemic, governments were not blamed. In 1943 the British government did not feel responsible for the Bengal famine that took two million of its subject’s lives, continuing an official indifference to genocide that goes back to the Irish famine. The flu pandemic of 1968 is estimated to have killed 700,000 people, made little impact and is now forgotten.</p>
<p>Yet today, if governments were indifferent to such deaths, few would survive. Whether or not the politicians acted out of their own ethical conviction is beside the point. To slow down the loss of life, they shut down economies everywhere, neoliberalism be damned. The alternative was not publicly acceptable.</p>
<p>I am not saying they discarded capitalism. On the contrary they acted to try and ensure its survival. Neoliberalism was always only a variant of a shapeshifting economic system which has plenty of life in it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, an historic transformation has taken place. The measures taken, however reluctantly, misconceived, badly run and limited, have precipitated the sharpest recession in history, because governments felt obliged to try and give their peoples’ lives and health priority over financial interests.</p>
<p>For this to have happened three changes were necessary. Governments had to be seen by the public as having responsibility for the economy. People had to expect their governments to ensure the availability of health services, including modern hospital support for all citizens whose lives are in danger. The public had to have a relatively clear idea of what is happening that governments cannot suppress. Together these changes have upturned the nature of politics around the world.</p>
<p>The first politician to recognise the moment’s “anthropological” significance was France’s president Emmanuel Macron. An exponent of globalisation and neoliberalism and one time banker he had sought to impose marketisation on his reluctant country.</p>
<p>In March, he told the Financial Times, the impact of COVID-19 “makes us refocus on the human aspect. It becomes clear that the economy no longer has primacy. When it comes to our humanity, women and men, but also the ecosystems in which they live, and therefore the emissions of CO2, global warming, biodiversity, there is something more important than the economic order.” To emphasise the shock of this he did not draw back from describing what was happening. “We are going to nationalise the wages and the profit and loss accounts of almost all our businesses. That’s what we’re doing. All our economies, including the most liberal are doing that. It’s against all the dogmas, but that’s the way it is.”</p>
<p>By “dogmas” he means neoliberalism. When he says “the economy no longer has primacy”, he means that what he, and all other leaders of our era believed in at the start of the year, just like the rest of us, no longer holds.</p>
<p>How should we evaluate Macron’s words? He gave the interview in part to pursue his call for bonds to mutualise the costs of the pandemic for Eurozone members. Without this, he warned, the currency will fold. “I believe [the EU] is a political project. If it’s a political project, the human factor is the priority…”.</p>
<p>Macron is widely patronised as a blow-in who struck lucky when France had a poor choice of presidential candidates. Traditional political leaders spend half a lifetime manoeuvering and calibrate their statements to make them acceptable to their constituencies. Macron’s lack of such a past is also a strength, the lightness of his political hinterland makes frankness possible, indeed it may be his special asset. Few other right-wing politicians would dare to say they have just nationalised their country&rsquo;s wages and business accounts. But the French president is simply reporting on the astonishing decisions he and others have all had to take.</p>
<p>What he is reporting is that the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated an ideological breakdown. Breakdowns are not the same as death or revolutions. You can recover and be strengthened by the experience or just go back to how you were. You can recover and be changed by it. Or you may be altered fundamentally for good or ill. The outcome is decided afterwards and has to be achieved, it is never inherent in the crisis. And the outcome in this case could hardly be more important as it is a breakdown in globalisation itself. The pandemic has revealed an incompatibility between the economic market “dogma” that claimed to shape the wealth creation of the world, and an expectation of the right to life that, it turned out, accompanied its growth.</p>
<p>If you look at the way globalisation has been talked and written about across the media over past decades you would not have guessed this was likely or even possible. Four notions stand out: that globalisation is inhuman, is singular, is inevitable and is economic – based on trade, supply lines and international finance.</p>
<p>Above all, it appears to be something done to us. It may be driven by human agency yet it is experienced as a process we can do nothing about. UN and non-government organisations seek to shape, limit and mitigate its consequences. But they are like a Greek chorus of helpless onlookers unable to orchestrate the drama.</p>
<p>The most alarming example of this is the vast international effort to track, measure, double-check and predict the looming climate catastrophe, contrasted with the persistent failure to take emergency measures to prevent it. The Davos elite bathes in its own power but pleads incapacity when it comes to taking responsibility as the planet burns.</p>
<p>Supporters of globalisation encouraged fatalism and powerlessness. A striking example was when the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair told the Labour Party Conference in 2005, “I hear people say we have to stop and debate globalisation. You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer”. That was the year Thomas Friedman published the best-selling The World is Flat and it was fashionable to believe the human planet was being turned into a socio-economic singularity, thanks to the growth of a world-wide system of trade, finance, migration and communication, driven initially by states, then by corporations and finally by finance and cyberspace. It was supposed to lead inexorably to representative democracy and the rule of law overseen by a liberal elite.</p>
<p>We cannot understand what is going on if our minds are gripped by such nonsense. The essential starting point to grasp is that all talk of globalisation misleads if it projects the idea of a simplification or homogenisation. Progress – and we are living in an epoch of immense technological and productive progress – generates complexity and diversity not uniformity. The internet intensifies local communication. The forging of a shared environment assists the development of difference. Richness, contrasts and paradox are the companions of shared regulation and security. As communication multiplies, variety blooms and decentralisation becomes more effective, not less.</p>
<p>Not only does globalisation generate differences, it is driven by them, especially the imperative of ‘catching up’. Studies of nationalism show that it has been the vehicle for industrialisation and modernisation, not an impediment to them. Far from this being something we cannot debate, it demands arguments and experiments.</p>
<p>Most important of all, globalisation is by no means limited to the economy. Yes, it encompasses the ways in which the world goes about its business within and between nations. But it is also the processes by which we inhabit the world as a whole, including our media and communications; it affects how we eat and drink, and the way we relate to and experience ourselves and our health as a species, something the Coronavirus has literally brought home to us.</p>
<p>Accompanying and related to the inhuman progress of the market, with all its insecurities, booms, busts, precariousness and refusal of responsibility, there has been a parallel process of humanisation. This is not a term I’d have used before COVID-19. Back then, in 2019, ’humanisation’ would have sounded too feeble and soft to describe the direction the world might be taking. But the virus has shown us that our species-nature is a hard and serious priority.</p>
<p>Today the human consequences of globalisation are part of our experience as well as knowledge. People everywhere feel we share the same planet earth at the same time as each other. It does not follow we share an identical response, on the contrary. Nonetheless, there is no longer any society on earth where the experience of being part of contemporary world history is excluded from everyday life.</p>
<p>A simple way to assess this is to compare 1950 to today, a period well within my lifetime (I was born in 1942). In the mid-twentieth century an estimated 51%, that is to say half of the world’s population, had no formal education, most women were illiterate, most people lived on the land and most of today’s countries were colonies. Today, nearly two-thirds of us have mobile phones, most of us live in cities or towns, there are almost more nations than we can count and the fact that 10 percent of us have no basic education is regarded as shocking.</p>
<p>This is an economic, social and political revolution. An immense improvement in the standard of life has created a generalised capacity to become citizens everywhere. The masters of globalisation did everything possible to debilitate popular agency. They have generated slums and urban poverty and hard drug addiction on an unspeakable scale, but sweeping educational, sanitary and technological transformations have laid the basis for people to become fully human and this has blown away neoliberalism.

<h3 id="a-prayer-for-my-father">&ldquo;A Prayer for My Father&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.algemeiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1024px-Jerusalem_Mount_of_Olives_BW_2010-09-20_07-57-31.jpg" alt="img">
This is the eulogy that Rabbi Shmuley Boteach delivered on May 27, 2020, for his father, Yoav Botach, on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem at a funeral service over which he presided.</p>
<p>It was nearly 26 years ago, also on a summer day, that my father called me from here in Israel to tell me the impossible news that the Lubavitcher Rebbe had died. I was living in Oxford, England at the time, serving as rabbi to the students, and was meant to travel to Israel that very day to visit my father in Jerusalem. The news shocked me to my core. The Rebbe was larger than life. He was going to usher in a messianic era. He could not die.</p>
<p>My plans for Israel changed immediately as I traveled in the opposite direction for the Rebbe’s funeral in New York.</p>
<p>And now, more than a quarter of a century later, I have traveled in the right direction, to the Jewish homeland, but for another impossibly sad occasion, the funeral of my own father.</p>
<p>Related coverage Should Israel Ignore Rising Coronavirus Rates? JNS.org - The reopening of the Israeli economy after nearly two months of COVID-19 closures was bound to lead to&hellip;</p>
<p>And as with the Rebbe, I never believed this day would come.</p>
<p>My father too was larger than life. Always the most charismatic personality in the room, he was a force of nature, a magnet that drew everything to him, a planet that forced all that surrounded him into his orbit. He could neither be avoided nor ignored. Even as his health deteriorated over the last few months, his broken body always fought back and rallied in a way that had agnostic doctors using the words “miracle.” Even when the hospital told us on several occasions — including at the Passover seder — that we had to say goodbye as he had hours to live, he always miraculously pulled through. Sickness and illness could never defeat him.</p>
<p>My father was a giant of a man, a business titan who bestrode the streets of Los Angeles like a colossus, a real estate genius with the charisma and good looks of a Hollywood star. My friend Kevin, writing from Australia, summed it up best: Yoav was a legend.</p>
<p>His struggle never to quit and always prevail was his defining characteristic. Born in abject poverty as the second child in a family of 13 in Iran in 1932, he was selling carpets and fabrics in the markets of Isfahan — the ancient Persian capital — from the age of ten to help support his brothers and sisters. And reaching out to aid his many siblings in every way possible would be an act he would continue for the rest of his life, along with charitable acts to complete strangers who approached him in dire straits.</p>
<p>He had only minimal schooling and was proud that he spent most of it not reading books but fighting antisemitic Muslim teachers and pupils and organizing the Jewish children in Isfahan into street fighters. At a Friday night Shabbat dinner that I spent alone with him when I was 14 and living in a Los Angeles yeshiva dorm, he regaled me with tales of the non-stop Jewish wars in Iran and proudly moved my hands over the battle scars in his scalp that proved it. “Feel here, under my hair, at the holes I still have from rocks that nearly cracked my skull,” he said with a huge grin. He would later show my children the same wounds. “They tried to break me with sticks and rocks,” he said, “but I’m the one who always beat them up.”</p>
<p>He was a Jewish lion, a mighty warrior, a living incarnation of his namesake, King David’s general-in-chief Yoav, instilling fear in all who would do harm to his people. He oozed Jewish pride from every pore of his being. My friend David Suissa, who edits Los Angeles’ Jewish Journal and was of the last non-family members to visit my father in the hospital, told me after he met him for the first time, “Your dad is the original Mesopotamian man. He has a powerful, leathery hand.” And yesterday my former student at Oxford and now Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, summed up my father beautifully in a text: “He was a heroic figure to me and I saw such a fire and a love in him. His memory is such a blessing to our city of Angels and to this world.”</p>
<p>This defiance of standing up, of being a proud Jew, ready to battle our people’s foes in every arena, constituted my father’s irreducible essence. Rarely has a man stood so straight. Rarely has a person walked so tall. Rarely has a Jew born in a Muslim country carried himself with such utter disregard for his hostile surroundings. To say that my father could not give a damn what anyone thought of him is to offer an unimpressive understatement. Once, when we flew together from Los Angeles to Miami for a grandson’s bris, he pulled out a cooked duck with his bare hands and tore it apart, offering me a leg dripping in grease, oblivious to an entire plane staring at him. And why would he care? If they could not appreciate that a Jew only eats kosher, and if the airline forgot to board the meals we ordered, that was their problem.</p>
<p>My grandfather Ezra, an ardent Zionist, moved his large brood to Israel where my father spent his late teenage years and met my mother Eleanor when she, as a young American tourist, asked a handsome local for the city’s best falafel in Beersheva. They married and began a family in Israel where my sister Sara was born, and, a few years later, moved to my mother’s native New York, where Bar Kochva was born, and to Los Angeles thereafter, where the twins, Chaim Moishe and Ateret, and then me, the youngest, followed.</p>
<p>My father arrived in America not speaking a word of English. He was sometimes looked down upon and degraded, with his dark, Middle Eastern complexion and the broken English of an immigrant.</p>
<p>That he would go on to build a large business and out-maneuver those with the impeccable college degrees he lacked should surprise no one. Few were as dedicated. Few worked harder. Few were as sharp.</p>
<p>My father rose at the crack of dawn each and every morning until he was felled by a catastrophic stroke last December on the night before Hanukkah. And over the next five months he waged a ferocious battle for life that electrified and astonished all who witnessed it.</p>
<p>He would often tell me stories of his work ethic. He drove from Los Angeles to the various swap meets and flea markets to feed his family. “I was so tired, I took the scissors that I used to cut the fabrics because I was falling asleep at the wheel. I started to poke my legs until blood flowed. But,” he said with his eyes open wide as saucers, “I didn’t miss the market.”</p>
<p>He never missed synagogue on any morning, either. In his last years, he would drag his broken frame day after day at 5 am and put on his tefillin, eschewing the help of other worshipers that in his later years he was finally forced to accept.</p>
<p>He believed in strength. He never showed weakness. After his first stroke nearly a decade ago, he would become visibly upset at me or any of my siblings as he pushed his walker to shul. I would bend to help dislodge it from a crack in the sidewalk or the roots of a tree. I would put my arm out to help him climb the stairs. He would never accept. It might take three times as long, but he would get to the top on his own. He had made his way through life on his own two feet, and his struggle to survive became symbolically solitary in the last weeks as the COVID-19 pandemic closed the hospitals to visitors and we children who were at his side were reduced to watching him on an IPad until he came home to my sisters’ care for a final 10 days.</p>
<p>Death to him was a curse, an aberration never to be discussed, an unacceptable tear in the glorious tapestry of nature — “the green” as he called it — whose pristine beauty he loved so much. In his hospital bed at Cedars-Sinai, he would hold my hand so utterly tight. He held on for life itself as he entered his final battle, attended with unequaled care by my sisters Sara and Ateret, who never left his side, my brother Bar Kochva, and my brother Chaim who crossed the country from Miami constantly to visit his sick father in LA.</p>
<p>I was moved to my core when, on the last Shabbat that we spent together, he struggled in semi-consciousness to move his unresponsive body and even to breathe. He grabbed my hand, first with his almost useless left arm, and then, moving his entire frame, with his right hand as well, as he seized me with a ferocious grip. My wife Debbie stood by watching with tears in her eyes as I sang to him the melodies of Havdalah that he so loved.</p>
<p>He adored Debbie ever since I brought her from Australia to obtain his blessing for our marriage 32 years ago. Characteristically, he stared her down. “Where do you want to live?” Debbie, not missing a beat, replied, “Wherever Shmuley wants to live.” And he lit up like a Hanukkah menorah as Debbie passed his test. “Uuuhooo,” he laughed, giving us his blessing, knowing that he had successfully teased this Ashkenazi woman about being the perfect Persian wife!</p>
<p>Such displays of love and tenderness were not foreign. My father had tremendous sensitivity to those in need. At the end of a long summer fast day in Los Angeles, when I was driving home from synagogue with him to eat our meal, we saw a confused, elderly woman in the middle of the street, nearly killed by passing cars. My father picked her up, saw the address of her nursing home, and drove her there, all while his famished teenage son prayed to himself that he would just leave her so we could eat. The owner of the nursing home told my father to butt out. “It’s none of your business.” “NONE OF MY BUSINESS?” my father hollered. “If ever I come back and see this woman in danger, I will teach you a lesson about respecting the elderly that you will never forget.”</p>
<p>My father loved music and loved to sing. Every Friday night he raised his voice to God like an ancient Hebrew prophet. He made the words of the Bible come to life and elongated the pronouncement of every syllable, doing impossible musical somersaults with his vocal chords.</p>
<p>Shabbat was especially dear to him. He loved going to synagogue and loved having his children and grandchildren around him singing at the Sabbath table. At family celebrations, he would suddenly stand in the middle of the guests and cry out in lyrical praise to the Creator. As I was conducting my daughter Shaina’s wedding, he rose under the chupa, in the middle of the ceremony, and began to sing the eternal words of the prophet Isaiah: “And Kings and queens will serve you and care for all your needs. They will bow to the earth before you and lick the dust from your feet. Then you will know that I am the Lord. Those who trust in me will never be put to shame.” As he did so he swung his hips into a Middle Eastern belly dance, scandalizing the serious, black-clad, Hasidic crowd who looked at him in shock. He gave a mischievous laugh and twisted his waist again. He loved every minute of it. And so did I.</p>
<p>When hundreds of thousands of Iranian Jews began fleeing Khomeini’s brutal regime in 1979, my father was already an established Los Angeles business figure. He saw it as providential that he had come to LA some 15 years earlier so that he could assist so many Iranian refugees and get them back on their feet. He became a patriarch to the Iranian Jewish community and is respected as such till today. In about 1980, I was with him in downtown Los Angeles when he took an Iranian immigrant to a meeting to try and help him close on a business. My father told the cynical American owner who listened halfheartedly to the refugee’s business pitch, “He may have nothing now, but in Iran this man had a huge business. Big. Like an elephant!” almost screaming the last word as he so hated seeing people’s dignity compromised.</p>
<p>A man as large as my father was never going to be a saint and would have been a bore had he not also possessed the flaws that accompany men of Biblical proportions. He could be stubborn, uncompromising, and, as a son who loved him and always sought his approval, at times distant. After my parents’ divorce, I grew up on the other side of America and missed him every moment. When he visited he could see my pain and I once heard him tell his brother Shlomo that he thought that I, as the family’s youngest, was especially wounded by the divorce. And that is how I felt too.</p>
<p>Which is why no global pandemic, no worldwide malady, was ever going to stop me or my beloved siblings — Sara, Ateret, and Chaim Moishe — who are here with me, from burying our father in the city that he loved so much, Jerusalem, and where he wished to live in his last years, as did his mother, Eshrat, to whom he was especially devoted. And we are joined today by my children Chana and Mendy, who also made the trip from the United States during the pandemic, and my nephew Aaron, all three of whom my father took such pride in as they served as soldiers in the IDF.</p>
<p>It would be the will of God that my father would not ultimately inhabit the home that he bought at the foot of the Old City. But interred now here as he is at Judaism’s holiest burial site on the Mount of Olives, just steps away from his great hero Menachem Begin, and the founder of the modern Hebrew tongue, Eliezer Ben Yehuda, my father has finally come home.</p>
<p>He will now be, as Jewish tradition maintains, the first to greet the Messiah and the first to rise in the resurrection of the dead.</p>
<p>In the same way that my father always kept his faithfulness to God, I know that the Creator will likewise fulfill his promise to his people, spoken through Isaiah, that in the end of days “Death shall be swallowed forever,” and through Daniel, that “Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will wake again.”</p>
<p>And at that time I will be reunited with my Rebbe and with my father, both of whom died on a Saturday night just as the holy Sabbath went out, making a world without them a little bit darker, and a world into which they will eventually reawaken shine with particles of everlasting light.</p>
