<p>Teen Mom 2 star Kailyn Lowry has officially achieved cool mom status for letting her 10-year old son Isaac Elliot Rivera dye his hair red.</p>
<p>‚ÄòTeen Mom 2‚Äô Star Kailyn Lowry‚Äôs Dating History: From Jo Rivera to Chris Lopez</p>
<p>The pregnant 28-year-old A Letter of Love author snapped a mirror pic from Delaware-based salon GEM Beauty Co. on Wednesday, June 17. In the pic, her son sits in a salon chair rocking freshly dyed bright-red hair.</p>
<p>Mom stands above him wearing a face mask with her hair styled in intricate braids that flow into loose curls.</p>

<p>One of Lowry‚Äôs 3.8 million Instagram followers couldn‚Äôt help but ask about her ex and Isaac‚Äôs dad, Jo Rivera. ‚ÄúAwh how cute! Good for him! What does jo think ü§£‚Äù the fan asked.</p>
<p>Lowry replied to the fan, ‚Äútexted a pic and he said Isaac looks badass!‚Äù</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania native made her reality TV debut in 2010 while she and Rivera were expecting Isaac. They welcomed their first son into the world in January of that same year, but their relationship didn‚Äôt last.</p>
<p>She went on to star on Teen Mom 2 and began dating Jordan Wenner, before Rivera controversially got involved in her life again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor the first time since I found out I was pregnant, we were getting along smoothly. Because we had never learned how to be friends, we fell back into old habits and I cheated on Jordan with Jo,‚Äù she wrote in her 204 book Pride Over Pity.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven though I was deeply in love with Jordan, I selfishly wanted Jo to remain single. I had typical girl syndrome: I didn‚Äôt want Jo, but I also didn‚Äôt want anyone else to be with him. One night, after he dropped Isaac off, we slept together.‚Äù</p>

<p>Lowry has welcomed two more children since Isaac. She shares Lincoln, 6, with ex-husband Javi Marroquin and Lux, 2, with ex Chris Lopez. She‚Äôs now expecting her second child with Lopez, as announced on February 4.</p>

The incident happened when Lowry was having a conversation with Rivera about how he has their son&rsquo;s haircut and the clothes he dresses him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he goes over there, you have him dress a certain way; you have him look a certain way; you have his hair cut a certain way, and that&rsquo;s not who he is,&rdquo; she says to Rivera in the clip. &ldquo;I think you forget about the fact that he&rsquo;s half-white and he&rsquo;s half-Hispanic. I feel like you dress him in a stereotypical way and I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rivera responds by saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what your description of how I dress him is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dress him like a thug!&rdquo; Lowry snaps back at him.

Kailyn Lowry is getting ready to welcome her fourth child, recently reaching the 33rd week of her pregnancy.</p>
<p>But the Teen Mom 2 star is keeping busy with her three sons, as they quarantine at home in Delaware.</p>

<p>The Letter of Love author also corrected an Instagram troll back in March, responding: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have 4 baby daddies though.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She also told Us Weekly back in October of 2018: &lsquo;In my book [A Letter of Love], I said that Lux will probably be my last child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would definitely have more, but I also know that my life isn‚Äôt really set up for another right now. Ideally I would have liked Chris to be the father of my next child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the exes have recently been feuding, and she appeared to shade him this week on the Shae &amp; Diam YouTube, when she was asked: &lsquo;Would you rather spend one night with your most-hated ex or live on the streets for a week?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kailyn responded: &lsquo;No, live on the streets for a week. I don‚Äôt hate any of [my exes], just one. Maybe two. One girl and one guy. I hate them. Hate is a strong word‚Ä¶ dislike. Am annoyed by.&rsquo;

<p>One user wrote: &ldquo;This is why she&rsquo;s the worst and deserves to be dragged. &lsquo;I think you forget who he is, he&rsquo;s half white and he&rsquo;s half Hispanic&rsquo;. However the way his HISPANIC father dresses him is wrong and stereotypical so obviously the white side matters more.

<p>A separate thread showing a 2015 &ldquo;All lives matter&rdquo; tweet from the Delaware-based star then sparked mixed reviews, with some dubbing Kailyn racist ‚Äì Kailyn has made no statements on her Instagram regarding the Reddit activity, however the account ‚Äì followed by 3.8 million ‚Äì did go dark for #BlackoutTuesday.

The Tv star Kailyn Lowry is in the limelight again with her recent affair. The actress starred in the reality show Teen Mom 2.</p>
<p>Other than being a TV star, she happens to be an author as well. She wrote her first book, ‚ÄòPride over Pity‚Äô in 2014. Her second book was launched in 2016. It is titled ‚ÄòHustle and Heart.‚Äô The third book, which was an apology to her children, is called ‚Äò A Letter of Love.‚Äô It was published in 2018. Moreover, she wrote a children‚Äôs book as well known as Love is Bubblegum in 2015</p>
<p>The mother of three has a long list of ex-lovers. Let us have a look at them.</p>
<p>Kailyn‚Äôs Relationship timeline</p>
<p>In September 2012, she was wedded to Javi Marroquin. They had a son Lincoln. But they soon get divorced in December 2015. Not they jointly share Lincoln‚Äôs custody. However, she had her first son Isaac Elliott Rivera back in 2018 with her ex-beau, Jonathan Rivera.</p>
<p>In her podcast in 2017, she apparently said that she is dating someone from the same gender. The paparazzi speculated it is Dominique Potter as both were seen too frequently on each other‚Äôs social media. You can see for yourself, Potter‚Äôs social media account is filled with their pictures.</p>
<p>However, this was not the first time when Kailyn was rumored to be in a homosexual relationship. She was seen kissing Becky Hayter at a Pride event in 2016. But, in the following month, Lowry announced that they were just friends.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Lowry and her friend Chris Lopez became a thing. Lowry‚Äôs youngest kid Lux Russell Lowry is the son of Lopez.</p>
<p>Even more shocking news is that she announced in February 2020 about her fourth pregnancy.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs her current status?</p>
<p>As per the rumors, she is currently single. However, she has been sighted with his past fling, Malik. But it is still unclear.</p>
<p>It in the air that Chris is the daddy of the upcoming kid. But, Chris is not even bothered by her relationship with Malik.</p>
<p>With so much hype about her new kid, it is unclear whether they are dating or not.

<p>Kailyn Lowry Claps Back at Critics Who Ask &lsquo;Why 4 Kids?': &lsquo;Mind Your Business&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kailyn Lowry wants haters to &ldquo;mind your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a video shared on TikTok this week, the Teen Mom 2 star, 27, clapped back at critics, who slammed her for her number of children.</p>
<p>Get push notifications with news, features and more.</p>
<p>In the clip, Lowry shares some questions fans have asked her including: &ldquo;Why 4 kids?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do you know what birth control is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fans also questioned her by saying, &ldquo;Are you gonna try for a girl?&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;Do you want any more?&quot;, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you tired&rdquo; and &ldquo;Will you have another baby dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response, Lowry simply shrugged as Supa Dupa Humble rapped &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; from his song &ldquo;Steppin&rdquo; in the background.</p>
<p>Lowry further shut down critics by writing, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask y&rsquo;all to babysit so mind your business&rdquo; over the clip.</p>
<p>Lowry announced in February that she is expecting a baby boy with Chris Lopez.</p>
<p>For the reveal, Lowry and her three sons ‚Äî Isaac, 10, Lincoln, 6, and Lux Russell, 2 ‚Äî helped pull handheld confetti cannons that were filled with blue confetti. (Lowry shares Isaac with ex Jo Rivera; Lincoln with ex Javi Marroquin; and Lux with Lopez.)</p>
<p>Lowry told E! News that although she‚Äôs ‚Äúnever found out the sex of the baby before the birth,‚Äù she is ‚Äúso excited, there‚Äôs just something so special about a mother and her sons.‚Äù According to the website, Lowry is due in July.</p>

<p>Lowry opened up about her latest pregnancy shortly after her announcement, sharing with her followers that she&rsquo;s been feeling a bit &ldquo;weird&rdquo; lately despite the fact that this her fourth time having a baby boy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThings have been so different this time around ‚Äì it‚Äôs weird knowing the sex of this baby &amp; trying to solidify a name so he doesn‚Äôt go nameless like Lux did ? + my anxiety is through the roof,‚Äù she wrote alongside a picture of her holding several ultrasound photos of her baby.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Lowry celebrated making it to her third trimester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby boy &amp; and I are coming up on 29 weeks &amp; so thankful to be in our third trimester! He still doesn&rsquo;t have a name, but this is the chaos, it&rsquo;s how we do things,&rdquo; Lowry shared in the caption of an Instagram post that showed her cradling her bump.</p>
<p>Lowry also revealed that her unborn baby is &ldquo;currently breech, so hopefully he decides to turn soon, because we&rsquo;re running out of room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s moving a lot these days and likes to keep me up at night,&rdquo; Lowry said.
