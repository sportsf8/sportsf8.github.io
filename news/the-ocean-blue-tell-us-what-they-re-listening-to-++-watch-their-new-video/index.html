<p>The Ocean Blue released Kings and Queens / Knaves and Thieves last year, and it’s another fine record in their 30-year catalogue of shimmering dreampop. They’ve released a new single from the record, just in time for Valentine’s Day, “Love Doesn’t Make It Easy On Us” which features vocals from Allison LaBonne (The Owls) and Charlotte Crabtree (The Jim Ruiz Set). We’ve got the premiere of its video which you can watch below.</p>
<p>The band have a few tour dates coming up, including a Brooklyn show at The Bell House on February 28 with Toronto band Tallies, who are definitely cut from the same cloth as The Ocean Blue, and Brooklyn vets Dinowalrus. They’ve also got shows on the horizon in Phoenix, Atlanta, West Palm Beach and Nashville. All dates are listed below.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we asked The Ocean Blue’s David Schelzel, Peter Anderson, and Oed Ronne what they’ve been listening to on the tour bus and elsewhere, and their list includes a mix of new and old, including Low, Swedish indiepop cult heroes Eggstone, Night Moves, The Innocence Mission, and more. Check out the whole list, along with commentary for each, below.</p>

<p>Kings and Queens / Knaves and Thieves by THE OCEAN BLUE</p>
<p>The Ocean Blue – “What We’re Listening To” (David, Peter and Oed)</p>
<p>Night Moves – Can You Really Find Me</p>
<p>This is my most listened to record of the last 6 months. It creates a mood for me that is so reminiscent of listening to mid 70’s radio stations as a kid. The same feeling I would get when a cool Al Stewart or Gary Wright song came on. It’s pop music, but with intriguing, enveloping production. The songs arc, but you never lose the feeling that you’re cruising. [Peter]</p>
<p>Can You Really Find Me by Night Moves</p>
<p>Cigarettes After Sex</p>
<p>I like the new album but I’m really in love with the previous releases. Tracks like “Nothing’s Gonna Hurt You Baby”, “K,” “Apocalypse.” I don’t really know what dream pop is but their stuff is dreamy, otherworldly, and romantic. Yes, sexy. [David]</p>

<p>Low – Double Negative</p>
<p>A favorite record by one of my favorite bands. [One of our favorites too – Ed] Been out awhile now but still discovering new depths to this record. Perfect for a Minnesota winter. Or a turbulent life. [David]</p>
<p>Double Negative by Low</p>
<p>Typsy Panthre – Hell</p>
<p>My friend Allison LaBonne and John Crozier released a pop masterpiece this past year. Sophisticated, contemplative, well-crafted, beguiling pop tunes. Also for Francophiles. [David]</p>
<p>Hell by Typsy Panthre</p>
<p>The Innocence Mission – See You Tomorrow</p>
<p>Hard to be objective about your dear friends, but when they make music this beautiful, it’s a non-issue. As observed, “They are the unheralded masters of folk… wrest beauty and grace out of thin air”. [David]</p>
<p>see you tomorrow by the innocence mission</p>
<p>Eggstone – “April and May”</p>
<p>I have been a huge fan of this band for decades. ‘April and May’ is a pure, cosmopolitan pop song. Just when you think the song is going a certain direction, they pivot and inject these crazy, energetic vibes with an odd time signature phrasing. Rumor has it they are back, and I hope this time they come back to rule the world. [Oed]</p>

<p>Matt Wilson and His Orchestra – “Real Life”</p>
<p>I’m eagerly awaiting the new record by Matt Wilson and His Orchestra, due out soon. I think I probably saw just about every Trip Shakespeare show in Chicago in the late 80s/early 90s, but I’ve lost track of what Matt has been up to in recent years. ‘Real Life’ has a very chamber feel, showcasing harp and Matt’s beautiful voice. It reminds me a little of Colin Blundstone’s solo stuff from the 70s. [Oed]</p>

<p>Bruce Kaphan – “Clouds”</p>
<p>Bruce is a masterful pedal steel player, formerly of the great American Music Club, but in recent years has been making beautiful, wide, meditative instrumentals like ‘Clouds.’ [Oed]</p>
