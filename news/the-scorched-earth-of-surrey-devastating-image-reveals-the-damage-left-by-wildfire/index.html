<p>Scorched and charred, this is the devastation left by a ravaging wildfire that stopped play at a prestigious golf course.</p>
<p>Around 140 acres of Chobham Common, Surrey, went up in flames after the fire broke out on Friday, forcing 100 residents to flee their homes.</p>
<p>The fire raced towards the fringes of Wentworth Golf Course, forcing the cancellation of the Rose Ladies Series event.</p>
<p>Despite largely bringing the fire under control, authorities fear another week of blistering heat could allow it to take hold again.</p>
<p>Firefighters yesterday continued to tackle the Surrey wildfire that has destroyed 150 acres of countryside around Britain&rsquo;s &lsquo;Beverly Hills&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Residents of Britain&rsquo;s &lsquo;Beverley Hills&rsquo; faced a weekend away from their £2million mansions as fire crews battled a wildfire in Chobham Common, Surrey</p>
<p>Firefighters from Surrey, West Sussex, Berkshire and Hampshire rescue services battled a huge wildfire in Surrey after more than 100 people were evacuated from 60 gated properties on Heather Drive on Friday due to plumes of smoke in the air</p>

<p>Owners of sixty gated properties were evacuated from their homes on Friday after the huge wildfire swept across the area.</p>
<p>Despite the £2million properties not being under immediate threat, owners were asked to stay away due to plumes of smoke in the air.</p>
<p>It is understood the owners have been staying with family and friends, though some were spotted popping back to their properties to collect essentials this weekend.</p>
<p>They described the huge wildfire, which has destroyed 150 acres of countryside, as &lsquo;quite something&rsquo; and said Heather Drive is a &lsquo;ghost town&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Earlier this morning, Surrey Fire and Rescue service said crews made &lsquo;significant progress&rsquo; overnight with the &lsquo;cooling air temperatures&rsquo; and are now focusing on &lsquo;damping down and tackling hot spots&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Surrey County Council said that a &lsquo;large number of resources remain on the scene&rsquo;, nearly 48 hours after the fire started.</p>
<p>It said: &lsquo;At this time the fire service are focusing on damping down and tackling hot spots across the common although with the weather forecasted to be hot and dry through the day this is very much still an active incident.</p>
<p>Chobham Common should be avoided by members of the public for their own safety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the height of the wildfire, it required more than 40 vehicles including fire engines, specialist units and 4x4s.</p>
<p>The flames also spread to Wentworth golf course, halting play in the Rose Ladies Series Grand Final on Friday.</p>

<p>Surrey Fire and Rescue Service called in reinforcements from West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service and Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service after declaring the blaze a &lsquo;major incident&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surrey council have urged members of the public to avoid Chobham Common &lsquo;for their own safety&rsquo;. The huge wildlife also spread to Wentworth golf course</p>
<p>At the height of the wildfire, it required more than 40 vehicles including fire engines, specialist units and 4x4s, with huge plumes of smoke leading to the evacuation of Heather Drive residents</p>
<p>Surrey Fire and Rescue Service told MailOnline no other properties have so far been evacuated while on Saturday they sent 25 vehicles to tackle the blaze for the second day</p>
<p>Surrey Fire and Rescue Service called in reinforcements from West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service and Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service yesterday after declaring the blaze, which started on Chobham Common on Friday, a &lsquo;major incident&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On Friday, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service sent 40 fire engines including two water carriers to put out the huge blaze, which could be seen 20 miles away in west London and from the Shard in the city centre.</p>
<p>The embattled fire service declared the fire a &lsquo;major incident&rsquo; while several road closures remain in place - including Windsor Road from Titlarks Hill to Chertsey Road (B386) and part of Chertsey Road.</p>
<p>Runnymede Council has told the public to keep clear of Chobham Common and surrounding areas, while Wentworth Golf Club cancelled its Rose Ladies Series Grand Final on Friday.</p>
<p>Rich residents were spotted popping back to Heather Drive (pictured) to collect essentials</p>
<p>In a joint statement released on Saturday evening, Surrey Police and Surrey Fire and Rescue Service said: &lsquo;Following discussions between partners a number of properties have had to be evacuated due to safety reasons and at this time it is not safe for those residents to return to their homes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A number of local roads remain closed and we&rsquo;re also asking people to avoid the area.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The forces believe it is still too early to say what caused the fire but added that &lsquo;the extreme temperatures across the county have no doubt had an impact&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They also asked people to avoid lighting bonfires or using disposable barbecues to stop any similar incidents.</p>
<p>On Friday, Surrey Fire and Rescue Service said an estimated 120 people were evacuated from their homes in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.</p>
<p>The fire service said at the time: &lsquo;It is still a significant fire and it is still likely to be going on for some time. [It is] not helped by the heat and the wind direction keeps moving which is causing some trouble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are around 60 properties that have been evacuated, about 120 people, they are all in Windsor and Maidenhead, Berkshire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surrey Fire and Rescue Service said on Saturday: &lsquo;Crews remain on scene at the fire on Chobham Common which spread to around 150 acres at its peak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Overnight the cooling temperatures and hard work of crews contained the spread but we&rsquo;re expecting firefighters to be on scene through the day. Please avoid the area for your own safety.</p>
<p>They added: &lsquo;A number of roads in the area remain closed and some properties were evacuated. Residents that were evacuated should not return to their homes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surrey Fire and Rescue Service tweeted: &lsquo;The Fire Severity is currently at level 4. Meaning the risk of wildfires &amp; rapid spread of fire can occur. Please take extra care if your (sic) out in the forestry/park areas. Please do not use disposable BBQs and ensure smoking materials are fully extinguished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fire service told MailOnline the cause of the blaze is being investigated, but added that the weather and mini-heatwave which has seen temperatures soar to nearly 100F played a role.</p>
<p>Rich residents were spotted popping back to their million pound properties to collect essentials before heading to stay with friends and family after being told the fire was &lsquo;still smouldering&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Alistair Lines, a 64-year-old nearby resident, told MailOnline: &lsquo;Fires in Chobham Common have been quite regular over the years, but I have never seen it so close to the houses. It is only about 100m from the fire to someone&rsquo;s expensive garden, normally the fires are right over the other side nearing the M3.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was brought up on this road when it was just a three bedroom home but now this road is like millionaires row. I would have been worried last night if I lived in one of these massive houses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fire is bigger than I&rsquo;ve ever seen, it&rsquo;s quite something.</p>
<p>Homeowners are now being told not to go home as firefighters prepare for a second day of battle with the fire which began on Chobham Common</p>
<p>&lsquo;Overnight the cooling temperatures and hard work of crews contained the spread but we&rsquo;re expecting firefighters to be on scene through the day,&rsquo; the service said</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think they&rsquo;ve got the fire under control, when I drove round there they were all sitting down having a cup of tea. It is like a ghost town around here with everyone being evacuated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the main road leading up to the common, cars were being turned away by a response officer who told motorists that the fire was just &lsquo;300 yards away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Windsor and Maidenhead council worker wearing high vis said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m trying to stop people driving through this road closure, as the vast majority of people around here are ignoring it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fire is literally 300 yards that way. The fire is still smouldering, it is still a live incident. Residents on Heather Drive have been asked to leave their properties,&rsquo; the response officer added.</p>
<p>Millionaires watched from their windows last night as the wildfire burned acres of countryside.</p>
<p>Jonathan, a 54-year-old company director, told MailOnline: &lsquo;We live on the road that&rsquo;s been asked to evacuate. I think it will smoulder for quite a few days because it is such a big fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We aren&rsquo;t sure how it started, it&rsquo;s very dry but it could have been anything.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve lived here for 15 years and obviously you don&rsquo;t want million of pounds worth of houses to go up in flames. The fire backs onto our property so we could see it from our windows, it was quite a sight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A homeowner rushing back to his home in Onslow Lodge to grab extra clothes before heading to stay at a friends for a second night told of his experience.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old accountant, who didn&rsquo;t want to be named, said: &lsquo;We were asked to leave yesterday but we were allowed to pop back for five minutes to grab some more stuff we are still under evacuation at the moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The common is just the other side of the railway, we are worried but I am hoping that they have it all under control, there is no property that has been destroyed yet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think a lot of area has been affected and because the temperature is so hot the risk is that there is still undergrowth smouldering away and then it could quite easily catch again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The police were brilliant, just knocked in our door yesterday afternoon and asked us to gather our stuff and leave. This area is worth a fortune, what I&rsquo;m hoping is that there is a lot of expensive houses between me and the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wentworth golf club is a two-minute walk away, golfers had to stop play yesterday during a ladies cup because there were flames ravaging in the background. It was pretty spectacular really.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grand final of the Rose Ladies Series golf has been suspended after the huge fire encroached on Wentworth Golf Course in Surrey</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses saw the fire from more than 20 miles away in west London and from tall buildings in central London.</p>
<p>Last night Surrey Police said: &lsquo;The fire on Chobham Common is an ongoing incident with significant numbers of emergency services on the scene who are likely to remain there for some time. Please continue to avoid the area.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Road closures are currently in place - as the below image shows - these are eastbound on the Chertsey Road (B386) at the junction with Brick Hill up to the roundabout with Windsor Road and Chobham Road, and then northbound on the Chobham Road from the roundabout to the junction with Onslow Road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are aware of reports of social media posts suggesting that residents can return to HEATHER DRIVE - this is not the case. Please DO NOT attempt to return home at this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We thank the public for their continued support of all multi-agency colleagues working on the ground.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Play at the Rose Ladies Series Grand Final had to be halted and the final has been cancelled after a &lsquo;wall of flames&rsquo; spread to Wentworth golf course.</p>
<p>At around 11.30pm last night, The Rose Ladies Series wrote on Twitter: &lsquo;With a heavy heart, the Major Incident Command Centre have closed Wentworth tomorrow due to the severity of the ongoing fire risk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Grand Final restart is cancelled until further notice. Most importantly, players, caddies &amp; staff must be safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fire (pictured) started at around 12.25pm in Chobham Common before spreading to the nearby golf course</p>
<p>Griff Ryan, 23, who lives in Sunningdale near to the blaze, said the fire began with a &lsquo;strange light&rsquo; at around 1pm before smoke and then later a &lsquo;wall of flames&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Smoke got gradually worse and ash began falling into our garden,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now standing on Chobham road. At around 5pm fire still wasn&rsquo;t visible from the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Over about half an hour it&rsquo;s become visible and now can see a wall of flames down towards the railway line.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Other residents I&rsquo;ve spoken to have said it&rsquo;s the worst they&rsquo;ve seen in 30 years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surrey Heath MP and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove said he was &lsquo;horrified&rsquo; by the damage caused by the fire.</p>
<p>The fire service said on Friday: &lsquo;We received a call this afternoon around 12.25pm to a report of a fire on Chobham Common.</p>
<p>Ten fire engines have been sent in total, alongside multiple specialist vehicles, with the first arriving at the scene around 12.35pm</p>
<p>Chobham Road is closed between Titlarks Hill Road and the roundabout junction with Windsor Road and Chertsey Road</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten fire engines have been sent in total, alongside multiple specialist vehicles, with the first arriving at the scene around 12.35pm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Approximately 41 hectares of grass and undergrowth are alight. Crews remain at the scene tackling the fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Surrey Police added: &lsquo;Surrey Fire and Rescue are working hard to get the fire under control, and we are assisting with evacuations and road closures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are on the common you need to evacuate immediately, following instructions from the police and fire officers on the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you decided to walk off the common, but have left a vehicle in one of the car parks, please message us immediately so we can account for you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fire is travelling fast due to the wind, and there is also a risk of reduced visibility due to smoke.</p>
<p>The blaze could be seen for miles around including from tall buildings in central London</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you are affected by the smoke from the fire please keep windows and doors shut to avoid health problems.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pro golfer Felicity Johnson told Sky News Sports News: &lsquo;I was just on ninth green, the group ahead had teed up and then we could see a lot of smoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We could see it moving in the distance and it seemed to get closer pretty quickly. We waited five to ten minutes and it was the noise that was pretty scary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We all know how fast fire can travel and then we saw ash landing on our clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to Sky Sports News, no one has been injured on the golf club but everyone was asked to leave the West Course.</p>
<p>Smoke from the fire was visible in London and had earlier been mistakenly thought to be coming from Heathrow airport by some on social media.</p>
<p>The fire stops play as the group of Cara Gainer, Sophie Powell and Gabriella Cowley wait to play off during day three of The Rose Ladies Series on The West Course at Wentworth Golf Club</p>
<p>Surrey Fire and Rescue Service said it sent 10 fire engines, two water carriers and 10 other vehicles to tackle the blaze</p>
<p>MP for Surrey Heath Michael Gove said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m horrified by the damage this wildfire has done to Chobham Common - and hope people will heed this evacuation warning - thanks to Surrey Fire and Rescue service for their bravery in tackling this terrible tragedy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ash assumed to be from the fire has been reported to have fallen on homes as far as Windsor.</p>
<p>Councillor for the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead said: &lsquo;Ash is now falling in my garden in Windsor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can only assume from Chobham. It must be a huge fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The railway at Longcross in Surrey was blocked and trains could pass because the fire encroached on the line.</p>
<p>Police vehicles attend the blaze that began on Chobham Common, Surrey, and spread to Wentworth golf course</p>
<p>Approximately 41 hectares of grass and undergrowth are alight. Crews remain at the scene tackling the fire</p>
<p>The Surrey Heath Liberal Democrats said: &lsquo;Trains between Reading and Waterloo will run between Reading and Ascot or Waterloo and VirginiaWater, with replacement transport between Ascot and Virginia Water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Disruption expected until 8pm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Chobham Road was closed between Titlarks Hill Road and the roundabout junction with Windsor Road and Chertsey Road.</p>
<p>Rose Ladies Series is a one-off professional women&rsquo;s tournament, consisting of seven single day competitions, culminating in a three-day grand final.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/08/09/13/31740556-0-image-a-16_1596974673059.jpg" alt="img">
A British &lsquo;Jihadi&rsquo; bride who denies leading an all-female Islamic State unit in Syria is now back in the UK living on a canal boat and claiming Universal Credit.</p>
<p>Natalie Bracht, 45, who holds dual British and Germany citizenship, was said to have travelled to Syria towards the end of 2014 before begging to be allowed to return to the UK in October 2018.</p>
<p>She had most recently been living in Heidelberg, Germany, but when the coronavirus pandemic hit, she was repatriated, according to The Sunday People.</p>
<p>Natalie Bracht, 45, was repatriated when the coronavirus pandemic hit and has been living in a canal boat and has claimed Universal Credit</p>
<p>After visiting the British consulate in Dusseldorf Bracht was given a ticket for a British Airways flight to London on April 3.</p>
<p>On arrival in the UK she was then questioned for more than three hours by Special Branch under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>
<p>The mother-of-nine told the paper: &lsquo;They asked me where I had stayed in Syria. I had to tell them a couple of times, &ldquo;Guys, I wasn&rsquo;t in Syria.&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bracht also said that she was asked for her thoughts on Brexit, elections and vaccines.</p>
<p>She said she had initially been put up in a £44-a-night Travelodge before moving onto a barge and claims she receives help from the Helping Households Under Great Stress organisation.</p>
<p>On arrival in the UK she was then questioned for more than three hours by Special Branch under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Pictured: File image of Natalie Bracht at King&rsquo;s Cross station, issued on November 18, 2008</p>
<p>Bracht now hopes to work as a busker and has claimed Universal Credit.</p>
<p>It was previously alleged that Bracht had married Celso Rodrigues da Costa, 31, an IS fighter from London after travelling to Syria and that she was among a group of Western women being held in Kurdish-controlled camps in northern Syria.</p>
<p>But she has now denied ever having joined Islamic State in Syria and said that living as a full-time terror suspect has made her stronger.</p>
<p>However, Bracht also said that she started volunteering in 2012 as an interpreter for the controversial campaign group Cage.</p>
<p>She translated letters for terror suspects held in prison all over the world because of concerns she had over Islamophobia.</p>
<p>Bracht, who holds dual British and Germany citizenship, was said to have travelled to Syria towards the end of 2014</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;They are in prison, then they are free again and then they are not convicted but treated for the rest of their lives as full-time terror suspects. They never had convictions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cage has said that it had no ­record of Bracht volunteering.</p>
<p>Bracht&rsquo;s comments come only weeks after Shamima Begum was involved in a legal battle to win back her British citizenship to return to the UK.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old said that Begum had been brainwashed on the internet and shouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to leave the country in the first place.</p>
<p>The Home Office said: &lsquo;We do not comment on individual cases.&rsquo;

<h3 id="fears-growing-that-portugal-may-be-taken-off-quarantine-list-too-late">&ldquo;Fears growing that Portugal may be taken off quarantine list too late&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/08/09/22/31752852-0-image-a-101_1597010277029.jpg" alt="img">
Fears are growing that any decision to take Portugal off the Government’s quarantine list will come too late for most families’ summer holidays.</p>
<p>At present, all travellers to Portugal have to self-isolate for 14 days on return, following restrictions imposed when coronavirus cases began to surge.</p>
<p>The number of cases has recently started to fall, leading to hopes the restrictions would soon be lifted.</p>

<p>Locals and tourists sit at outside tables of a restaurant as local and foreign tourism slowly picks up</p>
<p>But it is understood that Government officials will want to ensure the fall is sustained before they end the quarantine requirement.</p>
<p>A possible decision comes as Jersey increased restriction on France – which could soon be added to Britain’s quarantine list – this weekend.</p>
<p>An announcement on Portugal is unlikely to be made this week and could even be delayed until the final week of August – only days before schools return.</p>
<p>Paul Charles, of PC Agency, which advises hotels and airlines, said: ‘Portugal could be removed from the list but it is not looking like it will be until the end of August.</p>
<p>‘My understanding is that it would need a sustained reduction in the number of cases for them to do so.</p>
<p>‘This kills the summer season for Portugal, and there is no doubt that 2020 has been the worst season it has had.’</p>
<p>At present, all travellers to Portugal have to self-isolate for 14 days on return, following restrictions imposed when coronavirus cases began to surge.</p>
<p>Paddle boarders enjoy the beach as coronavirus cases in Portugal start to fall sparking hopes that the country will be taken off the UK&rsquo;s quarantine list</p>
<p>A Government source said: ‘The process for dropping quarantine is far more gradual than it is for imposing it, so an announcement is not going to come soon.</p>
<p>‘But things do seem to be heading in the right direction in Portugal.’</p>
<p>The Portuguese government has expressed ‘regret’ at the UK’s decision to continue to exclude it from the list of countries that are exempt from quarantine.</p>
<p>‘It is a decision that is neither substantiated nor supported by the facts,’ Portugal’s ministry of state and foreign affairs said last month.</p>
<p>Tourism is a major industry in Portugal and is popular with British holidaymakers, with almost three million UK visitors a year.</p>
<p>Mr Charles warned travellers to France and Malta that quarantine requirements may be imposed at the end of this week, if Covid cases continue to rise there.</p>
<p>‘If France continues to see cases rise at the current rate, the Government will need to add France to the quarantine list,’ he said.</p>
<p>‘France has four days to show it is keeping a lid on its numbers. Malta is also being watched quite closely.’</p>
<p>Fears about Germany and Croatia being added to the list have dissipated following falls in the number of cases there.</p>
<p>‘This is a crucial week for countries to show that they are keeping a lid on this,’ said Mr Charles.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/08/09/10/31737486-0-image-a-18_1596965746033.jpg" alt="img">
A grieving mother has told of how her eight-year-old son told her &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; shortly before collapsing and dying in front of her of a mystery illness.</p>
<p>Clare Walker, 31, had asked her son Cillian Anderson, who was playing Fortnite, to put his pyjamas on so they could watch a film together seconds before she heard his terrified screams.</p>
<p>Ms Walker told The Scottish Sun: &lsquo;It was piercing, like a very, very scared scream. It was a sound I&rsquo;d never heard my son make.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cillian, from Dundee, was asthmatic and had hay fever and was on medication for his health conditions.</p>
<p>The family began shielding weeks before lockdown began on March 23 to protect Cillian.</p>
<p>Experts say Cillian may have had a fatal asthma attack or perhaps an allergic reaction, and are waiting on blood results to say for certain.</p>
<p>Clare Walker, 31, had asked her son Cillian Anderson (pictured) to put his pyjamas on so they could watch a film together seconds before she heard his terrified screams</p>
<p>Ms Walker said the last thing he said to her was &lsquo;I love you, mum&rsquo; and she had responded &lsquo;I love you too, son - to the moon and back&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She heard him scream when she got downstairs and rushed to get him outside for air, but he fell lifeless in her arms when she opened the back door.</p>
<p>Her dad Bruce, 51, carried out CPR as Ms Walker rang 999. Cillian was rushed to Ninewells Hospital but died ten minutes after he arrived on May 5.</p>
<p>Ms Walker said: &lsquo;I went numb, like somebody ripped my guts open. I climbed in next to him and gave him a cuddle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She added that she strokes his hair the way he liked it and bawled her eyes out.</p>
<p>Ms Walker said the family couldn&rsquo;t go home for two weeks while police &lsquo;sealed off her home&rsquo; so she couldn&rsquo;t seek comfort in his bedroom.</p>
<p>Ms Walker (pictured) said the last thing he said to her was &lsquo;I love you, mum&rsquo; and she had responded &lsquo;I love you too, son - to the moon and back&rsquo;</p>
<p>DCI Ray Birnie said protocol was followed after the eight-year-old&rsquo;s sudden death and said their aim &lsquo;is to investigate in an appropriate and proportionate manner&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Scottish Ambulance Service launched a probe after the family complained, according to The Scottish Sun.</p>
<p>A JustGiving page was set up by Dundee Superheroes to raise money to go towards the funeral and other costs to help the family.</p>
<p>The page raised more than £3,500 and Dundee Superheroes said they would be attending the service.</p>
<p>People wearing superhero costumes followed the coffin, which was Fornite-themed, to Dundee Crematorium on May 27.

<p>A total of 1,062 people have tested positive for coronavirus today bringing Britain&rsquo;s case load to 310,825 in the biggest daily rise in six weeks</p>
<p>The country has not seen an increase this large since June 25 - when 1,118 cases were reported in a single day.</p>
<p>The numbers come almost exactly a fortnight after Boris Johnson predicted a second wave in two weeks.</p>
<p>On July 28, a senior government source said Prime Minister Boris Johnson was &lsquo;extremely concerned&rsquo; by outbreaks &lsquo;bubbling up&rsquo;, both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Scotland has reported 48 new cases today, while Wales has reported a further 26.</p>
<p>The drastic rise in figures - up from 758 yesterday - may come as a shock to lockdown-sceptic revelers who flocked to Britain&rsquo;s beaches today.</p>
<p>Swathes of beachgoers were pictured dotted along the coast this weekend - with many ignoring social distancing rules.</p>
<p>While case figures have shot up today, the country&rsquo;s daily death toll remains low after a further eight people who tested positive for Covid-19 died in Britain. Both Scotland and Wales reported no further deaths.</p>

<p>Eager holidaymakers queued to get a spot on busy Bournemouth beach this morning, as some eager people even camped out the night before to claim their sunbathing patch</p>
<p>The patients who died in England were aged between 45 and 89 and all had known underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>The region with the highest number of deaths was the Midlands with four.</p>
<p>Minister rejects Children&rsquo;s Commissioner&rsquo;s calls for regular testing in schools The government&rsquo;s schools minister has slapped down calls from England&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Commissioner to introduce routine testing when schools reopen in September. Nick Gibb today said students and staff would only be tested if they displayed symptoms. But Anne Longfield earlier called for checks to become &lsquo;part and parcel&rsquo; of school life and suggested they should be done weekly. She told Times Radio: &lsquo;I think it needs to be as regular as it needs to be for the infection to be caught&hellip; certainly not one-offs but regular occurrences so they&rsquo;re part and parcel of the running of a school.&rsquo; But speaking on the same programme, Mr Gibb later said: &lsquo;Anybody who shows symptoms in schools will be tested, not routine testing, the advice we have is it&rsquo;s better when people show symptoms. &lsquo;If they test positive the people that pupil has been in contact with will be self-isolating. Everything we do is led by the science, the priority for the new 90-minute tests has to be the new hospitals and laboratories, the measures we are putting in place, the hierarchy of controls is the most effective measures of the virus.&rsquo; Advertisement</p>
<p>There were three deaths in the North East and Yorkshire, two in the East of England and one in London.</p>
<p>There were no deaths reported in the North West, where local lockdown measures in place in Greater Manchester and parts of east Lancashire were extended on Friday to include Preston.</p>
<p>Figures released on Sunday are usually smaller due to a delay in processing over the weekend.</p>
<p>The figures came as a landmark coronavirus study found the risk of transmission in classrooms is minimal, ratcheting up pressure on the Education Secretary to fully reopen schools in September.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson is understood to have warned that Gavin Williamson&rsquo;s &lsquo;head will be on the chopping block&rsquo; if pupils are not back in lessons next month.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has declared resuming classes a &lsquo;national priority&rsquo; and is planning an advertising blitz to urge anxious parents to send their child back to school.</p>
<p>His campaign was yesterday bolstered by encouraging scientific evidence which found a low threat of catching infection in schools.</p>
<p>Government Sage adviser Professor Russell Viner outlined the forthcoming Public Health England study and stressed that reopening schools was &lsquo;imperative&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As the reopening of schools was bumped to the top of ministers&rsquo; agenda:</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s Commissioner Anne Longfield called on the government to introduce regular testing for all students and staff in schools;</p>
<p>Labour&rsquo;s shadow education secretary Kate Green said she supports getting children back to school in September, but said the government needs to ramp up its track and trace system;</p>
<p>New research laid bare the damaging educational impact on pupils who have missed schooling during the lockdown;</p>
<p>The coronavirus death toll rose by 55 yesterday, to 46,556, compared to a rise of 74 last Saturday, while 758 new infections were reported, 13 fewer than a week ago;</p>
<p>Scientific advisers warned that the UK-wide reproduction rate, R, is between 0.8 and 1.0, the point at which the virus starts spreading exponentially again;</p>
<p>Oxford University researchers developing a vaccine were embroiled in an ethics row about whether to deliberately infect human volunteers – and warned that although there was a 50 per cent chance of a jab being available next year, it was likely to be only partially effective and carry side-effects;</p>
<p>A survey found that barely half of the adult population is committed to being immunised against Covid-19;</p>
<p>France is on the brink of joining the list of countries from where British travellers will have to go into quarantine upon their return;</p>
<p>Young people in Preston were being urged &lsquo;don&rsquo;t kill Granny&rsquo; as the city was subjected to new lockdown measures following a spike in infections;</p>
<p>Up to 16 children and staff were forced to isolate at home after a coronavirus outbreak at a nursery in Bury, which has also been put into local lockdown.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson (right) is understood to have warned that Gavin Williamson&rsquo;s (left) &lsquo;head will be on the chopping block&rsquo; if pupils are not back in lessons next month</p>
<p>&lsquo;A new study that has been done in UK schools confirms there is very little evidence that the virus is transmitted in schools,&rsquo; he told the Sunday Times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is some of the largest data you will find on schools anywhere. Britain has done very well in terms of thinking of collecting data in schools.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Labour, the unions, and the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner have all today voiced support for the principle of schools reopening in September.</p>
<p>But thorny issues such as routine testing and the wearing of masks remain - which were both today slapped down by the schools minister.</p>
<p>Leading scientist Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and a member of Sage said: &lsquo;A new study that has been done in UK schools confirms there is very little evidence that the virus is transmitted in schools</p>
<p>Prof Viner, also president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said keeping schools shut would take a further toll on both young people&rsquo;s academic attainment and mental health.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson outlined similar concerns in an article for today&rsquo;s Mail on Sunday where he heralded the resuming of lessons a &lsquo;moral duty&rsquo; and &lsquo;crucial&rsquo; for pupils&rsquo; &lsquo;welfare, their health and for their future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wrote: &lsquo;The education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health and for their future. That is why it is a national priority to get all pupils back into school in September.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The message I have given to Ministers and civil servants is this: we can do it – and we will do it. Social justice demands it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke of the &lsquo;uplifting sight… as millions of parents rose to the challenge of educating their children&rsquo; amid the added pressures of lockdown, but said that had to end.</p>
<p>The PHE study, which tested more than 20,000 pupils and 100 teachers, is hoped to allay the concerns of wary teacher unions, which thwarted ministers&rsquo; initial attempts to resume classes for fears of staff catching the virus.</p>
<p>Ministers are poised to lock horns with union bosses who have unveiled a list of demands if teachers are to go back next month. Mary Bousted, head of the National Education Union, (left) urged schools to ignore &lsquo;threatening noises&rsquo; from the Government and refuse to reopen if they feel it is unsafe</p>
<p>Obese people could be told to stay at home in Covid hotspots if virus cases surge amid second wave this autumn By Kate Dennett For Mailonline Obese people could be among those told to stay home in coronavirus hotspots if there is a second wave of cases this autumn. The Government is said to be looking at plans for a &lsquo;more sophisticated model&rsquo; of shielding to avoid another mass lockdown. Officials are considering how NHS data could target vulnerable groups, including those who are obese, so they can be told to stay indoors if there is a second coronavirus wave, the Sunday Telegraph reported. Obese people could reportedly be among vulnerable groups told to stay at home if there is a second coronavirus wave this autumn (file photo) One Cabinet minister reportedly described the plan to tell those who are especially vulnerable to shield as a &lsquo;stiletto not a sledgehammer&rsquo; method. Those who are over-50 could also be among vulnerable groups contacted and told to stay indoors if there is a second coronavirus spike this autumn. A Cabinet minister told the Telegraph: &lsquo;They are understanding that age does come into it. The shielding cohort is way too broad - you can&rsquo;t say that every fat person has to shield. It will be more subtle.&rsquo; This comes after stricter lockdown rules were imposed in Preston, following other northern towns, and young people were urged to follow the new regulations. It was revealed half of the 61 new coronavirus cases in the newly-locked down city are under the age of 30, as fears rise that &lsquo;bold&rsquo; young people are ignoring social distancing. Council chiefs in Preston also launched a powerful &lsquo;don&rsquo;t kill granny&rsquo; message to encourage youngsters to follow the rules. Bradford has also seen its tightened measures extended for another week, as other towns, including Aberdeen and Leicester, are also adhering to local lockdowns. Over-50s could also be told to shield if there is a second wave, as the Government is said to be looking at plans for a &lsquo;more sophisticated model&rsquo; of shielding (file photo) Local Government Association also called for councils to be given more powers to shut down rule-breaking pubs nationwide, as revellers continue to pack into venues up and down the country. Experts warned that being in a busy pub carries more risk of spreading coronavirus than being on an aeroplane, as aircrafts have better ventilation. Dr Julian W Tang, honorary associate professor of respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, said the most common method of transmission in the UK is probably &lsquo;conversational exposure&rsquo;. The spike in Preston was blamed on households mixing in pubs and homes and the spike in Aberdeen&rsquo;s lockdown came after an outbreak of cases linked to a number of bars emerged. Local lockdowns will continue to be based on council boundaries, while rural areas could see it only applying to market down in villages. The Department of Health and Social Care have declined to comment. Advertisement</p>
<p>Union bosses were last night accused of &lsquo;nit-picking&rsquo; after releasing an exhaustive list of 200 safety demands.</p>
<p>The National Education Union has urged its 450,000 teachers to &lsquo;escalate&rsquo; action if their schools do not adhere to their 200-strong Covid-secure checklist.</p>
<p>The demands included assurances the working day will not be lengthened, children waiting to be picked up to be kept isolated, and support for staff suffering workload anxiety.</p>
<p>Education select committee chair Robert Halfon MP last night hit out at the demands and told the Sun on Sunday: &lsquo;It is incredible not one of these 200 nitpicking questions asks the most important thing of all - what&rsquo;s best for the kids?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But today Amanda Martin, co-president of the NEU, said there is no price on safety, and pointed out that they had been urging their members to plan for the reopening in September.</p>
<p>She told Times Radio: &lsquo;I think the NEU right from the beginning has been on the right side of history by saying schools should remain open to key worker kids and the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have half a million members, we have had schools open all the way through lockdown and we have been supporting them with checklists&hellip; We have said schools should be ready to open in September.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said her union has requested information from Sage and the government for a risk assessment about reopening schools in September.</p>
<p>Prof Viner, a member of Sage, insisted reopening schools was a non-negotiable, even if it meant sacrificing other freedoms as a trade-off.</p>
<p>The desperate need to prioritse education was endorsed by Children&rsquo;s Commissioner Anne Longfield, who said in the event of future lockdowns schools should not be closed as a default to save &lsquo;disruption to the lives of adults&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She today threw her weight behind Mr Johnson&rsquo;s bullishness to reopen schools, even if it meant pubs were sacrificed.</p>
<p>Speaking to Times Radio, she said: &lsquo;Children have been out of schools for five months&hellip; There was a moment I thought children have been forgotten in the relaxation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must reopen and they must stay open so if there are future lockdowns they are the last to close and first to reopen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Quizzed if that meant people should be restricted from indoor drinking in pubs, she said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve talked about that when decisions need to be made in future lockdowns, it makes absolute sense if there&rsquo;s a limited amount of social interactions before infections are raised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said she was &lsquo;dismayed&rsquo; that theme parks and even zoos were opened before schools, but said she is pleased that the PM has bumped resuming lessons to the top of the government&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
<p>Ms Longfield said that regular testing should become &lsquo;part and parcel&rsquo; of school life from next month.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;I think it needs to be as regular as it needs to be for the infection to be caught&hellip; certainly not one-offs but regular occurrences so they&rsquo;re part and parcel of the running of a school.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this was slapped down by schools minister Nick Gibb, who said only those who developed symptoms would be tested.</p>
<p>The minister this morning told Times Radio: &lsquo;Anybody who shows symptoms in schools will be tested, it won&rsquo;t be routine testing&hellip; the advice we have is it&rsquo;s better when people show symptoms.</p>
<p>If they test positive the people that pupil has been in contact with will be self-isolating&hellip; Everything we do is led by the science&hellip; the priority for the new 90-minute tests has to be the new hospitals and laboraties, the measures we are putting in place, the hierarchy of controls is the most effective measures of the virus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On masks, he added: &lsquo;These kind of issues will be up to head teachers, but there&rsquo;s no need for masks to be worn within schools if the hierarchy of controls, the measures I have outlines, are in place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Labour expressed support for the reopening of schools in September, but surged the government to support teachers by bolstering the test and trace infrastructure.</p>
<p>Shadow education secretary Kate Green said: &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s essential that schools open in September and that all pupils are expected to be back in the classrooms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do think the Government could be doing more to support them (teachers) particularly, for example, making sure we&rsquo;ve got a really robust Test and Trace system in place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The work is being done to make schools safe but more is needed to support those schools, they may need extra resources for example for extra clearing or to stagger the school day or to make sure children can travel to and fro safely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Government has a window between now and the beginning of September to get that right and it absolutely must do so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s really, really important that we don&rsquo;t write off a generation of Covid children - they need to be back in class, the whole of our futures depend on this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Boris Johnson has said that getting children back to school is a national priority (pictured during a visit to The Discovery School in Kings Hill last month)</p>
<p>Not a single confirmed case of a school pupil passing on coronavirus to their teacher exists anywhere in the world, says a leading expert</p>
<p>By Stephen Adams, Medical Editor for The Mail on Sunday</p>
<p>No confirmed cases exist anywhere in the world of school pupils passing on Covid to their teachers, an expert has said.</p>
<p>All the available evidence points to children being poor spreaders of the virus, said Professor Mark Woolhouse, who cast doubt on the theory that reopening schools will trigger a deadly second wave.</p>
<p>Last week, a modelling forecast published in The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health warned that opening schools across the UK in September could lead to a tsunami of new cases, more than twice the size of the first wave.</p>
<p>But Prof Woolhouse said a second study published in the medical journal the same day, which found infected children in Australian schools had passed the virus on to hardly anyone, had been largely ignored.</p>
<p>During the first wave, 15 schools and ten nurseries in the state of New South Wales reported 27 cases where children or staff had attended while infectious with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Fifteen of these &lsquo;index&rsquo; cases were staff and 12 were children.</p>
<p>Class pledge: Boris Johnson on a visit to a Kent school last month</p>
<p>These 12 children were in close contact with 103 staff, found contact tracers.</p>
<p>Only one of them was discovered to have passed the virus on to a member of staff in a single instance, although this is understood to have occurred in a nursery.</p>
<p>Nor did infected children pass the virus on to their classmates to any great degree, with that happening in only two of 649 close contacts – a virus &lsquo;attack rate&rsquo; of just 0.3 per cent.</p>
<p>By contrast, the 15 infected staff members passed it on to 4.4 per cent of colleagues who were close contacts (to seven out of 160).</p>
<p>Prof Woolhouse, head of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, said: &lsquo;Science progresses by people publishing research. So what we do as carefully as we possibly can is scan what&rsquo;s been published in the literature to see if there are any reported cases, in this case of a child transmitting to a teacher in the classroom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact that there aren&rsquo;t any that we can find, and there still aren&rsquo;t, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s not possible in principle and doesn&rsquo;t mean that it won&rsquo;t happen on occasion.</p>
<p>Prof Woolhouse, head of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, said: &lsquo;Science progresses by people publishing research.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it does suggest that out of all the ways that we see and have found this virus to transmit – and remember, there are thousands and thousands of transmission events that have been inferred [from contact tracing] – out of all those thousands, still we can&rsquo;t find a single one involving a child transmitting to a teacher in a classroom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;Even if this virus doesn&rsquo;t spread easily among the children, it certainly will spread among staff if it gets the opportunity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The evidence so far is that the most dangerous room in the school is not the classroom, it&rsquo;s the staff room. So schools need to pay attention to that, and not take their eye off the right ball.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prof Woolhouse advises the Government on coronavirus as a member of the Scientific Pandemic Group on Modelling (SPI-M), although he stressed he was speaking in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>Academics concluded reopening schools without improving contact tracing could trigger a second wave up to 2.3 times the size of the first, leading to 250,000 more deaths</p>
<p>His comments come amid renewed calls for caution by teaching unions, with the National Education Union urging schools to ignore &lsquo;threatening noises&rsquo; from the Government and to refuse to reopen if they feel it is unsafe.</p>
<p>The unions will have felt emboldened to speak out by last week&rsquo;s modelling study, by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and University College London (UCL).</p>
<p>Academics concluded reopening schools without improving contact tracing could trigger a second wave up to 2.3 times the size of the first, leading to 250,000 more deaths.</p>
<p>Prof Woolhouse said that apocalyptic outcome was &lsquo;highly unlikely given the current evidence&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m slightly worried that, just through an accident of timing, schools will get blamed for pushing the R number over 1. But all activity can contribute to R rising, not just schools.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Missing out on school is disaster that lasts forever - as the huge damage inflicted on youngsters by a long break from the classroom is laid bare by several new studies</p>
<p>By Julie Henry for The Mail On Sunday</p>
<p>The huge damage inflicted on youngsters by a long break from school has been laid bare by several new studies.</p>
<p>Interrupted schooling has deep and long-lasting effects on children, according to Oxford University researchers who used data from school closures in a disaster zone. They said the study &lsquo;has relevance for other disasters, including the Covid-19 pandemic&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The study found that children&rsquo;s test scores in areas of Pakistan hit by a 2005 earthquake were between one- and-a-half and two years behind their peers in untouched areas.</p>
<p>Those affected face losing 15 per cent of their earnings every year for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>In another study, US researchers looked at the effects of the &lsquo;summer slide&rsquo; – when children forget over the long holidays what they have previously learned – to estimate the impact of school closures caused by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>It said students are likely to return to the classroom with less than 50 per cent of the knowledge and skills they had in maths.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a major UK study into the long-term consequences of the Covid crisis on the younger generation is being undertaken by Exeter University.</p>
<p>In another study, US researchers looked at the effects of the &lsquo;summer slide&rsquo; – when children forget over the long holidays what they have previously learned – to estimate the impact of school closures caused by the coronavirus (file photo)</p>
<p>Dr Lee Elliot Major, the university&rsquo;s professor of social mobility, said: &lsquo;What is already clear is that the drastic losses in learning will have profound impacts on the lives of many children and young people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every extra week away from face-to-face teaching adds to the cumulative damage over a lifetime. We need to assess the short-term risks of containing the virus against the longer-term, but in many ways more profound, risks of damaging the prospects for a whole generation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Natalie Perera, executive director of the independent Education Policy Institute (EPI), said: &lsquo;Pupils across the country have suffered huge learning loss since the lockdown began, with the most disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils hit the hardest by school closures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The period of disruption faced by schools is likely to have increased the achievement gap between the poorest pupils and the rest, which is already 18 months of learning by the end of compulsory education.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Government must offer maximum support to schools so that they are able to continue with pupils&rsquo; education in a safe and secure environment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maura Regan, chief executive officer of Bishop Hogarth Catholic Education Trust, which runs 18 academies in the North-East, told The Mail on Sunday that schools &lsquo;owe it to society&rsquo; to have staff back working so that children&rsquo;s education can get back on track and parents can return to work.</p>
<p>Interrupted schooling has deep and long-lasting effects on children, according to Oxford University researchers (file photo)</p>
<p>&lsquo;In essence we need to get children in school in September. I&rsquo;d like to see us back full time and back permanently full time,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a balance to be struck between the risk and the priority of getting children back and the economy going.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the detrimental impact on children, especially the most vulnerable who might not have the drive or the parental support, is huge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Other research shows that the least well-off children have suffered the most from being out of school.</p>
<p>An Institute for Fiscal Studies report found children from better-off households are spending 30 per cent more time each day on educational activities than children from the poorest fifth of homes.</p>
<p>BORIS JOHNSON: Keeping our schools closed a moment longer than is absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible</p>
<p>The education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health and for their future. That is why it is a national priority to get all pupils back into school in September.</p>
<p>The message I have given to Ministers and civil servants is this: we can do it – and we will do it. Social justice demands it.</p>
<p>Back in March, we had no option but to close schools to all but vulnerable children and those of critical workers, as part of our wider effort to protect the NHS and save lives.</p>
<p>One of the most uplifting sights as our country came together during the lockdown was the transformation of living rooms and kitchens into classrooms, as millions of parents rose to the challenge of educating their children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The message I have given to Ministers and civil servants is this: we can do it – and we will do it. Social justice demands it&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pictured: Prime Minister Boris Johnson visiting the Discovery School in West Malling, Kent, in July this year</p>
<p>For many, this was achieved while juggling the pressures of work and childcare, compounded by the mounting toll of the restrictions necessarily imposed by our fight against coronavirus – swings and slides locked up, playdates banned, grandparents unable to help.</p>
<p>It was – and for many families continues to be – a truly Herculean effort of which I will always be in awe. It was also supported by many brilliant teachers providing remote learning for their pupils, the thousands of laptops and tablets we bought and shipped to the children who needed them to access online resources, and the stunning creation of Oak National Academy, which developed an entire online curriculum in just a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>But we are in a different situation now to the one we faced earlier this year.</p>
<p>Thanks to the enormous sacrifices made by the British people, we have made very significant progress in our fight against the virus. The number of infections has been forced down from an estimated 157,000 in early May to around 28,000 at the start of this month.</p>
<p>Scientists have learned more about how the virus spreads and how we can control it.</p>
<p>Crucially, studies have shown that children face a much lower risk than adults.</p>
<p>This pandemic isn&rsquo;t over, and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent.</p>
<p>But now that we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely, we have a moral duty to do so.</p>
<p>Because there is ultimately no substitute for a child learning at school to give them the knowledge, skills and wherewithal to succeed in life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve had compulsory schooling in this country for 140 years, and the evidence is incontrovertible.</p>
<p>Time spent out of class means lower average academic attainment, with a lasting effect on future life chances. The less children are in school, the worse it is for their health. Sport England reports one in three children has done less physical activity in lockdown, with many suffering from poorer mental health, including through reduced access to vital support.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Time spent out of class means lower average academic attainment, with a lasting effect on future life chances. The less children are in school, the worse it is for their health&rsquo;</p>
<p>Most painfully of all, the costs of school closure have fallen disproportionately on the most disadvantaged, the very children who need school the most. Surveys estimate that while the majority of pupils have been learning at home, as many as a quarter of pupils were doing less than two hours of school work a day.</p>
<p>Children in the richest families spent over 75 minutes more per day on home-schooling than those in the poorest, and one study predicted that the attainment gap between children from economically deprived households and their peers could widen by more than a third.</p>
<p>The Children&rsquo;s Commissioner has reported increased risk of exposure to domestic violence, exploitation and addiction, both at home and on the streets.</p>
<p>The longer this continues, the more likely it is that some will tumble out of education, employment or training altogether, never to return. On top of all this, there are the spiralling economic costs of parents and carers unable to work without the school or wraparound childcare they depend on; and the devastating long-term cost looming from the stunting of our children&rsquo;s future productivity.</p>
<p>This damage is taking place all over the world, with the United Nations Secretary General last week warning of a &lsquo;generational catastrophe that could waste untold human potential, undermine decades of progress and exacerbate entrenched inequalities&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We simply cannot allow this to continue.</p>
<p>Keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible.</p>
<p>I have always believed that talent is uniformly distributed but opportunity is not, and the first step to changing that is by helping those who have fallen behind to catch up.</p>
<p>So we are investing £1 billion in catch-up support, including a new £350 million National Tutoring Programme. We have announced £14 billion extra for schools and a new ten-year school building programme, as part of the Government&rsquo;s mission to build back better.</p>
<p>But first of all we must open the school gates to all pupils once again.</p>
<p>The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies has advised that the risk to children themselves of becoming severely ill from coronavirus is low.</p>
<p>Our test and trace system is up and running – already, it has identified almost 200,000 people who might otherwise inadvertently spread the virus, and advised them to self-isolate – and we have worked closely with teaching unions and school leaders on measures to ensure that our schools are Covid secure.</p>
<p>Grouping children into bubbles, staggered drop-off times, regular handwashing and providing schools and colleges with a number of home-testing kits for those who would be unable to access a testing centre.</p>
<p>It is a detailed plan for getting all of our children back to school in a way that is safe.</p>
<p>In June, we began the phased return of Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 and, after some initial apprehension, many parents reported how much happier their children were and what a relief it was to be back.</p>
<p>Now we must all work together to bring this best practice to the task of reopening schools to all pupils in September.</p>
<p>Nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children and nothing is more important for the future of our country.</p>
<p>Britain’s coronavirus wards stand empty as number of people dying of Covid plummets by 99% since height of pandemic</p>
<p>By James Robinson for MailOnline</p>
<p>Many of Britain&rsquo;s coronavirus wards are standing empty as new figures have today revealed that the number of people in hospital and dying from Covid-19 has plummeted by 99 per cent since the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Coronavirus death figures in hospitals have plummeted from 866 people a day at the height on April 10 of the pandemic to five last Thursday.</p>
<p>The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has also plummeted by 96 per cent since the peak of the coronavirus pandemic, according to official data.</p>
<p>Under pressure hospital staff were treating more than 17,000 patients a day for coronavirus in England at the height of the pandemic in mid-April.</p>
<p>But as of August 6, official NHS England data shows staff were treating 700 Covid-19 patients.</p>
<p>It comes as it has been revealed some hospitals did not have a single coronavirus patient on their wards last week, with one top doctor suggesting that Britain is &lsquo;almost reaching herd immunity&rsquo;, according to The Sunday Times.</p>
<p>Under pressure hospital staff were treating more than 17,000 patients a day for coronavirus in England at the height of the pandemic in mid-April. Pictured: Nurses care for a patient in an intensive care ward</p>
<p>One doctor also described the downturn as &lsquo;huge&rsquo; and said he did not expect a future increase in hospital admissions.</p>
<p>Doctor Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant in Birmingham, told the Times: &lsquo;I think that&rsquo;s highly unlikely, because the pubs have been open for over a month, people have been interacting heavily during that time and the natural history of the disease is that and you are going to end up in hospital you are pretty much in hospital within 15 days of contracting it.</p>
<p>He also suggested the downturn could be due to the most vulnerable in the UK having contracted the virus in &lsquo;March and April&rsquo; and that the virus may have become &lsquo;less virulent&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It comes as preliminary figures today reveal a further ten people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died in Britain.</p>
<p>The latest figures - which only cover deaths in hospital - bring the UK&rsquo;s total death toll during the pandemic to 46,576.</p>
<p>However as of August 6, official NHS England data shows staff were treating 700 Covid-19 patients. Pictured: Clinical staff wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</p>
<p>Coronavirus death figures in hospitals have also plummeted, from 866 people a day at the height on April 10 of the pandemic to five last Thursday. Pictured: A nurse at an intensive care unit wears PPE</p>
<p>The numbers are likely to be higher when figures for deaths across all settings - including in care homes and the wider community - are revealed.</p>
<p>Both Scotland and Wales reported no further deaths.</p>
<p>Figures released on Sunday are usually smaller due to a delay in processing over the weekend.</p>
<p>Scotland has reported 48 new cases today, while Wales has reported a further 26.</p>
<p>England has not released its case figures yet.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland stopped reporting its data on the virus at weekends so the daily figures for positive cases are for Britain only.</p>
<p>The figures came as a landmark coronavirus study found the risk of transmission in classrooms is minimal, ratcheting up pressure on the Education Secretary to fully reopen schools in September.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson is understood to have warned that Gavin Williamson&rsquo;s &lsquo;head will be on the chopping block&rsquo; if pupils are not back in lessons next month.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has declared resuming classes a &lsquo;national priority&rsquo; and is planning an advertising blitz to urge anxious parents to send their child back to school.</p>
<p>His campaign was yesterday bolstered by encouraging scientific evidence which found a low threat of catching infection in schools.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson (pictured left) is understood to have warned that Gavin Williamson&rsquo;s (pictured right) &lsquo;head will be on the chopping block&rsquo; if pupils are not back in lessons next month</p>
<p>Government Sage adviser Professor Russell Viner outlined the forthcoming Public Health England study and stressed that reopening schools was &lsquo;imperative&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A new study that has been done in UK schools confirms there is very little evidence that the virus is transmitted in schools,&rsquo; he told the Sunday Times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is some of the largest data you will find on schools anywhere. Britain has done very well in terms of thinking of collecting data in schools.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Labour, the unions, and the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner have all today voiced support for the principle of schools reopening in September.</p>
<p>But thorny issues such as routine testing and the wearing of masks remain - which were both today slapped down by the schools minister.</p>
<p>Prof Viner, also president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said keeping schools shut would take a further toll on both young people&rsquo;s academic attainment and mental health.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson outlined similar concerns in an article for today&rsquo;s Mail on Sunday where he heralded the resuming of lessons a &lsquo;moral duty&rsquo; and &lsquo;crucial&rsquo; for pupils&rsquo; &lsquo;welfare, their health and for their future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He wrote: &lsquo;The education of our children is crucial for their welfare, their health and for their future. That is why it is a national priority to get all pupils back into school in September.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The message I have given to Ministers and civil servants is this: we can do it – and we will do it. Social justice demands it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke of the &lsquo;uplifting sight… as millions of parents rose to the challenge of educating their children&rsquo; amid the added pressures of lockdown, but said that had to end.</p>
<p>The PHE study, which tested more than 20,000 pupils and 100 teachers, is hoped to allay the concerns of wary teacher unions, which thwarted ministers&rsquo; initial attempts to resume classes for fears of staff catching the virus.

<h3 id="finger-of-suspicion-is-pointed-at-the-worlds-most-expensive-painting">&ldquo;Finger of suspicion is pointed at the world&rsquo;s most expensive painting&rdquo;</h3>

A finger of suspicion has been pointed at the world’s most expensive painting - because the hands are ‘too childish’ to have been painted by Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
<p>Salvator Mundi sold for $450 million (£342 million) in 2017 but art expert Jacques Franck believes it is a ‘workshop Leonardo’ created by two of the artist’s assistants.</p>
<p>The French historian argues that the fingers of Christ’s right hand which are held in the sign of the cross lack Da Vinci’s usual anatomical precision.</p>
<p>‘When the index and the middle finger are raised fully, one cannot bend the other fingers inside the palm extensively as observed in the Salvator Mundi’s blessing hand,’ he said. ‘It is therefore an unlikely movement.’</p>
<p>Salvator Mundi, above, sold for $450 million (£342 million) in 2017 but art expert Jacques Franck believes it is a ‘workshop Leonardo’ created by two of the artist’s assistants (file photo)</p>
<p>Salvator Mundi was painted by famous Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci - who is pictured here in a portrait by Lattanzio Querena (1768-1853)</p>
<p>In an essay for the journal ArtWatch UK, Mr Franck also claims that too much of the fingernail on the hand is shown - something that Da Vinci would have known - and says it is unlikely the artist would have painted ‘the oddly long and thin nose, the mechanical hair ringlets, the flat orb and the over-shadowy neck’.</p>
<p>He believes that two artists called Salai and Baltraffio, who worked alongside Da Vinci, are the true painters of the piece which has been described as the ‘male Mona Lisa’.</p>
<p>The painting was sold at Christie’s in New York, reportedly to Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who is rumoured to have it on display on his superyacht.</p>
<p>The auctioneers and other experts insist the painting is a genuine Da Vinci work, but Michael Daley, the Director of ArtWatch UK, said: ‘Nobody was as anatomically sophisticated as Leonardo. The problems with the hands, which can’t have been painted by Leonardo are just one of the great untalked about things of this painting.</p>
<p>‘When you discover one thing that is wrong with a painting it tends to be that you discover everything is wrong with a painting.’</p>

One person has died and at least 20 others shot when multiple gunmen opened fire at a block party overnight in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>D.C. police said at least three shooters opened fire from different locations at the gathering near the 3300 block of Dubois Place in Southeast at around 12:30am on Sunday.</p>
<p>The victim has been identified as 17-year-old Christopher Brown, a father-of-one, WUSA9 reported.</p>
<p>At least 20 others were injured in the mass shooting, 11 of whom are women. At least seven of those hurt were taken to hospital in a critical condition.</p>
<p>One of those victims includes an off-duty 1st District Police officer who was shot and is currently struggling for her life.</p>
<p>No arrests have been made as of Sunday morning and no further details have been offered by D.C. Police.</p>
<p>The victim has been identified as 17-year-old Christopher Brown, a father-of-one</p>
<p>When the gunfire finally subsides, bystanders and paramedics are seen applying chest compression to a number of lifeless figures prone on the ground</p>
<p>The fatal shooting unfolded near the 3300 block of Dubois Place in Southeast at around 12:30am on Sunday. Multiple detectives and forensic squads are still at the scene as of 8:00am</p>
<p>Witnesses say the shooting occurred during a block party or cook out that was taking place in the middle of the residential street late last night, with hundreds of people attending.</p>
<p>Many said the gunfire sounded as if it was being fired from an automatic weapon or more than one gun.</p>
<p>Local resident George Benton uploaded footage of the shooting&rsquo;s aftermath. He said he had been inside his home when he heard &lsquo;about 100 gun shots&rsquo; ring out.</p>
<p>Benton said that officials at the scene said as many as 15 people were shot, including children.</p>
<p>In an update posted this morning, Benton claimed he had been told by an officer at that eight different guns were reportedly used in the shooting.</p>
<p>The Sixth District has not yet responded to a DailyMail.com request for comment on the ages of the victims.</p>
<p>Footage of the moment the fatal gunfire erupted has been shared on social media, showing hundreds of revelers running and screaming as countless shots are heard ringing out.</p>
<p>When the gunfire finally subsides, bystanders and paramedics are seen applying chest compression to a number of lifeless figures prone on the ground.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had DJs, everybody was down there. It was more women than men,,&rsquo; another witness, Nelson Bostic, told WTOP. &lsquo;Next thing you know, it was like Beirut out here. It sounded like machine guns &hellip; I saw a young lady, she got shot in the leg. A young man, he was leaning over his car.</p>
<p>&lsquo;People laying on the ground. People ducking under cars and stuff like that,&rsquo; Bostic said. &lsquo;It was terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On social media, several attendees posted a number of images identifying the street party as the annual &lsquo;34th-n-EAT Cookout&rsquo;</p>
<p>As hundreds of revelers are seen dancing and enjoying themselves, suddenly chaos descends as a flurry of gunshots is heard ringing out, prompting the crowd to disperse</p>
<p>Many said the gunfire sounded as if it was being fired from an automatic weapon or more than one gun</p>
<p>Local resident George Benton uploaded footage of the shooting&rsquo;s aftermath. He said he had been inside his home when he heard &lsquo;about 100 gun shots&rsquo; ring out. Benton said that officials at the scene said as many as 15 people were shot, including children.</p>
<p>An apparent DJ of the event, All Homage, uploaded a video to Instagram hours before showing more than 100 bottles of alcohol laid out in a front yard</p>
<p>Another witness told WUSA9 that police had been monitoring the street party last night, but as soon as they left the shooting happened.</p>
<p>The witness, who wished not to be named, said they saw a man &lsquo;slumped over on a car bleeding like crazy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>On social media, several attendees posted a number of images identifying the street party as the annual &lsquo;34th-n-EAT Cookout&rsquo;.</p>
<p>An apparent DJ of the event, All Homage, uploaded a video to Instagram hours before showing more than 100 bottles of alcohol laid out in a front yard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The annual 34th-n-EAT cookout is today!!&rsquo; the performer wrote. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m your DJ all night Pull up positive vibes only.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Early Sunday morning, keys, shoes and other person items were seen strewn across the road. More than 170 shell casings were also reportedly scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Police said additional information would be made available later in the day. They say they have no description of the assailants at this time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the grief-stricken family of Christopher Brown have spoken out about their heartbreak over their devastating loss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You need to stop because you took away something that belonged to me, somebody hat I loved so much and somebody dear to me,&rsquo; his grandmother Patience Brown told WUSA9.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know this is not the only child or will be the last child,&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;But they need to stop this. I want everybody to be safe and happy. But this is not the way to be safe. And this is not the way to be happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Brown&rsquo;s mother, Artecka Brown, described her son as an energetic person and a doting father. He leaves behind a one-year-old son, and was expecting his second child at his time of death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was an innocent king&hellip;he just wanted to go attend a neighborhood party,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Overall, he is a father, he has one-year-old son and another on the way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is a developing story&hellip;
