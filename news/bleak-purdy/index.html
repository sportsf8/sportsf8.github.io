<p>Quarterback was a major priority for Mike Norvell when he first arrived at Florida State.</p>
<p>Rightfully so.</p>
<p>The Seminoles failed to land a prep quarterback in Willie Taggart’s two lone recruiting classes, leaving the future of the room bleak. Norvell immediately made steps towards rectifying this problem by signing two signal callers in the early signing period: Tate Rodemaker and Chubba Purdy.</p>
<p>Purdy was particularly important for a few reasons, including the optics of flipping a long-time Louisville pledge in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>Beyond that, Purdy has substantial upside. And that’s why, even as a true freshman, he comes in tied for 32nd on our list of FSU’s 40 Most Important Players of 2020.</p>
<p>“Important” can be fairly vague, because it depends on how you define importance. It’s subjective. Is it based on the player who holds the most value on the roster? Is it simply decided by determining who is the best/most talented player? Do you weigh what position a player plays and just how much that position impacts the game on a play-to-play basis? What about depth at the position, how is that factored in?</p>
<p>Given that different people will place different values to how they define “important”, Noles247 decided to go with a by-committee approach in crafting this year’s 40 Most Important List. Noles247’s Brendan Sonnone, Chris Nee, Josh Newberg and Zach Blostein compiled their own respective lists of 50 players&hellip;and then we invited 247Sports’ Bud Elliott, the Tallahassee Democrat’s Wayne McGahee and Trey Rowland of The Rowlcast partake in the exercise as well. We then narrowed it down to the Top 40.</p>
<p>The result? A composite list of the 40 players that the seven of us consider the most important to FSU’s success in 2020.

Creators Raphael Bob-Waksberg and Kate Purdy helm this animated fantasy-drama about Alma Winograd-Diaz (Rosa Salazar), a troubled young woman who, after a near-fatal car accident, discovers she has a new relationship with time and space. Soon her dead father, Jacob Winograd (Bob Odenkirk), begins appearing to her and telling her she&rsquo;s a shaman whose special abilities can find out his murderer. Is she insane? It&rsquo;s animated using the rotoscoping technique. (Eight 23 min. episodes)</p>

<p>MENTALLY ILL MAGIC REALISM After a near-fatal car accident, Alma Winograd-Diaz (Rosa Salazar) awakes from a coma to discover she can see her dead father, Jacob Winograd (Bob Odenkirk), who&rsquo;s come to help her control her new power over time and space, in Undone.</p>
<p>Glen Alma doesn&rsquo;t play well with others. She and her younger sister, Becca (Angelique Cabral), love each other, but they&rsquo;re very different. Becca is about to marry Reed (Kevin Bigley), the frat-boy-esque scion of the wealthy Hollingsworth clan, and Alma knows she&rsquo;ll never love her boyfriend, Sam (Siddharth Dhananjay), enough to want to settle down. Alma&rsquo;s mother, Camila (Constance Marie), definitely doesn&rsquo;t understand her daughter, and we learn that mental illness ran in Alma&rsquo;s deceased father Jacob&rsquo;s family. Aside from getting tequila-drunk, Alma doesn&rsquo;t have much ambition, and the only thing she&rsquo;s good at is her job in a preschool, but after a car accident leaves her questioning reality, even that job becomes too much for her. This first season is basically Alma navigating her existential crisis as she tries to discover who she is and why she&rsquo;s here. It&rsquo;s very funny and engaging! Another season has been greenlit, and I&rsquo;ll definitely watch.</p>
<p>Anna Stylistically I am a big fan of the rotoscoping technique—it is such a smart way of muddying the waters between fantasy and reality and taking the audience on a journey. Not only are the characters and storyline of Undone fascinating, but it&rsquo;s just such a treat visually. Alma is both frustrating and magnetic—her quick wit and frankly hilarious antics contrast with the dull repetition she feels her life has slumped to and her bleak outlook in general. We learn pretty quickly that Alma&rsquo;s childhood was molded by several big events, including her father&rsquo;s death—times she can&rsquo;t help but travel back to in her mind and certainly still feel unresolved. Her mother and sister love her, though many times they can&rsquo;t stand her. She&rsquo;s a loose cannon near the shores of their glassy lake; who knows when she&rsquo;ll blow it all up again. I&rsquo;m all in on this series! Bring on season two!</p>
<p>Glen The rotoscoping technique allows for an easy transition between reality and fantasy. Sometimes I thought, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point?&rdquo; Then something dramatic would happen like Alma&rsquo;s car accident, a reversion into her past, or a trip into outer space, and I would realize the animation was essential to the story. This is a tale of relationships, personal growth, and metaphysics. Alma&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s research was based on what he believed was the malleable nature of time and space. When he returns to teach Alma to master, for instance, telekinesis, it&rsquo;s not through actually moving something with her mind but by using her newly discovered control over space and time. And her powers aren&rsquo;t even new; she just never manifested them until her father showed her they were there. It&rsquo;s pretty heady stuff, and the end of season one calls into question everything Alma thinks is true. Season two is teed up nicely. I can&rsquo;t find a release date for it, but it&rsquo;s definitely happening!</p>
<p>Anna Alma&rsquo;s relationship with her father, both before and after his death, is complicated. She&rsquo;s the older sibling, so she has more memory and connection to him than sister Becca. She&rsquo;s no stranger to abandonment issues and seems to have almost a sense of pride over her unattached life. The walls she&rsquo;s built up in self-protection can&rsquo;t help but crumble as her reality falls further and further away. It&rsquo;s so easy to think of both our lifetimes and time in general as a linear story; Undone has a lot of fun messing with that narrative and throwing us for loop after loop. Watching Alma&rsquo;s story unfold in a series of flashbacks and fast-forwards means that even at the end of season one we are still learning about our main character. We binged this, which is a great way to watch, but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind going back in time myself and slowing down my watch: There is a lot to enjoy here. Δ</p>

<h3 id="2020-t--f-seniors-speak-out">&ldquo;2020 T &amp; F seniors speak out&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d31029zd06w0t6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2020/05/web1_Alyssa-Dingus-Relay.jpg" alt="img">
PORTSMOUTH — Jacob Brickey aimed to break the Valley High School shot put record.</p>
<p>Faith Malone of Minford made it a goal to qualify for the regional.</p>
<p>Eric Purdy of Portsmouth planned on a redemption season with his Trojan teammates.</p>
<p>And Alyssa Dingus of Wheelersburg was prepping for a third and final trip to the state track and field meet.</p>
<p>In any other ordinary year, this indeed would have been the week of the regional meets throughout the Buckeye State, and the aforementioned foursome had high goals of competing for two days at either Fairfield Union (Division III) or Muskingum University (Division II) —with the dream of punching a coveted state tournament ticket.</p>
<p>But, of course, 2020 has been anything but any other ordinary year.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, in response to the coronavirus threat, the 2020 track and field season —like all other Ohio High School Athletic Association spring sports seasons this year — was officially canceled on April 20.</p>
<p>That was after the OHSAA twice postponed those seasons.</p>
<p>Brickey, Malone, Purdy and Dingus were just a minuscule sampling of Scioto County’s track and field seniors — seniors who won’t get another opportunity to hear that gun go off or compete in front of a full house.</p>
<p>The quartet was posed questions about their senior seasons that never were —and what possibly those senior seasons could have been.</p>
<p>Beginning with the thrower Brickey, who competed in the shot put and discus, he was a returning state placer in the Division III boys shot —having scored seventh in last season’s meet.</p>
<p>He was also an indoor state meet placer in the same event in early March — placing seventh in that competition too.</p>
<p>He was indeed after the Valley school record in the shot put, which is 56-feet.</p>
<p>His goal was to throw 62-feet in the shot and 180-feet in the disc, as he was heaving 59 or 60 feet for the 12-pound shot — when he stopped throwing that following the cancellation.</p>
<p>“If I would have had my senior season, I felt like I would have won the state in shot put, and also make the state in discus. My original thought when they (OHSAA) first postponed it (season) was I’m just going to stay optimistic about the whole situation and maybe things will clear up soon. As soon as the season was canceled, my mind was just blown. I really didn’t know how to react to it. After all of the hard work I put in throughout the summer and winter, it just felt like it was going to waste,” he said. “It upset me a lot because everyone in my community was also cheering me on and wanting to see what I could do.”</p>
<p>A Walsh University signee, Brickey began throwing the 16-pound shot in getting ready for his college campaigns.</p>
<p>Malone, who late last week announced her intention to run track at Marietta College, moved on in her training for the next level as well.</p>
<p>She ran sprints and sprint relays while at Minford, but was working on more mid-distance events as a senior, including the 400m dash and the 800m run.</p>
<p>While Malone wanted to run in the regionals, Purdy placed an emphasis on Ohio Valley Conference competition — and the Trojans’ chance for their first-ever OVC title in any sport.</p>
<p>Portsmouth has been a member of the OVC since the 2015-16 academic year.</p>
<p>Along with the long jump, Purdy ran the distance relays (4x800m and 4x400m) — and planned to run the 4x200m relay this spring.</p>
<p>“This season was honestly all about redemption and improvement. After losing the conference by a measly eight points last year, we were all really excited to get back out on the track and bring Portsmouth its first outright OVC championship. We figured we were up to the occasion. I think we definitely would’ve all improved dramatically from last year, because we were willing to put in the work to get there. My goals were to first and foremost win the conference and second to jump 21-feet (long jump),” he said.</p>
<p>But Purdy and the Trojans never got that championship shot, as he said the finality of the situation started to sink in.</p>
<p>“At first, I underestimated the severity of this (coronavirus) pandemic and the precautions that the state and the OHSAA would take to prevent the spread of this disease, so me being the fairly optimistic person that I am, I thought that we would at least have a partial track season. After the season was canceled, reality hit me that my high school days were basically over and that I could no longer run with the people I’ve considered family the past four years,” he said. “Running and competing for Portsmouth has been an absolute dream. Running with the people that I’ve grown up with and being able to compete with any team we go against was what made running for Portsmouth so special to me.”</p>
<p>Speaking of sprints and relays, Dingus did just those at Wheelersburg —running the 4x200m and 4x400m relays and the 200m and 400m dashes.</p>
<p>Sometimes she did the 100m dash or the distance relay (4x4800m), and was a two-time Division III state meet qualifier as a sophomore and junior.</p>
<p>As a sophomore (2018), she ran the 4x400m with Wheelersburg graduate and standout Ellie Ruby, and fellow 2020 seniors Gabby Deacon and Lani Irwin.</p>
<p>As a junior (2019), she ran the 4x200m with the graduated Libby Miller, junior Lauren Jolly, and Irwin —and qualified for the 400m on her own.</p>
<p>In the regional 400 finals, Dingus tied Rebecca Barnett’s school record of 59.9 seconds, which Barnett set back in 1993.</p>
<p>As part of three Southern Ohio Conference championships and one Southeast District team title, the Lady Pirates broke a 37-year-old SOC record and the Wheelersburg school mark since 1984 in the 4x200m — with a time of a minute and 47 seconds.</p>
<p>With sights set on state again, her individual and team goals were for those same two records to fall again this season.</p>
<p>“I feel like our season this year would have been a successful one. I would have loved the opportunity to add to our titles and maybe a state title. We are a very determined, driven team and individuals,” said Dingus. “We really wanted to come out strong this year, win more titles, break some more records and take as many of us as possible to the state competition.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of those goals never got a chance.</p>
<p>“Initially when spring sports were postponed, I felt disappointed but hopeful that they would start again, determined to push myself and team to succeed, to meet my personal and team goals when the time came to compete again. I continued to train, run and do my sprint workouts on my own. Then with the second postponement, I still hung on to some hope that we could still have a season even just for a few weeks, but at the same time I had fear and disappointment that it was looking bleak for my senior season, my last time with my team and coaches. I still continued to run and work out. Then when they cancelled the season, it felt like I couldn’t breathe, like someone had just punched me in the stomach and took my breath. I felt so many emotions: heartbroken, sad, pure disappointment,” she said. “As seniors, so much has been stripped away that most will never have the opportunity to do again. I am thankful that I still have the chance to compete and run again. Everyone says senior year is the best, embrace it, do all you can, make memories. Senior year is a right of passage. We lost memories and closure for a lot of things that are a very important chapter in our lives. At the same time, we had to move on and try to plan for the next chapter. I hope no senior class has to ever again experience the loss we have as the class of 2020. It is something you cannot explain or understand until you have to live it. It feels like such a huge loss and you just can’t help but cry at the lost opportunity, memories and overall experience.”</p>
<p>But still, Dingus doesn’t have any regrets on what she and her Lady Pirate teammates accomplished their first three springs.</p>
<p>In fact, she said “I will be around next year to cheer on and support the team and coaches.”</p>
<p>“I am grateful that I made it to the state competition twice as an individual and part of a team. Some athletes never get the opportunity to get there and I did twice. So for that opportunity, I am blessed. I was able to share it with the best teammates, coaches, family and friends to support and push me,” said Dingus. “I am excited to see what they accomplish next season. I want to wish them luck, and to my fellow seniors, I can’t wait to see what all you do and accomplish.”</p>
<p>It’s just a shame that the 2020 seniors never got that opportunity on the track or in the field.</p>
<p>Malone, perhaps, although speaking directly for herself spoke indirectly on behalf of her entire class.</p>
<p>“I was really counting on a good senior season. I was working harder than I ever have for this season, really hoping it would be the best season I’ve ever had,” she said. “When they told us the season was delayed, I still trained on my own, worked hard on my open events, still kept hope we would come back to school and come back and have a track season. It was very heartbreaking that I didn’t get an opportunity this year to do what I wanted to do and achieve what I wanted to achieve.”</p>

<p><img src="https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/skateboard-ramp-jump-2.jpg" alt="img">
Bitcoin price is caught in a downdraft after a series of rallies in recent weeks that repeatedly fizzled out at the $10,000 mark.</p>
<p>“There is no clear understanding where bitcoin will go,” Yuriy Mazur, head of data analytics at cryptocurrency exchange CEX.IO told CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole. “It may either retrace back to $6,500 or reach $10,000.”</p>
<p>You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.</p>
<p>Source: TradingView</p>
<p>With the near-term picture cloudy, some analysts are focusing on a longer-term trend that could be surprisingly bullish for bitcoin: the emergence of digital currencies issued by central banks.</p>
<p>It’s not an obvious investment thesis because bitcoin was invented to be used in an electronic peer-to-peer payment system that would be free of government control and operate outside of the traditional banking system.</p>
<p>And most central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, would, by their very nature, be issued and controlled by governments, and in many cases distributed through banks.</p>
<p>But Jack Purdy and Ryan Watkins of the research firm Messari wrote last week in a report that the “coming digitization of money,” including the launch of CBDCs, could provide a “secular tailwind” for bitcoin.</p>
<p>CBDCs have gained momentum over the past year as countries consider whether to roll out digital versions of their currencies to keep up with Facebook’s proposed Libra and China’s forthcoming digital currency electronic payment, which is already in testing.</p>
<p>The journal Central Banking, which is supported by the Bank of International Settlements and the European Central Bank among others, found in a survey earlier this month that some 46 countries are considering CBDCs using a constrained form of distributed ledger technology.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress in February the U.S. central bank is in the early stages of researching digital currencies, and that having a “single government currency at the heart of the financial system is something that has served us well.”</p>
<p>Even so, JPMorgan said last week in a report that “there is no country with more to lose from the disruptive potential of digital currency than the United States,” as reported by Bloomberg News. “This revolves primarily around U.S. dollar hegemony.”</p>
<p>The largest U.S. bank’s warning merely reinforces the urgency and significance of the efforts, and that’s what the Messari analysts were homing in on.</p>
<p>“Catalyzed by bitcoin and the recognition of the benefits of blockchain technology, many countries and companies around the world have begun researching, testing and launching their own digital currencies,” the analysts wrote.</p>
<p>“When these projects launch, they will have the combined effect of exposing billions of people to cryptocurrency-related technologies,” according to the report. “This will increase people’s comfort with and understanding of cryptocurrencies, get more people creating and using cryptocurrency wallets, and provide on-ramps into decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.”</p>
<p>So CBDCs might be used to facilitate purchases of bitcoin? That’s the idea.</p>
<p>Tweet of the day</p>
<p>Bitcoin watch</p>
<p>BTC: Price: $8,878 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,011 | 24-Hr Low: $8,672</p>
<p>Source: TradingView</p>
<p>Trend: While bitcoin has recovered from two-week lows reached on Monday, the cryptocurrency is yet to beat key resistance above $9,300.</p>
<p>At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $9,000, having put in a low of $8,630, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index. Prices need to cross Sunday’s high of $9,310. That would invalidate the lower highs setup on the 4-hour chart and confirm an end of the pullback from $10,000 and the revival of the bullish trend.</p>
<p>However, as long as prices are held under $9,310, the bearish view put forward by Sunday’s downside break of the ascending trendline connecting March 13 and April 21 lows would remain valid.</p>
<p>The uptick from $8,630 to $9,000 seen in the last 24 hours lacks substance, as volumes have remained low throughout the price recovery. A low-volume bounce is often short-lived. Hence, prospects of a strong move above $9,310 look bleak.</p>
<p>Besides, higher time frame charts are reporting a failed breakout. “The previous weekly candle below the long-term downtrend line support (drawn from June 2019 and February 2020 high), which locally invalidates the bullishness,” said Adrian Zduńczyk, chartered market technician and CEO of trading community The BIRB Nest.</p>
<p>So another move lower toward $8,630 cannot be ruled out. A violation there would expose 78.6% Fibonacci retracement marked at 8524. “If that level is broken, it would result in tapping into range lows support $8,000-$8,100. The 50-day average at $8,300 could also offer support,” said Zduńczyk.</p>
<p>However, if prices rise above $9,300 with strong volumes, a falling wedge breakout would be confirmed on the 4-hour chart. That would open the doors to a re-test of $10,000.</p>

Easy pickings? Not hardly when you notice the sister school to Ottawa of Atchison, Kan., has put together marks of 7-4 and 9-2 in its first two seasons, reaching the 16-team NAIA playoffs last fall.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Nesbitt evidently felt his troops were ready to pursue bigger fish and that’s very definitely what they’re hoping to do.</p>
<p>Morningside, after all, has morphed into the gold standard in NAIA football ever since Ryan got his program started with records of 5-5 and 3-7 in 2002 and ’03. In the last 12 years, his teams have gone 139-17, averaging nearly 11.6 wins to just 1.4 losses. And keep in mind 10 of the 17 setbacks have been national playoff defeats.</p>
<p>All of the above got me reminiscing on a host of not-so-sensational Saturdays at Elwood Olsen Stadium. As many recall, the place was called Roberts Stadium back when Morningside was finishing up 79 years in the North Central.</p>
<p>With no competition from 1943 through 1945 due to World War II, the old Maroon Chiefs played 76 NCC seasons and won just two conference titles. The first came in 1923, the league’s second year, and the other was in 1954, a co-championship with South Dakota State.

<p>As we race toward the Memorial Day holiday on the 25th, for the first time in history we can save the human race by laying in front of the TV and doing nothing. Let&rsquo;s not screw it up! Zillow laid out its work from home (WFH) plan: the rest of 2020. Microsoft? October at the earliest. Facebook &amp; Google for the rest of 2020. Who cares what politicians say? Owners asking people to return to an office will be faced with antibody testing, temperature monitoring, and social distancing. The coronavirus pandemic might cause lasting damage to economies and individuals by leaving companies burdened with debt and by leaving households worried about financial security. Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane: &ldquo;All crises leave scars, and this crisis assuredly will be no exception.&rdquo; Whether it is nearly every government in the world, or billions of individuals, there is a lot of borrowing going on. On a personal level, Truist’s Michele Perrin shared this video of an interview with her husband Chuck who was hit swiftly with the virus and is now, thankfully, on the slow road to recovery although his lungs were damaged and may take as much as a year to recover.</p>

<p>As Chase, Wells Fargo and others step away from HELOC lending due to current economic disruption, many borrowers need a lender to help them access their (often considerable) home equity reserves. ReverseVision President Joe Langner says this creates opportunity for lenders offering the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Because HECMs really deliver in a down market, senior homeowners are turning to the flexible HECM line of credit as an alternative to traditional HELOCs. That’s because unlike HELOCs, HECMs can&rsquo;t be canceled, recast or frozen. HECMs also give borrowers flexibility in making monthly mortgage payments. If you’d like to learn more about how this rewarding, widely underutilized lending program can benefit your senior borrowers and your bottom line, contact Wendy Peel for a free consult or demo of ReverseVision.</p>

<p>The FHFA was busy yesterday. Fannie Mae issued Lender Letter LL-2020-07, COVID-19 Payment Deferral. “Servicers will use this new workout solution to help homeowners impacted by COVID-19 financial hardships return their mortgage to current status after up to 12 months of missed payments. Designed to be simple and efficient for both servicers and borrowers, this solution moves the amount of the missed payments to the end of the loan.”</p>
<p>Freddie Mac, also overseen by the FHFA, announced “a solution for homeowners once they have resolved their COVID-19-related hardship that can quickly bring their mortgages current and put them back on track.”</p>
<p>The industry is watching moves by AmeriHome and PennyMac, two large non-bank correspondent investors. Yesterday it was PennyMac’s turn. “PennyMac will make updates to the Government LLPAs effective for all Best Effort commitments taken on or after Friday, May 15: Update values on the Government ‘FICO Price Adjustments’ Grid.” A sample of the updated rate sheet(s) was posted last night to the PennyMac Portal. “Sample rate sheet(s) will be available for download shortly after the standard rate sheet email notification is sent from ‘PennyMac Seller Pricing.’”</p>
<p>Gateway First Bank, Correspondent Lending, is amending its May 5th, 2020 announcement titled Update to Agency LLPAs: Temporary Selling Requirements Related to COVID-19. “Effective immediately, agency purchase or no cash-out refinance transactions entering into a forbearance period (as defined by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) after purchase by Gateway but prior to the loans being sold to an agency, will not be assessed the following LLPAs: 500 basis points (5.000%) for first-time home buyers, or 700 basis points (7.000%) for all other transactions. Loans that are currently in forbearance are not eligible for purchase by Gateway. Agency Cash-out refinances that enter into forbearance after purchase by Gateway and prior to being federally backed may result in a repurchase. Purchase and no cash-out refinance transactions that enter into a forbearance period (as defined by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) after purchase by Gateway, remain eligible in accordance with agency salability and clients loan purchase and sale agreement.”</p>
<p>Remember that Fannie Mae issued LL-2020-04 extending the temporary appraisal flexibilities until June 30.</p>
<p>USDA issued information on SFH Direct Loan and Grant Programs. Fiscal Year 2020 income limits for the Single Family Direct Loan and Grant Programs were published on May 4, 2020 through a Special Procedure Notice. The income limits were updated in the impacted websites and systems (e.g. UniFi and the Section 502’s Eligibility Assessment tool). The following automated worksheets were also updated, and other changes as noted below were made. Section 502 - Worksheet for Computing Income and Maximum Loan Calculator (as found on the Single Family Housing Direct Home Loans and Direct Loan Application Packagers pages). Section 504 - Automated Worksheet (as found on the Single Family Housing Repair Loans &amp; Grants page).</p>
<p>FHA, USDA, and VA have aligned to provide the housing finance industry and consumers with information that outlines their responses to forbearance and loss mitigation options available under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The Interagency COVID-19 Forbearance Fact Sheet for Servicers provides guidance to assist borrowers seeking forbearance on their mortgage loans that are insured or guaranteed by these Agencies. A separate Interagency COVID-19 Forbearance Fact Sheet for Consumers is also available.</p>
<p>This fact sheet outlines the steps borrowers need to take to request forbearance for their FHA-insured or USDA- or VA-guaranteed mortgages due to the COVID-19 National Emergency.</p>

<p>On the business loan front, World Business Lenders’ COVID-19 RELIEF LOAN PROGRAM offers financing up to $2,000,000 to businesses impacted by the pandemic, qualifying businesses by reviewing their pre-coronavirus revenues as part of its eligibility criteria; businesses can still qualify despite having little or no current cash flow. All loans are secured with adequate equity in virtually any form of real estate and WBL will take a junior lien position. The two-year loan Program is intended to make available to a struggling business the capital necessary to weather the economic storm by providing no payments until month four, interest only payments for the first year (first three months collected at closing), and loan structures with other flexible payment options.

<p>There were two main headlines moving the bond market yesterday, as U.S. Treasuries exhibited some curve-flattening action in rallying for the second day in a row. The first was Fed Chairman Powell urging the White House and Congress to spend more money to ensure their initial response to the coronavirus-induced economic downturn is not for naught. Additionally, he said that he expects only a gradual economic recovery and he repeated his opposition to a negative interest rate policy in the U.S. during his prepared remarks. In general, his outlook was pretty bleak. “There is a growing sense that the recovery may come more slowly than we would like…and that may mean that it’s necessary for us to do more,” he said.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the Chairman seems to be a firm believer that the Fed currently has enough tools in its toolkit to address the crisis, saying that negative rates are not currently under consideration. In my opinion, it’s worth noting that the Chairman said that “Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it,” to Congress when the same argument could be used about negative rates if the Fed really wants to achieve its mandate of achieving maximum employment and stable prices. Easing monetary policy is easier when inflation is low. The other headline impacting the bond market was the concerns over a second wave of coronavirus infections, which weighed on risk tolerance.</p>
<p>Some housekeeping notes. The U.S. Treasury $22 billion 30-year bond auction was met with lukewarm demand. The Producer Price Index for final demand missed expectations as it marked its biggest decrease since records began in December 2009. Most of that decline was attributed to a drop in prices for final demand goods. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, slightly missed expectations as well. The figures will certainly keep the Fed on the path at the lower bound.</p>
<p>Today’s main economic releases are already out: Weekly Initial Claims for the week ending May 9 (2.98 million!), April Export Prices (-3.3 percent), April Import Prices (-2.6 percent, ex-oil -2.5). There are three scheduled Fed presidents speaking today: Minneapolis’ Kashkari, followed by Atlanta’s Bostic and Dallas’s Kaplan. The NY Fed will conduct two FedTrade purchase operations totaling up to $4.875 billion starting with $1.625 billion UMBS15 2 percent and 2.5 percent, followed by $3.25 billion UMBS30 2 percent through 3 percent. The Desk will also report on MBS purchases for the week ending May 13 this afternoon. Additionally, today marks the Class B 48-hour notification. We begin the day with Agency MBS prices better/up nearly .125 and the 10-year yielding .62 percent after closing yesterday at 0.65 percent.</p>

<h3 id="bitwage-rolls-out-bitcoin-401k-plan-with-help-from-gemini">&ldquo;Bitwage Rolls Out Bitcoin 401(k) Plan With Help From Gemini&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?428477907" alt="img">
Employers struggling to meet the conditions set by the U.S. governmentâs loan program may find salvation in an unlikely place: a new bitcoin 401(k) plan from Bitwage.</p>
<p>Calling the product a world first, the crypto payroll company said Tuesday it had successfully trialed its bitcoin 401(k) employee pension account and would start offering the plan to companies â especially those trying to meet the 75% payroll requirement in the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).</p>
<p>The PPP has proven to be a lifeline for U.S. businesses struggling in the coronavirus pandemic. A total of $660 billion has been lent out nationwide by the Small Business Administration (SBA). To incentivize staff retention, the program offers 100% loan forgiveness if employers spend at least 75% of funds received on payroll expenses.</p>

<p>Crucially, the SBA includes things such as retirement benefits in the bucket of payroll expenses, says Bitwage. It adds that devoting some of the loans into 401(k) plans can count towards hitting the crucial 75% target.</p>
<p>âThis gives companies an opportunity to provide matching or profit sharing contributions to employee 401k accounts in order to help close the gap to receive full loan forgiveness,â Bitwage said in a press release. âTogether with the PPP program, the Bitwage Bitcoin 401(k) Plan allows employers to get more out of their PPP loans, while providing their employees new and innovative investment options.â</p>

<p>Based in San Francisco, Bitwage wants to integrate cryptocurrencies into everyday life. Company clients can use Bitwage to offer their employees the option to have their wages paid in crypto. Although its primary focus remains on the U.S. it has set its sights on a more global clientele, offering fiat support in more than eighteen different currencies.</p>
<p>Related: Bitcoin IRA Is Letting Customers Lend Out Their Crypto Retirement Funds</p>
<p>The Bitcoin 401(k) plan is a collaboration with three other firms: crypto exchange Gemini, the custodian service Kingdom Trust, as well as the established pension provider, Leading Retirement Solutions, who keep records for the 401(k) plan with the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<p>âOur vision includes integrating a cryptocurrency trading engine directly inside of the 401(k) Plan so institutional as well as retail investors have access to the same exchange-grade trading tools inside of tax-incentivized retirement accounts,â Bitwage said.</p>
<p>Although Bitwageâs plan is geared toward employers interested in offering bitcoin, employees can also choose to gain exposure to traditional asset classes too, including equities and bonds, via its link-up with Leading Retirement Solutions.</p>
