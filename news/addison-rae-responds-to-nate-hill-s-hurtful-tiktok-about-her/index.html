Addison Rae responded to a diss track about her from Fortnite pro Nate Hill, publicly denouncing the FaZe Clan member’s video as “hurtful” and “fueling negativity.”</p>
<p>While the video was made to address the “people infesting [his] timeline with bad Addison Rae tweet replies,” the content of the clip was largely focused on the 19-year-old’s physical appearance and nature of her content.</p>
<p>The video instantly gained traction around the internet among fans, streamers and influencers alike. Hill, as well as a portion of his friends and fans, enjoyed the track. Others, including Rae, did not.</p>
<p>“This makes me really sad,” Rae said of the track. “I can’t change how people interact with me or my tweets&hellip; but I’m thankful they do&hellip; I struggle with body image and insecurities in general and this can be so hurtful.”</p>

<p>Rae said that the content of the track “can tear someone’s self-esteem up if they’re already having negative thoughts in their own head.”</p>
<p>Hill’s “researched” track included lyrics such as “there’s better girls than Addison Rae” and “I see hotter girls every day.”</p>
<p>This makes me really sad. I can’t change how people interact with me or my tweets.. but i’m thankful they do. They have kindness they aren’t afraid to share with me and i’m grateful for that. I struggle with body image and insecurities in general and this can be so hurtful — addison rae (@whoisaddison) April 6, 2020</p>
<p>Many hit out at Hill for the since-deleted video’s content since it was out of character for the streamer.</p>

<p>“This dude has ‘positivity’ in his title every stream yet went out of his way to make an entire ass song tearing down someone who he’s never met or done anything wrong,” Twitter user ‘THump’ said. “Imagine being that weird.”</p>
<p>Also replying to the tweet was fellow FaZe member ‘Ewok,’ saying that the video was &ldquo;Unnecessary. But it’s obviously impression farming.”</p>
<p>The term refers to an online strategy that’s sole purpose is to be consumed by as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Made a song earlier that didn’t land well. Had no intention of hurting anyone. We’ll do better next time 🤝 — Nate Hill (@NateHillTV) April 6, 2020</p>
<p>Rae decried the clip: “I say these things because [Hill] has a large platform and is choosing to use it to spread and fuel negativity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It should be said that these kind of diss tracks are frequent and menial in the streaming space, but the content of the song didn’t conjure the reaction Hill was hoping for.</p>

<h3 id="kyle-kuzma-suffering-in-self-isolation-appears-to-shoot-his-shot-with-tiktok-star-addison-rae">Kyle Kuzma, Suffering In Self-Isolation, Appears To Shoot His Shot With TikTok Star Addison Rae</h3>
<p><img src="https://brobible.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/kyle-kuzma-appears-to-shoot-his-shot-with-tiktok-star-addison-rae.jpg?quality=90&amp;w=650" alt="img">

<p>Last month, Iman Shumpert revealed that he and his wife Teyana Taylor exchanged lists of the famous people they’d slept with when they first started dating.</p>
<p>If Lakers star Kyle Kuzma ever has to do that with someone they’d better pack a lunch because they could be there awhile.</p>
<p>Kuzma, who was last seen with actress Vanessa Hudgens after the two of them got flirty on Instagram, must be dying inside due to having to practice social distancing and self-isolation for such a long time.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old power forward is quite the social butterfly having also been linked to, among others, Kendall Jenner, Farrah Abraham, and IG model Katya Elise Henry, who most recently exchanged very flirtatious social media messages with Miami Heat star Tyler Herro.</p>
<p>So naturally, seeing as how Kuzma can barely contain himself on social media when it comes to the ladies, it should come as little surprise that his latest attempt to get friendly with someone came on TikTok.</p>
<p>The target of his desire? TikTok star Addison Rae Easterling, who along with Charli D’Amelio, and Dixie D’Amelio, performed during the 2020 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.</p>
<p>With 11 million followers on Instagram and over 31 million followers on TikTok, Kuzma might have a tough time getting his message through to the 19-year-old Addison Rae, but it won’t be for lack of trying – and much to the amusement of NBA fans.</p>

TikTok star Addison Rae sat down with makeup mogul James Charles for a collaborative video, where she gave her two cents on critics claiming that her content isn’t difficult to make.</p>
<p>Unlike YouTube, TikTok is a short-form video platform, giving users a maximum amount of fifteen seconds to fill their clips with as much creativity as they can muster.</p>
<p>While stars like Addison Rae, Charli D’Amelio, and others are best known for their viral dance videos, TikTok also boasts a slew of reactions, comedic skits, and other content aside from its origins in Musical.ly lip-syncing.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t stop many critics of the platform for blasting its most popular videos, with some calling the viral dance clips and lip-syncing uploads as “nothing.”</p>
<p>James Charles brought this up during his collab video with Rae, who responded by noting the effort TikTokkers put into their videos is no different from top YouTubers, and explained that the fifteen-second time limit puts a huge strain on their creative process.</p>
<p>“Being on TikTok, I feel like people do have the idea that it is a bunch of nothing, and we’re just sitting in our rooms making videos, and it’s super easy,” she began. “&hellip;Yeah, it may be a fifteen-second video, but it’s like, you want to make it the best fifteen seconds that anyone’s ever watched, you know?”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>She went on to clarify that many TikTokkers aren’t limiting themselves to one platform, either, noting that putting out content on multiple websites is a full-time career.</p>
<p>“It goes with a lot of time in learning the dances, coming up with the dances, coming up with skits,” she continued. “Yeah, TikTok may be a fifteen-second video, but it’s like, when we’re working on other platforms, as well… it’s all a big job.”</p>

<p>Rae isn’t the only one who has come under fire from critics as of late, either; social media celeb Charli D’Amelio has likewise spoken at length on the effects of TikTok stardom, claiming that she’s even been yelled at by fans’ angry moms and followed into bathroom stalls.</p>
<p>Rae and D’Amelio’s testimonies just go to show that online stardom isn’t all sunshine and roses; it requires hard work, time, and opens them up to a slew of online criticism in the process.
