<p>A new report from Parrot Analytics suggests that television viewers have an increased interest in two of Netflix&rsquo;s most socially-relevant series.</p>
<p>“Dear White People” and “When They See Us” are enjoying large viewership spikes as Americans seek out socially-relevant television content amidst the ongoing nationwide protests.</p>
<p>A new report from data firm Parrot Analytics noted that U.S. demand for “Dear White People” grew 329 percent over the last week, while “When They See Us” was up 147 percent compared to the previous week. The firm tracked demand for both series, which are available on Netflix, from May 27 to June 2. The third season of “Dear White People” and Ava DuVernay’s “When They See Us” miniseries premiered in mid-2019.</p>
<p>Parrot Analytics reported on the increased interest in both series following a week of nationwide protests regarding the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was killed by a white police officer in Minnesota last week.</p>
<p>“During a week of pain and protest, these series are finding a resurgence of demand,” Ashley Alleyne-Morris, Parrot Analytics’ partner insights director, said in a statement. “Whether it’s a satirical look at dealing with discrimination at majority white spaces (universities) or a true story about the miscarriage of justice faced by the Central Park Five, new audiences appear to be turning to these stories as a form of education and understanding of the black experience in America.”</p>

<p>While the data shows a sharp uptick in interest for the two series, it’s unclear exactly how many viewers are watching those shows. A Parrot Analytics representative told IndieWire that because Netflix does not regularly release viewership data for its titles, Parrot Analytics instead measures engagement via data points such as file sharing, downloads, social video, research, and social media.</p>
<p>Although the specific number of people who are tuning in to ”Dear White People” and “When They See Us” is unknown, it’s not particularly surprising that they’re seeing upticks in popularity, given their topical content and high quality. All three seasons of “Dear White People” and the “When They See Us” miniseries garnered significant attention at launch and both titles have been critically acclaimed. IndieWire’s Ben Travers praised the former show’s third season and “When They See Us” in his B+ and B reviews last year, respectively.</p>

<p>When They See Us is the four-part miniseries from 13th and Selma director, Ava DuVernay. The series dramatises the true story of the Central Park Five, who were falsely accused and wrongfully convicted of the rape and assault of a woman in Central Park, New York. Express.co.uk has everything you need to know about the real prosecutors in the case.</p>
<p>Trending</p>
<p>Who were the lead prosecutors in the Central Park 5 case? Elizabeth Lederer (played by Vera Farmiga) was the lead prosecutor in the Central Park Five case. Her co-prosecutor was Tim Clements (Alex Breaux). The prosecution was overseen by Linda Fairstein (Felicity Huffman) who was head of the sex crimes unit of the Manhattan District Attorney’s office from 1976 until 2002. She assigned assistant district attorney (ADA) Elizabeth Lederer as the trial prosecutor alongside another ADA Tim Clements for the trials that were held in 1990.

<p>READ MORE When They See Us: What really happened to Korey Wise&rsquo;s sister? As shown in When They See Us, Fairstein’s department led the immediate investigation into the Central Park Five case and the wrongful arrest of five teenagers – four African-American and one Hispanic – after a white female jogger was raped and assaulted in New York’s Central Park on April 19, 1989. The mini-series, which is based on the true accounts of Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Korey Wise, interview transcripts and court documents, which revealed the five boys - all under the age of 16 - were interviewed without an adult present and were held for more than 24 hours with little breaks. Antron, Kevin, Raymond and Korey all signed written confessions and Yusef made a verbal confession did but did not sign.</p>
<p>When They See Us on Netflix tells the story of The Central Park 5</p>
<p>All five of the accused teenagers pleaded not guilty and claimed their confessions were coerced through interrogation and intimidation. Their confessions served as evidence in their trials and all five boys were found guilty, despite the DNA found on the victim not matching any of those accused. Lederer was the lead prosecutor on the case and played a vital role in securing their wrongful convictions. In 2002, the convictions of Wise, Salaam, McCray, Santana and Richarson were overturned when the real attacker, Matias Reyes, confessed to the crime while serving a life sentence in prison. In 2002, after Wise, Salaam, McCray, Santana and Richardson were exonerated, the five sued the City of New York for malicious prosecution, racial discrimination and emotional distress. In 2014, the case was finally settled for $41 million [£32 million], the largest settlement in New York State history.

<p>Where is prosecutor Elizabeth Lederer now? Following her retirement from the DA’s office in 2002, Fairstein has gone on to become a successful crime novelist. Fairstein wrote and published a staggering 23 books since stepping down from the DA’s office. Following the release of When They See Us in June 2019, Elizabeth Lederer resigned from her long-held position as lecturer at Columbia Law School. In a letter posted on the Columbia Law School Instagram, law school Dean Gillian Lester said in a statement: “The mini-series has reignited a painful—and vital—a national conversation about race, identity, and criminal justice. “I am deeply committed to fostering a learning environment that furthers this important and ongoing dialogue, one that draws upon the lived experiences of all members of our community and actively confronts the most difficult issues of our time.” She also cited Lederer as saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my years teaching at CLS, and the opportunity it has given me to interact with the many fine students who elected to take my classes. &ldquo;However, given the nature of the recent publicity generated by the Netflix portrayal of the Central Park case, it is best for me not to renew my teaching application.&rdquo; As of June 2019, Lederer continues to serve as an active prosecutor in the New York County District Attorney’s Office.

<p><img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2020/02/ava-duvernay-publicists-guild-honor.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
Oscar-nominated director Ava DuVernay will host a live discussion of her critically-acclaimed Netflix series “When They See Us,” which tells the story of “The Exonerated Five” — Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana Jr. and Korey Wise — the five young men who were wrongfully convicted of the rape and assault of a woman in Central Park in 1989.</p>
<p>Commemorating the one year anniversary of the release of the four-part drama series, DuVernay will watch the first episode and chat along with audiences in real time.</p>
<p>Tonight at 5pm PST, join our IG Live Watch + Chat for WHEN THEY SEE US via @ava. Spread the word. pic.twitter.com/glgxGC3xzn — ARRAYNow (@ARRAYNow) May 31, 2020</p>
<p>The virtual watch party also follows the news that DuVernay’s production company Array Now has officially launched Array 101, an educational initiative aimed to bridge the gap between Hollywood and social justice by providing educational resources to help audiences explore the historical context of the story and work through the emotional questions it brings up. Featured on the site, is a detailed breakdown of the themes of each episode as well as a field study guide full of educational tools for teachers, students and journalists about how to use data analysis effectively.</p>
<p>Discussing the initiative during an interview with “CBS This Morning” host Gayle King, Duvernay explained the need for the resource, “So many people came up to me and were like, ‘I cried’ and ‘I couldn’t finish it.’ I think what I failed to do and many people in Hollywood failed to do and other people failed to do was connect the dots between the thing you make and the people who are watching it, particularly young people.”</p>
<p>She continued: “What I found is, to have people sign this petition or everyone go to this protest, everyone may not be interested in taking action in that way. There’s a full array of options that we suggest and really invite people to go further.”</p>
<p>To watch along, join @ava on Instagram at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. PT.

<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/when-they-see-us-trailer-pic-2.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
EXCLUSIVE: Having already seen one lawsuit against the Emmy winning and Peabody Awards nominated When They See Us miniseries tossed out of court, Netflix and Ava DuVernay are aiming today to get the defamation action by ex-Central Park Five prosecutor Linda Fairstein dismissed too.</p>
<p>“Plaintiff’s claims fail under the First Amendment as a matter of law,” says the three-pronged filings Monday by the Oscar nominated director, the streamer and co-defendant WTSU producer/writer Attica Locke. “Material falsity is essential to any defamation claim and is an element Plaintiff must establish,” says the motion to dismiss put in the federal court docket today in response to ex-Assistant District Attorney for New York County Fairstein’s wide spread damages and apology seeking initial complaint of March 18.</p>
<p>Related Story NBCUniversal Smacked In The Mouth With $2.8B Lawsuit By Teeth Straightening Company Over Critical News Report</p>
<p>“Here, the Series is an artistic dramatization of controversial and contested historical events. Plaintiff’s complaint that the Series’ portrayal of her is “false” because it ‘depict[s] her at places where she never was’ and “puts words in her mouth” that ‘she never uttered’ is simply a non sequitur,” the motion adds (READ ALL THE DEFENDANTS’ FILINGS TODAY HERE, HERE &amp; HERE)</p>
<p>The context is obvious: not every scene and piece of dialogue is a transcription of actual conversations but involves “the selective editing of real history not only for time but also for clarity, flow, and emotional impact,'” the 36-page document from attorneys at offices of Dentons US LLP states. “Another District Judge recently recognized just that in dismissing defamation claims based on the Series by an interrogation training company.”</p>
<p>Back on March 23, U.S. District Court Judge Manish Shah axed the effort started in October 2019 by John E. Reid &amp; Associates over their issue with a reference to the company’s trademark controversial interrogation technique in the four-part When They See Us.</p>
<p>Here, Netflix, DuVernay and Locke either want the matter ended over jurisdiction because none of them have anything to do with the state of Florida, where Fairstein filed and recently moved. Correspondingly, in a separate document, the parties want this latest case against the hard hitting WTSU halted under California’s anti-SLAPP statutes and the freedom of expression it protests, as does the Constitution.</p>
<p>In her legal swipe earlier this year, Fairstein used a similar tone to her Wall Street Journal op-ed of June 2019, in claiming that WTSU showed her as a “racist, unethical villain who is determined to jail innocent children of color at any cost.” The one time then head of the Manhattan D.A.’s sex crimes unit goes on to insist that her Felicity Huffman-portrayed depiction in the miniseries “are complete fabrications and readily contradicted by evidence in the public record.”</p>
<p>At the time, Netflix said that “Linda Fairstein’s frivolous lawsuit is without merit. Today they made that POV a bit more official</p>
<p>“Equally clear is that the Series has a distinct point of view: that of the Five,” the defendants said in their mutual filings in the middle district of the Sunshine State. “Having told her side of the story, the First Amendment does not allow Plaintiff to silence their story and belief, founded on the facts leading to their exoneration, that the prosecution she helped lead was a colossal injustice.”</p>
<p>When They See Us dramatically depicts the already very dramatic and careless rush to justice against five young men falsely accused in the near-fatal 1989 rape of a woman who was jogging in Central Park. With the five hammered by the media, Donald Trump and law enforcement, Fairstein was a very public presence in the various cases and trials that followed. At the time, the now crime novelist and former ICM Partners client took a lot of credit for the convictions of Rayomond Santana, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, and Korey Wise.</p>
<p>Wrongful convictions it became clear decades later.</p>
<p>In 2001, serial rapist and murderer Matias Reyes confessed to the attack while behind bars for another crime; his statements were confirmed by DNA evidence and knowledge of the scene. While the Exonerated Five eventually saw their names cleared in 2014 after a long long effort, Reyes was never prosecuted for the rape because the Empire State’s then statute of limitations on such sex crimes had expired.</p>
<p>In October of last year,WTSU’s Jharrel Jerome won the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance as Wise.

<p>Santana, 45, shared several Instagram photos of the happy couple posing together for their wedding pictures, writing on each of the photos, &ldquo;#THESANTANAS&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deelishis (née Chandra Davis) wore a stunning white dress for the nuptials, while Santana opted for a white suit with a black vest and black bowtie.</p>
<p>The VH1 reality star, 42, also shared a look at the wedding on her Instagram Story, including videos of her throwing the bouquet and dancing with fellow guests.</p>
<p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kandi Burruss was among the attendees and shared an Instagram photo with the happy couple. &ldquo;Congratulations @santanaraymond &amp; @iamsodeelishis!!!!! I’m so happy for y’all &amp; I&rsquo;m happy to say that I had a little something to do with this love connection! ❤️❤️,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>The Bravo star shared another photo of just she and Deelishis, writing, &ldquo;Sorry fellas she’s off the market now! 🤣 @iamsodeelishis 🙌🏾.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In December, Santana and Deelishis announced they were engaged, sharing videos on Instagram that showed Santana asking her to marry him at a restaurant.</p>
<p>Reps for both Deelishis and Santana also confirmed the engagement to PEOPLE at the time.</p>
<p>The couple, who both have children from previous relationships, confirmed they were dating in October after Santana had been posting photos with Deelishis for some time.</p>

<p>Deelishis was a contestant on season 2 of VH1’s Flavor of Love. She won the competition after she was chosen over Tiffany “New York” Pollard.</p>
<p>Santana, meanwhile, gained national attention last year following the release of Ava Duvernay&rsquo;s hit Netflix series When They See Us, which explores the false convictions of five men — Korey Wise, Yusef Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson and Santana — when they were accused of raping a woman in New York City’s Central Park in 1989.

ARRAY 101&rsquo;s learning guides allow participants to &ldquo;explore systemic injustice&rdquo; and &ldquo;take action to change themselves, institutions and systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A year after the release of her Emmy-winning Netflix series When They See Us, filmmaker Ava DuVernay is continuing to share the story of the Exonerated Five while also furthering the conversation around social justice.</p>
<p>In a new online education initiative called ARRAY 101, launched by DuVernay&rsquo;s multiplatform media company and arts collective ARRAY, learning guides will be created for the company&rsquo;s films and television series.</p>
<p>The first to receive a guide is DuVernay&rsquo;s Netflix miniseries recounting five teenagers — Kevin Richardson, Antron Mccray, Raymond Santana Jr., Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam — who were wrongfully convicted of a Central Park rape in 1989.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’re thrilled to partner with Participant to launch our first ARRAY 101 learning companion, which expands on themes and topics in When They See Us. I firmly believe that there must be a stronger bridge between what our industry produces and real teachers in classrooms,&rdquo; said DuVernay in a statement. &ldquo;The one-year broadcast anniversary of the series was the ideal time to release this social impact learning supplement and kick-off ARRAY’s upcoming study guide initiative overall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When They See Us shines a timely and important light on the many challenges and pitfalls of the criminal justice system, which are heightened even more by COVID-19,&rdquo; added David Linde, CEO of Participant in a statement. &ldquo;We are proud to partner with Ava DuVernay and ARRAY on the When They See Us Learning Companion to educate the public, building from the power of an artist’s original voice, about the state of criminal justice reform and offer students, advocates and organizations resources to take action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While sharing news of the initiative&rsquo;s launch Thursday on her Instagram, DuVernay noted that the question she is most asked after people watch her films is, &ldquo;What do I do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to this new initiative, not only can such questions be answered but according to DuVernay, all those who watch can find &ldquo;fresh ways to broaden our knowledge and challenge our thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ARRAY 101 will produce supplemental learning materials for students in grades nine and above, becoming a resource to those looking to further their knowledge of social justice and advocacy. Beginning Thursday, the When They See Us Learning Companion is available via download from ARRAY 101 and Participant. The guide includes an interactive section, featuring eight project-based, field study lessons that invite students to create news stories around the Exonerated Five case using public data analysis.</p>
<p>Along with the release of the inaugural guide for ARRAY 101, DuVernay will host an Instagram Live Watch event on May 31 featuring a screening with commentary on When They See Us&rsquo; first episode, and discussion on the series overall. The event pays tribute to the one-year anniversary of the Netflix broadcast, and will go live at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET. from the the filmmaker&rsquo;s own Instagram account.</p>
<p>Future guides will feature ARRAY projects Burning Cane, Jezebel, They’ve Gotta Have Us and The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open in the coming months.
