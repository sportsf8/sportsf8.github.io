<p>In the Twitter message, Russell said “ #Trump you projected your narrative that #TakingAKnee is disrespectful &amp; #UnAmerican it was never about that! You are divisive &amp; a coward. It takes true courage 2 stand 4 what is right &amp; risk your life in the midst of a #pandemic #Proud2kneel #BlackLivesMatter .”</p>
<p>Boston Celtics great Bill Russell called President Trump a coward in a recent overnight tweet, as protests demonstrating against police brutality and systemic racism continued throughout the country.</p>
<p>In the tweet, the NBA Hall-of-Famer can be seen kneeling with the Presidential Medal of Freedom bestowed on by then-President Obama in 2011, around his neck. It appears to be a photo Russell has previously tweeted. The recent message also quote-tweeted Trump saying, “We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!”</p>
<p>Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started taking a knee during the national anthem in 2016 as a way to protest police brutality and racial injustice in the US. Kaepernick, who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl, has been exiled from the NFL in recent years, with the quarterback saying he has been blackballed for his role in starting a wave of protests. Kaepernick has insisted all along he was good enough to play in the league.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Two days ago, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was wrong for not listening to players fighting for racial equality and encourages them to peacefully protest, as a multitude of demonstrations against systemic racism unfolded nationwide.</p>
<p>Protests have continued locally. Recent demonstrations, which have been held daily in Boston for more than a week, have focused mostly on the killing of George Floyd but also on the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville and racial inequality at large.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Floyd, a 46-year-old handcuffed Black man, died on Memorial Day when a white Minneapolis police officer pinned his knee to Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Taylor, an EMT, was killed in March by police executing a “no-knock” warrant. She would have turned 27 last Friday.</p>
<p>Last week, Russell offered some candid thoughts on the recent protests in the wake of Floyd’s death.</p>
<p>Russell, who won 11 titles with the Celtics and also garnered five league MVPs, was the foundation of the team’s 1960s dynasty. A bronze statue, unveiled outside City Hall in 2013, was considered by some to be a long-overdue tribute to the basketball legend in a city Russell once considered bigoted.</p>
<p>Russell, who became the first Black coach in major professional sports in North America when he was named Celtics player-coach in 1966, has often spoken out on civil rights issues, dating back to his time in Boston. He attended the 1963 March on Washington and was a supporter of Muhammad Ali at a time when the boxer was drawing controversy over his decision not to serve in the military.</p>
<p>“Bill Russell the man is someone who stood up for the rights and dignity of all men,” said Obama at the 2011 Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony.</p>

<h3 id="bill-russell-rips-president-donald-trumps-stance-against-mail-in-voting-during-coronavirus-pandemic">&ldquo;Bill Russell rips President Donald Trump’s stance against mail-in voting during coronavirus pandemic&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.masslive.com/resizer/oxM-W5rNBDw6aTCmbNLOqrLuN2g=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/R2Q63TX72RFGZN26IM3SVNKSIY.jpg" alt="img">
Former Boston Celtics great Bill Russell appears to be picking another fight with President Donald Trump in the commander in chief’s favorite arena - Twitter.</p>
<p>Russell attacked the president for his opposition to voting by mail, which has become a controversial topic in recent weeks because of the coronavirus pandemic. Russell tweeted:</p>
<p>“Hello @realDonaldTrump there is a good reason for #VoteByMail not sure if you have heard of #coronavirus #COVIDー19 or better known as a #pandemic bit I don’t want to risk my life to #vote ! @MSNBC @CNN”</p>
<p>Several states are considering allowing mail in voting to avoid voting lines and election gatherings that would make social distancing and maintaining disinfected voting stations a challenge.</p>
<p>Russell’s tweet follows Trump’s own Twitter threat to Nevada to withhold federal funds for sending out mail-in ballots:</p>
<p>&ldquo;State of Nevada “thinks” that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots, creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S. They can’t! If they do, “I think” I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry, but you must not cheat in elections. @RussVought45 @USTreasury</p>
<p>At 86 years old, Russell is more vulnerable to the affects of coronavirus, which has been particularly dangerous to people 60 and older.</p>
<p>Russell, an NBA Hall of Famer, won 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons and was a leader in the civil rights movement both in Boston and nationally. He the NBA’s first African American coach and attended the 1963 March on Washington. In 2011, President Barack Obama, who Trump has an acrimonious relationship with, awarded Russell the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>
<p>Russell tagged MSNBC and CNN in his Tweet, likely in an attempt to draw attention to his attempt to pick a fight. It’s not the first time Russell has gone after Trump using a similar approach. When the president criticized LeBron James and CNN’s Don Lemon in 2018, Russell tweeted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time &amp; place for any African American, @KingJames @donlemon @RepMaxineWaters @repjohnlewis &amp; #NFL plyrs to be criticised by @realdonaldtrump means you must be doing something right! As I have said before- Its the biggest compliment you can get. @TwitterSports @MSNBC @CNN</p>
<p>Russell did the same thing when Trump famously used a derogatory phrase about the origin of many immigrants:</p>
<p>“Is @realDonaldTrump aware the first people to come here from #”SHIThole&rdquo; countries did not come willingly, they came as slaves to build this country and the White House #Racismhasnologic @Lawrence @CNN @NBA @JoyAnnReid @FoxNews @POTUS #MLKDay2018″</p>

<h3 id="nba-legend-bill-russell-has-been-married-4-times--meet-his-4th-wife-jeannine">&ldquo;NBA Legend Bill Russell Has Been Married 4 Times – Meet His 4th Wife Jeannine&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.amomama.com/241eac0ecb237689c2321eca220583f7.jpg?width=650&amp;height=340" alt="img">
The NBA legend was one of the most acclaimed players in NBA history and still is. His defensive style on the court was a big influence on players in the future. At 85 years old, he still holds his stand over racism and is married for the fourth time.</p>
<p>One of the greatest players in NBA history, Bill Russell, is currently in his 4th marriage. At 85 years old, he is still active going to watch basketball games with his wife Jeannine Russell, as he shows in his Instagram account.</p>
<p>In a 2018 Halloween post, Bill wrote that he and Jeannine “go together like Bacon &amp; Eggs”. On another photo posted, the couple watched the Los Angeles Lakers and the former player captioned the image saying he had a wonderful time with his wife. Both appear happy and smiling as Bill wears a Celtics cap.</p>
<p>LIFE ACHIEVEMENTS</p>
<p>Born in 1934, William Felton Russell, is considered one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history. Russell started his professional career with the Boston Celtics in 1956 and played with the team for 13 years, leading the club to 11 championship titles.</p>
<p>The former player had a dominating presence on the court as a defender and an impressive ability to rebound. He was also named five times the NBA’s Most Valuable Player. He retired the game after the 1969 season was over, and after that, he frequently came back as a coach or executive for many years.</p>

<p>Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975, but did not accept the ring until 2019, when ex-NBA star, Chuck Cooper, was also inducted in the Hall, whom he considered should be in the Hall of Fame before him.</p>
<p>In 2010 Bill also received from President Barack Obama, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, considered the country’s highest civil honor. He has three children from his first marriage to Rose Swisher, a daughter named Karen, who is a lawyer and TV pundit, and sons William Jr. and Jacob.</p>
<p>RACISM ISSUES</p>
<p>His achievements on the court were only a part of his outstanding career, as he had to face racism while rewriting Boston basketball history. On a few occasions, his home was assaulted, as well as he was rejected from being served at cafeterias. He also once heard from a reporter that he would not get MVP for being black.</p>
<p>In 2017, Bill showed his support to NFL players by posting a photo on social media to reject declarations made by President Trump. The image shows the NBA star kneeling proudly in front of the camera, with the caption: &ldquo;Proud to take a knee and stand tall against social injustice”.

FILE PHOTO: Basketball – NBA – Charlotte Hornets v Milwaukee Bucks – AccorHotels Arena, Paris, France – January 24, 2020 Milwaukee Bucks’ Giannis Antetokounmpo reacts REUTERS/Benoit Tessier</p>
<p>Several Bucks players, led by reigning league MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo, spoke and marched on Saturday in Milwaukee at a protest against racial injustice and police brutality.</p>
<p>Among the other Bucks players present were his brother Thanasis Antetokounmpo, as well as Brook Lopez, Sterling Brown, Donte DiVincenzo, Frank Mason and Cam Reynolds. All wore shirts reading “I can’t breathe,” a reference to the words of George Floyd before he died in police custody on May 25 in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Floyd, an African American, died after officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeled on his neck for eight-plus minutes. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter, while three other officers have been charged with abetting murder and manslaughter.</p>
<p>“We want change,” Antetokounmpo said in address to other protestors. “We want justice. That’s why we’re out here. That’s what we’re going to do today. That’s why I’m going to march with you guys.</p>
<p>“I want my kid to grow up and not to be scared to walk down the street. I don’t want my kid to have hate in his heart. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter the color. We’re not black, white, yellow. It doesn’t matter. We’re all human beings.”</p>
<p>The Bucks also announced Saturday they will lead a protest march in support of social justice on Sunday, with players, coaches, ownership, management and staff all expected to take part.</p>

Players, coaches and administrators from college football teams across the country gathered Saturday to take part in unity walks with their campus communities.</p>
<p>FILE PHOTO: University of Southern California head coach Lane Kiffin directs his team against Stanford University during the second quarter of their NCAA football game in Palo Alto, California September 15, 2012. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith</p>
<p>In Oxford, Miss., Lane Kiffin said it was important to take part “after listening to our players throughout the week,” the first-year Rebels coach told ESPN.</p>
<p>“We’re going to work together to make sure things change. They have to change. This is a good step, but just the first step,” said Kiffin.</p>
<p>In Tampa, Fla., USF senior cornerback and Tampa native KJ Sails organized a walk that attracted 300-400 people, who endured a rainy day to send a message of hope and change in the wake of the global protests that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.</p>
<p>“We walked peacefully, and there was no chaos. We simply walked as one, and I feel like it spoke measures to the world,” Sails told ESPN. “It’s not about color. It’s about coming together as one, as a community, to show that together we can sow change.”</p>
<p>USF coach Jeff Scott called the walk a “powerful statement.”</p>
<p>“That message of unity was preached from our players starting on Monday. I really like what I have seen from the guys taking some meaningful steps this week in bringing everyone together,” Scott told ESPN.</p>
<p>In Charlotte, 49ers football coach Will Healy joined 500 others in a march through campus.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to make sure we continue to push the button,” Healy told ESPN. “This is great. A march is great. Voting is great. They’re great steps, but the real thing is, can we continue to run the race? We can’t get complacent and feel like we fixed it because we let them go vote.”</p>

Drew Brees may end up with more apologies than touchdown passes in 2020.</p>
<p>Brees spoke his mind the other day and has been forced to atone for that offense — and every other sin ever committed by the United States.</p>
<p>History doesn’t repeat itself. It merely evolves. African-American athletes have been making the case that black lives matter since Jack Johnson first won the heavyweight title in 1908. Johnson was put in jail due to something called the Mann Act, in large part because he had a white wife.</p>
<p>Like it or not, sports are a major force driving racial equality and magnifying inequity. Nothing blurs color lines faster than a bases-loaded double, a gold medal in the 100-meter dash or a first down on third-and-10. That’s true even when the huge majority of the coaches, GMs and owners are white.</p>
<p>Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Tommie Smith, Juan Carlos, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Muhammad Ali, Curt Flood, Bill Russell, Wilma Rudolph, Joe Louis, Jim Brown, Alan Page, Tommie Harper, Willie O’Ree, Fritz Pollard, Bobby Marshall, Earl Lloyd, Charlie Sifford, Althea Gibson, Arthur Ashe and many others not listed opened doors and fought like hell for equality, freedom and justice before Colin Kaepernick took his first knee, cashed his first Nike check or settled with the NFL for an undisclosed sum and signed a confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p>“Stick to sports!?” This issue has stuck to sports. That’s a good thing for those who desire change in how law enforcement does its job, those who think “defunding the police” is insanity, those who are sickened by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and too many others, those who are repulsed by flaccid leaders who fiddle as their cities go up in flames, and those who stand during the national anthem while understanding why others don’t.</p>
<p>These categories are not mutually exclusive, by the way.</p>
<p>Who were the first larger-than-life figures in your life? For so many of us, they were athletes.</p>
<p>Growing up in Greater Boston in the 1970s and ’80s, those figures were nearly all white. Those under 35 who have Bay State Sports DNA were weaned on the likes of Pedro Martinez, David Ortiz, Andre Tippett and Paul Pierce – not to mention Roger Clemens and Tom Brady.</p>
<p>Those flirting with Boston sports for the first time in 2020 were able to follow the journey of Celtics forward Jaylen Brown on social media as he traveled from Boston to Atlanta to organize a demonstration in his hometown and peacefully protest following the death of Floyd.</p>
<p>The kids in New England so wanted to love Mookie Betts forevah, but the Old Towne Team shipped him 3,000 miles west because of fiscal concerns. The Red Sox have gone 43,506 days without a black manager, but they did observe 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence on Thursday in Floyd’s memory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boston has marked 142,353 days off the calendar without a black mayor. But who’s counting? Willie Gross, the job is yours for life if you want it.</p>
<p>The deadly violence unleashed against the likes of retired St. Louis police captain David Dorn, the destruction of hundreds of inner-city businesses – many owned by minorities – and the antics of the those raising hell have nearly drowned out the message of legitimate peaceful protesters.</p>
<p>At least they wiped out those COVID-19 concerns in the process.</p>
<p>The life experience of the White Woke Kinder screaming the loudest is often limited to extra-curricular activities in high school and college, hashtags and virtue signaling that can be seen from the International Space Station.</p>
<p>They cite grievances going back to the fact that the “Star-Spangled Banner” contains a verse that mentions slaves fighting for the British. Meanwhile, they deface a memorial in Boston commemorating black soldiers who fought for the Union to end slavery in the Civil War. They castigate Brees for not mentioning black soldiers who fought in World War II while speaking about his family, yet they condone vandalism of the World War II Memorial in Washington. And you’d better sedate these emotional adolescents with a few pounds of the weed looted Sunday night from the Pure Oasis cannabis store in Dorchester before explaining to them which political party enforced Jim Crow and segregation across the American South for nearly a century.</p>
<p>Sports, again, is poised to come to America’s rescue.</p>
<p>But not all sport. Baseball has all but abdicated until 2021. The NHL just discovered that there are black Americans. Big Z took some huge baby steps during a march this week. And the NBA establishment abdicated its moral authority by kowtowing to China last year.</p>
<p>That leaves the NFL. Brees even got blitzed by Donald Trump on Twitter on Friday before responding in kind. Several NFL teams, including the Patriots, have held virtual meetings allowing black players to share their life experience and perspective with their white teammates.</p>
<p>Dialogue is so good, so good.</p>
<p>Several NFL stars, including Pat Mahomes – whose father played for the Red Sox – Saquon Barkley, DeAndre Hopkins and Stephon Gilmore, posted a video Thursday night demanding the NFL offer more than lip service.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the National Football League, this is what we, the players, would like to hear you state: ‘We, the National Football League, condemn racism and the systematic oppression of black people. We, the National Football League, admit wrong in silencing our players from peacefully protesting. We, the National Football League, believe black lives matters,’” they said.</p>
<p>In less than 24 hours, Commissioner Roger Goodell delivered a hostage video agreeing line-by-line to the players’ demands.</p>
<p>Neither video mentioned Kaepernick by name.</p>
<p>Those are all statements Goodell could have delivered three years ago.</p>
<p>In 2020, Goodell and the NFL owners read the room – meaning social media – and lowered the metaphorical Stars and Stripes as if they were evacuating the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. Goodell never really cared about players standing, sitting or kneeling during the national anthem. Nor did he give a damn about the American flag.</p>
<p>It was a marketing maneuver then, and it’s a marketing maneuver now.</p>
<p>If Goodell thought it was good for business, the NFL would dress all its players in Black Lives Matter garb, make Colin Kaepernick deputy commissioner and have LeBron James sing the Chinese national anthem while burning Old Glory before the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s the most powerful entity in sports history.</p>
<p>The long-term fix will happen one interaction at a time, one million times a day.</p>
<p>One need not kneel in order to extend a hand, offer a hug, or embrace in brotherhood.</p>
<p>Listen. Learn. Love.</p>
<p>It never fails.</p>
