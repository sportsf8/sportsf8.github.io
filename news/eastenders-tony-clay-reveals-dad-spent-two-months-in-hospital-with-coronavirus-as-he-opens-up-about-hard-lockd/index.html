<p>EASTENDERS&rsquo; Tony Clay reveals he&rsquo;s suffered a &ldquo;hard time&rdquo; in lockdown, with his dad spending two months in hospital with coronavirus.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old actor opened up about his family&rsquo;s heartache during tonight&rsquo;s episode of Secrets of the Square with Stacey Dooley.</p>
<p>⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news &amp; updates</p>
<p>3 Tony had a difficult lockdown</p>
<p>Tony, who plays Callum in the BBC One soap, appeared alongside Max Bowden, who stars as his on-screen boyfriend Ben Mitchell.</p>
<p>Speaking at the start of the episode, Tony admitted that lockdown has been difficult for him.</p>
<p>He explained: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a bit of a strange time for me, my dad was hospitalised with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two months in hospital, three different hospitals - it was just a hard, hard time.</p>
<p>3 He opened up to host Stacey Dooley</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my dad and on my family. And the nation really, going through this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Host Stacey asked if his dad was on the mend now, with Tony replying: &ldquo;He is, he&rsquo;s finally home so I&rsquo;m very, very, very happy - and a bit overwhelmed by it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secrets of the Square sees popular EastEnders cast members join Stacey on the Walford set for socially-distanced chats about their time on the show.</p>
<p>Previous episodes have included Danny Dyer and Kellie Bright, and Ian Woodyatt and Letitita Dean.</p>

<p>The episodes air every Monday evening, filling one of the gaps after the soap was forced off air last month due to lockdown.</p>
<p>Despite halving the amount of weekly shows when production ground to a halt back in March, EastEnders ran out of pre-recorded episodes.</p>
<p>They now air Stacey&rsquo;s special behind-the-scenes series on Monday evenings, and an iconic vintage episode on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>It was previously promised that the popular soap will return to our screens in September, with four 20-minute episodes a week.

EastEnders stars Max Bowden and Tony Clay take centre stage in spin-off series Secrets From The Square tonight.</p>
<p>The actors — who portray Ben Mitchell and Callum ‘Halfway’ Highway — join Stacey Dooley in Walford East to chat all things Ballum.</p>
<p>During the instalment, Max and Tony will re-live their best moments on the soap, revisit iconic scenes such as their first on-screen kiss, and Stacey will be taken on a tour of Walford gay bar The Prince Albert.</p>
<p>Behind-the-scenes casting secrets will be revealed, and Max will reminisce about the secretive casting process — and how he actually had no idea that it was Ben Mitchell he was auditioning for.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Tony will reflect on his earlier scenes — when Callum used the Halfway nickname — and recoils at the sight of the beanie hat and the ‘bowl cut’ hairstyle.</p>
<p>They’ll also reveal how a ‘ghostly’ pigeon nearly turned tragedy into comedy!</p>
<p>The episode also takes a trip into the EastEnders archives to explore previous LGBTQ+ characters — such as Barry and Colin, Binnie and Della and Christian and Syed — who paved the way for Ben and Callum.</p>
<p>With EastEnders off the air as a result of production having had to halt amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Secrets From The Square has been filling the Monday slot in the schedule rather nicely — and you don’t want to miss Max and Tony’s episode tonight.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can re-live the memorable Pride episode from last year, when it re-airs as this week’s iconic episode.</p>
<p>EastEnders: Secrets From The Square continues Monday 13 June at 8pm on BBC One.</p>

<h3 id="eastenders-star-tony-clay-reveals-why-halfway-was-transformed-into-callum">&ldquo;EastEnders star Tony Clay reveals why Halfway was transformed into Callum&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot-2020-07-10-at-19.51.14-2f78_1594526351.png?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
EastEnders star Tony Clay has opened up about the transformation of Callum ‘Halfway’ Highway.</p>
<p>Callum has become something of a fan favourite character over the last year or so, but prior to his relationship with Ben (Max Bowden), he was somewhat different.</p>
<p>Referred to by his nickname Halfway more so than Callum, the character sported a beanie hat and a ‘bowl cut’, and developed a relationship with Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty).</p>
<p>Tony — who portrays Callum in the BBC One soap — spoke to Stacey Dooley about the transformation which ensued in scenes which viewers can see in Monday night’s instalment of Secrets From The Square.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Discussing the relationship with Whitney, the actor weighed in on whether he knew what the future held for Callum at that point, saying: ‘At that time, I didn’t know.</p>
<p>‘I was like, “I don’t really know where this goes.”‘</p>
<p>‘It’s got some lovely stuff with me and Shona, but I said: ‘It’s like we have it one episode, and then the next it’s done and never spoken about again. I’d like to know is this the end of the road? Is it not? Let’s know now!”‘</p>
<p>‘And they were like boom! They came out with this big storyline, and I was like: “Well, I’m very happy!”</p>
<p>‘I’ll take that one!’</p>
<p>Senior Executive Producer Kate Oates certainly worked her narrative magic with Callum, doing what she does time and again in that she used what had already been established to further develop his character, and in doing so, retroactively strengthened what was already there to begin with.</p>
<p>During the interview with Stacey, Tony also spoke about Halfway’s infamous hat and haircut.</p>
<p>He said: ‘It was Halfway, at the time, so he was just a very different character from where we are now — with his little bowl cut and wooly hat.’</p>
<p>Stacey revealed that the little hat ‘broke her heart’, and Tony replied: ‘It broke mine the minute I came in!’</p>
<p>‘I’m here to play a very serious part’ he joked, ‘I’m a very serious actor. And they were like, “well, we’re going to give you a bowl cut, and this [the hat]”, and I was like, “great. Well, I’ve signed now!’</p>
<p>One to watch: Monday 13 July at 8pm on BBC One</p>

<h3 id="eastenders-tony-clay-praises-sharons-huge-queen-vic-cliffhanger">&ldquo;EastEnders&rsquo; Tony Clay praises Sharon&rsquo;s huge Queen Vic cliffhanger&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/eastenders-tony-clay-callum-highway-1583583957.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0676xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
EastEnders star Tony Clay has revealed that he loved the huge cliffhanger the soap was left on when it went off-air.</p>
<p>The final scene viewers saw before the show took a break last month due to the ongoing pandemic saw Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) standing behind the bar of the Queen Vic as she announced to her shocked estranged husband Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) that she&rsquo;s the new landlady of the pub he was attempting to buy.</p>
<p>Tony, who plays Callum Highway in the soap, has praised the scene and called Sharon actress Letitia Dean &ldquo;an icon&rdquo; as he spoke about how much fun he had filming a scene with her recently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For someone that&rsquo;s been on the show and in the industry for so long, the fact she is as lovely, professional and talented as she is – it&rsquo;s an honour to have scenes with Tish. She&rsquo;s a joy to work with. It&rsquo;s definitely something I can look back on and think &lsquo;wow I loved that scene!&rsquo;</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>Related: EastEnders fans spot killer prediction in old episode</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not always the big, major smashing things in the middle of the Square type moments, it&rsquo;s those little scenes where the characters are connecting and chatting that are great. Having scenes with the iconic characters is something that every kid that&rsquo;s grown up watching EastEnders wants so it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so happy she&rsquo;s the new landlady too. It&rsquo;s where she should be! I thought the reveal was great, history repeating itself and I hope Mick and Linda (Carter, played by Danny Dyer and Kellie Bright) do alright out of it as well because I love them too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actor also revealed which characters he&rsquo;d like to share more scenes with once the soap returns to our screens later this year, saying that he&rsquo;d love to work more with Ricky Champ who plays Callum&rsquo;s brother Stuart Highway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always love scenes with my brother Stuart – played by Ricky,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I love doing scenes with Danny and I&rsquo;d love there to be more scenes with Callum and Whitney (Dean, played by Shona McGarty).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love working with Shona, she&rsquo;s a dream and an iconic character – so talented – she&rsquo;s a gift! I think the show is so strong at the moment and it&rsquo;s amazing to be part of that company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tony will be back on our screens next week alongside co-star Max Bowden, who plays Callum&rsquo;s boyfriend Ben Mitchell, chatting to Stacey Dooley as part of the Secrets from the Square series.</p>
<p>The episode will see Tony presented with a reminder of Callum&rsquo;s beanie and previous &lsquo;bowl cut&rsquo;, while Max will tell all about working with his on-screen dad Steve McFadden in panto when he was a child.</p>
<p>EastEnders: Secrets From the Square continues on Monday (July 13) at 8pm on BBC One.</p>

EastEnders star Tony Clay has promised that there is more to come from Callum Highway’s journey into the police force – which is bound to cause some friction with the Square’s very own crime syndicate, the Mitchells!</p>
<p>Callum is currently dating Ben (Max Bowden) and supporting him through his hearing loss. But as they become a closer unit, Callum plans to see his career through and Tony admits that he is excited to explore the story and where it goes from here.</p>
<p>In an extended chat, he also shares his love for working with co-star Max, reveals who else he wants to work with and talks about his most iconic scene to date.</p>

<p>What is your earliest memory of EastEnders?</p>
<p>It goes back to Bianca and Ricky – Frank and Peggy and Pat, I loved it so much when I was younger so it’s such an honour to be a part of it now.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Any classic iconic moment that sticks out?</p>
<p>I loved the reveal of Max and Stacey’s affair with Bradley – that was so special. It’s got to be my highlight episode, such a brilliant one and they were all so good in it.</p>
<p>Who have been your stand-out characters over the years?</p>
<p>June Brown as Dot is an entity in herself – she’s incredible and the fact she’s so professional and as lovely as ever – she’s class through and through. I also loved Frank and Peggy – there are so many characters, it’s timeless. Working with Steve too – an absolute legend – it’s really special.</p>
<p>What do you think it is about the show that has resonated so strongly with fans for 35 years?</p>
<p>I think it’s all about portraying everyday life! For me the show is at its best when with storylines that people can empathise and relate to more than anything else. It can be something as simple as two people sitting down talking about a real issue, those scenes are so beautiful. They’re the moments the audience watch and think ‘wow that’s something I have been through!’ That connection is why people watch – it’s complete escapism but rooted in reality – in people’s living rooms every night.</p>
<p>What have you enjoyed most about filming Secrets From The Square?</p>
<p>It was really lovely to come back and to see Max and Stacey Dooley too. She was so great. It was also really nice to look back at all the things we’ve done. It’s easy to forget sometimes because you’re doing so much that you don’t really have time to take it all in and to process it all. So it was really nice to be able to look back and talk it through with Max. It was a such good laugh!</p>
<p>What can fans expect to learn by watching Secrets From The Square?</p>
<p>We look back on our first days on set, how we built up a rapport over time and I think it shows that we gelled very quickly. There’s a real trust between Max and I a real confidence in each other and it’s a really lovely thing to have. Now he’s one of my close pals too!</p>
<p>How was filming the Pride episode? It’s a real turning point for Callum in his journey with coming to terms with his sexuality….</p>
<p>It was a big few weeks definitely! We really wanted to get it right and make it brilliant. I hope that we did that – it seemed to get a great response. To be trusted with such an important storyline was a real blessing and I feel really thankful to Kate and Jon.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>I try to make every part of Callum’s journey believable and true so that people can relate to it. I had a lots of messages over that particular episode – people saying ‘this was my story’, ‘I’ve been through something similar’ or a simple ‘thank you so much’. It feels like we are doing our job properly because that’s such an important thing – portraying real stories that are meaningful… it’s why we do it.</p>
<p>What’s your favourite thing about working with Max?</p>
<p>I love Max as a person anyway but equally I love working with him. We have a really good understanding of each other and how we work. We also have times where we can have a laugh too – we take the work seriously but never take ourselves to seriously.</p>
<p>He’s such a talent – looking at his work over the past few weeks on screen, it’s clear to see how incredibly talented he is. He puts a lot of work into it, there’s a lot of effort and research that goes into everything because he cares and its lovely to work with someone who shares that. He’s a really good friend of mine now too so I love working with him – long may it continue!</p>
<p>Favourite scene you’ve filmed together?</p>
<p>For me it was the first time that Ben confronts Callum and holds him up and says the famous ‘I smell queer’ line. Those scenes were very exciting to play and when you watch back as a viewer you think ‘that is a real turning point in Callum’s journey’. You see him let out that side of him that’s a bit feisty and there’s a real vulnerability to the moment because someone now knows this secret. He’s been hiding it and now there’s a chance for it to be out there in the open. it was really exciting and a real pivotal point in Callum’s journey.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>How would Ben and Callum have got on in Lockdown away from all the outside pressures?</p>
<p>I think, much like regular life, there would be ups and downs as with any relationship. It would have been difficult definitely. Also depending on whether they’ve locked down together or if they’ve had to isolate in separate homes – we don’t know that yet! Something we’ll look at in the future so keep watching!</p>
<p>Fans loved the scene between Callum and Sharon – what was it like filming that scene with Letitia?</p>
<p>Tish Dean is an icon! For someone that’s been on the show and in the industry for so long, the fact she is as lovely, professional and talented as she is – it’s an honour to have scenes with Tish. She’s a joy to work with. It’s definitely something I can look back on and think ‘wow I loved that scene’! They’re not always the big, major smashing things in the middle of the square type moments, it’s those little scenes where the characters are connecting and chatting that are great. Having scenes with the iconic characters is something that every kid that’s grown up watching EastEnders wants so it’s great.</p>
<p>I am so happy she’s the new landlady too. It’s where she should be! I thought the reveal was great, history repeating itself and I hope Mick and Linda do alright out of it as well because I love them too!</p>
<p>Phil and Callum’s relationship is improving…he’s not been the most welcoming father – what’s it been like working with Steve?</p>
<p>Working with Steve is amazing – he’s a complete professional and a lovely man. He’s such a brilliant actor, he really is phenomenal! I think sometimes actors in soaps can get taken for granted and when you work with people like Steve and Tish or Kellie and Danny – it’s amazing. We all have a laugh but there’s a real level of professionalism that goes into EastEnders and Steve is the pinnacle of that. A great bloke and I love having scenes with him.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Anyone else that you’d like to have more scenes with? Personally and for Callum’s character.</p>
<p>I always love scenes with my brother Stuart – played by Ricky. I love doing scenes with Danny and I’d love there to be more scenes with Callum and Whitney. I love working with Shona, she’s a dream and an ionic character – so talented – she’s a gift! I think the show is so strong at the moment and it’s amazing to be part of that company.</p>
<p>Ben’s deaf storyline has been such an important one – did you do any research beforehand?</p>
<p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video</p>
<p>Absolutely – it’s such an important storyline to portray so when you’re a key part of it you have to do research. The best form of research really came in Rose – who plays Frankie. She walked on set and was incredible – a tour de force! She owns it and she was always there explaining and helping bring authenticity. She’d say ‘No this is the correct way to do this’ or ‘that would not happen in the deaf community, this is how we are going to do it’ and I loved that!</p>
<p>That’s exactly what we need, someone like Rose to come in with her perspective – she has lived this life and this is how it has to be portrayed to do it justice. She was incredible. Her work on screen is amazing and I really hope she sticks around for a very long time. She’s massively important not only for the show, but for the deaf community and the audience that watch it too.</p>
<p>You’ve been using a bit of BSL in the show – how has learning been?</p>
<p>Yeah where I can – we have advisors that come in that help us and a lot of the signing scenes are with Rose so it’s great she’s always there to talk things through and advise us on what we’re doing right and wrong. I’m always learning it’s a great skill to have and, so important.</p>
<p>Callum, Lexi and Ben have a lovely relationship – what’s working with Isabella like?</p>
<p>She is incredible! That girl – she is amazing for such a young kid. If I imagine myself at her age, I would have been so nervous and she has none of that! She is such a brilliant little actor anyway but it’s the personality that comes with it. She’s so well behaved and a real credit to her Mum and Dad. She’s so funny and a has a proper little cockney voice on her, I love doing scenes with her, Max and Lola as a family.</p>
<p>Callum is now qualified in the police – are you looking forward to exploring this new aspect of his character? Any research done?</p>
<p>It’s early days with the Police and you’re always learning when you see things in the script I immediately look at how I’m going to tackle it and do it properly. It’s another exciting journey to play with Callum and one that we can do right. It will be an interesting dynamic, being part of the Mitchell crime syndicate when your day job is in the Police! I’m sure that’s going to be exciting to play.</p>
<p>If you could spend quarantine with any character from EastEnders, who would it be and why? Same but any actor?</p>
<p>I would have to go with Ricky Champ – I love all of the them but Ricky plays my brother and he’s become like a brother to me in real life too, I love him to bits I really do.</p>
<p>I think he can cook a lot better than me too! He’s a man of many talents not a lot of people know about every now and then he’ll mention something else he can do, I’m always surprised. A man of many talents!</p>

<h3 id="eastenders-star-reveals-his-two-favourite-ballum-episodes">&ldquo;EastEnders star reveals his two favourite Ballum episodes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/eastenders-tony-clay-max-bowden-callum-highway-ben-mitchell-1594071947.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.749xh;0,0.0501xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
EastEnders stars Max Bowden and Tony Clay are opening up about all-things Ballum ahead of their appearance on EastEnders: Secrets from the Square.</p>
<p>Bowden and his on-screen love interest Clay will be the next two EastEnders cast members to sit down with Stacey Dooley on the interview show next week, as they reflect on a year of Ben and Callum&rsquo;s love story.</p>
<p>Ahead of the episode airing, Bowden spoke about why Ballum has resonated with viewers in a different way to Ben&rsquo;s previous coupling with Paul Coker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s the resonance of two working-class men who come from similar backgrounds who share similar experiences being drawn together in a time of hope,&rdquo; Bowden argued.</p>
<p>Kieron McCarron BBC</p>
<p>Related: EastEnders star Max Bowden reacts to Ben Mitchell twist and teases aftermath</p>
<p>&ldquo;Callum was feeling so withdrawn in himself and Ben allowed him to find out who he really was. The element of self-discovery between them both is really important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bowden acknowledged his off-screen chemistry with Clay as well: &ldquo;We have a very similar sense of humour – we&rsquo;re both idiots so we generally tend to laugh at near enough everything. Tony&rsquo;s a really well-crafted actor, he knows how to work with different people and he&rsquo;s always up for trying things in a scene so it&rsquo;s a joy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tony Clay credited Ben and Halfway&rsquo;s popularity with evoking &ldquo;everyday life&rdquo; for LGBTQ+ couples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, the show is at its best when with storylines that people can empathise and relate to more than anything else,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It can be something as simple as two people sitting down talking about a real issue, those scenes are so beautiful.</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the moments the audience watch and think, &lsquo;Wow that&rsquo;s something I have been through!&rsquo; That connection is why people watch – it&rsquo;s complete escapism but rooted in reality – in people&rsquo;s living rooms every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking back over the last year, Bowden singled out two Ballum episodes as his favourite: &ldquo;I have loads, but the break-up episode was one that Tony and I were very proud of our work in. I&rsquo;d also say the Ballum kiss episode because it was the start of a journey for both of us and we didn&rsquo;t expect it to go the way that it has so that&rsquo;s been lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clay answered: &ldquo;For me, it was the first time that Ben confronts Callum and holds him up and says the famous &lsquo;I smell queer&rsquo; line. Those scenes were very exciting to play and when you watch back as a viewer you think, &lsquo;That is a real turning point in Callum&rsquo;s journey&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Kieron McCarron BBC</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see him let out that side of him that&rsquo;s a bit feisty and there&rsquo;s a real vulnerability to the moment because someone now knows this secret. He&rsquo;s been hiding it and now there&rsquo;s a chance for it to be out there in the open. It was really exciting and a real pivotal point in Callum&rsquo;s journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bowden also pointed to the soap&rsquo;s groundbreaking Christian Clarke (John Partridge) and Syed Masood (Marc Elliott) love affair with laying the groundwork for Ben&rsquo;s later relationships.</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved that storyline and I thought it was played out really well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;John Partridge did a great job as Christian, it was a brilliant telling of that community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duo also looked ahead to the future now that filming has resumed on EastEnders, with Bowden expressing hopes of seeing the couple in more parental scenes with Ben&rsquo;s daughter Lexi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really lovely to see the way in which Lexi has taken to Callum and vice versa,&rdquo; he noted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be nice to see much more of that relationship blossom as well as Lola in the family too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BBC</p>
<p>As for what Ben has been up to in lockdown, Bowden teased: &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s going mad! I would imagine he&rsquo;s sitting staring at the walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, much like regular life, there would be ups and downs as with any relationship,&rdquo; Clay acknowledged. &ldquo;[Lockdown] would have been difficult definitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, depending on whether they&rsquo;ve locked down together or if they&rsquo;ve had to isolate in separate homes – we don&rsquo;t know that yet! Something we&rsquo;ll look at in the future so keep watching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>EastEnders: Secrets from the Square airs Monday on BBC One at 8pm.</p>
