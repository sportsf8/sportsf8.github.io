<p>THURSDAY afternoon didn&rsquo;t seem any different for the team at Winchester Coffee Roasters.</p>
<p>That was until they discovered a sword-like artefact in their new outside seating area.</p>
<p>The history behind the object is currently unknown, but Mark Goulding of the business is hoping to find out as much as he can.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We were digging up an area for our new decking and outdoor seating when we came across a metal sword-shaped item.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be anything but it certainly looks like a sword to me. People on social media have shared their opinions and it will be nice to know exactly what it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be calling Winchester Museum today and I have a long list of numbers of experts who can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winchester Coffee Roasters, based in The Foundry Yard, posted a picture on Facebook which received comments from dozens of people.</p>
<p>Tony Blackman said: &ldquo;Definitely get that checked out looks like it might still be in its sheath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a guess judging by its length it could be early medieval. Swords generally got longer and bigger the better the amour got. So could be quite a find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mark Housby said in a comment that he is &ldquo;not entirely convinced it is a sword&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like any I&rsquo;ve come across. It could be a theatrical prop, or possibly a fragment of a metal structure such as a gate or fence which just happens to be sword shaped.&rdquo;

<h3 id="to-go-where-no-one">&ldquo;To Go Where No One&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://vashonloop.com/media/LoopFP.jpg" alt="img">
One of the things I have been thinking about lately is the original Star Trek series. It was one of the teevee shows I was fascinated with as a kid. It was one of those things we looked forward to as the “fall line-ups” were revealed after the summer re-runs had stopped their re-running. In its later iterations, the summing up of the various star-trekking crews’ mission changed from going where no man to where no one has gone before- a nod to gender and species inclusivity, but without saying so much. To be fair, they had been pretty inclusive from the start. The captain and the doctor were two white guys, but among the core group on the bridge or at the controls in the engine room there was a Japanese man, a Russian, a Scotsman, a black woman and an alien with pointy ears, and they all seemed to get along pretty well for being cooped up in a tin can for five years at a stretch. It was a subtle message, and one that seems to be entirely lost on the people of our own future now, whether that message was actually intended there or not. I wasn’t thinking of race and gender relations way back then and I don’t recall that the mix of bridgemates at that time was controversial, although it may have been and I just missed it. As it was, the show did get cancelled after only a three year run. Perhaps all that diversity was a bit too much to handle for some people, while at the same time there were all-white and all-male crews flying into space in real life.</p>
<p>In the ten year interim between Star Trek on the teevee and Star Trek, the movie, there came along in the summer of 1977 another star adventure. As I remember it, I was up in the North Carolina mountains at the time in a sort of semi, self-imposed isolation at the Penland School of Crafts, making photographs and drinking beer, sometimes not necessarily in that order. At the time Penland was in a dry county where no alcohol was sold, although that didn’t mean you couldn’t go elsewhere to get it. This meant a trip to Tennessee in one direction or to Asheville in another if you wanted to exercise your right to party. As it turned out, for most of my time there I was an official driver for the school, which in a work-study kind of arrangement allowed me to attend my photo classes for free.</p>
<p>It also meant that I was making somewhat regular trips to Asheville for school supplies and to pick up or drop off students who were coming from, or going back to, elsewhere for the six sessions of craft classes that ran all summer long and into the fall. This regular change over of the student body meant new waves of news from the outside, as there were no teevees up there (except at the director’s house), only a few radios, and this was years before cell phones and the internets. And so it was at one of those mountain sea changes that conversations in the dining hall all of a sudden turned to this new star movie. There had been rumors for years that a Star Trek film had somewhere been in the works. While I don’t recall getting the full story about the film at any of the meals, out of curiosity I left early for one of my supply runs while just assuming that this new movie was the long-awaited Hollywood version of Star Trek. What I couldn’t figure out from the poster outside the theater in Asheville as I walked by it on the way to the box office was why they had changed the name to Star Wars, where Kirk and Spock were and why that guy was holding that weird flashlight shaped like a sword. It turned out to be neither the droids nor the film that I was looking for, but I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing while wondering if the rest of the sparse, matinee crowd had left or gone to sleep.</p>
<p>Both Star Trek and Star Wars made sense in the context of my having grown up being herded into one central classroom in fifth grade and getting to watch John Glenn and the others blast off into space in real time. What Star Trek and then Star Wars represented were an imagined future for the baby steps we had been taking into space in the 1960’s, even if one of them happened in a galaxy far away and long ago. The travelers of both Star series were the beneficiaries of technology that allowed them to bridge the giant voids of space in fractions of time and with engines and fuel that were seemingly super efficient and bordered on the magical. We won’t get into the buzz kill questions of the problems with light speed travel and communications over massive spatial distances. We could mention the problems we and our current or recent space programs have had with basic weather. After watching Han Solo maneuver the Millenium Falcon through meteoroid fields and blaster explosions, it seems crazy that at this point in time we still can’t launch a rocket through a little rain and thunder.</p>
<p>One of the things I always was puzzled by about the space program was the quarantine period the astronauts had to go through when they got back down here on terra firma. I mean, it was the aliens that died of our bugs or viruses when they showed up in ‘War of the Worlds’. The main dilemma in Gareth Edward’s film ‘Monsters’ was that we accidentally brought back a living space menace that took over part of Mexico. But both Kirk and Skywalker were only worried about breathable atmospheres when venturing on to really foreign soils. In the bright light of our current crisis with a virus, it would seem that going either way, with a visitor coming here or one of our missions landing elsewhere on a distant orb, a concern with microbes would dominate ones worries of survivability. In the film ‘Arrival’, the scientists and linguists tasked with establishing communications with the visitors did carry along a canary as something more than just a companion or as an example of where ancient giant earth reptilian beasts had evolved to, but it would seem, like today, that really good test kits would have to be a part of every space explorer’s landing gear that could tell whether it was really all clear and safe to pop off that space helmet and take that first deep breath of an alien atmosphere.</p>
<p>Beyond that, one would really have to wonder what it is that we might be going out there to find in the first place. Would we be looking for strange new worlds and be seeking out new life and civilizations? Would we have in place anything resembling the Federation’s “Prime Directive” of non-interference in whatever cultures we might find. Or would we be sending out a landing party of Space Force Trumpian nitwits packing enough heat to neutralize any curious space beast that had gotten stunned in their glaring headlights, and then stripped of enough essentials for the trophy wall back on the bridge of their Enterprise. Indeed, it is interesting to think of the difference between a mission into space with the Prime Directive guiding a Riker or Picard versus a mission with a mandate from Donald Trump. It is also curious to contemplate the metaphorical twists in play when imagining how a spaceship named Enterprise, when being manned by these two divergent sets of crews, would define their mandate in outer space, and what enterprise each might choose to undertake.</p>
<p>One of the most enlightening things a friend said to me a long while ago regarding my getting back into what revealed itself to be a really bad relationship was this: “What has changed?” Since the answer at the time was – nothing- it became quite clear that getting back to it would most likely return a similar result. This is a similar and simpler way of that timeless definition of insanity as being what is indicated by repeating the same action and expecting a different result. One need to only just look all around us now at how we are really screwing things up here. Why would we think that going into space and finding a nice clean planet to inhabit once we have decimated this one would result in something other than finding ourselves with a ruined and exploited former garden of Eden and the desperate need for yet another ticket out of town? One could talk about learning from history, but then one could once again simply say- Look Around! We have the capability to create amazing learning tools and the capability to instantly transmit them around the world, and at the same time we have the capability of creating documents and media that refute that self-same set of tools and data points. We have already been told all of this. George Orwell said it succinctly in his book ‘1984’: “For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?” He also wrote this: “Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.” First we need to get back to some basic math- then we can work on greatness.

Chinese archaeologists have unearthed a 2,000-year-old swan-shaped bronze vessel which they say contains more than 3 litres of a mysterious liquid.</p>
<p>Researchers with the Sanmenxia Archaeology Institute in Central China&rsquo;s Henan Province announced the discovery of the intact grave on May 21. Tests are now being carried out to determine what the liquid is.</p>
<p>The bronzeware pot, the top of which is shaped like the neck and head of a swan, was found inside a tomb along with other burial objects such as a helmet and a sword made of jade and iron.</p>
<p>An expert from Beijing takes a sample of the liquid in order to identify the substance found inside the swan-shaped Chinese ritual bronze</p>

<p>According to researcher Yan Fei, more than 3 litres of brownish liquid was poured out from a small hole.</p>
<p>Though members of the public have speculated the vessel may have contained some early form of grain alcohol, Mr Yan&rsquo;s institute said it has invited experts from Chinese capital Beijing to test the substance before confirming anything.</p>
<p>A researcher with the School of Humanities at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing took a sample of the liquid on May 18, which is still being analysed.</p>
<p>The swan-shaped Chiense ritual bronze was found among other burial items inside a tomb in Sanmenxia, above and below</p>
<p>Researchers believe the items belonged to a low-ranking official</p>
<p>More than 3,000 ml of liquid containing impurities were discovered inside the swan-shaped Chinese ritual bronze</p>
<p>Mr Yan said: &lsquo;The swan-head bronze vessel is a rare find. It is the first time we&rsquo;ve found such an item in this area.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very lifelike, including its mouth and eyes. It really shows how skilled early civilisations were at creating bronzeware.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Experts believe the bronzeware was modelled on a mute swan, known as a Cygnus olor.</p>

<p>Some thought it resembled a goose, but veterinarians concluded it was more than likely a swan due to its longer beak, the Sanmenxia Archaeological Institute reported.</p>
<p>The tomb where it was unearthed has been dated to the chaotic, war-torn period between the end of the Qin dynasty (221 to 207 BC) and the early Han dynasty (206 BC to 220 AD).</p>
<p>Researchers believe the items belonged to a low-ranking official.</p>
<p>The tomb was found by chance by workers taking part in an urban development project in a local village.

<h3 id="returning-to-the-cutting-edge-sword-part-1">&ldquo;Returning to the cutting edge: “sword” (Part 1)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://42796r1ctbz645bo223zkcdl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ancient_Assyria_Divided_into_Syria_Mesopotamia_Babylonia_and_Assyria_WDL37.jpg" alt="img">
Those who have read the posts on awl, ax(e), and adz(e) (March 11, 18, and 25, 2020) will find themselves on familiar ground: once again “origin unknown,” numerous hypotheses, and reference to migratory words. This is not surprising: people learn the names of tools and weapons from the speakers of neighboring nations (tribes), adapt, and domesticate them. Dozens of such names have roots in the remotest prehistory. Another complicating factor: the line separating tools from weapons is easy to cross. An ax, for example, can cut a tree and cleave a skull with equal ease. What once was a tool may become a deadly weapon.</p>
<p>From Old Germanic three words for “sword” have come down to us. Two of them occurred in the fourth-century (CE) translation of the New Testament into Gothic. The verses with the word for “sword” are L 2. 35 and E 6. 17. In the King James Bible, they sound so: “(Ye, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul, also)” and: “…take the helmet of salvation and the sword to the Spirit, which is the word of God.” The Greek text has mákhaira and rhomphaía. Bishop Wulfila, who either translated the entire text or at least edited it, used hairus (pronounced as herrus) and meki (with ē, long e). The Greek for sword, memorable from Homer and Hesiod, is ‘áor, but, for some reason, it did not satisfy Wulfila.</p>
<p>When dictionaries cite glosses, such as “Gothic hairus translates Greek mákhaira,” they do not tell the complete story. In Classical Greek, the word meant “a knife used for human sacrifices (it was also used as a short-range weapon, that is, as a saber and a dagger); razor.” It came to mean “sword” only in New Testament Greek. Rhomphaía, at least in Classical Greek, designated a short Thracian sword with a long broad blade. One wonders what image the word evoked in the minds of the users of the Greek gospels and what exactly Gothic hairus and mekis meant.</p>
<p>The origin of both Gothic words is unknown, but it is amusing that, when we put side by side mákhaira, mekis, and hairus, the Germanic words look like echoes of the Greek one. Yet the similarity is accidental, because hairus has exact correspondences (cognates, congeners) in Old Icelandic, Old English, and Old Saxon, while meki is known even more widely. Also, Germanic speakers fought the Romans, not the Greeks and would have had no need to borrow Greek words. And of course, borrowings would have been much closer to their source.</p>
<p>A cognate of meki showed up even on a runic inscription dated to approximately 250 CE, and the cognates of hairus occurred all over the Germanic-speaking world, but the Goths probably did not know a word like sword, while the rest of the Germanic world did. In the modern languages, only Icelandic has retained a reflex (continuation) cognate with hairus, while meki or maki– died without issue. However, its close relatives have been recorded in a Caucasian language and in the Slavic-speaking world (for example, Russian mech). Were swords bearing this name forged in the Caucasus, became famous, and spread over most of Eurasia? Even if so, the word’s etymology remains a mystery. The same is true of hairus despite some ingenious conjectures on this subject.</p>
<p>Sword is equally mysterious. If it is not a Germanic noun, but a so-called culture (migratory) word that traveled form land to land with soldiers, we have little chance of finding its ancient source. Attempts to trace it to a Germanic root have also been moderately successful. Let us note that from a historical point of view awl does not mean “piercer,” ax does not mean “cutter,” and so on. We have also seen that the same word may mean “knife; dagger; razor,” and then “sword.” By the way, the origin of knife is obscure, and the same holds for bodkin. In any case, sword need not have meant “piercer” or “cutter” and been an analog of razor, which is, raz(e) + –er.</p>
<p>Three approaches to the etymology of sword have been tried.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Perhaps, we are told, the word either migrated from afar or is a cognate of some very ancient word (compare Gothic meki and Old Slavic mech’). Not long ago, the Luvian (or Luwian) cuneiform word shi(h)ual “dagger” (here given in a grossly simplified English transcription) has been cited as a cognate of sword. Allegedly, the root of both means “sharp.” Something should perhaps be said about the phrase Luvian cuneiform. Cuneiform was a system of writing, invented in ancient Mesopotamia. The texts have been preserved on multiple clay tablets, and the “letters” were wedge-shaped marks (hence the name: Latin cuneus means “wedge”). Luvian (Luwian) was spoken in Mesopotamia and northern Syria. Those who think that cuneiform is something exotic and marginally significant should remember that Hittite texts were written (inscribed) in cuneiform and that the world-famous epic Gilgamesh was recorded on such tablets. I will skip the technical part of this hypothesis (it is too complicated, and there seem to be some phonetic difficulties in it), and as regards the conclusion, I prefer to remain uncommitted. One could have expected to find some Germanic words with this root and some traces of it between Mesopotamia and the regions inhabited by the ancestors of modern Germanic speakers, though the home of the Germanic peoples remains a matter of controversy. I also try to follow the “law” I once formulated for myself: the more complicated and ingenious an etymology, the smaller the chance that it is true.</p>

<p>One should look at other words meaning “sword” in the hope that light will come from that source. In an excellent old etymological dictionary, written by two Norwegian scholars, sword (or rather its ancient protoform swerðam-; ð = th in Engl. this) was compared with Greek ‘áor “sword,” mentioned above, on the assumption that the ancient root was (s)ver “to lift” or “to weigh along” (s in parentheses designates movable s, a mysterious volatile prefix often mentioned in this blog). This reconstruction presupposes that the sword in Greek and Germanic got its name because it hung from the fighter’s hip. Though shared by several eminent etymologists, this idea fails to convince. Could the ancient sword in two languages be called from such a secondary feature? A weapon from a baldric, as it were?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perhaps the solution is less convoluted. Are there any Germanic words that sound like sword and provide a clue? Yes, indeed, but whether they conceal the desired “clue” is far from obvious. Though I believe that one guess is promising, here I am in the minority. Anyway, wait until next week.</p>

<p>Transcript</p>
<p>So after Microsoft bought Minecraft they must have said “Ha ha, it’s mine all minecraft, and we got it away from Notch before he went too weird on us, now what shall we do with it?” And in reply the thoughtwaves of the Microsoft corporate hive mind emitted only cricket noises. Telltale Games came along and said “Hey, I know, let’s make a choices matter except not really episodic adventure game!” Oh piss off Telltale Games, you tried to turn my last colonic endoscopy video into a choices matter except not really episodic adventure game. Choices matter except not really episodic adventure games are not the answer to everything, especially not questions like “How is Telltale Games going to unfuck itself.”</p>
<p>So, the question remained, what to do with Minecraft? Minecraft is a pure sandbox creativity game set in an infinite number of randomly generated functionally infinite worlds. What you gonna do, make a sequel that has twice as much functionally infinite content? Or built of slightly larger cubes? This isn’t like Halo or Gears of War, you can’t just slowly fade in the logo with an incremented number on the end and watch an auditorium of fanboys drench each other in come. Minecraft is a hobby. It’s the model train set of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Minecraft fans don’t want sequels that just repackage what they’ve already got and fuck up all the mods, they just want the odd content patch to add slightly taller iron fences and giraffes and pastry lamination and that’s a difficult thing to cut a pulse-pounding hype trailer around. But, you can’t just buy something and then keep it as it is forever, this isn’t a fucking art gallery, and so Minecraft Dungeons had to be made, a game that is the equivalent of moving your hand in a circular motion and going “ehhhhhh” because you feel obliged to say something, anything, to fill the silence.</p>
<p>In case I wasn’t making this clear, I believe there’s a fundamental issue with Minecraft Dungeons on the conceptual level. It’s an isometric hack and slash dungeon crawler for up to four players, and while yes, there are swords in Minecraft, and yes, there are things you can hit with the sword in Minecraft, it was never more than an incidental hassle to make it all the more satisfying when you finally finished your roller coaster shaped like Nicki Minaj lying on her back or whatever your project was. To base your spin off around something so incidental to the point of Minecraft is to spin right off it, out the garage and down a storm drain.</p>
<p>Essentially all Microsoft has done is slap Minecraft’s art style onto a completely unrelated game, and I’m pretty sure part of Minecraft’s identity lies in how it looks like absolute shit. Oh, the style functions as intended, sure, but there’s a reason why Minecraft projects only look impressive once they go past a certain size, ‘cos close up everything looks like it’s made from family pack sized boxes of Ricicles. And the art is literally the only thing connecting Dungeons to Minecraft, you could swap out everything for Monopoly board pieces and retitle it The Day Uncle Pennybags Finally Snapped and it would work just as well. Not that this precludes Minecraft Dungeons from being a fun and interesting game, no, it’s everything else that does that.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the plot. In the peaceful land of Microsoft’s Minecraft registered trademark, a bitter and vengeful villain randomly finds a Triforce, I mean Cosmic Cube, I mean generic all-powerful Maguffin invariably taking the form of a simple geometric shape that glows a bit, and then a numberless horde of generic monsters pour out of his armpits and now you, the hero stroke heroes, must fight to liberate the innocent residents of… whatever they’re calling this place. And all of this is established with what I can only describe as a sense of disengaged inevitability.</p>
<p>The story is set up with a very bored-sounding narration and very little time is wasted on establishing how or why we, the heroes, found ourselves in this situation. You are heroes and there are baddies currently standing around being alive and not asphyxiating on their own teeth and that’s all the motivation you’re getting. What I wonder is if the human minions of the villain ever look at the zombies and skeletons and kamikaze hedges they’re forced to work alongside and regret dropping out of higher education, but don’t worry about it. This is the tokenest of token plots to add token context to an extremely token game. Not a particularly long game, either, just eight or nine token levels in token biomes before a token final boss and a token ending.</p>
<p>It is a better embodiment of token than a Chuck E. Cheese arcade with one black employee. So it’s definitely trying for the co-op focus, it’s got all the signs – online is the default mode and single player offline mode you have to opt into with that air of tacit disapproval multiplayer games always project like a waiter in a posh restaurant when you ask if you could just have a side without an entree, you have to go back to the hub / matchmaking zone between every level, and every cutscene shows three extra dudes mysteriously accompanying you like they’re the documentary film crew.</p>
<p>But I played the whole game solo and never once felt I was missing out. There are no classes or much in the way of support abilities that emphasise co-operation, every level is just getting funneled along a path and stabbin’ a number of dudes large enough to be stimulating to fight in an “escaping from a roomful of balloons” kind of way but not large enough that extra help was needed.</p>
<p>In fact, with Minecraft’s “box ottoman space program” art style that means every character has the exact same silhouette, having three other blockheads running around could only make things more visually confusing, like dropping your last watermelon jolly rancher into a box of lego. As for the core gameplay, you pick a weapon, the Minecraft sword, the Minecraft axe, the Minecraft pickax or the Minecraft halberd if you don’t mind completely breaking down the already thin facade, and then you go from room to room swatting it at anything that moves. And yes, I have been putting off bringing up the core gameplay, well deduced Inspector Poirot, ‘cos frankly there’s nothing particularly wrong with it. It’s a competent enough combat grind with all the right impacts and balances.</p>
<p>It does present a difficulty slider before each level, which usually for games like this would strike me as developer shorthand for “please balance our game for us, we couldn’t be bothered,” but I rarely felt the need to tweak it. If you are determined to have fun with Minecraft Dungeons, like it was the only thing your mother got you for your birthday and she’s going to break out the wire coathangers if you don’t seem appreciative, then you might well find fun, or at the very least distraction from what sounds like a very unhealthy home environment. But the point is, the inoffensiveness of the gameplay makes it as substantial as a puff of air.</p>
<p>And Minecraft Dungeons is as much Minecraft as a balloon with a Minecraft logo printing on it. Potentially amusing if you let the air out so it makes a farting noise but still just a big ball of air with fuck all to do with the original. Even that Telltale adventure game remembered to put some crafting in, for fuck’s sake, it was a join-the-dots version of a Da Vinci masterpiece but it was something. I don’t know what you could comfortably add to Minecraft Dungeons to make it more like the authentic Minecraft experience. Replace the main villain with an aggrieved little brother holding a bucket of lava?

<h3 id="gaby-wood--diary-how-to-draw-an-albatross--lrb-18-june-2020">&ldquo;Gaby Wood · Diary: How to Draw an Albatross · LRB 18 June 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lrb.co.uk/media/cache/social_image/var/site/storage/images/8/8/9/2/21882988-1-eng-GB/Wood-Web.jpg" alt="img">
Before my appointment​ with the albatross, I’d planned to draw it differently. We first met through glass: the skeleton was in a cabinet in the museum, displayed on a high shelf. If you looked up and dodged the reflections you could see the curved sweep of its beak and the Z-shaped slashes of its vast folded wings. Diomedea exulans, the wandering albatross, was an improbable bird, seemingly assembled from the disparate parts of others: a dodo here, a seagull there, a wingspan from something prehistoric. You didn’t need to know what it was, or to be reminded of the albatross’s association with luck or guilt or human burden, or even to understand how far this one must have travelled, to see the majesty and melancholy in the creature’s remains. This was Coleridge’s harmless bird ‘that loved the man who shot him’; Baudelaire’s ‘king of the blue’ brought ‘stumbling and ashamed’ into the orbit of men.</p>
<p>You could make a research appointment, I discovered, at UCL’s Grant Museum of Zoology, and the albatross would be taken out of the cabinet so you could see it up close. ‘As we are closed to the public in the morning,’ the curator told me, ‘you will have peace and quiet to draw the specimen.’ I began my preparations. I wanted to make etchings, which I was just beginning to learn to do. I bought a small torch so I could light the skeleton and cast shadows that would turn into aquatints. I found photographs of other albatross skeletons online and tried to map out a three-plate print, separated by thin vertical gaps like a Japanese woodcut. I imagined a grainy black background partly flecked with stopped-out stars, the albatross floating in the night. As I fell asleep I fantasised about an etching needle gliding across the dark waxy ground of the metal plate, a glint of copper coming through in its wake, tracing the shape of the bird’s beak and ribs, its wings and feet. Over and over in my mind I drew fine, fluid lines, like ice-skating or conducting or a sword fight.</p>
<p>Almost everything about the albatross is extreme. The wandering albatross, which is the largest of the 22 species now identified, has the widest wingspan of any bird (up to 3.5 metres). They are circumpolar. They can glide for hours without flapping their wings – a form of flight known as dynamic soaring, which has been studied by aerospace engineers in an effort to make drones more energy efficient. They mate monogamously and for life, after spending years practising elaborate courtship dances, but they only see their partner once every year or so, when they meet to produce a single egg. Until they’re old enough to breed, which can take up to a decade, albatrosses live in the air, never touching the earth. The oldest bird in the world (or at least the oldest any human has been able to track) is a Laysan albatross that still hatches a chick every year on an island midway between Asia and North America. She is thought to be 69 and to have flown a distance equivalent to circumnavigating the Earth 120 times.</p>
<p>It isn’t known whether the albatross already belonged to Robert Edmond Grant when he started to put together his collection in 1827. Grant arrived in London that year from Edinburgh, where he had taught Charles Darwin and studied marine invertebrates with him in the Firth of Forth. All 12 of Grant’s brothers joined the navy or worked for the East India Company; he stayed closer to home, becoming a founding professor of the University of London, and the first professor of zoology and comparative anatomy in the country. He walked across the Alps seven times and was familiar with the natural history collections of Florence and Paris. He knew Georges Cuvier and was described by Geoffroy St Hilaire as ‘le premier entre tous les savans’.</p>
<p>The Grant Museum of Zoology c.1880.</p>
<p>When gathering specimens for the new ‘people’s university’, Grant probably asked his wide and well-travelled network of friends for donations. The albatross arrived at some point between 1827 and the 1880s, when a photograph shows it on display (Grant died in 1874). An inventory dated 1850 lists 64 bird skeletons without specifying the kinds of bird. The museum’s first catalogue, which does mention the species by name, was compiled in 1890. Based on the patina on the bones and the style in which the skeleton is mounted, the wandering albatross is likely to be one of the earliest specimens in the collection. But even if we could work out when it was acquired, there’s no record of its sex, age or country of origin.</p>
<p>Although Grant remained at the University of London until his death, the debates over evolution in the 1830s led to his being ostracised from the scientific establishment (his love of opera, familiarity with foreign languages and the fact that he never married probably also positioned him as an outsider – as did his caustic tongue). His dissemination of Lamarckian ideas had an influence far wider than his zoological contributions to the study of marine life, but he was reduced to living in a slum, and delivered his lectures in a tattered tailcoat. One of his supporters was Thomas Wakley, the editor of the Lancet, who in 1833 sent a shorthand writer to take down sixty comparative anatomy lectures given by Grant, and proceeded to publish them at the rate of one a week. In the course of two lectures on the osteology of birds, Grant used the specimens in his collection as demonstration models. ‘I hold in my hand the two clavicles, anchylosed, of the great condor of the Andes,’ he announced, pointing out that birds were particularly remarkable for their skeletons. ‘In the texture and composition of the bones, the class of birds has arrived at the maximum of development known in the animal kingdom.’</p>
<p>Grant guided students through every part of a bird’s body: the way its neck was used as a prehensile hand; the trunk vertebrae ‘almost as fixed as that of a tortoise’; the enormous orbits of its skull; the complex structure of the wings; legs ‘totally destitute of plumage’; the arrangement of the toes. He referred to albatrosses when describing their bills shaped ‘for pouncing upon a fish’, but he doesn’t seem to have had a specimen to hand, although he showed his students the sternum of a peacock, the nostrils of an osprey and the ‘sigmoid flexure’ in the neck of a swan.</p>
<p>An illustration of a camera lucida.</p>
<p>I’d bought a large drawing board to the museum, but realised that I wanted to make a much smaller sketch, using a camera lucida I’d found a year earlier at an auction of ‘fine photographica and instruments of science’. It was lot 108: ‘A camera lucida, English, 19th-century, in lacquered brass, in velvet-lined mahogany case, with period detailed illustrated instruction leaflet’. Invented in 1806 and widely used in the 1820s and 1830s, the camera lucida was the last popular drawing aid adopted by artists before the advent of photography. Unlike a camera obscura, which is, literally, a dark room or chamber into which an image is projected, the only ‘room’ in the camera lucida is a small, four-sided glass prism fixed to the top of an extendable brass rod. Because it causes an image to appear over the drawing surface, it offers the possibility of putting objects in perspective with confidence and speed – a camera obscura minus the dark. The prism is about the width of a human eye, and at the other end of the rod, a vice allows you to screw the whole thing to your desk or drawing board. It’s small and simple – William Hyde Wollaston, the chemist who invented it, could fit his whole laboratory on a tea tray – and it appears to work, as you look through the prism, by projecting the object in front of you onto the paper beneath your hand.</p>
<p>But there is no projection. The image is trapped inside the prism. No one around you can see it – it’s almost a hallucination. David Hockney, who took up drawing with a modern camera lucida in 1999, described it in Secret Knowledge (2001) as projecting not ‘a real image of the subject, but an illusion of one in the eye’:</p>
<p>At first I found the camera lucida very difficult to use … When you move your head everything moves with it, and the artist must learn to make very quick notations to fix the position of the eyes, nose and mouth and to capture a ‘likeness’. It is concentrated work.</p>
<p>The first time I tried to use mine, dejection was swift. The 19th-century instructions weren’t much help in angling the prism. The image was disconcertingly doubled – more like a migraine than a magic trick. Even when you could focus, you couldn’t see your drawing hand, or you could one minute and not the next. If you blinked it was a disaster. I found the whole enterprise confusing and over-complicated. No wonder it never caught on, I thought.</p>
<p>At the time, the camera lucida was said to be unpopular because amateurs either couldn’t get the hang of looking through the prism or didn’t like the drawings they produced. Henry Fox Talbot’s response, which he noted in The Pencil of Nature, was typical:</p>
<p>I was amusing myself on the lovely shores of Lake Como, in Italy, taking sketches with Wollaston’s Camera Lucida, or rather I should say, attempting to take them: but with the smallest possible amount of success. For when the eye was removed from the prism – in which all looked beautiful – I found that the faithless pencil had only left traces on the paper melancholy to behold. After various fruitless attempts, I laid aside the instrument and came to the conclusion, that its use required a previous knowledge of drawing, which unfortunately I did not possess.</p>
<p>He went on to record what he saw by chemical means – which caused ‘natural images to imprint themselves durably and remain fixed upon the paper’.</p>
<p>Yet when the painter John Sell Cotman was given a camera lucida in 1817, he wrote to a friend that ‘they are used by all ye artists I find!’ The prolific Victorian sculptor Francis Chantrey used one to sketch three views of each of his sitters, which he would give to his assistants as the basis for a bust. The Scottish optics expert David Brewster remarked in 1831 that it had ‘come into very general use’. A piece in Mechanics Magazine around the same time noted that it was ‘used to an extent that will scarcely be credited’.</p>
<p>Scientists, architects, archeologists, explorers: people working in all these fields used the camera lucida. The most significant portfolio of camera lucida drawings was made by the astronomer and chemist John Herschel. On his Grand Tour with Charles Babbage in 1821, Herschel’s travelling equipment included a mountain barometer, a pocket compass, a small sextant, two mineralogical hammers, a camera lucida and a drawing board. He drew the Alps, the crater of Vesuvius and the peak of Mount Etna. The notes on his drawings include navigational co-ordinates and geological formations.</p>
<p>Some artists were ambivalent. The retired Scottish naval captain Basil Hall, who was one of the device’s greatest advocates and the probable reason for its widespread use in Scotland, wrote that artists were ‘apt to feel a sort of humiliation when borrowing instrumental assistance’. They needn’t worry, he said: ‘The Camera, though possessed of great powers, has no means of supplying intellect, taste and industry to persons who by nature are destitute of these gifts.’ Hockney tried to make a similar point: ‘Let me say here that optics do not make marks.’</p>
<p>If you’re interested in 19th-century pioneers of light, sooner or later you want to try to see what they saw. Brewster invented the kaleidoscope. Herschel taught his friends how to print nature in blue (cyanotypes – the original blueprints). Joshua Reynolds disguised his portable camera obscura as a book (when you opened it, the view appeared upside down). I liked the way you could flip, slice, tone, multiply or otherwise reformulate your vision. ‘Photogenic drawing’, an image created by light, might as well have been a psychogenic symptom in the 1830s. Tricks of the light, tricks of the mind: photography was magical thinking, corroborated.</p>
<p>A while after my first attempts with the camera lucida I tried again, expecting nothing. I found that my eye could withstand the strange balance of peripheral vision for increasingly long periods, but it was never more than ten minutes before the whole illusion vanished. (This was what Hockney meant when he wrote about having to find quick forms of notation.) One thing that was especially odd was that even if you could just about see your hand you couldn’t see the marks it was making: the drawing was indistinguishable from the illusion. The process was like drawing blindfold, although it was really the opposite – a surfeit of seeing. The wonkiness or wooziness of the drawings was like automatic writing. They were accidentally expressive. If you were after exactitude this was no way to go about it, but if you thought of the prism as producing an apparition – reminiscent of Pepper’s Ghost – then the drawings were just right: as if summoned during a séance.</p>
<p>Eventually, what Talbot found maddening felt liberating to me. In weekly life drawing classes I had developed a correctness compulsion: when I realised I was capable of producing a decent likeness of a person I was seized by an urge to repeat it, fuelled by adrenaline and an appetite for accuracy. The results were stiff and disappointing. The camera lucida offered the opposite: something that was impossible to intend fully. The drawings were semi-conscious, made at great speed in order to record an illusion, the way you might wake up and try to write down what had happened in a dream. My favourite results were those that didn’t quite look like something I’d made, yet felt like something I meant.</p>
<p>Gaby Wood’s etching of an albatross.</p>
<p>By the time I used the camera lucida in the museum, I’d spent several months grappling with the strange proposition offered by its prism. I’d read that the image was sharper if you held it over a dark drawing surface, but that didn’t make any sense to me until the smoked metal etching plate was beneath my hand. Suddenly the albatross skeleton appeared on it: bright, spectral. The process was different from the way I’d imagined it. There was a drag, almost a dance, under the needle – a tiny jump of resistance in the copper. Without seeing what you were doing, you could feel it more keenly. It wasn’t like ice-skating at all.</p>
<p>As a novice etcher, I have spent quite a bit of time thinking about ‘states’. Although I’d seen references to an etching’s state – ‘second state of four’, ‘fifth state’ and so on – I hadn’t really taken in what it meant. When you make an etching you tend to work on it in layers, and often over a long period. Painters do that too, but when you’re etching the only way to see the result is to print it (apart from anything else, the print is backwards in relation to the plate). The finished plate, which can be used for hundreds of near identical prints, will have produced printed records of its younger selves, or ‘states’. Of course, you don’t have to call your early trials ‘states’ – you could just call them rubbish and throw them in the bin. But artists often make editions of different states, and collectors might acquire several of them. There’s an acknowledgment, when dealing with this medium, that one image is haunted by its ancestors or alternates.</p>
<p>Most people in my etching class felt, as I did, that their fear of the blank page was intensified when the page was made of metal. The permanence of the marks seemed alarming. But one of the first things you’re taught is the flexibility of the etching plate. Making a change on metal is more laborious than rubbing something out on paper, but metal is much more durable, and will withstand more changes. You can bite (with acid) or burnish off weeks of work and begin smoothly again, printing an image that looks as fresh as it did at the start.</p>
<p>Once you grasp the notion of states you realise that etching is a process in which changing your mind is part of the grammar. If you insist on planning everything in advance, without leaving yourself open to chance and to the effects of time, you’re not really speaking the language of etching. ‘Don’t block the inherent characteristics of the process,’ our tutor told us. The image, he said, should be ‘restless’.</p>
<p>A second state print of Degas’s ‘Self-Portrait’ (1857).</p>
<p>When you look at the different states of prints by Rembrandt or Goya or Manet or Degas, you can trace their changing intentions. For instance, a self-portrait made by Degas when he was 23 began as a light etch, with fine, spaced-out cross-hatching. Later, it became richer – the lines dense and black – yet remained a faint idea of a self: the hands unfinished, the features withheld within shade. The first state might be mistaken for hesitation; the second proves it to have been restraint, now more explicitly delivered.</p>
<p>When an etcher thinks a plate has reached the end of its lifespan, or doesn’t wish to authorise further prints, she or he can ‘cancel’ it by scratching lines across the metal. This early self-portrait was one of 21 plates cancelled by Degas with a diagonal slash, then sold to his dealer Ambroise Vollard. After Degas’s death Vollard made editions of 150 prints from each of these. They’re unsigned, of course, and much less valuable than the original states, but they are nonetheless works by Degas. Scarred, denied, sold and reinvented, the prints from the cancelled plates seem like a posthumous message from the cantankerous artist himself.</p>
<p>Rembrandt, the godfather of etchers, was better known in his lifetime for his prints than for his paintings, and would sometimes return several years later to a plate, continuing to play with the process. A few of the changes he made were dramatic – an entire crowd scene removed and replaced by architecture, for instance. Other changes were tiny: a key added to the side of a stove, a bonnet swapped for hair. There was a financial incentive, of course: even a change as small as that would constitute a new state, and a whole new edition could be put up for sale.</p>
<p>When my plate was processed and printed – a chemical bite into metal; a slow rotating wipe of blackened scrim; a heavy roll of the printing press – the effect, at least to my eyes, was of an image slightly suspended over the paper. This ghostly aspect, plus the suggestion of a fossil record in the grooves of the plate itself, seemed apt. There was another element too: a clumsiness or sadness, as if chance had found something in the albatross that I’d seen at the start but forgotten. This was the first state, and I let it hover there. Later, I added some aquatint shading, which gave it more depth, but made it seem more conventional, less surprising.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps too fanciful to say that the state of an etching bears a relation to its maker’s state of mind. It doesn’t, really – or not necessarily. But at the very least it’s something fluid. If each state suggests a sequence, then every etching is a narrative image by implication. This idea pleases me more than I can explain: the work of art as open-ended train of thought.</p>
<p>I had made another appointment to see the albatross in April, but went back before then. I wanted to try etching on a bigger plate, and I had an idea, too, for a series of etchings of specimens in the museum – skeletons drawn with the camera lucida. I made a list: the thylacine, now extinct and lit for menace; the babirusa skull, tusks curling backwards towards its forehead; the unprotected underside of a giant turtle; the gibbon, long palms facing upwards; the armadillo with its levitating carapace; a fish; a frosted bat; the oldest penguin. I set to work: camera lucida, etching plate, needle. As I traced the albatross’s outline for the second time, I could hear the curator on the phone, receiving instructions to close the museum for the foreseeable future. I put down my needle and looked at the bird’s face. Its skull was tilted to the left, as if asking a question. I packed up my things.

As we sit cocooned in the self during this pandemic, an age is silently slipping away. An age when classrooms and campuses defined the personal and collective dreams of a generation. A sensuous ensemble of colour and touch, of human smells of sweat and starch, of finding delightful flavours in humble shared midday meals, of vagabond tales and truant passions.</p>
<p>Classrooms are chronicles of time. Here, many wiped away another’s tears, shared pangs of hunger, or partook in desolate sighs and simple joys. Classrooms taught us empathy and humanity; there were verses under the trees, plays in the wind, and psalms in shared food, giving one life lessons in camaraderie. There were silences, punishments, humiliations and bullying, where we learnt to stand up for ourselves and others. But the continual discovery of bonds over differences, shared initiations and common agonies and ecstasies moulded the way many of us picked ourselves up and walked out of that immense gallery of life into the wide world.</p>
<p>More than teaching or learning, it was the sociality and the camaraderie, the tumult of togetherness, and learning to live with differences and commonalities that made classrooms a rich social space, a microcosm of human plenty. Finding that one cherished friend in whose company the world lost its desolation, celebrating and mourning in togetherness, learning to shed the rough edges of personal egos and privileges, were all precious legacies. In fact, as social beings, many of us were literally shaped by our classrooms. However fragile or tentative their educational value, classrooms are nevertheless clumsy communal blessings; and no matter how dark the setting, there were many unforgettable moments of affinity, fellowships of pride and humanity burnished with time and the exuberance of esprit de corps. At a time when the flags of our destinies were yet furled, with infinite lightness of being, with far more tenderness and far less cumbersome customs, we bonded over seasons of sun and rain and drank deep of the cup of collective life. Those classrooms that spiced the shores of our life with gregarious fragrances, while wearing the vibrant colours and aspirations of a supple youth and its ardent socialities, are soon to be a thing of the past. The COVID-19 pandemic has fossilised us in space, building islands of solitude all around. The classroom was a social space, a habitus, a network of individual and collective practices. It gave all its inhabitants, teachers and students alike, a wider scope of creating positions within practices, finding and locating oneself within the social. In that sense, even before the idea of the state, it was our first encounter with a polis, an organisation of people arising precisely out of acting and speaking together, a shared space of words and deeds.</p>
<p>The transition to the online makes many wonder whether the students of tomorrow will be Shakespearean soliloquies, characters who speak aloud to themselves; spectral beings glued to computer displays, strangers to the consolations of another beating heart, or the sweat of a burdened brow, or the gentle flow of another’s tears. The collectivism and organic nature of our traditional classrooms will slowly yield to the individualism and plasticity of the online. A teacher will probably never really know her students again, see the light of understanding dawn in their eyes, or discover through empathy the face of hunger hidden behind an uninterested gaze. Technology can, of course, magnify the boxed images of her students, but in the process, it can only transform a throbbing social world to digitally enhanced images and representations.</p>
<p>Complex issue</p>
<p>The rather hurried move to online in the name of the COVID-19 pandemic makes one wonder whether there are deeper issues at stake. At a fundamental level, one does not need any data or survey to understand how critical, multifaceted and complex the issue of digital divide is in India. All one needs to do is to think of the millions of migrant workers walking hundreds of kilometres from quarantined cities to their villages, even as the relatively privileged middle classes, who constitute about 28 per cent of the population, are safely ensconced in comfort to pore over their laptops or smart phones, working or studying from home. While governmental bodies, universities and institutions seem to be drafting policies to address the divide and include the differently abled and the dispossessed into the portals of online education, the distance between the cup and the lip is anybody’s guess, given the distrust of the fact that what had been insufficiently addressed all these years would be miraculously cured by the magic hand of the digital. With 1.17 billion wireless phone subscribers and 560 million Internet subscribers, India is the second largest Internet market in the world after China, but the fact remains that there are still 900 million people without any direct access to the Internet. This, further intensified by class, caste, religion, region, gender and sexuality, among many other factors, creates conundrums of the worst kind, posing serious obstacles in the transition to online education. It is easy for the 560 million, most of them part of a vast middle class, to be blind to the glaring economic difference between them and the 900 million, and the huge impact this digital chasm would make on the knowledge economy.</p>
<p>Access is not the sole issue at stake here. The advantaged and the disadvantaged do not respond to technology in the same manner and the need is also to understand the variance in behavioural models, especially in education, between the socially and economically disadvantaged and say, the privileged millennials with digital usage experience. Furthermore, within a digital economy, while digital literacy can be imparted over a period of time, what needs to be emphasised is the idea of digital citizenship. A citizen is a participatory member of a political community, and it is necessary to see the digital economy not only as the organisational logic of an economic community, but also one creating a social and political community. It is important that along with digital access and literacy a student should also be conceived of as a digital citizen, capable of creatively and critically engaging with and coming together over shared social and public worlds.</p>
<p>This is not a panegyric for the traditional classroom, nor is it an invective against digital classrooms, which, in all probability, are here to stay. The need of the hour is to think of ways of devising a healthy balance between the two. Digital tools and e-learning have enabled many teachers override the narrow physical limitations of the classroom and acquire new kinds of mobilities, both in terms of content and in terms of methods. There seems to be an attempt to force an unnecessary binary between traditional and online classrooms, pooh-poohing all attempted critiques of this shift as technophobia and laziness, which barks right up the alley of the market and its corporate dreams of technocratic education. There is no discounting the fact that the old order changes, yielding place to new. Irrespective of wishful encomiums, we are in the digital age and digital technologies are pivotal in producing and disseminating knowledge to large numbers of people, making it a priceless asset in harnessing the democratising potential of technology to the higher purpose of education. Moreover, for nearly a decade now, education in India has indeed been digitally oriented and enhanced. There has been a wide prevalence of digital tools and techniques along with e-books and e-reading. Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-enabled classrooms became a requisite for education, with the University Grants Commission (UGC) making it mandatory for teachers and institutions to incorporate such practices into the curriculum for their promotions and accreditation respectively. However, the lacuna was that even as the shift to the smart classrooms happens, many teachers who belong to the old school have not been trained sufficiently and “smartened” to the use of ICT.</p>
<p>As the pandemic forces a hasty move to the online mode with fears of this being the new norm, one should learn from past mistakes and train teachers in new uses of technology. However, this shift must not be reduced to attempts at mimicking or replicating a virtual model of the physical classroom but also strive to recreate it with new possibilities and pedagogies that would enable more imaginative interactions, from flipped and blended classrooms to more collaborative and interactive learner-centric models and templates.</p>
<p>There should also be a concerted effort for academic audits and feedback from students, making their voices more audible in the portals of education. Another imperative is the need for rapid digitisation of books and resources and the online availability of these digitised materials. It is indeed amusing to think that many libraries in India have wonderful digital archives, but there is a studied reluctance to make them available to researchers other than through physical access, which defeats the very philosophy of digitisation.</p>
<p>India has one of the most outdated examination systems in the world. Other than encouraging the propensity of learning by rote and testing memory, our traditional closed-book examinations can boast of little else. The open book exam, which allows students to access notes, texts and other academic resources while writing an exam, tests a student’s ability to find the right information. It also helps the student interact with such materials in a scholarly and ethical manner, thus creating a dialogue between existing knowledge and one’s own creative and critical engagements with it, bearing in mind contexts and positionalities while attempting a rigorous and socially charged critique. This would also mean training the teachers in asking questions differently.</p>
<p>Open-book exam</p>
<p>Three students from the Chuna Bhatti slum area have filed a case in the Delhi High Court against Delhi University’s decision to implement open-book examinations, citing unequal opportunities in the proposed mode. The petitioners cannot be more correct when they say that there are differences in circumstances with regard to home environments, access to devices and Internet connectivity for different students, all of which affect how a student writes an exam. It is true that a steady and fast Internet connection is a remote dream for many Indians, and therefore solutions like take-home open-book exams, where students can attempt answering at a more convenient time and pace, could be implemented. But as pointed out by the petitioners, many students come from environments not conducive to home-learning or home exams, not only in terms of space but also with regard to emotional and affective economies.</p>
<p>One needs to rethink the concept of a homogenised ideal home where learning could be undertaken at peace. For many, homes could be spaces of violence, repression and struggle, and they therefore conceive of classrooms as safe spaces of more egalitarian interaction and bonding. Moreover, a lecture of one hour requires at an average about 500 MB of data/hour. For a family with two children attending three hours of class daily, the data requirement would be 3 GB. This is in addition to two computers or smartphones, headsets and webcams. The petitioners in the Delhi High Court have argued that such gadgets and their quality will give an unfair advantage to economically well-off students. How many Indian households with agricultural labourers or migrant workers as earning members can afford high-quality learning gadgets? How many girls would find their education sabotaged because making technology available is, at worst, a gendered process in a land torn by patriarchies which are compounded by caste and class?</p>
<p>Internet as a basic right</p>
<p>In a networked society, where the idea of space and time, along with economy and governance, have undergone paradigm shifts, so much so that the enjoyment of all fundamental rights seem linked to information technologies, the government could, of course, try to make Internet access a basic human right. Communication technologies have become crucial to marginalised people all around the world in their need to express opinion and their right to freedom of speech, as also in exercising other fundamental rights, especially given the slow ousting of traditional media by new media.</p>
<p>Just as the underprivileged and dispossessed have a right to public spaces, they have a right to digital spaces, information highways and networks, and participation in e-governance, which are today as much linked to lives as to livelihoods within what should ideally be a digital democracy. All this calls for an urgent need to address the almost impending prospect of a monopoly in the Indian telecommunication market, a national moral obligation as never before to strengthen the state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). One cannot emphasise enough the need to revive and resuscitate India’s largest public sector telecom operator, the only viable option in providing telecom services to commercially non-viable areas, instead of playing into the hands of private players who might initially make huge offers and discounts but end up as monopolies at the peril of the underprivileged consumers.</p>
<p>Efforts such as those initiated by the government of Kerala to get free Internet to two million poor households through the Kerala Fibre Optic Network, a joint venture of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and the Kerala State IT Infrastructure Limited, are exemplary in that they envisage Internet as a basic citizen right.</p>
<p>‘Teaching Commons’</p>
<p>Implementing the idea of “Teaching Commons”, which brings together high-quality open educational resources including open access textbooks, course materials, lesson plans, multimedia and more from leading colleges and universities, curated by librarians and their institutions, could be an immense help at this point of time. A blended system of online and offline classes may be an option until we tide over the pandemic. But the looming doubt in the minds of many is whether the pandemic is a pretext to hasten the technological takeover of the classroom for a booming knowledge industry.</p>
<p>The world over, there seems to be an eager readiness to embrace the online uncritically, which creates a nagging suspicion of whether the neoliberal market is fuelling a desire that aims to transform public education into a feeder service for corporate capitalism. A techno-market rhetoric which speaks of all the educational achievements of postcolonial nations as the democratisation of mediocrity creates an aspiration for “elite models” which then quickens to the fulfilment of that ultimate capitalist dream of a knowledge-for-profit revolution. For the thriving middle and upper classes of countries like India, this would mean the great pride of educating their children in “world-class” institutions through new global educational services enabled by the digital, while the less privileged might be systematically erased as collateral damages in the course of fulfilling such magnificent class dreams.</p>
<p>That this might even come at the expendability of the “guru”, who could be eased out by pre-recorded lectures and contract tutoring, does not seem to dampen the spirits of many who had once upon a time waxed eloquent on the holy covenant of guru-sishya relationships. Market models would strive to maximise profits through minimum expenditure. The greatest educational expense is, of course, the teacher, and what better way to cut public expenditure on education than by making one-third of them redundant in the shift online, as estimated, and then slowly eliminating them from the system.</p>
<p>Massive customised programmes like MOOCs [massive open online courses], while helping mass education, have often been considered as failures by universities in the West in that they are more prone to the forces of economics than education, and also owing to the huge dropout ratio, and mostly weak pedagogy. While culpable of creating a “star” system within academia, MOOCs also need to be rethought within frameworks of interactiveness, and higher academic and research goals.</p>
<p>A classroom is a safe space not just for the dissemination of information and knowledge, but for critical thinking, difficult dialogue and scholarly debates and dissent. Along with the question of data protection of teachers and students, the fear of digital surveillance to silence dissent is a concrete issue that begs for immediate attention in that technology requires ethical and transparent policies to be the bedrock on which humans transact with it. The United States, for example, has a first amendment of the Constitution which guarantees freedom of speech and ensures that students or teachers “do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate” and have every right to engage in symbolic speeches of protest. This is the reason why people like Noam Chomsky are able to write essays like “The Responsibility of Intellectuals” from within the U.S. academia. The citizens of many countries in the world do not have the same luxury of freedom of speech as an absolute right, or they might have other fears to reckon with, like sedition laws that might hang like the sword of Damocles over the right to free speech and thought. In the wake of surveillance states all around the world, this could pose threats to the supposedly limitless intellectual domain of a classroom, where ideally all knowledge needs to be questioned in the quest for new and unconsidered modes of thought.</p>
<p>One need only think about that ancient teacher Socrates who was killed by the state of Athens in 399 BCE for asking politico-philosophical questions of his students and talking to them about new gods. While science streams grapple with worries over virtual laboratories and dummy experiments, the humanities and social sciences have to reckon with such new fears. Under new “omniopticons” where everybody is surveilling everybody else, will a teacher be able to refer to queer politics in a class on gender and sexuality without a moral majority baying for her blood? The death of the social potential of classrooms through surveillance, compounded by distancing, could mean the death of critique and the silencing of dissent, which would be a dream come true for corporate, neoliberal forces. This could also be a requiem for the teacher as an organic intellectual and the student as a social agent in a civil society.</p>
<p>But even amidst this transition to the online, where many seem happy to uncritically accept the fact that states of exception might soon become the new norm, the resounding question is one that predates the virus, one that is probably as old as civilisation itself: “What is the function of education?” How we answer this question will determine how deeply the virus has dehumanised, desocialised and depoliticised us.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, our erstwhile classrooms and vibrant campuses which made many of us who we are today. May the flights of angels lead you on your way and martyrs greet you after death’s dark night.</p>
