<p>Spoiler Warning: This article contains spoilers for Outlander Season 5, Episode 10, “Mercy Shall Follow Me.”</p>
<p>Outlander keeps getting better. The further it gets into Season 5, the closer it gets to the Season 1 vibe. Last episode, which was one of my two favorites ever in this show, Jamie almost died, Claire brought him back to life, Roger stepped up and Bree saved the day — and her dad’s leg.</p>
<p>And this week delivers yet another riveting episode, which had me holding my breath the entire time. Except for the time I paused it to pour a glass of wine. Buckle in, for 59 minutes of pure entertaining stress in this bona fide epic episode, or rather Bonnet-fide. That’s right: Bonnet is back and he’s worse than ever.</p>
<p>Bonnet in a Brothel</p>
<p>Bonnet meets with that little weasel lawyer, Forbes in a brothel. Forbes warns Bonnet that he shouldn’t be “trading commodities of a female nature.” Is Bonnet a pimp now? He spends most of this meeting eyeing a prostitute across the room. Forbes tells him if he wants his son, he shouldn’t be doing this. I ask again, how does Weasel lawyer know that Jemmy might be Bonnet’s? How? You know who that Weasel is? He’s the Peter Pettigrew character in Harry Potter. A rat. Forbes assures Bonnet that young Jeremiah will be with his father, and asks Bonnet when he’ll be paid. Bonnet says once I have my son there will be an accident for Jocasta and her bride groom. Oh! This lawyer is Jocasta’s lawyer! He’s the jilted douche. The one Bree didn’t pick! Of course this is about a man who can’t take no for an answer. So Jocasta needs a new lawyer.</p>
<p>“To Catch a Bonnet” — Jamie and Claire Put Their Plan into Action</p>
<p>Fam Fraser is having a lovely lunch where Jamie, Claire, Bree and Roger discuss murdering Bonnet for the greater good. They’re so cute. Claire says she doesn’t trust Philip Wylie, Panto man, to keep his word. Jamie says he thinks he will. Claire responds, “What if he doesn’t?” And Jamie says, “Well, I’ll be dead.” Too soon, Jamie. We have not yet recovered from your last brush with death, though it did bring us probably one of the best Jamie and Claire scenes in the entire series. Claire created a new form of CPR. The C stands for Claire. The R stands for Resuscitation, and I’ll let you figure out what the P stands for.</p>
<p>Claire is not digging Jamie’s death jokes. But then he says, “If you find the time, make Wylie suffer for it,” and Claire smiles. She loves good murder humor. Bree looks at her parents with heart eyes.</p>
<p>Young Ian joins them, looking like a mini James Fraser. He’s going to be Mr. Alexander Malcolm. Ooh, this episode is very suspenseful and it’s only 6 minutes in. Jamie tells Claire that if he, Roger and Ian don’t come back in two days, go back to The Ridge. Claire’s like, “If you don’t return we’re coming to find you.” Jamie looks hella proud. She ain’t a regular wife, she’s a “cool wife.”</p>
<p>It’s funny when Jamie tries to tell Claire what to do. It never goes well for him. Watch Caitriona Balfe impersonate Sam Heughan’s Jamie, in this funny video where a fan called out this exact situation.</p>
<p>Claire &amp; Bree — Hit Me With Your Best Shot</p>
<p>Claire and Bree head out in town to talk to a local glass blower. They show him a drawing of their syringe. He says this is rather small. That’s what she said. Claire replies, “The smallest things in life are the most useful.” That’s what she said. Did she though? (They really set me up well, I’m sorry).</p>
<p>He asks them, “Aren’t syringes made out of brass?” Claire says, “Well I prefer to use this easier to sterilize, err I mean clean.” He looks perplexed. I love when Claire slips up and uses her future speak. Cue montage of Claire doing this at least once a month since season 1.</p>
<p>Glass blower is in. Claire and Bree are the cutest time-traveling-syringe-making mother daughter duo ever. Bree asks when was the hypodermic needle invented. Claire responds, “Not for a while. But I need one. Your father has a knack for almost getting himself killed every time he gets out of bed. I swear that man is like a cat, 9 lives, if not more.” Oh shit. As they’re walking, someone is watching them. They don’t reveal who but pretty sure it’s Bonnet.</p>
<p>Jamie, Roger and Ian Wait for Bonnet</p>
<p>The boys arrive at Wylie’s landing. They look kind of badass. But Roger has so many weapons on his belt. Okay, just last episode he said he wasn’t into violence, guns etc. and now he has 45 weapons on his belt.</p>
<p>Jamie says Bonnet will probably come with sailors and it’s their one chance. (Aka, don’t mess this up boys).</p>
<p>Claire Takes Her Daughter to Work Day — aka The Beach</p>
<p>Bree and Claire are walking on the beach. I FEEL NERVOUS. Oh, they’re looking for shells and sponges for Claire’s surgery. Of course. That’s why I go to the beach too. Someone. Is. Watching. Them. Cue creepy music. Outlander will not let us have nice things!</p>
<p>Roger tells Jamie he wants to kill Bonnet. Now Roger, I like you, we came a long way in the last episode. You, me and Jamie. Jamie and I like you now, but you really can’t aim, man. Exhibit A and Exhibit B.</p>
<p>Jamie and I have the same reaction. But Roger says, “I’m doing it, Brianna is your daughter but she’s my wife.” That argument falls kind of empty for me. Jamie says, “Don’t hesitate. Kill him the moment you have the chance.” Then Jamie and Roger make a boy pact. Jamie says, “If you get killed, I’ll avenge you.” “And, I you,” Roger responds. This is an adorable bromance now. Then they split up, which makes me concerned. Mainly for Roger.</p>
<p>Back to Claire and Bree on the beach, a huge whale jumps out of the water and then six more. Claire and Bree, whale watchers. Then they both say how much they loved Moby Dick. Cute mom-daughter book club moment happening on this beach. They reminisce about racing on the beach when Bree was little. And then they start racing each other. Omg guys, this makes my heart hurt. Twitter fan @marjorie_pr says it best. Finally, we are getting family scenes. Why isn’t Jamie here? He would no doubt race Bree. Fraser beach marathon? Yes, please. Bree says, “It’s not easy in a corset.” Claire says, “I’m too old for this running sh*t.”</p>
<p>Here’s what that marathon would look like. I don’t know who made the Jamie and Phoebe from Friends running gif, but whoever you are, you are a legend.</p>
<p>When you hear it&rsquo;s time for #OutlanderatMidnight. Head over to the @STARZ App to watch a new episode of #Outlander now. https://t.co/ATYIxBiMX4 pic.twitter.com/YS7j1zQxQa — Outlander (@Outlander_STARZ) April 26, 2020</p>
<p>This is too perfect, something bad is about to happen. Bree decides to walk in the water for a bit and Claire says she’s going to look for more shells. No girls! Do not separate on that beautiful whale beach!</p>
<p>Son of a Beach</p>
<p>Back at Wylie’s landing, Ian, Jamie and Roger see some men arriving. It’s basically three men on a boat meet three men not on a boat. We then cut back to Bree and Claire on the beach. I already know, Bonnet ain’t on that boat, because he’s on that beach.</p>
<p>Claire is in a field channeling her best Julie Andrews Sound of Music look. The hills are alive. She and Bree wave to each other. This perfect moment. Eek.</p>
<p>The boys learn Bonnet is not there. He had business elsewhere. Hello, let’s name that beach “Elsewhere.” The sailors go in the shed then Jamie beats the crap out of them. Even Roger gets a good barrel shot in! He actually throws a barrel at someone. One guy almost stabs Roger but then last min Jamie saves him. Roger is like, “What took you SO LONG DA-IN-LAW?!” And Jamie is all nonchalant, “You were doing so well, dinna think you needed the help.” They interrogate the sailors and asks where Bonnet is. Jamie is amazingly menacing in this scene. But WE KNOW WHERE BONNET is!</p>
<p>Claire bends down to pick up a god damn seashell. And Bonnet reveals himself, “The sea lives inside every shell,” he says. Sea creep.</p>
<p>Claire whips out her tiny gardening knife. Where’s her gun?! Bonnet says, “I never forget a face. Neither you nor your lovely daughter’s. She seems to have inherited your beauty.” Weird time to flirt. You sociopath. Then he asks, “Where’s my son? Does he resemble his handsome father?” Claire is angry. Like Mom angry. Where she will cut you if you threaten her babies. She spits, “You don’t have a son.” He says Bree told me I do. Pause, I’m kind of mad at JAMMF. Knowing Bonnet is on the loose, why would they leave Claire and Bree unprotected?</p>
<p>Then Bree comes running around the corner giving Bonnet a chance to grab Claire and put a knife to her throat. Claire screams, “Bree, RUN!”</p>
<p>Claire yells at her to go! But Bree says, “I’m not leaving you.” She quickly grabs the pistol from Claire’s basket. Ooh Bree with killer moves! Claire says, “SHOOT HIM!” He threatens to cut Claire’s throat. Bree says, “Wait!” Bonnet says, “I’ll let her go if you come with me. I want you and my son.” How romantic, you psycho. Claire ain’t gonna like that. Omg. The next few seconds are super stressful! Claire elbows Bonnet hard and gets free from him so Bree can get a shot! Bree shoots! Damn it, the pistol is empty. Bonnet knocks Claire out, Bree rushes him, and he knocks her out. This isn’t good. Two knocked out ladies on a beach with an actual crazy person. Twitter fan @IAmNotTrisha’s video reaction to this scene is worth watching. She is us. We are her. This would be the time to get another drink.</p>
<p>Gone Girl</p>
<p>Claire wakes up alone on the beach, with a very bad headache. She screams for Bree. She gone, girl. Claire finds Brianna’s boots and belt. That man took Bree barefoot? Sick.</p>
<p>Brianna wakes up with an equally bad headache and sees Bonnet. He’s all, “Would you like some tea?” Oh cool, that’s how he courts women. He assaults them, then throws them a tea party. Please kill him now. Twitter fan @heughanverse agrees with an important cat gif. Bree asks where they are, and he says, “Safe. You’re on my island.” Sorry? Did Bonnet win the lottery last we checked. He has an island? Bree’s like where is my mom? Bonnet says, “I left her on the beach.” You, son of beach.</p>
<p>Bonnet then says, “Can’t we just let bygones be bygones.” No b*tch, we can’t. Bonnet is wearing some actual cray cray pants, when he gives Bree a chest with creepy dolls, a gift for their son. He says, “We made him. I want to do right by you and him.” Seriously, the dolls in that chest are very scary. Like a bunch of small little Phillip Wylies! He says creepily, “I have something for you too.”</p>
<p>Mom and Dad to the Rescue</p>
<p>Cut to Claire galloping on a horse. She runs into Jamie, Ian and Roger and says, “It’s Brianna!” I’m not going to ask how she found them so fast. Though if anyone would have good 17th century GPS skills, it would be Claire.</p>
<p>Bonnet Woos Bree — Blech</p>
<p>Bree comes out in a fancy new dress that Bonkers Bonnet gave her to wear. Oh look, he’s set up an insane romantic dinner for the two of them. Run, Bree, run. He asks, “Am I supposed to pull out the chair for you?” Seeing this weird psycho try to be nice is unnerving. Bree looks unimpressed. He asks her to please sit down. Please let her kill him. And then eat dinner as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>Their weird one-sided date continues and Bonnet says, “What I need is something I can’t buy.” And Bree snaps back, “A moral compass.” Yes, girl. There’s Claire and Jamie’s daughter. A little Sassy, nach.</p>
<p>Bonnet says, “I want to make sure our son knows how to get on in the world. Show me how to be a worthy gentleman. And no harm will come to you.” Then he plays the true typical psycho card. “You saw something in me. You’re drawn to me. Fate has brought us together.”</p>
<p>Okay. I won’t deny that was a fateful night when she saw him holding her mother’s wedding ring. But what he did was horrific, not fate. Bree looks sick. He says, “Fate has brought us together to be parents to Jeremiah.” Bree says, “You know his name?” And he’s all, “Of course, let’s eat!” Worst date ever. Then Bree says, “Elbows off the table.” Ooh, she’s turning him into a little Eliza Doolittle. (Or Pretty Woman, whichever analogy you prefer. This is like if Pretty Woman were remade as a horror film).</p>
<p>Bree and Bonnet’s Book Club — Bonnet Breaks Down</p>
<p>Their date progresses to the bedroom. “What now,” he asks. Eek. Stress level a solid 10 right now. Good time to pause and refill your drink. But Bree has a genius idea. She says, “Read to me.” He looks mad. Oh gosh, unsay it Bree! Bree realizes and says, “If you can’t read I’ll read to you.” Wow, she is very good at this mental warfare!</p>
<p>She tells Bonnet, “You can’t make someone love you.” He says, “Can’t you learn to love me? For the sake of our son?” This is a very good, unsettling scene. Props to Sophie Skelton and Ed Speleers. Outstanding.</p>
<p>Then Bonnet comes up way too close behind her. I DO NOT LIKE IT. Six feet apart, Bonnet! Pandemic parameters are what we’re needing right now. Social distance your a** back, Bonnet. Speaking of social distancing, Twitter fan @catsandkilts re-mixed the Outlander theme song to be more social-distance friendly.</p>
<p>He reveals to Bree that when she told him in the jail that a piece of him would be left on this earth, he couldn’t explain how that made him feel. “Will you teach me how to love?” Very Beauty and the Beast vibes, but not in a fairytale way. She says I’ll read to you and thankfully, he backs away. Worst book club ever.</p>
<p>Okay just a note, you will need several stiff drinks for this episode, as Twitter fan @hailey_beaupre learned.</p>
<p>@Outlander_STARZ so how much alcohol do I need to consume before I watch the episode tonight?? @caitrionambalfe @SamHeughan pic.twitter.com/SEHANp0mWz — Hailey Beaupre (@hailey_beaupre) April 26, 2020</p>
<p>Twitter fan @nichole_bain showed how she and her husband watch stressful Outlander episodes. Is that a JAMMF blanket? Why yes it is.</p>
<p>How we watch #Outlander … thanks to my 14yo daughter for the cozy blanket. I figured since he was feeling a little emotional after 5×10, he could use the snuggles. #outlanderatmidnight pic.twitter.com/n3LQF8YSYU — Nichole Bain (@nichole_bain) April 26, 2020</p>
<p>Bree opens a book called, “The Art of Husbandry,” by Jamie Fraser. (No, not really, but if he did write a book, that might be it. High-five, feminist JAMMF). Bree starts pretend-reading the story of Moby Dick.</p>
<p>Gotta say, she isn’t great at fake reading. Only Claire’s daughter would memorize Moby Dick! Bree tells him this is Jeremiah’s favorite story and he asks if his son loves sea tales. Yes, you evil sea wank. Jemmy loves everything! Except large buffalo.</p>
<p>Bonnet loves this story so much that he lies down on the bed. But he can’t wait and wants to know how it ends! Spoiler-alert-Bon-Bon, up in this joint. So she tells him that the whale wins and Ahab dies. He looks unhappy and very triggered. He says the sea is a monstrous place. Oh! Remember in season 4 when he told Claire he was most afraid of drowning. He tells Bree he’s afraid of the sea. Ed Speleers is very, very good. Chillingly good. Wow. I wish he was a good character so I didn’t want him to be killed. But he’s not, and I do. Oh well.</p>
<p>He says, “You don’t think less of me?” And Bree wittily responds, “I could never think any less of you.” Smart girl. Bonnet has tears in his eyes and asks if Jeremiah gets scared. Bree says he needs his mother and Bonnet says he never had a mother or father. Such a powerful scene. Skelton and Speleers are brilliant. He makes Bonnet terrifying and sad at the same time. She makes Brianna sympathetic yet scared. He asks Bree how she comforts Jeremiah. And she says I would go to him and hold him and Bonnet grabs her. Bree says, “A lady would say goodnight and go to bed alone.” And thankfully psycho says, “I look forward to saying, ‘Good morning’.” Wow he’s crazy.</p>
<p>What’s for Breakfast Bon Bon? Terror with a side of Trauma? Cool.</p>
<p>Bonnet has breakfast brought in and the waitress is the prostitute he hooked up with in the opening scene. What’s going on? Bree decides to play along. She’s really good at this. “Where will we live? Here?” Bree says she needs to tell Jeremiah about him on her own, and that fate will bring them back together. Oooh, good girl use his creepy words against him.</p>
<p>She says she misses Jemmy. He agrees and says while she goes he will find them a place with a bedroom and room for their son. I hate him. And he says we’ll seal it with a kiss. Poor Bree. She nervously kisses him.</p>
<p>And then he turns back into a psycho, and says that kiss was fake and flips on her. He grabs her throat. And then the prostitute comes back in and he tells Brianna I’ll show you what you’re missing. Trigger warning scene.</p>
<p>He proceeds to throw the woman down and have sex with her while Brianna watches. The prostitute smiling during this does not help. Poor Brianna. Super traumatic. This is almost as if he’s attacking her all over again. Her PTSD just took 10 steps back. After they’re done, the prostitute says, “For a few extra I’ll have some fun with her and you can watch.” Luckily, Bonnet says, “No.” He tells her to not let Brianna out of her sight.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Bonnet’s pride has been hurt. There’s a quote by Margaret Atwood, “Men are afraid women will laugh at them. Women are afraid men will kill them.” Bree waves from afar. Bree tries to get the prostitute, Eppy, to help but she’s very unhelpful. Bonnet comes back in and ushers Eppy out.</p>
<p>Roger and Jamie find Wylie sans panto make up and fake mole, and say you must tell us where Bonny is. Roger holds a knife to Wylie’s throat, and pretty sure Wylie pees a little. Wylie quickly reveals that Bonnet hangs out at a brothel.</p>
<p>Claire &amp; Jamie Go to a Brothel</p>
<p>Claire and Jamie go to the brothel together. Lol. The brothel ladies are like, “Hmmmm, different having a husband and wife coming together.” (Poor choice of words). Unimpressed, Claire says, “We’re not here for that. We’re looking for Stephen Bonnet.” Eppy looks down at the ground.</p>
<p>Side note: Claire and Jamie go on the funniest errands together. Hi, weird Beardsley cabin with goats episode, which was one of my favorites this season. Aww, remember when Jamie and Claire lived at a brothel for a hot second in Season 3, and Claire didn’t let that go for two seasons. She’s still mad about it.</p>
<p>Rage at River Run</p>
<p>Weasel lawyer Forbes drops by to visit Jocasta. Jocasta’s new husband is a nice kind teddy bear. Jocasta tells Forbes she wants to give away her fortune to her family. Good thing she can’t see, because Forbes has absolutely no poker face at all. He is freaking out. Jocasta starts listing off how much money everyone is getting. She gives Marsali and Fergus 100lbs, 200lbs to young Ian. Forbes responds, “He’s been living with the Indians!” Oh hey, racist. Weasel says he’s writing it down but he’s super upset and questioning her at every corner. Jocasta! Get a new lawyer girl.</p>
<p>“Brianna and Roger 1000 pounds!” That’s it, that’s the straw that breaks the weasel’s back. Jocasta is like sorry Gerald or whatever lamebot’s name is, “I had hoped Brianna would have picked you.” This little worm. Jocasta says, “Lizzy 25 pounds,” and Forbes flips, like really flips and says “You can’t get give away my money!” Omg is he going to kill Jocasta?! YES. He smothers her with a pillow! She knocks the bell down and Ulysses comes in for the chokehold win!</p>
<p>Every scene in this episode is so terrifyingly exciting!</p>
<p>Jocasta is okay. Phew. Unclear if Ulysses killed weasel. He might have. It sounded like a solid neck snap.</p>
<p>Claire’s Card Trick</p>
<p>Back to Claire and the brothel. Eppy denies she knows Bonnet. And Claire sees her walk funny and says you have this medical condition. She tells her I know why your leg hurts. Eppy is like, “How did you know?!” Claire says, “I’m a healer and you’re in a great deal of pain.” Then Claire does a very cool card trick, and shows her she needs a cobbler to make her shoe that’s higher, the size of the stack of cards. Eppy says I can’t pay for new shoes. And Claire pulls out money and says I’ll help. Eppy says, “Why?” Claire responds simply, “When someone is in need and you can help, you help.”</p>
<p>Eppy tells her where Brianna and Bonnet are. Claire Fraser people, from healer, to card dealer, to heeler, as Twitter fan @kreidy_b calls her.</p>
<p>Ian, Roger, Claire and Jamie get on a boat. Bree, don’t worry, your ridiculously hot parents are bringing all the guns.</p>
<p>Bonnet Sells Bree — Everything’s Just Beachy</p>
<p>And back at Hell Island, Bonnet is selling Bree to a man. Ugh. Stephen Bonnet, sailor, psycho, sex trafficker. The buyer sizes Bree up and checks her teeth. Ew, weirdo. Tooth fetish?! She bites down and he punches her in the stomach. He winds up to slap her, but Bonnet says she’s not yours yet. He then offers 6 pounds and Bonnet says deal. (Btw, 6 pounds is about 7 US dollars today.) They bring Bree down to the beach to complete the transaction. Man, beaches are just not good for this family! No beach vacations for the Frasers. Twitter fan @TinyTunney captured this in two photos. And @axisnebular responded by calling Claire a “sandy, traumatized, goddess.” I see no lies here.</p>
<p>Maybe Claire should stop going to the beach… it really seems to stress her out 😅😳 #Outlander pic.twitter.com/hPfna9LeId — SA7AH (@TinyTunney) April 25, 2020</p>
<p>All of a sudden the Frasers storm the beach. Roger goes after Bonnet, Bree breaks free and Claire and Jamie run to her. Jamie says, “You’re safe.” (Minus the trauma, this is an adorable Fraser moment).</p>
<p>Creepy buyer dude runs to his boat. I wish they had shot him or at least taken his teeth out. He’s actual garbage. Roger and Bonnet roll down the hill fighting and then ROGER BEATS THE BONNET OUT OF STEPHEN. And it’s very satisfying to watch. But I want Bree to shoot him. Please and thank you. They tie him up and then there’s a very cool shot of all the Frasers looking down at Bonnet. Messed with wrong fam, man.</p>
<p>Brianna Fraser</p>
<p>Bree is much nicer than me, it seems. She wants him to be judged according to the law. (I promise I am not murdery in real life, but this show brings it out in me). Murder, she wrote. It me.</p>
<p>Claire is like are you sure? Mama knows best Bree. Let her kill him, which is what I wanted from the beginning. See #7. Claire is very good at healing and killing. And whiskey. And Jamie. And CPR.</p>
<p>Jamie and Roger say Tryon still owes them for accidentally hanging Roger. Claire looks down at Bonnet and honestly if she could kill him with her eyes, this would have been the moment. And then they actually show Bonnet’s punishment. Death by drowning. As the water slowly rises, Bonnet screams. Hours later, he looks up and his expression drops. Bonnet is shot in the head, and on the other side of the gun is Bree. Brianna is a very good shot. Like mother, like daughter. Buffalos and Bonnets had no chance. “Was that mercy or did you want to make sure he’s dead?” Roger asks and Brianna doesn’t answer.</p>
<p>Brianna proved what we’ve known all along, she is the daughter of Jamie and Claire F-ing Fraser. Yes, girl. Brianna then hands Roger her gun. “Hold my gun” is the new “Hold my beer.”</p>
<p>This was Sophie Skelton’s episode. Her strongest work in the series. The last time we saw her shine like this was the day Brianna and Jamie met for the first time. Skelton played the duality of Brianna in these Bonnet scenes with perfection. She went head to head with Speleer. Literally. Played his head games and then her character shot his character in the head. She’s always been ahead of the game. She’s got a good head on her shoulders, that Brianna. Too much? Fine, I’m heading out.</p>
<p>The episodes that focus on Jamie, Claire and the family seem to work best where they all play off of each other, and they are all a part of it. Weaving Brianna and Roger in with Claire and Jamie leading is the secret to this show’s success, it does ensemble incredibly well when it leaves Jamie and Claire at the center. Unlike that season 4 episode aptly named, “Down the Rabbit Hole,” which didn’t feature Claire or Jamie at all, this episode allows Skelton’s Brianna to shine but with the leading support from her parents. Claire and Bree’s beach walk was the episode’s moment of zen. Still missing from this season are substantial Jamie and Brianna scenes.</p>
<p>With only two more episodes left — insert actual tears here — Outlander just keeps on getting better. Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan became producers this season, more so around the halfway mark, and wow it shows. It really shows. This season has seen standout, especially episodes 3, 7, 9 that are some of the best of the series, which is not easy to do in the fifth season of a show. This Bonnet storyline was actually from Book 6, “A Breath of Snow and Ashes.” Which is a first for the show that usually sticks to one book per season.</p>
<p>Remember when Outlander used to be 16 episodes a season? Bring that back for Season 6, Starz. Because this upcoming Droughtlander is going to be too long for everyone. Cast, fans, the world. Give the people what they need.</p>
<p>And just when you think you can calm down because this episode is over, next week’s promo is even more stressful.</p>
<p>NEXT EPISODE: Spoilers — This episode looks terrifying. TERRIFYING. Outlander book series writer Diana Gabaldon penned this episode so it is sure to be good. Claire says, “Ulysses, have you given any thought as to where you might go next?” And he says, “Now that I’m a murderer?” I really want Ulysses to be part of Claire and Jamie’s band. Then Claire runs into her surgery room, screams “What’s the meaning of this?!” And somebody gets stabbed! Jamie runs to light the Fiery Cross, but Claire is not with him. Something bad must happen to Claire. These two cannot catch a break. Also, Claire’s hair is grayer. Is Outlander about to time jump us? I don’t really want that, because remember that 20-year separation/time jump? I can’t let it go, I’m SORRY.

<h3 id="long-acting-reversible-contraception-by-effervescent-microneedle-patch">&ldquo;Long-acting reversible contraception by effervescent microneedle patch&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/11/eaaw8145/F1.large.jpg" alt="img">
To increase access to long-acting contraception, we developed a reversible contraceptive microneedle patch that is simple-to-administer, slowly releases contraceptive hormone (levonorgestrel) for &gt;1 month, and generates no biohazardous sharps waste. After manually pressing the patch to skin for 1 min, microneedles rapidly separate from the patch within the skin due to effervescence triggered by contact with skin’s interstitial fluid, as demonstrated in rats and human participants. Long-acting contraception is achieved by formulating microneedles with a biodegradable polymer [poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid] that slowly releases levonorgestrel for ~1 month in vitro. In rats, the patch maintained levonorgestrel concentration above the human contraceptive threshold level for &gt;1 month, and a placebo microneedle patch was well-tolerated in human participants. Women of reproductive age in three continents demonstrated interest in and preference for long-acting contraception by microneedle patch. These studies indicate that an effervescent microneedle patch could facilitate greater access to long-acting contraception.</p>

<p>Here, we developed a MN patch using biodegradable MNs for slow release of LNG that enables rapid separation in skin by including an effervescent formulation in the patch backing ( Fig. 1 ), which builds on our prior work in this area ( 32 ). Upon contacting interstitial fluid (ISF) in the skin, sodium bicarbonate and citric acid in the MN patch backing react to form carbon dioxide bubbles that weaken MN attachment to the patch and enable separation within 1 min of skin insertion. This is faster than what other MN designs have achieved without involving a mechanical separation mechanism. The MN patch design also involves casting nonaqueous solutions onto MN molds by a method that achieves high drug loading and retains MN shape during patch drying. In this study, we first developed the effervescent MN patch and characterized its mechanical, rapid detachment, and controlled release properties in vitro, then determined the pharmacokinetics of long-acting LNG delivery in rats, demonstrated rapid MN separation from effervescent patch backing in human participants, and lastly assessed the acceptability of long-acting contraception by MN patch among women in India, Nigeria, and the United States. In this way, this translational study goes from patch design and fabrication through animal studies and ends with two studies in human participants.</p>
<p>Using MN patches for slow drug release has two important challenges. First, the MNs must be designed to use a non–water-soluble formulation that slowly releases the drug and contains sufficient drug to last the targeted time period. Second, to enable a short MN patch wear time (i.e., to avoid the need to keep the patch on the skin for the duration of drug release), the MNs must be biodegradable and have a mechanism to rapidly separate from the patch backing to remain embedded in the skin. MN patches with these properties have received limited attention in prior literature ( 28 – 32 ).</p>
<p>Our design includes an MN patch as the delivery method. MN patches contain arrays of solid needles measuring hundreds of micrometers in length that encapsulate drugs ( 16 , 17 ). By manually pressing the patch to the skin, the MNs painlessly penetrate into the skin’s upper layers, where they release the encapsulated drug. Most work with MN patches involves water-soluble formulations that quickly release drug and thereby enable a short patch wear time (e.g., minutes) and fabrication using aqueous casting or dipping methods. This type of MN patch has received extensive attention in the literature ( 18 – 21 ) and has been successfully used in a number of clinical trials ( 22 , 23 ). MN patches have also been shown to be easy to administer, including via self-administration ( 22 , 24 ); to generate no biohazardous sharps waste, because MNs dissolve in the skin ( 25 ); to find high acceptability in human studies ( 22 , 26 , 27 ); and to enable low-cost manufacturing ( 18 ).</p>
<p>To address these limitations, we developed a long-acting contraceptive administered by a microneedle (MN) patch containing an effervescent backing to facilitate rapid separation of the MNs from the patch. We chose levonorgestrel (LNG) as the contraceptive hormone because of its long history as a safe and effective contraceptive ( 14 ), and we chose poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) as the biodegradable MN polymer, mediating slow drug release, because of its extensive use in pharmaceutical and medical products with an excellent safety profile ( 15 ).</p>
<p>Expanding contraceptive options with new methods that better meet the needs of women throughout their reproductive life spans is critical to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. Important characteristics of a contraceptive include (i) high safety and efficacy with minimal side effects; (ii) simple administration, enabling self-administration; (iii) long-acting (≥1 month) to increase user compliance by requiring infrequent dosing; (iv) generation of no biohazardous sharps waste to avoid needle-stick injury; (v) cost-effectiveness; and (vi) high acceptability among women of reproductive age ( 6 ). Nonhormonal contraceptive methods such as condoms and diaphragms do not provide long-lasting protection and have limited effectiveness due to poor user acceptance and adherence with correct use ( 7 , 8 ). Oral contraceptive pills are easy to use but are also not long acting, and their efficacy suffers because of poor compliance ( 9 ). Injectable long-acting hormonal contraceptives have reduced acceptability due to their invasive nature and can have poor compliance due to the need for administration by health care professionals, who are in limited supply in developing countries or regions ( 10 , 11 ). Implantable long-acting hormonal contraceptives, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subcutaneous implants, can last for years but are even more invasive and require administration by health care professionals with even greater training compared to other methods ( 12 , 13 ).</p>
<p>Contraceptive methods empower women and couples to make decisions about the timing and spacing of pregnancies. Family planning, in turn, provides important health, social, and economic benefits for individuals, families, and nations ( 1 ). With the global population exceeding 7.5 billion people ( 2 ), universal access to effective contraception is critical for both personal and societal needs. Although many family planning methods exist, 85 million pregnancies worldwide were unintended in 2012, which represents 40% of all pregnancies ( 3 , 4 ). In the United States, where 45% of pregnancies were unplanned in 2011 ( 3 , 4 ), total public expenditures on unintended pregnancies nationwide were estimated to be $21 billion in 2010 ( 5 ).</p>
<p>Women in most interviews liked the idea of self-administration, although many wanted to first receive it from a provider to learn to apply it correctly. Interest in the patch grew with the duration of protection against pregnancy, where 3- or 6-month patches were much preferred, but a 1-month patch was still of interest to some women. Many women and providers were initially concerned about possible pain caused by MNs, but further discussion indicated that a feeling akin to an insect bite or injection would generally be acceptable. There was discussion but ultimately less concern about issues regarding the location of patch application, patch size, and possible erythema, although there was a general preference to hide skin “rashes” to conceal contraceptive use and an interest to better understand possible side effects of the contraceptive. We recently published an expanded analysis of this study that further supports these conclusions ( 37 ).</p>
<p>To further understand the acceptability of long-acting contraception by an MN patch, we conducted a qualitative study involving 16 focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews with women of reproductive age, as well as 20 in-depth interviews with public and private sector providers in India and Nigeria. Participants were provided a brief description of an MN patch, a prototype MN patch, and a magnified image of MNs to inform their opinions. Overall, we found that women and providers were receptive to the idea of a long-acting contraceptive MN patch and perceived it as very easy to use. Relative to other contraceptive methods, perceived advantages of the MN patch included no need to take daily pills, avoidance of invasive placement of implants (Nigeria) and IUDs (India), and discreet use due to short patch wear time.</p>
<p>Last, in response to a standard set of questions, 100% of participants said they would prefer contraceptive administration by a monthly MN patch compared to monthly hypodermic injection ( Fig. 6F ), and 90% of participants said they would prefer a monthly MN patch compared to oral administration of daily pills ( Fig. 6G ). Sixty percent of participants preferred self-administration to physician administration (fig. S4). This indicates that long-acting contraception by an MN patch was well accepted and overwhelmingly preferred over daily pills or a monthly injection in the small population of reproductive-age women studied.</p>
<p>Immediately after MN patch application, faint erythema was seen at the site of patch administration, which largely disappeared within 1 hour and almost completely disappeared after 24 hours ( Fig. 6, B and E ). During MN patch administration, all 10 participants reported either no pain or slight pain that was much less than that caused by a conventional hypodermic injection (fig. S3). No participants reported pain 1 hour or 24 hours after MN patch application. There was no tenderness, swelling, or other notable effect seen at the patch application site at any time (table S2). These findings are consistent with previous observations for MN patches without effervescent formulation ( 22 , 36 ), indicating that the effervescent MN patches were well tolerated.</p>

<p>Consistent with findings in pig and rat skin, MNs were able to efficiently penetrate skin and separate from the patch backing ( Fig. 6 ). Microscopic examination of MNs before and after application to skin shows good separation of the MNs from the patch, similar to that seen in vitro and in rats ( Fig. 6A ). Skin staining shows a 10 × 10 array of micropores created in the skin by penetration of the MNs ( Fig. 6C ), and quantitative analysis of the remaining patches indicated that 98% of MNs penetrated the skin and 92% of MNs separated from the patch within a wear time of &lt;1 min ( Fig. 6D ). For comparison, MN patches of similar design, but without effervescent formulation, were left in skin for up to 20 min to enable complete MN separation in prior studies in human participants ( 36 ).</p>
<p>We next determined whether effervescent MN patches could be applied painlessly and then separate rapidly in skin of women of reproductive age. We also studied skin tolerability and acceptability of MN patch administration. To study these effects, placebo MN patches were pressed against the dorsal skin of participants’ hands and then left on the skin for 50 s. These MN patches used the same effervescent patch backing formulation used throughout this study, but the MNs did not contain LNG and were made of water-soluble excipients (i.e., PVA and sucrose) rather than PLGA to avoid the complexity of leaving PLGA MNs in the skin of human participants, which was beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>Examination of the rats during this study showed that the effervescent MN patches were well tolerated, with no erythema, edema, or other signs of irritation during the 60-day study ( Fig. 5C and fig. S2). Histological analysis of the rat skin treated with MN patches with effervescent backing did not show evidence of changes in skin architecture, inflammatory cells, or other signs of tissue damage (fig. S2). Overall, these results demonstrate the following key functions of the effervescent MN patch in vivo: rapid, efficient separation of MNs in skin; sustained release of LNG, maintaining target plasma concentration of LNG for &gt;1 month; and good tolerability of the drug-releasing MNs in the skin.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data allowed calculation of the LNG absorption kinetics from the MNs in vivo, which can be compared to the measured LNG release kinetics from MNs in vitro. The estimated absorption curve in vivo shows essentially no burst release and exhibits roughly first-order release kinetics ( Fig. 5E ). This is in reasonable agreement with the in vitro release profile when ethanol was included in the release medium ( Fig. 4F ).</p>
<p>To assess LNG pharmacokinetics from MN patches, rats were each administered an LNG-loaded effervescent MN patch, which was applied to the skin for &lt;1 min. LNG concentrations in rat plasma reached a peak concentration (C max ) of 0.83 ± 0.03 ng/ml (mean ± SD) at a time (T max ) of 98 ± 84 hours after MN patch application ( Fig. 5D ). Thereafter, the LNG plasma concentration gradually decreased, keeping above the human therapeutic threshold level of 0.2 ng/ml ( 35 ) for &gt;30 days, and lastly dropped to essentially zero concentration after 60 days ( Fig. 5D ). The area the under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for LNG delivery from effervescent MN patches was 482 ± 79 ng·hour/ml (table S1).</p>

<p>To study effervescent MN patches in vivo, MN patches (containing Nile red dye) were manually pressed against the skin of shaved rats and then left in place for 50 s. As seen ex vivo, the fluorescent MNs were efficiently separated from the patch after application to skin with a detachment efficiency of 91.7 ± 2.4% ( Fig. 5A ); histological sections showed MNs embedded under the skin surface in rats ( Fig. 5B ).</p>
<p>Effervescent MN patches were further tested for the release kinetics of LNG using release media of PBS containing Tween 80 surfactant (PBST) and 0 to 25% ethanol. Ethanol was added to the release media to better simulate in vivo release kinetics ( 34 ). LNG release into PBST exhibited essentially no burst release and released LNG at a rate of ~1.4% per day over the course of at least 60 days ( Fig. 4F ). Inclusion of ethanol in the release medium [to simulate faster release kinetics often seen in vivo ( 34 )] proportionally increased burst release up to 25.7 ± 1.5% after the first day in 25% ethanol, but the presence of ethanol did not significantly affect release rate after that (two-tailed Student’s t test, P = 0.83), such that LNG release persisted in all release media for &gt;1 month, which is the target delivery time frame in this study.</p>

<p>To determine whether effervescent MN patches enable rapid MN separation in the skin (as opposed to PBS in the previous section), patches were applied to porcine skin ex vivo. MNs loaded with Nile red dye were pressed firmly against the skin and then kept in place for 50 s to enable separation of MNs in the skin due to effervescence ( Fig. 4, A and B ). After patch removal from the skin, there was almost no fluorescent dye left in the residual patch, indicating efficient MN separation ( Fig. 4C ). Histological sections indicate that the separated MNs were embedded under the skin surface ( Fig. 4D ). On average, 96 ± 4% of MNs separated from the effervescent patches and 90 ± 4% of encapsulated fluorescent dye (simulating encapsulated hormone) was delivered into the skin ( Fig. 4E ). In contrast, MN patches with noneffervescent PVP backing or PVA/sucrose backing had &lt;45% MN detachment efficiency and &lt;35% dye delivery efficiency after a 50-s application time on the skin ( Fig. 4E ). Together, these results demonstrate rapid and efficient MN separation and high delivery efficiency into skin using the effervescent patch ex vivo.</p>

Each point represents mean ± SD (n = 3), **P &lt; 0.01.</p>
<p>To investigate whether effervescent patches can achieve rapid MN detachment, patches were immersed into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), which was used to mimic contact with the skin’s ISF ( Fig. 3A ). MNs were loaded with a fluorescent dye, Nile red, for better visualization ( Fig. 3B ). Upon placing the patch in PBS, the patch backing immediately generated a large field of gas bubbles due to the reaction between citric acid and sodium bicarbonate, and the MNs were rapidly separated from the patch ( Fig. 3, C and D ). It only took 10.7 ± 1.2 s (mean ± SD) to separate MNs from the effervescent backing ( Fig. 3E and movie S1), compared to 53.3 ± 3.1 s for a PVP patch backing without effervescence or 94.0 ± 6.6 s for a patch with backing made of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sucrose, which is a commonly used noneffervescent MN patch formulation ( Fig. 3E , fig. S1, and movie S2). This demonstrates the rapid detachment of MNs from a patch enabled by an effervescent backing in vitro.</p>
<p>The fabricated patch consists of a 10 × 10 array of sharp MNs over an area of ~0.5 cm 2 , mounted on a slightly larger, rigid tape, containing 0.28 ± 0.04 mg of LNG per patch. Each MN is conical with a base radius of 150 μm, a height of 600 μm, and a tip radius of ~10 μm ( Figs. 1 and 2, A and B ). Measurement of mechanical strength of the effervescent PLGA/LNG patch using a force gauge showed a failure force of 0.07 N per needle ( Fig. 2C ), which indicates that the effervescent MN patch should have sufficient strength to penetrate the skin without breaking ( 33 ).</p>
<p>Next, an effervescent backing solution in ethanol was cast on the mold surface. The backing solution was formulated to facilitate rapid separation of the MNs from the patch backing by containing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which is very water soluble, as well as citric acid and sodium bicarbonate ( Fig. 1 ) to produce effervescence. Upon insertion into skin, the skin’s ISF penetrates the patch and begins to solubilize the patch backing. Once in contact with ISF, the sodium bicarbonate and citric acid react and form CO 2 bubbles and water [C 6 H 8 O 7 (aq) + 3NaHCO 3 (aq) → Na 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 (aq) + 3H 2 O(l) + 3CO 2 (g)]. The effervescent CO 2 bubbles serve to mechanically weaken the interface between the MNs and the patch backing, and the water facilitates further dissolution of the patch backing at this interface. In this way, the effervescence initiated by MN patch application to skin enables rapid separation of the MNs from the patch backing. The patch can then be removed from the skin after a short application time, after which the PLGA MNs remain embedded under the skin surface for long-acting drug release.</p>

<p>The MN patch was fabricated by casting a PLGA solution in diglyme/water (95%/5%, v/v) with suspended LNG crystals with an average diameter of 17.1 ± 7.6 μm ( Fig. 2, D and E ) onto a silicone MN mold. Polymer and LNG formulations were filled into mold cavities by centrifugation to form the MNs and enhance MN strength by minimizing void formation. Because we found that organic solvents can enter into the silicone molds and swell them, which can distort MN shape, we used diglyme, which minimally swelled the mold (i.e., pure diglyme swelled the mold by 25.7 ± 1.1%, n = 3 replicate measurements), as the solvent. The addition of a small amount of water swelled the mold even less [diglyme/water (95%/5%, v/v) swelled the mold by 15.8 ± 0.3%, n = 3]. The MN patches were then dried to remove residual solvent. In addition to minimizing mold swelling, this casting formulation was able to produce and encapsulate fine LNG particles at 40% loading in PLGA MNs for slow release of LNG over time as the PLGA biodegrades.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study is that it was conducted in a relatively small number of animals, which emphasized pharmacokinetic analysis, and in small cohorts of human participants, which addressed the use of effervescent MN patches on human skin and stated preference for contraceptive delivery by MN patches. Future studies should increase the LNG dose to enable contraception in humans for 1-month or possibly 6-month use, further develop MN formulations to achieve an optimal LNG release profile, improve MN patch design based on a more complete understanding of needs and preferences of women in target populations, and translate the work to clinical trials to evaluate safety and efficacy in large populations.</p>
<p>In this study, the effervescent MN patch delivered LNG, which is a well-established contraceptive hormone, with an extensive record of safety and efficacy. A prior study examined LNG delivery by MN patch, but it was for bolus delivery in the context of emergency contraception ( 44 ). The effervescent MN patch was designed for self-administration by women without special training. Previous studies have shown that human participants are able to reliably self-administer MN patches ( 26 ), and the fact that the effervescent MN patch application time is so short should increase patient compliance with correct use. Because the MNs separate from the patch backing, the patch does not generate biohazardous sharps waste after use, which should increase safety and reduce disposal costs. The high patch loading with 40% LNG can facilitate minimizing patch size containing the required drug dose. Last, the straightforward fabrication method—sequentially cast two solutions onto a mold, allow them to dry, and place the resulting product in packaging—should lend itself to low-cost, mass manufacturing that can meet health care cost constraints in developing countries.</p>
<p>In addition to studies in vitro and in rats, this study examined the acceptability of MN patches for long-acting contraception in the United States, India, and Nigeria. When experiencing placebo effervescent MN patches, a small population of women in the United States reported slight or no pain associated with patch application, faint erythema that generally resolved within hours, and a very strong preference for long-acting contraception administered by a monthly MN patch compared to monthly injections or daily pills. Findings from the qualitative study in India and Nigeria also indicated high reported acceptability of the MN patch for contraceptive delivery. Its simple administration and opportunities for self-application were compelling to women, as was the possibility of discreet use. While low levels of pain at the application site may be acceptable, there was concern with the perception that MN patches might hurt (although these study participants never experienced application of MN patches and only saw pictures and prototypes). Acceptability studies like these can guide continued MN patch development, e.g., by helping to optimize trade-offs between patch size, location, and erythema, in support of discreet use or addressing the importance of possible local cosmetic skin effects in ensuring acceptability and uptake of a future product.</p>
<p>The use of the ISF to initiate effervescence and MN detachment within 1 min provides a trigger that is inherently associated with skin penetration and requires no special intervention by the user. Without effervescence, a water-soluble patch backing formulation can also dissolve in ISF, but such dissolution can be slow, requiring patch application times, for example, of 20 min ( 22 , 39 ) or 6 hours ( 39 ), as shown in recent clinical trials using dissolvable MNs. Coated MNs, which can sometimes dissolve faster but have other disadvantages like generating sharps waste, also required 2 min ( 40 ) or 30 min ( 23 ) to release drugs ( 23 ). A few other studies have developed methods for rapid MN separation, but those designs require complicated experimental setup and operating procedures (e.g., high-voltage supply and micrometer-scale alignment) ( 41 , 42 ), metal-polymer hybrid systems ( 17 , 43 ), and/or physical intervention required by the user (e.g., application of shear force) ( 32 ). The effervescent MN patch developed here is expected to enable low-cost manufacturing and simple, reliable use.</p>
<p>This study developed an effervescent MN patch that can provide women with better access to contraception. A novel feature of the patch design is that it incorporates an effervescent backing that causes rapid separation of MNs from the patch, enabling separation within 1 min, while providing contraception for &gt;1 month. Upon penetrating the skin and contact with ISF, the effervescent reaction of sodium bicarbonate and citric acid in the patch backing immediately produces CO 2 gas bubbles that mechanically weaken the attachment of MNs to the patch and generates water that facilitates dissolution of the MN-patch interface. These effects lead to rapid MN detachment. The detached MNs remain embedded under the skin surface, where they slowly biodegrade and release LNG for long-acting contraception. Effervescence is classically used in oral drug formulation, for example, for taste masking or for improved patient acceptability and/or marketing ( 38 ), but we believe that this is the first use of effervescence associated with MNs.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed an MN patch with a backing that effervesces upon application to skin and contact with the skin’s ISF. This enables the MNs to separate from the patch within 1 min and remain embedded under the skin surface after patch removal. The MNs were made of a biodegradable polymer that released LNG for &gt;1 month in vitro and in vivo in rats, thereby demonstrating potential to serve as a long-acting contraceptive. The effervescent MN patch was well tolerated in the skin of rats and human participants, leaving little visible sign of use. An acceptability study among women of reproductive age in the United States showed overwhelming reported preference for long-acting contraception by MN patch compared with daily pills or monthly injections. Health care providers and women of reproductive age in India and Nigeria also reported interest in MN patches for long-acting contraception, where ease of use, discreetness, and duration of action were identified as important attributes. We conclude that effervescent MN patches can achieve month-long delivery of contraceptive hormone that is simple to administer, minimally invasive, and strongly preferred and can offer women improved access to long-acting contraception.</p>
<p>MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>
<p>Fabrication of effervescent MN patches Effervescent MN patches were fabricated using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) molds. Each MN was conical with a base radius of 150 μm, a height of 600 μm, and a tip radius of ~10 μm. The MNs were arranged in a 10 × 10 array in an area of 7 mm by 7 mm with a center-to-center spacing of 600 μm. To elevate the MNs, the patch backing contained an array of pedestals (base diameter, 600 μm; top diameter, 300 μm; and height, 350 μm) positioned at the base of each MN. To fabricate MN patches, two solutions were cast sequentially onto the mold. The first casting solution contained 10% (w/w) solids, PLGA/LNG (60/40%, w/w) in diglyme/water (95%/5%, w/w). To prepare the first casting solution, 0.6 g of PLGA (50/50 lactide/glycolide molar ratio; inherent viscosity, 0.59 dl/g; Durect, Birmingham, AL) and 0.4 g of LNG (Chemo Industriale Chimica S.R.L, Saronno, Italy) were dissolved in a mixture of 7 g of diglyme (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 2.5 g of tetrahydrofuran (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and then LNG was crystalized and precipitated by slow evaporation of the tetrahydrofuran. Last, additional diglyme and deionized (DI) water were added to obtain the final casting solution. To fabricate MN patches containing Nile red (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 mg of Nile red powder was added into the casting solution and mixed to homogeneity. Seven microliters of casting solution were applied to the top of the MN mold and then centrifuged at 3200g for 20 min to fill the mold. After waiting for 5 min, 20 μl of diglyme/water (95%/5%, w/w) was pipetted on the top of the mold, followed by centrifugation at 3200g for 20 min to wash residual casting solution on the top of the mold into the mold cavities. After that, the mold was placed in a 60°C oven with vacuum for 12 hours for drying. Next, a second casting solution was prepared, consisting of 13% (w/v) PVP with two molecular weights (360/55 kDa, 50/50%, w/w; Sigma-Aldrich), and 4% (w/v) citric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) in pure ethanol (Koptec, King of Prussia, PA), with 5% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) suspended in the solution. Then, 80 μl of the second casting solution was gently applied to the dried PDMS mold surface to form the effervescent patch backing. For the control groups with noneffervescent backing, the second casting solution contained 13% (w/v) PVA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 13% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich) in DI water or 13% (w/v) PVP (360/55 kDa, 50/50%, w/w) in DI water. After drying in the chemical hood for 1 hour for the effervescent backing or 3 hours for the PVA/sucrose or PVP backing, the mold with effervescent backing or noneffervescent backing was placed in a desiccator overnight or for 2 days, respectively, at room temperature (20° to 25°C) for complete drying, after which a layer of adhesive paper was gently attached onto the top surface of the PDMS mold and used to carefully peel the patch from the mold, which was then stored in a desiccator until use. To make MN patches for use in human participants, the first cast solution comprised 13% (w/v) PVA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 13% (w/v) sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich) in DI water. The second cast solution was the effervescent patch backing formulation containing PVP, citric acid, and sodium bicarbonate, as described above. The solutions were sterilized by passing through a sterile 0.2-μm filter (PES, VWR International, Radnor, PA). Molds were sterilized by autoclaving. Fabrication was carried out in a biological safety cabinet (Forma Class II, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and sample MN patches were tested to assure adherence to a low-bioburden specification.</p>
<p>Swelling of PDMS mold Films of the PDMS used to make MN casting molds were cast at a thickness of 2 to 3 mm on a glass dish and cured at 37°C for 2 days and then at 60°C for 4 hours under vacuum. Circular discs with a radius of 1.25 cm were then punched from the silicone film. A minimum of three discs were used for each solvent test. The discs were individually weighed, placed in a vial, and covered with 50 ml of the solvent to be tested. The container was sealed and the discs were allowed to soak for 2 hours. After soaking, each disc was removed from the solvent, lightly blotted onto absorbant paper (Kimwipes, Kimberly Clark, Irving, TX), and then quickly weighed to minimize evaporation of solvent. The percent swelling was determined as the difference between the weight of the disc before and after soaking, and dividing by the initial disc weight.</p>
<p>Effervescent MN patch mechanical properties Mechanical properties of MN patches with effervescent backing were measured using a displacement force test station (Force Gauge, Mark-10, Copiague, NY). Briefly, a single patch was attached to a rigid stainless steel platform positioned vertically (MNs facing up). Then, the test station sensor probe moved toward the MNs in the vertical direction at a speed of 0.1 mm/s. The distance between the sensor and MN tips was initially 1 cm. Force and displacement measurements began when the sensor first touched the MN tips and continued until the sensor traveled 0.4 mm from the MN tips toward the patch backing.</p>
<p>Detachment test of effervescent MN patches To study the kinetics of MN detachment from patches with effervescent backing or noneffervescent backing (PVP or PVA/sucrose), a single patch facing up was attached to a holder and then immersed in PBS. A camera (MU300, AmScope, Irvine, CA) was used to image the MN detachment process until all MNs detached from the patch.</p>
<p>Skin insertion of effervescent MN patches ex vivo Separation, retention, and delivery efficiency of effervescent MN patches were evaluated by inserting MN patches loaded with fluorescent dye (Nile red) into stretched porcine skin ex vivo by pressing with thumb against the skin and then leaving the patches on the skin for 50 s to give time for dissolution of the effervescent backing and separation of MNs. The skin was then examined by optical microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) to identify detached MNs embedded in the skin. To remove any detached MNs that were partially protruding above the skin surface, a swab was gently and repeatedly scraped across the site of MN patch treatment for 10 s in some cases. Separation and retention efficiency were calculated by dividing the number of colored spots due to the presence of fluorescent MNs in the skin by the number of MNs in the patch (i.e., 100 MNs). Delivery efficiency of the MN patch was evaluated by using quantitative fluorescence analysis (Microplate Reader, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) to measure fluorescence intensity from the dye in the MN patch before and after skin insertion and fluorescence from the dye on the skin surface. The amounts of dye in the residual backing and on the skin surface were subtracted from that in the MN patch before insertion to determine the amount of dye delivered into the skin. To calculate delivery efficiency, the delivered dye in the skin was divided by the amount of dye in the MN patch before insertion. Last, skin was frozen and then cut into 10-μm sections for histological analysis.</p>
<p>LNG release from effervescent MN patches in vitro In vitro release of LNG from effervescent MN patches was measured by placing an MN patch into 1 liter of PBST with varying concentrations of ethanol as the release media in a glass vessel incubated in a shaker water bath at 37°C and shaken at 80 rpm. PBST solution contained 137 mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 10.14 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.76 mM KH 2 PO 4 , and 0.02% (w/v) Tween 80. Ethanol was added to PBST to final concentrations of 0, 15, 20, or 25% (v/v) ethanol. One milliliter of release medium was collected at predetermined time points (0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, and 60 days) and replaced with the same amount of fresh medium. Sample analysis by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)–mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) was used to quantify LNG concentration. LNG was separated on an Acquity UPLC Ethylene-Bridged Hybrids (BEH) C 18 column (100 mm by 2.1 mm; inner diameter, 1.7-μm particle size) at 50°C. A mixture of acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid and water containing 0.1% formic acid (8:2 ratio, v/v) comprised the mobile phase. The injection volume was 10 μl, with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. LNG detection was performed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode. Quantification was based on the target analyte of LNG [M + H+; m/z (mass/charge ratio) = 313.4].</p>
<p>LNG pharmacokinetics after release from effervescent MN patches in vivo LNG-loaded effervescent MN patches were applied to adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (~200 g) while under isoflurane anesthesia. The rats’ dorsal skin was shaved before application of one MN patch per rat, taking care not to damage skin during shaving. Animal studies were performed with approval by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and IACUC guidelines were followed in all studies with animal subjects. To investigate detachment of PLGA/LNG MNs in rats, effervescent MN patches containing Nile red were administered to the rats using the methods described above for ex vivo MN patch application to porcine skin. The administration sites on the skin were imaged by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). To study pharmacokinetics of LNG release from MNs in skin, a group of 10 rats received LNG-loaded effervescent MN patches. A power analysis indicated that a sample size of 10 rats per group would be sufficient to distinguish pharmacokinetic profiles in animals receiving LNG from those without application of patches with 95% confidence. The primary endpoint of the animal study was LNG plasma concentration above the human therapeutic threshold level (0.2 ng/ml in plasma) for 1 month. The secondary endpoint was irritation at the site of MN patch administration. All data collected in this study were retained; no outliers were excluded. Blood samples (~500 μl) were drawn from the tail vein 0, 12, and 24 hours and 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 24, 28, 31, 35, 38, 42, 45, 49, 52, 55, and 60 days after MN patch application. Plasma was separated by centrifuging blood samples at 2000g for 15 min at 4°C, and LNG concentration in the plasma was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Biocompatibility of LNG delivery from effervescent MN patches was evaluated by euthanizing rats by CO 2 asphyxiation at the end of the study (i.e., 60 days after MN patch application) and excising tissue surrounding the patch application site. This tissue was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 2 days at 4°C and then embedded in paraffin after complete dehydration, cut into sections of 5-μm thickness, and stained using hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis.</p>
<p>Pharmacokinetic analysis Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis (45) with Phoenix WinNonlin v. 8 (Certara, Princeton, NJ). The following parameters were calculated: C max , the observed maximum plasma concentration; T max , the time when C max was achieved; K e , the terminal rate constant of LNG, estimated by log-linear regression of the terminal phase of the concentration-time profile after patch administration; AUC 0–t , the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of last quantifiable concentration (C last ) using the linear trapezoidal rule; and AUC 0–∞ , the area under the curve from time zero to infinity, calculated as AUC 0–t + C last /K e . The percentage of LNG absorbed in vivo as a function of time was calculated by numerical deconvolution of the patch LNG plasma concentration versus time profiles within Phoenix WinNonlin. Reference intravenous pharmacokinetic data for the calculation of absolute bioavailability (F) and percentage of LNG absorbed as a function of time were obtained from the literature (46).</p>
<p>Application of MN patches with effervescent backing to human participants To be eligible to participate in this study, participants had to be healthy nonpregnant female adults with normal skin, no known problems with pain perception, and no known allergies to the materials used in this study. Ten participants (21 to 36 years old) were recruited from students, faculty, and staff at the Georgia Institute of Technology. This study was approved by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board (IRB), informed consent was obtained from all participants, and IRB guidelines were followed in all studies with human participants. Participants received MN patches on the dorsal surface of their hands. Each participant received one patch on their left hand, and three participants received an additional patch on their right hand. The patches were pressed to the skin for 3 s and then left in place on the skin for 50 s. Skin of the left hands was imaged by a camera (EOS 60D, Canon, Japan) using the same setup (e.g., same light condition, same exposure time) 0, 1, and 24 hours after patch application. For those who received two MN patches, the application site on their right hands was stained with Gentian violet solution (Humco, Linden, TX) and then imaged 5 min after staining. All participants were asked a standard set of questions to solicit information about possible pain of the MN patch administration and the acceptability of MN patches for delivery of contraceptives. Pain was scored from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain of a hypodermic injection).</p>
<p>MN patch acceptability among women in India and Nigeria A qualitative study in New Delhi, India and Ibadan, Nigeria gathered initial data on the hypothetical acceptability of a contraceptive MN patch. A total of 16 focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were conducted in 2017–2018 with women of reproductive age across the two countries, as well as 20 in-depth interviews with public and private sector health care providers. Women who had previously used modern contraception and women who had not were interviewed; in India, all women were married, whereas in Nigeria, the sample included married and unmarried women. Participants were provided with a short description of the patch and shown a patch prototype (that did not contain MNs or LNG) and a close-up picture of the MN seen under a microscope. The target product profile was not fully specified; rather, interviews examined initial acceptability of the patch and attitudes toward several patch attributes, including pain at application, location of application, patch size, wear time, duration of protection, and skin reaction (erythema) at application, and several possible levels for each of these attributes. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and translated into English, and analyzed using coding and analytic memos. This study was approved by the Sigma IRB in India, the Oyo State Research Ethical Review Committee in Nigeria, and FHI 360’s Protection of Human Subjects Committee in the United States, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.

<p>Man jailed for having a craft knife at a food bank A man was jailed for 148 days after being caught with a craft knife at a food bank. Mark Rose, of Ilkeston Road, Nottingham, visited Grace Church Nottingham at the Ministry in Castle Boulevard with a friend at 11am on October 28. Officers said he was waiting outside when he was approached by a member of security staff, who said she had been told he was carrying a knife. He denied having a weapon on him but, when searched, had the craft knife in his jacket pocket. The 39-year-old was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article. He admitted the offence and was sentenced at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday, December 20. PC Charles Willett, who led the investigation, said: &ldquo;While Rose did not take the knife out of his pocket, it is still an offence to carry a knife in public. &ldquo;This case should act as a warning to anyone thinking of carrying weapons that we will seek to put them before the court if we catch them in possession of weapons, regardless of whether they are used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life with a minimum of 10 years for man who tried to kill his wife in their bed A pizza delivery man was handed a life sentence for stabbing his wife and leaving her with 25 wounds. Habibullah Faizi went downstairs to collect two knives for the attack as she lay in bed at their home in Newquay Avenue, Bobbers Mill. At his trial in Nottingham Crown Court, a jury heard that his victim&rsquo;s life was only saved by the intervention of neighbours and emergency medical care on January 2. Faizi, 40, denied attempted murder but was found guilty. The case had been adjourned after the conflicting views of two psychiatrists. Judge John Burgess imposed a life term with a minimum period of custody of 10 years. But the Parole Board will have to be satisfied that Faizi is safe to be freed and he could remain in prison indefinitely. The judge believed Faizi was suffering from a mental disorder at the time but that his attack left his wife with &ldquo;serious long-term physical and psychological harm.&rdquo; The judge said: &ldquo;The paramedics counted 25 wounds before they had to stop counting. She had a fractured skull, punctured lung and perforated bowel. &ldquo;You attacked with such force that one of the knives broke, leaving fragments embedded in the scalp. To fracture the skull and break the knife would have required severe force.&rdquo; Faizi told the court he has no memory of stabbing his wife. Rachel Darby, defending, said that the attack was &ldquo;spontaneous&rdquo; and that he was ill at the time with some &ldquo;psychotic symptoms.&rdquo; But she said this did not add up to a defence to the charge. He had never been in trouble before. Miss Darby said: &ldquo;There was no physical violence towards his wife or any other persons.&rdquo; The judge ordered him never to contact her again.</p>
<p>Jailed for life A teenager was jailed for life for the gang murder of former Arnold schoolboy Jaden Moodie. Jaden - who had studied at Redhill Academy - became the year&rsquo;s youngest gang victim when he was knocked off a scooter and stabbed nine times in Leyton, east London, on January 8. The killing was caught on graphic CCTV footage, which was shown in the Old Bailey trial of Ayoub Majdouline, 19. The teenage drug dealer was one of five Mali Boy gang members who had set out in a stolen Mercedes into rival Beaumont Crew territory. Majdouline, who had been identified as a &ldquo;modern slavery&rdquo; victim, had admitted drug dealing for the Mali Boys but denied being involved in 14-year-old Jaden&rsquo;s murder. But jurors heard his DNA was found on a bloody yellow rubber glove and knife discarded after the killing. At the Old Bailey, he was found guilty of Jaden&rsquo;s murder and having a blade. Judge Richard Marks QC sentenced him to life in prison with a minimum term of 21 years plus 18 months to run concurrently. Judge Marks said Jaden had been associated with the rival Beaumont Crew gang, but &ldquo;he did not deserve to die&rdquo;.</p>
<p>More than 15 years in prison A 41-year-old man who attacked a woman with a dumbbell, stick and metal pole was jailed for 15 years and six months. Mounaim Elfidh, of Gilbert Road, in Bircotes was sentenced on Tuesday, December 17, after being found guilty by a jury at Nottingham Crown Court of three counts of section 18 wounding, unlawful imprisonment and production of cannabis. The incident happened on May 9 this year where Elfidh assaulted a woman with a stick, causing serious injuries to her head and legs. The attack continued which led to the weapon snapping in half due to the force of the attack. A dumbbell was also thrown at the woman&rsquo;s shoulder, and he further assaulted her with a metal pole. The woman was also punched. The victim tried to escape the property, but Elfidh locked the doors so she couldn&rsquo;t leave. Later that afternoon, she managed to leave and contacted the police. He was arrested the next day. The victim attended hospital and was treated for a head injury. She also had visible bruising across a large area of her body.</p>
<p>Brexiteer Amy Dalla Mura jailed for harassing Anna Soubry Left, Amy Dalla Mura and right, former MP Anna Soubry A Brexiteer who repeatedly harrassed former MP Anna Soubry was jailed for 28 days. Amy Dalla Mura, 56, was also banned from the Broxtowe constituency in the run up to the general election where she had been standing against Ms Soubry. Dalla Mura appeared in Westminister Magistrates&rsquo; Court on Monday, December 16, where the court heard how she had targeted Ms Soubry between January and March this year, turning up at events and calling her a &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; on live television. Former MP Ms Soubry, a Remainer who lost her Broxtowe seat while standing for the Independent Group for Change, said she was left &ldquo;frightened&rdquo; following the incidents. Dalla Mura, of Eton Villas, Hove, claimed that her behaviour was politically motivated debate and did not accept it was frightening, despite standing in the General Election in the same constituency as Ms Soubry. Dalla Mura, who denied harassment but was found guilty following a trial at Westminster Magistrates&rsquo; Court, is banned from contacting Ms Soubry under a three-year restraining order.</p>
<p>Woman stole perfume from Debenhams A shoplifter blamed an illicit cigarette for landing her back in jail after stealing again following six days of freedom. Lynette Burton&rsquo;s solicitor told a court that it played a part in leaving her homeless and getting back into trouble. Rory Macmillan, mitigating, told Nottingham Magistrates&rsquo; Court: &ldquo;She reported to probation again and to the council three days in a row, trying to get somewhere to live. &ldquo;They would not give her anywhere, because on a previous occasion, they put her in a hotel. She was caught smoking a cigarette against regulations and so she was left with nowhere to live. &ldquo;She has been homeless since being released. &ldquo;She managed to sort out some benefits to come but in the intervening time she shoplifts,&rdquo; added Mr Macmillan. Burton, 36, admitted stealing four Lancome perfumes valued at £297 from Debenhams on Long Row on October 31; and theft of perfumes worth £276 from the same shop on December 13. She was sent to prison for 20 weeks. This will not increase her time inside because she will now have to serve the rest of a one-year term, after being released at the halfway point. District Judge Leo Pyle told her: &ldquo;It is a sad state of affairs that on being released, you embark upon this latest spree.&rdquo; Daniel Pietryka, prosecuting, said that Burton was stopped when leaving the Long Row shop on October 31. The perfumes were seized but she escaped with them earlier this month. She must pay Debenham&rsquo;s compensation of £276. When asked for her address in court, Burton said she had no home, but could be contacted through a property on St Matthias Road, which is in St Ann&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Burglar with &lsquo;horrendous record&rsquo; jailed after stealing TV from student flats A burglar was jailed for four years for taking a £40 TV from student flats. Imran Khan, 43, was filmed walking down the street with the television across his shoulders, a court heard. He claimed to have just bought it from a man who was taking it to a pawn shop - but a jury unanimously found him guilty of burglary. Recorder Ben Gumpert QC said that Khan had so many burglary offences on his record that he was liable to least three years in prison. Sitting at Nottingham Crown Court, he told Khan: &ldquo;You told transparent lies which the jury found to be precisely that. &ldquo;You were aware you were going to receive a sentence of more than three years if you were convicted. &ldquo;In the context of domestic burglary, no violence was used and no threats were used. Nevertheless, the offence is aggravated by your previous convictions.&rdquo; The recorder said that Khan had a &ldquo;horrendous record.&rdquo; Jonathon Dee, prosecuting, said that the television was recovered after being taken from the house on Lenton Boulevard on June 28.</p>
<p>Long Eaton man who attacked his mum three times found hiding in her wardrobe Betts slapped and kicked his own mother previously (Image: Derbyshire Constabulary) A Long Eaton man was found hiding in his mum&rsquo;s wardrobe after breaking a restraining order that was put in place for attacking her three times. Marc Betts, 47, of Northcote Street in Long Eaton, pleaded guilty to breaching his restraining order at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates’ Court. Betts had just come out of prison when he breached the order - which had been put in place until October 24, 2022, according to Derbyshire Live. Lynn Bickley, prosecuting, said: &ldquo;On December 12 at five to four in the afternoon police received a report that the defendant was at the cottages by a neighbour. &ldquo;When officers arrived they are allowed into the address by the mother and the defendant was found hiding in a wardrobe. &ldquo;He was arrested and interviewed by police, and answered no comment.” Nick Wenden, mitigating, said: &ldquo;This is clearly a breach of the restraining order, and his previous convictions list is not pleasant.&rdquo; &ldquo;He bumped into his mother and he had not seen her since. &ldquo;She invited him to the address. He does know he should not have gone. &ldquo;But he was desperate after just having come from prison and he wanted to try and make amends.” District judge Jonathan Taaffe handed Betts a 26-week jail term. He also ordered him to pay a £122 victim surcharge.</p>
<p>Fraudster applied for credit card by stealing couple&rsquo;s details from letterbox Ephraim Chivunga, left, and Tondarai Murungu, right A fraudster who used a rogue credit card to pay for a room at a Nottinghamshire hotel enjoyed his stay so much he posted it on Facebook, a court heard. Asylum seeker Ephraim Chivunga had booked two rooms for four people - but was using a card fraudulently applied for by co-accused Tondarai Murungu, who is also seeking asylum. Abi Joyce, prosecuting, said the pair went around Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire carrying out offences with the credit card and a stolen fuel card. Details to apply for the card, which was used to pay at the hotel, had been stolen from a couple&rsquo;s letterbox. They returned home in 2016 to a letter telling them their Debenhams master card was over the limit of £4,000. &ldquo;They had never taken out a Debenhams master card,&rdquo; explained Miss Joyce. Police gathered CCTV stills of Murungu and a white van loitering at their address. Both defendants admitted handling a stolen fuel card - which had been a replacement card that was never received by the owner. Murungu, 39, of Bathley Street, The Meadows, was jailed for two years for fraud and handling stolen goods. Murungu said there was a third party, who was the main player, putting together the original idea. He got ten percent from the £4,000 spent on the card. Chivunga, 38, of Silverdale Road, Basford, was jailed for a total of 33 months for fraud, handling the stolen fuel card, possessing an article for fraud - fake Marks and Spencer vouchers - and frauds relating to false Boots and WH Smith vouchers.</p>
<p>Dangerous driver reached 140mph on M1 in dramatic police chase A drug dealer was jailed after he reached speeds of up to 140mph along the M1 during a police chase. Mohammed Khan was locked up for seven years for a catalogue of drugs offences and dangerous driving. He was behind the wheel of a BMW when he overtook an officer in a police car as he joined the M1, at junction 29 at Chesterfield, on November 15 this year. Khan was pulled over at junction 30. But as the officer got out to speak with him, Khan sped off - driving back onto the M1 southbound and reaching 140mph at one stage. The 39-year-old slowed to 80mph at junction 29 and entered an area as if he was going to leave the motorway. Alan Murphy, prosecuting at Nottingham Crown Court, said: &ldquo;He darted back onto the motorway, through the hatched area, before commencement of the slip road. &ldquo;He went back up to 130mph at Tibshelf. He narrowly missed a car moving from lane four to three&rdquo;. Police laid a stinger at the next junction which Khan went over before driving through a red light. He tried to drive on but could not because he had flat tyres. He ran off but was soon caught. Ecstasy, cocaine and cannabis, for personal use, were found in a bag near the car. More ecstasy was found at his home address in Hadfield Close, Sheffield. Paperwork was also found linking him to a Nottingham address. Khan also faced sentence for more drugs offences. Police saw a Lexus in Bathley Street, The Meadows, with the driver appearing to be slumped in the seat on May 3, 2018. They stopped the car in Crocus Street and detained Khan. Four boxes of &ldquo;business cards&rdquo; were discovered in the boot, which Mr Murphy told the court were &ldquo;plainly a drug dealer&rsquo;s card&rdquo;. They had a mobile number on them and the words &ldquo;strictly no texts!&rdquo; and &ldquo;around 11am till late&rdquo;, plus the letters &ldquo;AB&rdquo; - indicating the Class of drugs sold and the time sales were available. A search of the car turned up drugs in a void behind the driver&rsquo;s door panel and the door - which could only be opened with a multi-tool. Judge Stuart Rafferty QC gave Khan concurrent sentences of 15 months for dangerous driving, four years each for possessing cocaine and Ecstasy with intent to supply, and no separate penalty for possessing cannabis. For the 2018 offences, he received concurrent sentences of three years each for possessing cocaine and Ecstasy with intent to supply, two years for possessing cannabis with intent to supply and two years for selling cannabis. The three years was consecutive to the four years. He was banned from driving for four-and-a-half years and must take an extended retest.</p>
<p>Fraudster jailed A man who caused &ldquo;serious distress and financial hardship&rdquo; to his employer was jailed after he swindled more than £128,000 from the business. Adam Cartwright, 39, of Hazel Hill Crescent in Bestwood Park, started working for B&amp;M Installations in 2011 as an electrician and it was there he began to buy electrical parts the company did not use. The company, which is based just outside Carrington in Pelham Street, began investigating in October 2018 after a project manager became aware of an invoice containing higher costs than expected for a project they were working on. Upon the discovery, Nottinghamshire Police&rsquo;s fraud team began looking into Cartwright&rsquo;s business dealings and found him to be buying extra electrical parts across 50 separate invoices. The parts came to a total of just over £128,000. Cartwright pleaded guilty to fraud by abuse of position at Nottingham Crown Court on Tuesday, December 19. He was subsequently sentenced to two years and eight months in jail. Detective constable Jason Jenkins, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: &ldquo;Fraud can have a devastating impact on businesses and it was clear from the outset that Cartwright’s actions caused serious distress to the business owners, as well as financial hardship. &ldquo;The sentence clearly demonstrates that we take fraud offences incredibly seriously and will deal with those responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burglar jailed A burglar took goods set aside for charity when he cycled past an unlocked shed. But Michael Smedley was spotted by a neighbour who had helped sort out the DIY goods for the British Heart Foundation, a court heard. Tom Heath, prosecuting, told Nottingham Crown Court: &ldquo;Police arrived and Mr Smedley was still inside the shed. He said the door was open.&rdquo; When Smedley was searched, officers found a can of &ldquo;CS incapacitant spray&rdquo; in one of his pockets. He claimed he thought it was paint, said Mr Heath. The court heard the offence took place on July 22, three months after he had been given a one-year suspended jail sentence. He had 55 crimes on his record. A one-year prison term was ordered for Smedley, 44, of Beacon Drive, Kirkby-in-Ashfield, who admitted shed burglary and having a CS spray. Recorder Justin Widoger told him: &ldquo;You saw the shed was unlocked and decided to help yourself. &ldquo;The items were going to be donated to a charity for the general good. You didn&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo; Digby Johnson, mitigating, described the offence as &ldquo;opportunistic.&rdquo; He said Smedley suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as thrombosis in the legs. He had been due to have an ultra-sound scan at the Queen&rsquo;s Medical Centre. Smedley knew he was at risk of custody but the suspended sentence had been imposed for an affray, a different type of offence, said Mr Johnson.
