<p>Many topical beauty products worldwide contain probiotics, the majority of which use processed fractions or purified components – tyndalized (heat-killed) probiotics, for example. Other formulations incorporate postbiotics which were immobilised or ‘dead’ variants.</p>
<p>So, just how viable were live probiotic strains in topical beauty formulations? And was it worth the investment when stable, processed variants worked well?</p>
<p>Experts from CosmeticDesign’s online Skin Microbiome webinar – held last month and still available to view on-demand​​ – agreed that the idea of formulating with live bacteria was great, but other market options were more realistic.</p>
<p>Live probiotics – ‘maybe more interesting as a marketing concept’​</p>
<p>“I think it’s interesting for the concept; it’s more complicated to include live bacteria in a cosmetic,”​ said Audrey Gueniche, expert claim activator at L’Oréal Research &amp; Innovation.</p>
<p>“Especially because, first, it has to be safe, but it has to also be well-preserved from foreign microorganisms. It’s very complicated to achieve these two things: to be clean without bacteria and to include a live bacteria,”​ Gueniche said during the CosmeticsDesign webinar.</p>
<p>Marie Drago, founder of skin microbiome beauty brand Gallinée, agreed and said her team had considered using live bacteria in the early stages of product development but ended up choosing to work with tyndalized probiotics.</p>
<p>“As Audrey was saying, it’s such an interesting concept [to work with live bacteria], but I think it’s maybe more interesting as a marketing concept. From a practical point of view, I’m not sure it’s worth the pain,”​ Drago said.</p>
<p>Working with live probiotics in skin care formulations immediately meant shorter shelf life, a complete upheaval of existing logistics and risks associated with other bacteria breeding in the product or on the skin, she said. “You don’t want your bacteria to breed in the product, you want it to be stable, then do a little bit and die. So, why not use stabilised bacteria? Those that have been tyndalized and have the same kind of effect.”​</p>
<p>Beauty in the fridge – a probiotic future?​</p>
<p>Some beauty brands were indeed working with live probiotics, Drago said, such as Mother Dirt with its AO+ Mist that had to be stored in the fridge for a longer shelf life, otherwise it lasted just four to six weeks.</p>
<p>Live probiotic cosmetics need to be refrigerated to ensure longer shelf life (Getty Images)</p>
<p>Asked if refrigerated products could be the answer, she said it might be but for the concept to truly take off, retail formats would have to change to offer refrigerated space in skin care sections. “You don’t really want to be sold in another category; you don’t want to be in the fridge with the orange juice”.​</p>
<p>Equally, for direct-to-consumer (D2C) brands, Drago said investing in fresh deliveries and refrigerated supply chains was a lot to organise. “Is it worth the pain and associated costs just to have your bacteria live rather than stable in your formulation? For the marketing, it makes sense. For the product benefits, I’m not sure.”​</p>
<p>Gueniche said the effects of tyndalized and processed probiotics were well-proven and the inclusion of postbiotics well documented as helping overall formulation effectiveness, so if the decision was made to incorporate live bacteria, manufacturers had to “be sure that it brings real added benefits, because it’s a complicated area to go into”.​</p>
<p>Regulations to consider if working with live probiotics​</p>
<p>Gerald Renner, director of technical regulatory affairs at Cosmetics Europe, said beauty brands would also have to carefully consider two main areas of regulation when formulating beauty products with live bacteria strains.</p>
<p>Firstly, brands and manufacturers would have to consider regulations around growing these kinds of bacteria – biotech regulation that might throw up restrictions, depending on the strain, Renner said. And secondly, industry would have to be certain that the final product fell into the cosmetics definition.</p>
<p>For a product to be considered a cosmetic in Europe – and most parts of the world – he said it had to be a substance or mixture of substances; applied externally to parts of the body or potentially within the oral cavity; and achieve a cosmetic benefit and nothing more.</p>
<p>Cosmetics Europe had conducted deep analysis on whether live bacteria could be considered a cosmetic ingredient, he said, and concluded that there was “nothing wrong or fundamentally against it being considered a cosmetic ingredient”​ as long as the product fulfilled requirements in the Cosmetic Regulation.</p>
<p>Learnings from the food and supplements industry?​</p>
<p>So, as industry advanced in its consideration of using live probiotics in topical beauty formulations, could it draw inspiration from elsewhere in consumer goods?</p>
<p>The supplements industry, as well as food and beverage, has conducted lengthy research into probiotic encapsulation and delivery techniques (Getty Images)</p>
<p>Ewa Hudson, director of insights at Lumina Intelligence, said the food, beverage and supplements industries had “invested a lot of energy”​ in different delivery systems for probiotics, including encapsulation techniques, and so perhaps cosmetics could look at existing research in this field.</p>
<p>Renner agreed food, beverage and supplements would be the obvious place to look for inspiration. “They’re facing the same questions: they want the good live bacteria in there but have to deal with making sure there’s no pathogens in there.”​</p>
<p>He added, though, that the concept of incorporating live probiotics in cosmetic formulations was perhaps “too early and not worth the pain” ​for most of the beauty industry at this point in time.</p>

<p>Young black people have shared their experiences of growing up in Bath and set out what needs to change for the next generation.</p>
<p>They reported losing count of the number of times they have been called the N-word, being treated differently because of the colour of their skin, and never having a black teacher.</p>
<p>October is Black History Month but they said black history should be taught throughout the year and not focus solely on the slave trade.</p>
<p>The young people were asked to give their perspective in a Black Lives Matter webinar organised by Bath and North East Somerset Council, which is setting up a panel to tackle systemic inequality.</p>
<p>Lucia Vinyard, who made a video with the charity Boys in Mind, Girls Mind Too about growing up in the city, said: “I’ve lived in Bath all my life. I’ve experienced racism. I’ve been called dirty in the street, I’ve been called the N-word more times than I can remember.</p>
<p>“I’ve been treated differently by my teachers and peers because of the colour of my skin. I didn’t know where to turn.</p>
<p>“This movement [Black Lives Matter] has provided a comfort blanket for me in terms of realising that other people are there to support me. I want younger people to have the support I didn’t feel I had.”</p>
<p>The Black Lives Matter movement spread across the globe after George Floyd was killed by a police officer. An estimated 1,200 people joined a protest in Bath in June.</p>

<p>Ms Vinyard added: “Being an ethnic minority in Bath you walk into the room and you’re instantly standing out because of the colour of your skin.</p>
<p>“It’s great that schools in Bath are diverse and they’re accepting different people but that doesn’t mean we have people to turn to.</p>
<p>“In all of my years of education, the first ethnic minority teacher I’ve had was in London when I was 19.”</p>
<p>She said she had been educated on race by her family but her school would only mark Black History Month with a single assembly, “which just isn’t enough”.</p>
<p>(Image: Paul Gillis)</p>
<p>Joshua, another speaker, said: “As a black youth in Bath I’ve been called the N-word many times, ever since I was a child.</p>
<p>“There were drive-bys, on the bus, people just shouting the N-word people calling me dirty.</p>
<p>“It got to a point where I got used to it, I just didn’t care, I can’t do anything about it. It’s kind of sad.</p>
<p>“We should try to expand the curriculum and learn more, not just about slavery, about the whole of Africa and its culture.”</p>
<p>Ben, a student at Bath College, said: “Bath is obviously a predominantly white city. Sometimes it’s hard to relate to people or at least make friends that seem more diverse and so understand what I might feel.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are too afraid to talk about these subjects because not only is it that they fear the past, they also feel as if they might be saying the wrong things.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are asking about what we should do in Bath. It’s not going to be easy, just like it’s not easy anywhere.</p>
<p>“Just from you being here it’s helping already. Things will start to change just from you watching, responding and asking questions.</p>
<p>“Things that will help are people just being represented more.”</p>
<p>Rachelle Wabissa studies issues including race and racism at the University of Bath but said she has never been taught by a black lecturer and she is “always the only black person in the room”.</p>
<p>While she welcomed steps to educate people about race, “the minorities are the ones who end up teaching for free”.</p>
<p>She called for culturally appropriate support, saying: “If you’re sexually assaulted you’ll get asked would you like to talk to a male or female person.</p>
<p>“If you experience a racist incident you’re expected to talk to a white person about it – you spend more time explaining why the situation was bad and why it hurt you than actually processing the emotions.</p>
<p>“It feels like my whole point here is to educate white people about racism. I’d like somebody to talk to about racism first, and then I’ll be in a good place to ask what else can be improved.</p>
<p>“Culturally appropriate support is what institutions can start with – let’s not run before we can walk.”</p>
<p>What the council can do</p>
<p>Councillor Kevin Guy, the cabinet member for children’s services, said: “As an openly gay man I’ve come across bigotry and abuse in my life. It’s a terrible thing that in 2020 young people still have to endure racism.</p>
<p>“I’m a big believer in education, because people aren’t born racist, they’re not born sexists, they’re not born as bigots. This is taught behaviour.</p>
<p>“If we can instil a better form of education through our society and all classes of society then I think that’s something that we in the establishment can do to change people’s lives for the better.”</p>
<p>Council leader Dine Romero said: “I find it distressing that this is still such a feature of modern day life in Britain and in Bath. We need to do whatever we can to change that.</p>
<p>“We can discuss these things till the cows come home but you know we actually do need to get on and do something.”</p>
<p>Cllr Romero said the issues are more difficult in Bath because it is not as diverse as other areas.</p>
<p>She invited the panellists to join the council’s new race panel, which is being set up in response to the Black Lives Matter movement to address systemic inequality, racism and discrimination.</p>

Before the pandemic, I traveled all the time. I spent two months in Barcelona, then I spent the holidays in South Africa, then I went straight to Miami to prep for the Super Bowl, then I went to Mardi Gras in New Orleans to do some casting, then I finally went back home to L.A. I like that this brand is international — if I’m not home and the handle breaks or a wheel gets loose, I’m able to have it fixed wherever I am in the world. I found the brand while looking for some new luggage. I’m that guy who goes into the store and literally asks a million questions before I walk out with anything. Briggs &amp; Riley came highly recommended and the brand has a lifetime warranty — that was a big selling point for me. I prefer the carry-on size. It’s expandable and super spacious. Usually the zippers give out on you right away, but these don’t break no matter how much I overpack. My friends always laugh at me because I pack my suitcase to the brim and they tell me it won’t zip. But I say, “Watch me.”

Notes to Cork project spreads a little kindness</p>
<p>Al Dalton decided to design and display a series of positive messages on empty billboards across Cork city, to spread some kindness during lockdown. We find out what he&rsquo;s up to now in our Person to Person feature series</p>
<p>TELL us about yourself;</p>
<p>My name is Al Dalton. I am managing director of Notes to Cork, a new creative agency that I have set up in Cork. I am also co-artistic director of theatre company ALSA Productions with Sadhbh Barrett Coakley.</p>
<p>I studied Theatre and Drama Studies in CIT Cork School of Music and graduated in 2016 with a first class honours degree. I met Sadhbh in my first year of college and we have been together ever since, shortly after graduating we set up our theatre company. We also both work as freelancers in the Arts in a variety of roles and have worked on shows all over Ireland and in the UK.</p>
<p>Early last year I took over the family business Poster Displays Ltd after the passing of my aunt Breda Dalton. Poster Displays supplies outdoor billboard advertising around Cork city and suburbs. It has been a whirlwind year getting my head around the business and during lockdown I made the bold step to restructure the business and rebrand as ‘Notes to Cork’. I’m currently refurbishing our new workspace on Douglas st.</p>
<p>Where were you born?</p>
<p>I was born in the Victoria Hospital, now the South Infirmary.</p>
<p>Where do you live?</p>
<p>I live in Rochestown (but a proud Ballinlough boy!)</p>
<p>Family?</p>
<p>The Dalton side of my family is quite small, just me, my Mum and my two uncles. I grew up as an only child but have two (much younger) half brothers who live in Oslo, Norway.</p>
<p>Best friend?</p>
<p>I am lucky in that I have many close friends but I would have to say my fiance Sadhbh would be my best friend. She’s an unbelievable person and is the complete opposite of me in every way. We have the most amazing conversations and our personalities complement each other very well!</p>
<p>Earliest childhood memory?</p>
<p>My earliest childhood memories would be spending time in my family’s cottage down in Oysterhaven, Co.Cork, more than likely wedged in a wetsuit and heading out to sea with my aunt and uncle in their boat.</p>
<p>Person you most admire?</p>
<p>I admire those who stand up against adversity. Those who put others ahead of themselves in the interest of others. I think the work that Stevie G and the Cork Migrant Centre are doing is amazing.</p>
<p>Person who most irritates you?</p>
<p>Donald Trump popped straight into my head when I read that question first, but i think it&rsquo;s more what he symbolises, people who are selfish, inconsiderate and antagonistic.</p>
<p>Who would you like to see as Minister for Finance and why?</p>
<p>There is a fantastic actor/accountant in Dublin called Peter Daly who has done unbelievable work, free of charge, on behalf of those working in the Arts post lockdown, petitioning for clarity and transparency from the government so that others could receive the pandemic unemployment payment fairly. I think he would be good in that role.</p>
<p>Where was your most memorable holiday?</p>
<p>Me and my mum spent years holidaying down around West Cork in Owenahincha and Rosscarbery during my childhood. I would give anything to be on the beach, post surf, with a towel wrapped around my legs and munching on an egg salad sandwich.</p>
<p>Favourite TV programme?</p>
<p>I’m a big Netflix fan and am mad about documentaries. ‘Last Chance U’ is a great documentary series.</p>
<p>Favourite radio show?</p>
<p>I listen to the radio constantly. First thing I do in the morning is turn it on. The Dermot and Dave Show on Today FM are always entertaining.</p>
<p>Your signature dish if cooking?</p>
<p>I make a mean Steak and Chips.</p>
<p>Favourite restaurant?</p>
<p>Huge fan of the Quay Co Op on Sullivan&rsquo;s Quay.</p>
<p>Last book you read?</p>
<p>The Boy, The Mole, The Fox and The Horse by Charlie Mackesy.</p>
<p>Best book you read?</p>
<p>Song of Spider-Man: The Inside Story of the Most Controversial Musical in Broadway History by Glen Berger.</p>
<p>Last album/CD/download you bought?</p>
<p>Hozier’s EP Nina Cried Power.</p>
<p>Favourite song?</p>
<p>My Number by Foals.</p>
<p>One person you would like to see in concert?</p>
<p>I saw Gregory Porter at the Jazz Festival 2012 in the Everyman with my aunt Breda. I would give anything to see him live again.</p>
<p>Do you have a pet?</p>
<p>I have two dogs. They’re both rescues, Rua (jack russel terrier) and Loah (border collie).</p>
<p>Morning person or night owl?</p>
<p>I’m a morning person.</p>
<p>Your proudest moment?</p>
<p>Proposing to Sadhbh.</p>
<p>Spendthrift or saver?</p>
<p>Spendthrift.</p>
<p>Name one thing you would improve in your area in which you live?</p>
<p>I am lucky that where I live is very nice. A small independent coffee shop in walking distance would be a lovely bonus. Love good coffee - Filter on George’s Quay know me well!</p>
<p>What makes you happy?</p>
<p>The Sea and surfing. Saltwater on the skin always allows me to recalibrate and salty eyebrows post surf reminds me of why I’m alive.</p>
<p>How would you like to be remembered?</p>
<p>As genuine, honest and compassionate.</p>
<p>What else are you up to at the moment?</p>
<p>Currently finishing off the last few details in the new workspace and signing off on the new branding for Notes to Cork. Myself and Sadhbh have also just submitted an application for Arts Council funding for a new play that we hope to develop in Cork next year. Other than that planning my next date with the Sea.

<h3 id="brad-glick-do-faad-dermatology-covid-19-skin-pigmentation-and-race">&ldquo;Brad Glick, DO, FAAD: Dermatology, COVID-19, Skin Pigmentation and Race&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/hcplive/af273ca3bcd1b0d8ae5b1a6e7004cc436320a2c7-1370x1370.jpg" alt="img">
It goes without saying that the specialty of dermatology spans an array of topics and discussions. After all, the skin may be a reflection of physical health and personal identity.</p>
<p>In an interview with HCPLive®, Bran Glick, DO, FAAD teased just a few of the many derm-related subjects that will covered in the upcoming podcast series, Derm Discussions.</p>
<p>For example, Glick touched on the intersections between derm therapies and the unique cutaneous manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). He explained the important role that dermatology has played in the pandemic—especially at the onset of it.</p>
<p>Another topic that will be explored is the continued rise of telehealth and its relevance to the field of dermatology. According to Glick, telemedicine has especially filled a significant gap in the specialty, although he did acknowledge the irreplaceability of face-to-face visits.</p>
<p>And finally, Glick discussed what to expect from the first episode. Featuring esteemed dermatology Seemal Desai, MD, FAAD, the episode will center around topics related to skin pigmentation, skin color, access to healthcare, and racial disparities.</p>
<p>“I’m really excited about that,” he said. “I think it’s a fantastic way for all of us at HCPLive® and Derm Discussions to lead these podcasts off.”
