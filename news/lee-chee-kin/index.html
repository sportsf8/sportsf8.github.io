<p>SINGAPORE - A former part-time actor, who had been stealing women&rsquo;s undergarments from homes since 2018, continued doing so even during the circuit breaker and despite being out on bail for the same offence.</p>
<p>Lee Chee Kin, 39, trespassed into the backyard of a house on April 15, a week into the start of the circuit breaker to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak, with the intention of adding to his tally.</p>
<p>The Singaporean had trespassed into the same property on five earlier occasions, between November 2018 and May last year, stealing nearly 30 pieces of undergarments worth at least $160 in total.</p>
<p>He was sentenced on Monday (June 8) to 23 weeks&rsquo; jail after pleading guilty last month to 10 charges, including criminal trespass, theft and an offence under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act.</p>
<p>Lee had been stealing lingerie for his own sexual gratification since 2018, trespassing into other properties to commit similar acts of crime.</p>
<p>The locations of all affected homes were redacted from court documents. In total, he admitted to entering different premises on at least 30 occasions.</p>
<p>Lee was earlier caught on July 12 last year.</p>
<p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Kwang Jia Min had said: &ldquo;He would select bras and panties to steal based on their appearance&hellip; he would climb over the back gate of the target unit and enter the (laundry or backyard areas) where bras and panties were hanging and steal them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would then leave the premises the way he entered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While out on bail following last year&rsquo;s arrest, Lee left his home in the wee hours of April 15 to return to one of his victims&rsquo; houses.</p>
<p>An occupant alerted the police and officers later arrested him.</p>

<p>In an unrelated case, he took another man&rsquo;s debit card which he had found at Ang Mo Kio MRT station on May 23 last year.</p>
<p>Lee then used it to buy nearly $91 worth of items by using the Paywave function.</p>
<p>He has since made full restitution to the victim, who made a police report on May 28 last year.</p>
<p>On Monday, the DPP urged the court to sentence Lee to at least six months&rsquo; jail, stressing that he had trespassed into multiple properties to steal women&rsquo;s undergarments.</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Roche Eng pleaded for between three and five months&rsquo; jail.</p>
<p>He told the court that his client, who had appeared in productions shown on Tamil channel Vasantham, is &ldquo;looking for judicial mercy&rdquo; and is remorseful.</p>
<p>For each criminal trespass charge, Lee could have been jailed for up to three months and fined up to $500.</p>
<p>For each count of theft, an offender can be jailed for up to three years and fined.

A serial lingerie thief has been found to be unsuitable for a mandatory treatment order (MTO), a district court heard yesterday. This means he may end up behind bars.</p>
<p>Lee Chee Kin was out on bail on April 15 amid the coronavirus outbreak when he climbed the fence of a landed property to steal women&rsquo;s undergarments.

<p><img src="https://static.mothership.sg/1/2020/05/Bra-and-panty-thief.jpg" alt="img">
Out on bail after his arrest in July 2019, a serial underwear thief flouted circuit breaker rules in order to look for bras and panties to steal.</p>
<p>On May 18, Lee Chee Kin pleaded guilty to ten charges relating to trespass, theft, dishonest misappropriation and unauthorised access to a debit card, and leaving his residence without reasonable excuse.</p>
<p>Another 14 charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing.</p>
<p>Court documents show that the 39-year-old Singaporean&rsquo;s crime spree lasted about two years, committing the offence of trespassing onto another property at least 30 times.</p>
<p>Climbing into people&rsquo;s house to steal underwear</p>
<p>Starting in 2018, Lee would climb into different houses to steal female underwear sometimes trespassing onto a property multiple times.</p>
<p>He would do this whenever the urge arose and selected the bra and panties based on their appearance, using them for his own sexual gratification, according to court documents.</p>
<p>One household — the residence of an individual court documents label as A4 — had a total of ten bras and eight panties stolen over four occasions between November 2018 and March 2019.</p>
<p>Lee would climb over the back gate and enter the house, before leaving with underwear that belonged to two women.</p>
<p>Another victim, labelled A7, had 24 pieces of underwear — with a total value of S$1,000 — stolen from her backyard over four occasions from February 2019 to March 2019.</p>
<p>While a police raid on Lee&rsquo;s house in July 2019 recovered some of the stolen underwear, none of the women wanted the items back.</p>
<p>Court documents reveal that despite finding 106 bras and 41 panties in the raid, 93 bras and 25 panties are still unaccounted for.</p>
<p>Flouting circuit breaker</p>
<p>Lee was arrested on July 12, 2019, prior to the raid, but was out on bail in April 2020 when he once again had the urge to steal underwear.</p>
<p>On April 15, when Circuit Breaker measures were already in place, he left his house to look for bras and panties to steal.</p>
<p>According to court documents this reason &ldquo;does not fall&rdquo; under any of the activities prescribed under the Covid-19 regulations.</p>
<p>Lee once again trespassed on A4&rsquo;s property by climbing over the house&rsquo;s back gate at around 2:14am. He was not wearing a mask while doing so.</p>
<p>Additionally, Lee pleaded guilty to dishonestly misappropriating a man&rsquo;s debit card from May 23 to 25, 2019, which he had found at Ang Mo Kio MRT Station.</p>
<p>He had spent about S$91 on it, utilising the card&rsquo;s PayWave function.</p>
<p>Hopes to &ldquo;do something good for society&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to CNA, Lee&rsquo;s defence told the court that the panty thief&rsquo;s father had died in 2019, while his uncle had recently undergone surgery.</p>
<p>Both issues, they posited, had affected Lee who was remorseful for his actions.</p>
<p>Lee also said that he hoped to see a doctor and &ldquo;do something good for society&rdquo;, reported CNA.</p>
<p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Kwang Jia Min said that she would not object to a mandatory treatment order suitability report being called.</p>
<p>The judge then called for the report to be compiled.</p>
<p>Lee&rsquo;s sentencing will commence on Jun. 1.</p>
<p>For criminal trespass, Lee can be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$500, or both.</p>
<p>For theft, he can be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.</p>
<p>For breaching COVID-19 regulations, he can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.</p>

A serial underwear thief has admitted to breaching Singapore’s strict coronavirus lockdown to sneak into a backyard and try to purloin women’s lingerie.</p>
<p>Lee Chee Kin has stolen underwear from homes on at least 30 occasions since 2018 and police found more than 100 bras during a raid on his home last year, according to court documents.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>The 39-year-old was on bail over previous charges of underwear theft last month when he snuck out of home and climbed into a backyard on the hunt for more intimates.</p>
<p>He was spotted by the homeowner and arrested.</p>
<p>On Monday he admitted in court to breaking lockdown rules by leaving his residence without a good reason and failing to wear a mask outside, and also pleaded guilty to charges of theft and criminal trespass.</p>
<p>A prosecutor told the court that Lee “would select bras and panties to steal based on their appearance.</p>
<p>“The accused used the stolen bras and panties for his own sexual gratification.”</p>
<p>Lee, who will be sentenced at a later date, could face a jail term and hefty fine.</p>
<p>Singapore closed schools and workplaces and at the beginning of April after being hit by a second wave of virus cases.</p>
<p>People were told to stay at home as much as possible, and only go out for essentials such as exercise and grocery shopping.</p>
