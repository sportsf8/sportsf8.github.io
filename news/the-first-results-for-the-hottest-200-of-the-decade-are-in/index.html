Featuring some songs we didn't expect to see this side of the 100.

Well, it’s happening: the Hottest 200 of the Decade is finally upon us.

The results of the massive national poll, organised and run by triple j, will be released unusually slowly for the station. The countdown will occur over five days, with spots 200 to 101 revealed from today until Friday, and then the Hottest 100 countdown itself will go down this Saturday. That’ll give us a lot of time to digest the list, and also allow everybody to adjust their predictions for the top spot in real-time.

It’ll also mean we’ll get strung out with a series of surprises; the kind of upsets and shock omissions that we’ve already started to see as the spots have been slowly revealed. For instance, we’ve already had a number of songs place surprisingly low on the list.

Coming in at spot 195, for instance, is Middle Kids’ ‘Edge of Town’. That song didn’t even place in the Hottest 100 when it was first released, but the band are extremely popular with the station, and the reputation of their break-out single has only grown since then. You’d expect it to hit around the #50 mark — for it to be this low means we have some surprises in store.

The same goes with the song sitting at position number 192, Lizzo’s ‘Truth Hurts’. Lizzo is everywhere at the moment — her bop ‘Juice’ will almost certainly appear again in the count — so you’d expect one of her lead singles to be faring better.

But hey, at least the other songs make more sense. The National coming in at 197 with ‘Bloodbuzz Ohio’ checks out, as does The Weeknd nabbing the 191st spot with ‘The Hills’. Expect to see more of them as the list goes on. We’ll keep you updated.

Here’s the list so far:
