<p>In the U.S., the number of coronavirus cases has grown to more than 530. On Sunday, the country’s leading expert on infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said regional lockdowns could become necessary and recommended that those at greatest risk — older adults and people with underlying health conditions — abstain from travel.</p>
<p>Here are the latest updates on the virus and a map of where it has spread.</p>
<p>Related: A cruise ship that has been held off California after 21 people aboard tested positive for the virus is set to dock today in Oakland. Passengers and crew members will be quarantined on four military bases around the country, the authorities said. The State Department on Sunday advised Americans against traveling on cruise ships.</p>
<p>Closer look: Dr. Fauci has become the chief explainer of the epidemic, partly because other government scientists have either avoided the spotlight or been reined in by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>News analysis: President Trump, who seems at his strongest politically when he has a human target to attack, has found it harder to confront the threat of an invisible pathogen, our chief White House correspondent writes.

<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db5b168812420eda5c46b6d0b9bc883be6157412/0_170_4119_2473/master/4119.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMtYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=0fbe863a4e34e55cfe5ce5818a038c73" alt="img">
On the afternoon of 11 November 1975, the steps of Canberra’s old Parliament House became the stage for the most immortal of so very many Gough Whitlam-isms.</p>
<p>“Well may we say ‘God save the Queen’ – because nothing will save the governor general.”</p>
<p>So declared the newly sacked 21st prime minister of Australia just after governor general John Kerr’s official secretary David Smith had read the proclamation to prorogue parliament for an election in the wake of the lunchtime dismissal of Whitlam’s government. A crowd of thousands, filled with anger and rebellion, gathered as news of the sacking spread like a Mallee scrub fire across the capital and the nation.</p>
<p>At the news of Whitlam’s death on 21 October 2014, people gravitated again, as if by instinct, to the old Parliament House – a home these days to the Museum of Australian Democracy. Some came with posies of flowers hastily picked from their own, or others’, front gardens and public beds. Some found time to buy a condolence card on the way.</p>
<p>Prince Charles knew of idea to dismiss Whitlam before 1975 crisis, book claims Read more</p>
<p>Others, however, made do with what they could – a torn piece of brown paper bag, a yellow sticky note or the back of an envelope – to scribble their sentiments about Whitlam and his governments.</p>
<p>In ensuing days the notes and the bouquets formed a pile on the steps. They are all, now, a part of the museum’s collection – there for historians and writers to ponder on the 100th anniversary of Whitlam’s death or the Dismissal.</p>
<p>“THANKS GOUGH RIP,” reads one. “FOR GOUGH – Without him I wouldn’t have gone to uni,” another note says.</p>
<p>“My parents were true believers all the way – my mother literally until she died last week. RIP to a true inspiration whose message is always timely,” says a message on a postcard from the Yeo family.</p>
<p>Whitlam urged the believers to maintain their rage. And I wonder how, 40 years later, they will mark the anniversary of Whitlam’s sacking. I expect many will return to the same place, to one of the scenes of what they consider the crime, to reflect on Whitlam’s 35 months of government and, perhaps, consider why the smouldering rage that afternoon never quite ignited into revolution.</p>
<p>The Queen’s emissary sacking a democratically elected government would be more than enough in another country, then or today.</p>
<p>The Dismissal was Australia’s JFK moment. Just about anyone over five or six at the time who’s retained the vaguest political consciousness, may well remember where they were at the time.</p>
<p>I thought I knew all about the Dismissal. I was an 11-year-old schoolboy. A priest burst in to class at my Catholic boy’s school to announce the Queen’s man had sacked Whitlam.</p>
<p>Fraser&rsquo;s great conservative achievement: cementing Whitlam&rsquo;s progress on race | Robert Manne Read more</p>
<p>We were instructed: pay attention – this is history in the making. It was. So much so that soon the dismissal was capitalised. It became, and remains, “the Dismissal”.</p>
<p>We do that with our more defining political events, like the Dismissal and “the Split” of the Labor party in 1955. In my home these events, two decades apart, were viewed as indelibly linked, at least emotionally if not quite politically or remotely causally. My mother – the younger sister of a federal Victorian rightwing Labor MP, William Bourke, who’d helped establish the Democratic Labor Party after the ALP expelled him in 1955 – loathed Whitlam for delivering the ALP government in 1972 after 23 years in the wilderness due in large part to the Split. Dad, the son of a left-wing former Labor councilor, idolised Whitlam.</p>

<p>So, the Dismissal further split the adults in my home, where the arguments about the rights and wrongs of the mercurial, vainglorious, John Kerr’s sacking of the Whitlam government were a microcosm of the fierce debate across the nation that preceded the federal election of 13 December 1975.</p>
<p>Consequently I had no trouble doing as instructed at school. I was certainly paying attention. Thanks to my parents I had already developed a deep aversion to – and scepticism about – big party politics. A defining memory of my childhood is of a blazing row between my parents after we had a chance meeting with Whitlam on the steps of Parliament House during a visit to Canberra when “the great man” (Dad’s words) was still opposition leader. Dad fawned over Whitlam, clasping his hand as if he was underwater and it was an oxygen supply. Mum walked away to the corner of the steps and glowered in her dark Irish way.</p>
<p>They argued, I remember, about mum’s brother and the Split. I was, and still am, on Dad’s side of that one. In feeble old age, and still (remarkably, I often think) together, they had the very same fight while visiting me in Canberra where I had (just as improbably given my aversion to politics) moved to write about national affairs.</p>
<p>Yes, those steps at old Parliament House hold my memories, too.</p>
<p>As a student of politics and as a political journalist, the Dismissal was a constant reference point – an Australian moment that has attracted, perhaps, more scholarship, journalism and cultural reflection than just about any other.</p>
<p>And the story continues to be written amid new archival analysis, the emergence of fresh documentary material and oral histories, such as those in the collection of the Museum of Australian Democracy and the National Archives of Australia. More material is being publicly released annually for poring over by scholars, writers and journalists.</p>
<p>The looming 40th anniversary has already given rise to some extraordinary revelations, not least from political scientist Jenny Hocking who has shed further light on just how closely Kerr colluded with Malcolm Fraser before 11 November – and how keenly he apparently kept Buckingham Palace in the loop.</p>
<p>Historian John Blaxland, meanwhile, in his most recent instalment of the official history of Asio, has illuminated further just how distrustful and contemptuous (and potentially undermining) of Whitlam’s government the United States Government and the Central Intelligence Agency were.</p>
<p>When the Museum of Australian Democracy invited me to participate in its ambitious 40th anniversary commemoration (it involved helping to design a live Twitter recreation of the Dismissal – #Dismissal1975 – and writing a long, lively essay with an element of fiction) I readily agreed with the satisfaction of someone who had grown up and felt conversant with the story of the Whitlam government’s sacking.</p>

<p>But confronted with a tight deadline and an overwhelming body of research (books, media, transcripts of speeches, personal recollections and the very official documents critical to the events of 11 November 1975) on which to base a narrative, I became overwhelmed by how little of the nuance, the drama, the subterfuge and the political context I had, indeed, been genuinely familiar with.</p>
<p>Twitter is the lifeblood of so much contemporary political communication and coverage, its cause and effect. But in 1975? I struggled to get my mind around the notion: after Kerr interrupted his own pre-luncheon drinks (he had a G&amp;T) to sack him, Whitlam returned to The Lodge and had a steak for lunch while his praetorian guard filed in, one by one, to be told by the forlorn, still masticating former PM, “We’ve been sacked”.</p>
<p>Twitter might’ve helped Whitlam in 1975, but it could have killed his administration during the Khemlani loans affairs</p>
<p>There was a conspiracy – or a mix-up – on the parking at Government House, where Fraser, who had arrived early, was waiting in a room close to the front door.</p>
<p>Had Twitter – or indeed mobile phones - been around in 1975, the game would’ve been up much earlier. It would be incomprehensible today, but Whitlam’s senators didn’t know at 2pm when the upper house convened after lunch that Labor had been sacked, even though some journalists already knew. Fraser’s opposition had been stalling supply; suddenly, after lunch the supply bills were passed with support from both sides of the chamber – thus fulfilling one of Kerr’s apparent conditions for Fraser to form a caretaker government.</p>
<p>The Whitlam government so nearly survived, thanks to wavering Liberal senators who were ready to cross the floor. Something new, I learned too, was just how dysfunctional the Whitlam government had been – economically, politically, administratively. Twitter might’ve helped Whitlam on Remembrance Day 1975, but it could have killed his administration during the Khemlani loans affairs, the beachwear and booze Labor national conference earlier that year and around the time of Cyclone Tracy in December 1974 when Whitlam interrupted a six-week overseas tour to visit the disaster zone of Darwin – before jetting off to Europe again.</p>
<p>The British-American coup that ended Australian independence | John Pilger Read more</p>
<p>I remain thoroughly struck by Whitlam’s political naivety and blind faith in the virtue of parliamentary democracy during the Dismissal. He saw the best in Fraser and others, including, until 11 November, Kerr himself. Fraser still stands out for his single-minded determination and bastardry – of using the Senate to destroy a democratically elected government and, of course, for his collusion with Kerr – duplicitous, fragile, conniving and always fixated on posterity.</p>
<p>Of course a building can be the stage upon which memories – and historical events – are built. To me, however, old Parliament House has always seemed animate. And so it felt like a small step to afford it the corresponding capacities of recollection and observation in my essay.</p>
<p>A small step – that ends on its front steps on 11 November 1975.</p>
<p>The steps to which I’m sure people will gravitate, as if by instinct, the week after next.</p>

<h3 id="why-the-bailout-bill-failed">&ldquo;Why the Bailout Bill Failed&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Why the Bailout Bill Failed</p>
<p>So how could a major bill described by the president and both parties&rsquo; leaders as critical to the well-being of the nation&rsquo;s &ndash; and the world&rsquo;s &ndash; economy go down to defeat?</p>
<p>There are no easy answers here, as the House&rsquo;s stunning defeat moments ago of the financial bailout legislation is putting us into seemingly uncharted territory. But while the final tally, with 133 Republicans and 95 Democrats voting no, was a surprise &ndash; all morning, Hill sources were predicting narrow passage &ndash; the signs were there that the measure was in trouble:</p>
<ol>
<li>Poor Salesmanship. Did you know that the general consensus is now that this bill will not cost $700 billion? If you didn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s because the bill&rsquo;s proponents did a poor marketing job. From the start, the Bush administration did not do enough to emphasize the point that taxpayers would get at least some of the money back, and that gigantic price tag got stuck in the head of the public (and the media).</li>
</ol>
<p>The administration was also too eager and ambitious with its initial proposal, alienating many lawmakers right from the start by seeming to ask for the moon &ndash; give us everything we want, with no oversight. This White House has long played political hardball, but this was not the time for hardball. This was the time for begging. The administration also let the &ldquo;bailout&rdquo; label stick to the package right from the start. By the time President Bush started calling it a &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; measure, it was too late.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Vulnerables Scared. If you have a difficult reelection race, what was your motivation to vote for this bill? &ldquo;I voted in favor of a bill that I didn&rsquo;t really like, because I had no choice,&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t make for a particularly snappy campaign slogan. &ldquo;I stood up to my party and Wall Street,&rdquo; sounds much better. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) both made the argument that lawmakers needed to rise to the occasion and not think of their own political futures. But members of Congress ALWAYS think of their political futures. It&rsquo;s much easier to talk of sacrifice for the greater good when you&rsquo;re going to get reelected with 70 percent of the vote, like nearly every leader on both sides of the aisle will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Center of Gravity. Who&rsquo;s running Washington right now? Bush is the lamest of lame ducks, with a minuscule approval rating and no clout or political protection left to offer. Bush and Vice President Cheney were reportedly making calls to wavering Republicans right to the end; obviously that didn&rsquo;t do the trick. Barack Obama and John McCain both supposedly support the bill, but neither of them has been exactly wholehearted in their backing, and there haven&rsquo;t been any reports of either candidate calling members of their own party to lobby.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>House leaders, meanwhile, did support the bill and did whip it. But this wasn&rsquo;t a party-loyalty vote; lawmakers were asked to vote yes, but they weren&rsquo;t threatened. They (probably) weren&rsquo;t bribed. Add all that up, and you had a power vacuum.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Ideological Problems. The simplest explanation of all for the loss was that a lot of members just didn&rsquo;t like the bill. Capitol Briefing outlined last week all the reasons why House conservatives balked at the initial proposal, and the basic point still stands: A massive expenditure of taxpayer funds and intervention in the free market, combined with tough new regulations, simply offended too many conservatives&rsquo; most basic principles. And Republicans, being in the minority, feel no responsibility to govern. They calculated that the bill&rsquo;s failure will be blamed on Bush (so what?) and the majority Democrats.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the liberal end of the spectrum, most members believe this really does represent a &ldquo;bailout&rdquo; of Wall Street and a power grab by the Bush administration, and that the current crisis vindicates their longtime warnings that the financial system was riven by greed and insufficient regulation. For those members, the final package didn&rsquo;t have nearly enough help for struggling homeowners.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Partisanship? House Republican leaders gave a press conference right after the vote, and they have strongly suggested that Speaker Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s (D-Calif.) floor speech toward the end of the debate was at least partly to blame for the loss. &ldquo;I do believe we would have gotten there had the Speaker not made this partisan speech on the floor of the house,&rdquo; Boehner said.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s too early to know whether Pelosi&rsquo;s speech, which laid much of the blame for the whole financial crisis at the foot of the Bush administration, really made much of a difference. But if several House Republicans actually did switch their votes on a momentous piece of legislation just because they were irritated by a speech, what does that say about them? As Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) mockingly characterized the GOP&rsquo;s argument: &ldquo;Somebody hurt my feelings, so I&rsquo;m going to punish the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible despite weeks of warnings, and a stock market that is cratering as we speak, that a lot of members still aren&rsquo;t taking any of this seriously enough. And that, ultimately, may be the real reason for today&rsquo;s vote.
