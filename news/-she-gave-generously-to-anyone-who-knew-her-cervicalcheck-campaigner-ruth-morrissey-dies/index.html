<p>&ldquo;Ruth had a sparkle to her smile, her wit and her intelligence. That sparkle made her wonderful company and her friendship was a gift she gave generously to anyone who knew her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those were some of the moving words from Paul Morrissey, the husband of Ruth Morrissey, the fearless cervical smear campaigner who died peacefully in Milford Hospice yesterday.</p>
<p>The Limerick woman&rsquo;s courage and steely determination belied a gentle nature as she captured the hearts of the nation with her dignified yet dogged pursuit of justice after a misread cervical smear test.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey, a 39-year-old mother of young daughter Libby whom she described as her best friend, did not find out until 2018 that a 2014 review showed smears taken under the CervicalCheck screening programme in 2009 and 2012 had been incorrectly reported.</p>
<p>Her cancer returned in 2018, leaving her terminally ill.</p>
<p>She and her husband Paul, whom she described as her rock, took a case to the High Court.</p>
<p>Despite her diagnosis, Ms Morrissey‚Äôs courage in attending court and fighting for justice despite its gruelling toll made her a household symbol of bravery and honour, despite her never wanting to be in the limelight.</p>
<p>Through their solicitor Cian O&rsquo;Carroll, Mr Morrissey spoke upon his wife&rsquo;s passing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though just 39 years old, Ruth achieved so much in her life and chief among those accomplishments is the love she and Paul shared and the wonderful daughter they brought into this world and raised with love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the magnitude of the harm caused to her by avoidable errors, despite the broken promise of a Taoiseach who said no other woman would have to go to trial, despite using Ruth as a test case through the final years and months of her life, neither the HSE nor the State has ever apologised to her, and now it is too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ruth‚Äôs life was a very happy one and none of the hardships of recent years robbed her of her good cheer and positive spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She fought fiercely to stay alive for the family she adored. The example she set stands as an enduring inspiration of strength and determination that should help many others through difficult times in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey‚Äôs courage in attending court and fighting for justice despite its gruelling toll made her a household symbol of bravery and honour, despite her never wanting to be in the limelight.</p>
<p>Fellow campaigners Vicky Phelan, Lorraine Walsh and Stephen Teap were among those who honoured the legacy of Ms Morrissey.</p>
<p>Ms Phelan tweeted: ‚ÄúRuth was one of the strongest women I know, and also one of the most positive. I never once saw her without a smile on her face and I saw her when she was very ill.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ruth was one of the strongest women I know, and also one of the most positive. I never once saw her without a smile on her face and I saw her when she was very ill.</p>

<p>Ms Morrissey, along with fellow campaigners such as Ms Phelan, Ms Walsh, Mr Teap and the late Emma Mhic Mhath√∫na, galvanised the nation with their quest for justice, winning huge admiration across the country for their commitment to their cause.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey and her husband Paul were paid the full sum of ‚Ç¨2.16m damages awarded to them by the High Court over misreading of her cervical smear tests, the Supreme Court was told just last week.</p>

TRIBUTES have been paid to prominent CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey who has died at the age of 39.</p>
<p>Mrs Morrissey was among hundreds of women impacted by the controversy around incorrect smear test results.</p>
<p>Prominent CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has passed away aged 39</p>
<p>The issue affecting the CervicalCheck national screening programme saw women receive all clear smear results when in fact a different result warning of cancer should have been flagged.</p>
<p>Mrs Morrissey, from Monaleen in Co Limerick, was initially diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2014.</p>
<p>She was not told until 2018 that two smear tests she had undergone through the screening programme in 2009 and 2012 were reported incorrectly.</p>
<p>She sued the Health Service Executive (HSE) and two laboratories and was awarded ‚Ç¨2.1 million in damages at Dublin&rsquo;s High Court.</p>
<p>Fellow campaigner Vicky Phelan, whose case first brought the controversy to light, paid tribute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth was one of the strongest women I know, and also one of the most positive,&rdquo; she wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never once saw her without a smile on her face and I saw her when she was very ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thoughts today are with Ruth&rsquo;s husband Paul and their beautiful daughter Libby who Ruth adored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PRESIDENT&rsquo;S TRIBUTE</p>
<p>President Michael D Higgins also paid tribute saying in a statement: &ldquo;So many people across Ireland will have learned with great sadness of the passing of Ruth Morrissey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth Morrissey‚Äôs tremendous courage in an arduous campaign for truth and justice leaves a legacy of courage for all Irish people, and for those campaigning for women‚Äôs right to healthcare in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sabina and I send our sincere condolences to her husband Paul, their daughter, her family and friends, and to all those who have shared Mrs Morrissey‚Äôs journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taoiseach Micheal Martin said: ‚ÄúI was deeply saddened to learn of Ruth Morrissey‚Äôs passing this afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruth was a brave, courageous woman who worked tirelessly for others and for future generations of women in this country.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe was generous of spirit and had the interests of others at heart.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish to extend my sympathies to her husband Paul, her daughter Libby, her family and friends.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay she rest in peace.‚Äù</p>
<p>Labour leader Alan Kelly also paid tribute saying: ‚ÄúI want to offer my condolences and those of the Labour Party to the family and friends of Ruth Morrissey who has passed away after a difficult battle with cancer.</p>

The State did not apologise to CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey for the ‚Äúmagnitude of harm‚Äù caused by the misreading of her smear and ‚Äúnow it is too late‚Äù, her husband has said following the 39-year-old‚Äôs death.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey, the terminally ill Limerick woman who sued the HSE and two laboratories over the misreading of her cervical smear test results, died on Sunday morning at Milford Hospice following a prolonged battle with cancer.</p>
<p>A statement issued by her solicitor Cian O‚ÄôCarroll on behalf of her husband Paul, said Ms Morrissey ‚Äúachieved so much in her life and chief among those accomplishments is the love she and Paul shared and the wonderful daughter they brought into this world and raised with love‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúRuth had a sparkle to her smile, her wit and her intelligence. That sparkle made her wonderful company and her friendship was a gift she gave generously to anyone who knew her,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>The statement acknowledged that Ms Morrissey ‚Äúshowed courage and determination throughout that 36 day marathon trial‚Äù in the High Court action over the misreading of her cervical smear tests.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDespite the magnitude of the harm caused to her by avoidable errors, despite the broken promise of a Taoiseach who said no other woman would have to go to trial, despite using Ruth as a test case through the final years and months of her life, neither the HSE nor the State has ever apologised to her, and now it is too late,‚Äù it added.</p>
<p>Mr O‚ÄôCarroll said that the Morrissey and Moloney families wished to thank all those who gave help, support and medical care to Ms Morrissey.</p>

<p>‚ÄúRuth‚Äôs life was a very happy one and none of the hardships of recent years robbed her of her good cheer and positive spirit. She fought fiercely to stay alive for the family she adored,‚Äù the statement said.</p>

<p>In 2019, the High Court heard Ms Morrissey was not told until 2018 that a review carried out in 2014 showed smears taken under the CervicalCheck screening programme in 2009 and 2012 had been incorrectly reported. Her cancer returned in 2018, leaving her terminally ill.</p>
<p>Two laboratories - Quest Diagnostics and Medlab - and the HSE had appealed aspects of the May 2019 High Court judgment of Mr Justice Kevin Cross, regarded as a test case concerning the standard of care in cervical screening.</p>
<p>I was on my own this morning at home when I received the news that I have been dreading for some time now, the news that my good friend and fellow CervicalCheck campaigner Ruth Morrissey has died.</p>

<p>‚ÄúShe was generous of spirit and had the interests of others at heart,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>T√°naiste Leo Varadkar also extended his sympathy to Ms Morrissey‚Äôs family and friends. He said that last October, while he was taoiseach, he gave a formal State apology to all women and their families affected by the CervicalCheck scandal.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey along with campaigners such as Vicky Phelan, Lorraine Walsh, Stephen Teap and the late Emma Mhic Mhath√∫na, were leading women‚Äôs health advocates in light of the scandal, which affected some 221 women.</p>
<p>Ms Phelan paid tribute to Ms Morrissey on Twitter, describing her as ‚Äúone of the strongest women I know, and also one of the most positive‚Äù.</p>

<p>Fellow campaigner Stephen Teap said he was ‚Äústrugglin[g] to find the words to display my sadness at hearing this news‚Äù.</p>
<p>He described Ms Morrissey as ‚Äúa kind and gentle soul who I was honoured to know, always checking up on me and my boys even in the middle of her own battles. This world is at a loss without her.‚Äù</p>
<p>Lorraine Walsh said she was ‚Äúa beautiful, gentle lady‚Äù.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour life has been cut short far too soon, you shouldered a great burden for many of us,‚Äù she said.</p>
<p>Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said it is ‚Äúwith great sadness‚Äù that he learned of her death, adding that she was ‚Äúan incredible, brave, compassionate woman, campaigner and patient advocate‚Äù.</p>
<p>Labour leader Alan Kelly said : ‚ÄúRuth and her family have shown so much bravery in the eyes of adversary since her cancer diagnosis.It is never easy to go up against the State to challenge an injustice but Ruth did just that.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe State should never have appealed Ruth‚Äôs case given the circumstances but her winning has set the standard now for many women in Ireland.Ruth‚Äôs fight for justice while enduring a devastating cancer diagnosis has not just been an inspiration for me but for so many people right across our island.‚Äù</p>
<p>In his judgement of her case, Mr Justice Kevin Cross said that if her 2009 smear had been properly analysed and her 2012 slide was deemed inadequate, she would have been spared the pain and distress that followed her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe would have been spared the prospect and knowledge that her daughter and her husband will have to go through life without her care and guidance,‚Äù the judge stated.</p>
<p>Speaking outside the High Court after the landmark ruling in 2019, Ms Morrissey said she hoped the decision in her case might mean that the ‚Äúwomen who are left‚Äù won‚Äôt have to go through a court process and ‚Äúfight for their right to have a good life in what they have left.‚Äù</p>
<p>She encouraged women to continue going for smear tests ‚Äúeven though it failed me, but it does save many, many lives.‚Äù

<h3 id="ruth-morrissey-i-want-to-move-on-and-spend-whatever-time-ive-left-with-my-daughter">&ldquo;Ruth Morrissey: &lsquo;I want to move on and spend whatever time I&rsquo;ve left with my daughter&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/4618105/river/?height=400&amp;version=4618546" alt="img">
THE HIGH COURT has delivered its ruling in the case taken by Limerick woman Ruth Morrissey and her husband Paul over the alleged misreading of her cervical smear tests and the failure to inform her about it.</p>
<p>They are to be awarded ‚Ç¨2.1 million in damages the court ruled this morning, in what‚Äôs seen as a test case in the wake of the CervicalCheck controversy.</p>
<p>Ruth is to be awarded ‚Ç¨757,000 and her husband is to be granted ‚Ç¨1.4 million.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters outside the court in Dublin today, Morrissey said she now wants to ‚Äúmove on and spend whatever quality time I‚Äôve left with my daughter‚Äù.</p>
<p>She thanked the judge for his compassion and her family for all of the support she and Paul have received over the 37 days of the case.</p>
<p>What can I say? I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be in this position because our Taoiseach told us that none of us would have to go through this. But unfortunately I‚Äôm the one that had to so I hope that‚Äôs a positive thing for the women left, that they don‚Äôt have to do this and fight for what is their right to have a good life, what they‚Äôve left.</p>
<p>She thanked her husband, who she described as ‚Äúmy rock‚Äù.</p>
<p>Morrissey also encouraged women to continue to go for smears. Though she said the system had failed her, she said the screening ‚Äúdoes save many, many lives‚Äù.</p>

<p>Responding to the judgement today, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar welcomed the fact that the couple won their action.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know a year ago I said I didn‚Äôt want any woman to have to go through court, I still don‚Äôt and I know the Irish public don‚Äôt want [that] either,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>And I genuinely believed at the time that it would be possible to settle all cases by mediation and negotiation. While many have been, we know now that‚Äôs not possible in all cases but we have found an alternative, an alternative to court, and that‚Äôs a tribunal.</p>
<p>Varadkar said legislation for the establishment of the tribunal is now being prepared and this process will mean women who want to take a case will have an alternative. He said these cases will be heard in private and the system will help to fast track those cases.</p>
<p>The couple took the action against the HSE and two US laboratories, Quest Diagnostics Ireland and MedLab Pathology Limited over cervical smears taken in 2009 and 2012.</p>
<p>The court had heard the woman was not told until May 2018 that a review of her two smears in 2014 had found they were incorrectly reported.</p>
<p>In February last year she was diagnosed with a recurrence of her cancer and was told she had at most two years to live. The labs had both denied liability.</p>
<p>Pain and distress</p>
<p>In his judgement, Mr Justice Kevin Cross said that her life had been ‚Äúruined‚Äù.</p>
<p>He found the laboratory where her 2009 slide was read were negligent and in breach of duty. In the case of the 2012 slide, he found this lab was not negligent in its failure to determine it contained abnormal cells as the sample was not adequate.</p>
<p>However he found that the failure of this lab to test the slide for adequacy was negligent and in breach of duty. He said if this test had been done, it would have been reported as inadequate and Morrissey would have been called back to be retested within one and three months.</p>
<p>MedLab Pathology welcomed the judgement that its lab was not negligent in its review and interpretation of the 2012 slide. It said it was ‚Äúsurprised and disappointed‚Äù with the finding there was insufficient cellular material on the slide to meet the minimum threshold of 5,000 cells.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is contrary to findings of a retrospective detailed actual cell count where it was proven there was in excess of 35,000 cells present on the slide,‚Äù the firm said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis is over seven times the required volume of cells to deem a cervical sample as adequate.‚Äù</p>
<p>The company said it will now review the judgement in full with a view to appeal.</p>
<p>This evidence about the 35,000 cells on the slide related to a computer analysis of the slide ‚Äì for the lab‚Äôs legal defence ‚Äì using what is known as the Qupad system.</p>
<p>However the judge was told by a medical expert hired by Ruth and Paul Morrissey that this analysis was irrelevant as the slide should have been assessed using the method in accordance with what is known as the Bethedesda system. This is the system the labs are suppose to use for carrying out tests, under their contracts with the HSE.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMrs Morrissey has suffered a life sentence, of which she is fully aware, which is expected to take effect within two years and for which there is no reasonable prospect of reprieve.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said the 37-year-old woman has ‚Äúsuffered a catastrophic injury, no less than that of a tetraplegic or someone with brain damage‚Äù.</p>
<p>He said there is a high probability she would have been successfully treated using the non-invasive LLETZ procedure and she never would have contracted cancer in 2014.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe would have been spared the pain and distress of what followed and in particular, the cancer would not as a matter or probability reoccurred.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said she would not be left with the knowledge she had only at most two yeas to live, her careers would not have been interrupted, she would not have had to stop having intimate relations with her husband and she would likely have had another child.</p>
<p>She would have been spared the prospect and knowledge that her daughter and her husband will have to go through life without her care and guidance and in particular she will not live to see her daughter make her way through life and probably start her own family and of most importance, her life would not have been so tragically cut off.</p>
<p>The HSE admitted it owed a duty of care to Ruth Morrissey in relation to the disclosure of the audits of her smear tests after she was diagnosed with cancer. The judge said that apart from the non-disclosure of the audits, the immediate cause of damages was the acts of omissions of the two labs.</p>
<p>He said the HSE is entitled under contract to indemnity against the laboratories for all matters other than its own liability relating to the audits and has been ordered to pay ‚Ç¨10,000 of the damages.

<h3 id="hse-loses-supreme-court-appeal-over-smear-check-results">&ldquo;HSE loses Supreme Court appeal over smear check results&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20074320/Ruth-Morrissey-Feature-Image.jpg" alt="img">
If there is any doubt about a smear-test result, that result should not be given to a patient, the Supreme Court has ruled.</p>
<p>The HSE, along with two screening labs, yesterday lost an appeal over a landmark judgment which awarded a terminally ill Limerick mother ‚Ç¨2.1million in damages, after her tests were misread twice.</p>
<p>Ruth Morrissey was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2014, after her cancer was missed in both 2009 and 2012. High Court judge Kevin Cross had said her life had been ruined by the delayed diagnosis, which had resulted in a life sentence for her, with no reasonable prospect of a reprieve.</p>
<p>Ms Morrissey, 38, had told the High Court: ‚ÄòI just want my life back, that‚Äôs all I want‚Äô, while her husband Paul said: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs been very tough, extremely tough, not only on Ruth but on our whole family, me and our daughter.‚Äô The Government guaranteed Ms Morrissey and her husband would still receive her ‚Ç¨2.1million award, regardless of the outcome of the appeal by the HSE and the two laboratories involved, Quest Diagnostics and Medlab Pathology. The Supreme Court appeal centred on Judge Cross‚Äôs ruling that lab screeners should have ‚Äòabsolute confidence‚Äô that a test result had no abnormalities before passing it as clear. The HSE and laboratories had argued the ‚Äòabsolute confidence‚Äô test could affect cancer screening services and medical diagnoses generally, as well as the work of the CervicalCheck tribunal.</p>
<p>But in his judgment yesterday, Judge Frank Clarke said he did not agree with these ‚Äòdoomsday predictions‚Äô, and that he felt the fundamental principles of the High Court ruling were sound.</p>
<p>He said: ‚ÄòI consider that the use of the term ‚Äúabsolute confidence‚Äù may have created more confusion than clarity. However, it is clear that all of the relevant witnesses agreed a screener should not give a clear result in respect of a slide unless they had no doubt but that the sample was adequate and did not contain any suspicious material.‚Äô He said the standard had not been imposed by the court, but stemmed from the screening profession itself, and was practised in the UK and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Judge Clarke also supported the High Court‚Äôs finding that the HSE was liable for the negligence of the laboratories, when it came to CervicalCheck patients.</p>
<p>Judge Clarke said Ms Morrissey‚Äôs case arose out of tragic circumstances. But he said it was important to note that a person could develop cancer after having been given the all-clear by a screener, without any negligence having been involved. He said this could happen due to the length of time between a test and the diagnosis of the disease in question. Or, he said, it could happen if a sample taken did not contain any of the type of suspicious material, or not enough of it, to show up during the screening process.</p>
<p>Thirdly, he said, even screening processes which operated at the very highest standards could give rise to different results by competent screeners.</p>
<p>‚ÄòFor these and doubtless other reasons, it is not simply a case of inferring from the fact that someone obtained a clear result, but subsequently was diagnosed with the relevant disease, that there was necessarily negligence on someone‚Äôs part,‚Äô he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄòIt follows that the assessment of whether there was negligence in any particular case will involve findings of fact by the trial judge based on evidence. That process may well be both difficult and complex and each case will, necessarily, depend to a significant extent on its own facts.‚Äô In the case of Ms Morrissey, he said audits in 2014 revealed that her slides had been incorrectly read. It was found there were borderline abnormalities in the first, and an insufficient sample taken on the second.</p>
<p>He added that she was only told of the audit result in 2018, when she made enquiries following the publicity given to CervicalCheck scandal victim Vicky Phelan. A doctor told Ms Morrissey he simply ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to tell her, the judge said. Judge Clarke said the court had been told that if Ms Morrissey‚Äôs cancer had been picked up at an earlier stage, she could have been successfully treated.</p>
<p>But he agreed with Medlab that, legally, Mr Morrissey should not have been awarded damages for the loss of his wife‚Äôs services.</p>
<p>After the judgment yesterday, Ms Morrissey‚Äôs solicitor Cian O‚ÄôCarroll said: ‚ÄòRuth and Paul Morrissey are hugely relieved that the matter is now effectively over. It has been a very difficult time.‚Äô He said the court proceedings had gone on for 18 months and his client‚Äôs health was not improving. He said the judgment clarified that the ‚Äòabsolute confidence‚Äô test was already used in the UK and Northern Ireland, where the cervical screening programme was ‚Äòthe envy of the world‚Äô.
