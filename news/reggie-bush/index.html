<p>LOS ANGELES — USC President Carol L. Folt and Director of Athletics Mike Bohn today welcomed Reggie Bush back to the Trojan Family following Bush’s 10-year NCAA-mandated disassociation from USC, which concluded today.</p>
<p>In a letter to Bush today, President Carol L. Folt wrote, “I am pleased to inform you that all restrictions and prohibitions on your involvement in our athletics program are officially removed and you will be afforded the privileges and courtesies extended to all Trojan football alumni.”</p>
<p>USC Director of Athletics Mike Bohn said, “When I was hired to represent the Trojan Family as the Director of Athletics, I committed to listening and learning before leading. Throughout this process, one of the consistent themes that emerged from my discussions was how much Reggie Bush means to our former players, USC alumni, and fans everywhere. I’ve enjoyed getting to know Reggie and so many of his teammates, and I’m pleased his disassociation has ended so that we can welcome him back to our family. I’m confident that Reggie will use his incredible platform and influential voice to support and empower all of our student-athletes.”</p>
<p>Said Bush: “I’ve dreamed of this day for 10-plus years, and I’m excited to come home!”

<h3 id="reggie-bush-compares-najee-harris-to-derrick-henry">&ldquo;Reggie Bush compares Najee Harris to Derrick Henry&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/356/739/9739356.jpg?fit=bounds&amp;crop=1200:630,offset-y0.50&amp;width=1200&amp;height=630" alt="img">
For the last few years, all eyes that watch Alabama football have been glued on quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. After everything that he was able to accomplish in his time with the Crimson Tide, it makes sense why people were focused on him constantly. But now that he’s gone, where are those eyes going?</p>
<p>It’s not like the Crimson Tide are lacking talented players to watch in 2020. Wide receivers DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle are expected to have big years for Alabama. But there might not be a more exciting player on the Alabama offense than running back Najee Harris.</p>
<p>A former five-star recruit in 2017, Harris posted a massive junior season. Now, many are saying he could possibly in contention be in contention for awards like the Heisman Trophy. Is that crazy? Well, former USC running back Reggie Bush, who won the award once himself, doesn’t think so.</p>
<p>“I like Najee Harris because he’s the most complete running back out of all these backs we just listed,” Bush said. “When I turn on the film and I watched this guy, he reminds me of a more athletic Derrick Henry. And if you think about that, that&rsquo;s absolutely scary because this man is 6-2, about 230 pounds.</p>
<p>“…I think if he plays well enough, I think he can win the Heisman Trophy. He’s playing on one of the best teams, he’s gonna have great coaching, is gonna be surrounded by great talent, and they love to run a football. He fits perfectly into that Alabama running back style.”</p>
<p>As a junior in 2019, Harris carried the ball 209 times for a career-best 1,224 yards and 13 touchdowns. He also caught 27 passes for 304 yards and seven touchdowns. Harris now enters his senior season looking to post the best season yet.</p>
<p>But one thing that stands out about Harris over other running backs is the frame that he brings to the field. At 6-foot-2 and 230 pounds, Harris brings a unique dimension to the field as a bigger running back. For reference of how that might compare to other successful running backs, former Wisconsin running back Jonathan Taylor, who won the Doak Walker Award the last two seasons, was just 5-foot-10 and 226 pounds.</p>
<p>With a bigger frame and playing for one of college football&rsquo;s elite programs, expect big things from Najee Harris.</p>
<p>“He is shifty, which I didn&rsquo;t realize,” Bush said. “You see him, muscling guys, jumping over people. This dude is 230 pounds; he’s as big as just about any starting Mike linebacker in the NFL right now, and he’s doing all this in the SEC. So, he’s a grown man playing in a big boy conference, and he’s seeing tough defensive linemen every week, tough defensive coordinators, every week, and I think he has a tremendous opportunity in front of him this year.”

<p>June 10 (UPI) &ndash; The University of Southern California is expected to end their dissociation with Reggie Bush &ndash; stemming from NCAA sanctions on the Trojans&rsquo; football program &ndash; due to a rule change from college sports&rsquo; governing body.</p>
<p>A source told ESPN Bush is in the process of finalizing an agreement that would allow him to be reinstated and the Los Angeles Times reported the school plans to welcome Bush back.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Bush starred at running back for the Trojans from 2003 through 2005. The NCAA imposed sanctions on the Trojans in 2010 after a four-year investigation into potential extra benefits Bush received while enrolled. The NCAA determined Bush and family members accepted cash, travel expenses and lived rent-free at a San Diego, Calif., home while he was a student-athlete on the Los Angeles campus.</p>
<p>The Trojans were forced to vacate 14 wins, including a national championship in 2004, and dissociate from Bush. The program lost 30 scholarships and was given a two-year bowl ban. Bush also surrendered his 2005 Heisman Trophy.</p>
<p>The NCAA Committee on Infractions adopted a rule three years ago that limits dissociation between former players and a school to 10 years. USC&rsquo;s sanctions began on June 10, 2010, exactly 10 years Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bush, 35, recorded 2,218 yards from scrimmage and 19 touchdowns during his final season with the Trojans in 2005 and totaled 3,169 rushing yards, 1,301 receiving yards and 43 scores in three seasons at USC. Bush also was an electrifying punt and kick returner, with four special teams touchdowns in 39 games.</p>
<p>Bush was drafted No. 2 overall in the 2006 NFL Draft and played his first five seasons for the New Orleans Saints, helping the team win a Super Bowl title in 2010. He later played for the Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills, but never made a Pro Bowl, before retiring in 2017.

USC plans to reunite with Reggie Bush as NCAA ban on their association ends. (Bryan Woolston / Associated Press)</p>
<p>The specter of his legend still looms over USC. His electrifying run from 2003 to 2005 remains an essential thread in the fabric of Trojans football and college football writ large, impossible to untangle from the rich histories of either. Recruits who barely witnessed his supremacy still whisper his name, still mimic his style.</p>
<p>But since June 2010, on the campus where he once captivated a generation, Reggie Bush has been a ghost. It was then that the NCAA imposed harsh sanctions against USC, stripping away its 2004 national title and forcing the school to permanently disassociate from its star running back.</p>
<p>Any mention of Bush at USC was erased, every image scrubbed, all records tagged with an asterisk after a years-long NCAA investigation revealed he and his family accepted improper benefits from two would-be sports marketers.</p>
<p>Bush returned his 2005 Heisman Trophy as part of the fallout, the only player ever to do so. The replica trophy that once sat triumphantly in Heritage Hall now gathers dust with the Heisman Trust. The No. 5 jersey that once adorned the peristyle end of the Coliseum is gone too; and no Trojan has worn the number since.</p>
<p>But now, after 10 years in exile, shifting public sentiment over amateurism along with a subtle change in the internal operating procedures of the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions have cleared the way for Bush’s return to USC.</p>
<p>Wednesday marks the final day of the disassociation ban — since reduced from a permanent one — levied against Bush exactly a decade ago. In the eyes of the NCAA, he will be free to return to USC’s campus, and the university plans to welcome him back.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely long overdue,” said LenDale White, the other half of USC’s 2004 running back tandem. “Reggie should’ve never been in this situation, considering he was a kid when this went on. We’re 35 years old now. I definitely believe it’s time.”</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Others are not so sure. There’s no doubt anti-Bush sentiment — he was, for a time, a living embodiment of everything wrong about big-time college athletics — has softened over the years. But 15 years after USC’s vacated national title, some people are still awaiting an apology.</p>
<p>Bush did not respond to requests for comment about a return to USC, but several of his former teammates and others affiliated with the program during its charmed run were supportive of his reinstatement.</p>
<p>“Reggie don’t owe anybody an apology,” White said. “He don’t owe nobody anything.”</p>
<p>Said former Trojan tight end Alex Holmes: “At no point in time have I ever felt any negativity towards him — at all. The reality … is that Reggie didn’t do anything wrong.”</p>

<p>USC would not comment on Bush’s return, and its plans are unknown. While some people still clamor for an explanation, others see Bush as a victim — even a martyr. Some teammates wonder whether reinstatement is sufficient penance for the pain of the past decade.</p>
<p>“That’s for Reggie to decide, ultimately,” Holmes said. “He’s not getting the last 10 years back. I mean, how do you make up for that?”</p>
<p>USC has long maintained it would like to welcome Bush, and Bush has said he&rsquo;d like to return.</p>
<p>Now, as that day arrives, can the healing finally begin?</p>
<p>“I would hope so,” said Pete Carroll, the title-winning former Trojans coach. “I don’t think there’s any other choice to make.”</p>
<p>::</p>
<p>It was June 10, 2010, after four years of investigations, that the NCAA Committee on Infractions cited USC for lack of institutional control and slapped the university with suffocating sanctions.</p>
<p>The final two wins of the Trojans’ 2004 title run, including the Orange Bowl victory over Oklahoma that clinched a national championship, were vacated. It meant forfeiting every win from 2005, a memorable season that ended in a legendary Rose Bowl loss to Texas. USC was put on probation for four years, banned from postseason play for two, and docked 10 scholarships each year over the following three seasons.</p>
<p>“We basically got the death penalty,” former linebacker Keith Rivers said.</p>
<p>In all, the committee’s report listed 25 penalties to be meted out against USC’s football, men’s basketball, and women’s tennis programs. No. 15 on the list — “Disassociation of student-athlete 1” — remained one of the last vestiges of that devastating decision.</p>
<p>Student-athlete 1 was approaching his fifth NFL season when his ban from USC was announced. In his first meeting with reporters following the decision, Bush called it “the closest thing to death without dying.”</p>
<p>Yet, when USA Today reported that the running back had called athletic director Pat Haden to apologize, Haden called the L.A. Times to clarify, saying that while Bush was contrite, “never did he say ‘I’m sorry’ or ‘I apologize. Never did he say, ‘I lied to the NCAA’ or ‘I took stuff.’ ”</p>
<p>As USC followed the NCAA’s edict and cut ties from Bush, many of his teammates wondered why the university didn’t fight harder to defend a player whose presence helped power the Trojans to a school-record 34-game winning streak and earn the university millions.</p>
<p>In a 2018 podcast with former NFL running back Arian Foster, Bush suggested “the people at the university bailed on me.”</p>
<p>White sees it much the same way.</p>

<p>“If there’s anyone to blame, it’s the people who came into our moms’ and dads’ houses and said they were going to protect us and keep us safe,” White said. “You can’t be mad at a kid. Your jersey done sold 1,000 times in a single day, and you gotta borrow money from your teammates to get a dollar burger from Wendy’s? Look, I don’t blame Reggie at all, so much as I blame the so-called higher-ups, the people who are supposed to save us at that point.”</p>
<p>That perception only intensified when subsequent NCAA investigations at Oregon, Ohio State, and Miami elicited far less severe sanctions. And when Penn State was offered relief from sanctions handed down after the Jerry Sandusky scandal, Haden met with NCAA officials but no adjustments were made.</p>
<p>“To disassociate yourself from a player like that, then for the NCAA to go soft on Miami and all these other schools, I thought [USC] was going to do something,” said Lawrence Jackson, a defensive end from 2004-07. “All this time we talk about fighting on, but we’re not fighting in this instance?”</p>
<p>But while that bitterness simmered in the years that followed, an administrator was quietly taking action behind the scenes to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>Dave Roberts, now a special assistant to USC athletic director Mike Bohn, was hired to help build its compliance department in the wake of the 2010 penalties. Five years later, his work earned him a place on the very NCAA committee that had so severely punished USC.</p>
<p>It was in that role on the NCAA’s Committee on Infractions that Roberts would play a part in changing internal operating procedure 5-15-8.</p>
<p>Until the rule was changed in 2017, the committee frequently handed down disassociation bans as part of university sanctions, according to Rod Uphoff, an attorney who served as a non-voting member of the committee during USC’s case. Such bans, Uphoff said in an email, “were usually permanent”.</p>
<p>However, that was not the case for Michigan, where former star basketball player Chris Webber was indicted on five criminal charges in 2002, including obstruction of justice and lying to a federal grand jury, after he was found to have accepted nearly $300,000 in cash and gifts from a Michigan booster. The NCAA ordered Michigan to disassociate from Webber for 10 years.</p>
<p>The disparity between Webber’s ban, which ended in 2013, and the permanent ban given to Bush was not lost on USC. Indeed, it would become the inflection point in the committee’s decision to limit disassociation bans going forward.</p>
<p>Roberts was named vice chair of the Committee on Infractions on Sept. 1, 2017. A month later, the committee adopted a new internal operating procedure, limiting disassociation penalties past and present “to not exceed 10 years from publication of the COI’s infractions decision.”</p>
<p>The change was not publicly announced, but USC sports information director Tim Tessalone said that USC was informed about it at the time. Asked in April 2019 about a potential return, Tessalone suggested that the NCAA’s ban was all that was standing in the way. “We would love to have him back,” he said.</p>
<p>In Webber’s case, it took five years after his ban’s expiration for the bitterness between player and school to subside. In Nov. 2018, a quarter century after he last played for the university, Webber was invited to be an honorary captain at a Michigan football game.</p>
<p>“This was a great moment, in front of 100,000 people,” Webber said at the time. “I had goosebumps and chills and definitely some watery eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Last September, Reggie Bush stood in the end zone of the Coliseum and surveyed the grassy stage where he once starred. Now, he was 34, wearing a gray suit and clutching a microphone as part of Fox’s college football coverage team.</p>
<p>His mere presence required permission from the NCAA. But as fans gathered in the South end zone, chanting his name through the pregame, it was clear that his disassociation from the university had not erased his legacy on campus.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what they can do to rectify everything and make up for all of this lost time, but they definitely need to reinstate him,” former receiver Steve Smith said. “Hopefully they give his Heisman back. Put his memorabilia back up and his jersey. Have a ceremony apologizing and introducing him back in. Bring all the guys and make him feel special again.”</p>
<p>Said Jackson: “They should re-retire his jersey,” Jackson said.</p>
<p>Said Holmes: “He should be in the College Football Hall of Fame, ASAP.”</p>
<p>But there’s no ceremony that could erase the emotional pain or undo the collateral damage that came from the NCAA’s 2010 decision. There are no delusions of the NCAA suddenly offering restitution or returning USC’s vacated wins. The Heisman Trust, which did not respond to requests to comment for this article, is unlikely to return Bush’s trophy, barring an NCAA decision that reinstates his eligibility from the 2005 season.</p>
<p>Even as society grows more sympathetic to the plight of student athletes and the NCAA considers a future in which they can earn a profit off their name, image and likeness, there is no re-writing that history. But USC may view Bush’s situation as a rare opportunity to win back at least a little shine from a tarnished era.</p>
<p>“You can never really take Reggie away,” White said. “Reggie is a part of that history. He’s a part of USC. Maybe once we get Reggie back, we can get back to our glory days again.”

Time heals all wounds, but it certainly hasn’t affected Reggie Bush’s confidence.</p>
<p>Although it has been years since Reggie Bush played an NFL down, the former New Orleans Saints star is sure he’d contribute if given a chance in 2020. Here’s what Bush said about a possible comeback attempt.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush was an electric player when healthy</p>

<p>Reggie Bush’s resume at both the college and professional level speaks for itself. At USC, he wasn’t just one of the greatest running backs in college football history, but a dangerous all-purpose weapon who excelled in the passing game and on kick returns.</p>
<p>Bush ran for 3,169 yards and 25 touchdowns in three seasons at USC. He totaled 1,740 yards and 18 touchdowns from scrimmage in 2005, the same year he won the Heisman Trophy and led USC to the national title game.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints selected Bush with the second overall pick in the 2006 NFL draft. He totaled 5,940 rushing yards and 36 touchdowns in 11 NFL seasons and won a Super Bowl ring in February 2010.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush also caught 477 passes for 3,598 yards and 17 touchdowns. He returned four punts for touchdowns, three of which came in 2008.</p>

<p>Reggie Bush earned $63 million in 11 NFL seasons, most of which came from the Saints. He is among the highest-paid running backs in NFL history.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush played his final NFL season at 31 years old, when he averaged -0.3 yards per carry on 12 attempts with the 2016 Buffalo Bills. Bush recorded 90 receiving yards on seven catches, but his inability to pick up first downs on the ground sealed his fate.</p>
<p>Could we eventually see Bush play in the NFL again, though? In a recent interview with Playboy, Bush admitted he believes he can contribute to a team if given the opportunity in 2020.</p>
<p>Bush made it clear: He doesn’t believe he can help teams — he “knows” it.</p>
<p>Will Reggie Bush ever play in the NFL again?</p>
<p>RELATED: How Much Money Did Reggie Bush Make in the NFL?</p>
<p>Reggie Bush averaged 3.4 yards per carry in his last three NFL seasons. His 2015 season ended prematurely because of a fluke injury and by 2016, it was clear Bush wasn’t his old self.</p>
<p>Bush turned 35 on March 2. Only six NFL running backs played last season at over 30 years old and one, Marshawn Lynch, unretired and joined the Seahawks in late-December.</p>
<p>By his own admission, Reggie Bush doesn’t think he’ll return to the gridiron anytime soon. Bush now works on Fox’s college football coverage and, for the most part, has left his NFL dreams behind.</p>
<p>Still, as Bush explained to Playboy, those thoughts still linger in his head.</p>
<p>“You guys turn on the TV on Sunday, and you’re like, ‘Oh, s—. This is the greatest sport in the world.’ And it is one of the greatest sports in the world. But it comes with a price. It comes with sacrifices. And those sacrifices are what people don’t see. “The game will always be one of my first loves, but I’m happy with where I’m at right now.”

<h3 id="former-nfl-star-reggie-bush-sells-los-angeles-home-at-a-loss">&ldquo;Former NFL Star Reggie Bush Sells Los Angeles Home at a Loss&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-193227/social" alt="img">
Former New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush has sold his modern house in Los Angeles at a loss following several rounds of price reductions.</p>
<p>The two-level, 7,500-square-foot house in the neighborhood of Pacific Palisades closed for $7.381 million late last week, according to listing records.</p>

<p>He first listed the house for $9.995 million in August 2019 and then dropped the price a few times to bring it down to $8 million this March. The listing went into contract in early May and closed late Friday, listing records show.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, 35, who played college football at the University of Southern California, and later with National Football League teams including the New Orleans Saints, Miami Dolphins, Detroit Lions, San Francisco 49ers and the Buffalo Bills, purchased the property via a limited liability company for $7.75 million in April 2014, property records accessed through PropertyShark show.</p>
<p>The five-bedroom, six-bathroom house has been recently “redesigned with the finest finishes and detail,” according to the listing with Jordan Cohen of Re/Max Olson &amp; Associates, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The interior of the house features an open-floor plan, a formal living room with walls of glass, a modern kitchen with a center island, a temperature-controlled wine cellar and a gym. Outdoors, it has a wraparound terrace with unobstructed ocean and city-lights views, an infinity pool with spa, a large fire-pit, entertainment decks, an outdoor kitchen, covered patios, and a three-car garage, according to the listing.</p>

<p>Mr. Bush, who retired from professional football in 2017, could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The identity of the buyer could not be determined, as the transaction has yet to appear in property records online.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times first reported the sale.
