<p>FRANKLIN, Tenn., June 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) &ndash; Wesley Financial Group (WFG) founder Chuck McDowell has issued a statement in response to a lawsuit filed by Diamond Resorts:</p>
<p>“Once again, my company is faced with a David versus Goliath situation with the timeshare industry. Not only has Diamond Resorts attacked Wesley Financial Group but they are also making it personal by attacking me.</p>
<p>I want to be clear that I’ve never hidden from the fact that I’ve experienced ups and downs in my life both personally and professionally. I lost my wife and had to raise two boys on my own. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done but, if you look at my boys now, it was the best thing I’ve ever done. On the business side, I’m an entrepreneur. Some things worked and sometimes I got knocked down….but I always got up and never quit.</p>
<p>I’ve certainly not done everything perfectly in my life, but I’ve dedicated the past decade to helping consumers who have been hurt by the lies and misrepresentations of the timeshare industry. I’m proud of that work.</p>
<p>Every single day good people who have been enticed by ‘free’ vacations, dinners, tickets to shows and other incentives get sucked into high-pressure, never-ending sales presentations that end with them signing to purchase a timeshare they can’t afford, don’t really want and that doesn’t provide the value or availability they were promised. By the time they get home and figure this out, the rescission period has passed and they are stuck with long-term debt and maintenance fees that continue to increase year-after-year.</p>
<p>Our company receives literally thousands of calls a week from consumers desperate to get out of their timeshare contracts. Many have tried to work with the timeshare companies to escape and actually end up signing on for more debt based on more false promises. It’s not right and that’s why Wesley Financial Group exists.</p>
<p>We are committed to helping fight for those who have no other recourse and are experiencing financial distress. It’s important to note that we do not take on every person who reaches out as a client. In fact, the company only takes a small percentage. Out of the 18,688 people that contacted the company in May, only 1,392 were accepted as clients. We have a comprehensive vetting process we utilize to ensure we can relieve a client of their timeshare. If we can’t, we tell them and we don’t take a dime.</p>
<p>For those approved, we do charge an upfront fee – with many payment options - for our services…but we also offer a money-back guarantee if we cannot get our clients freed within a mutually-agreed upon timeline, generally between 18 and 36 months depending on the situation. I’m proud that we’ve been able get timeshare owners relief in an average of less than 300 days and that we’ve been successful 98% of the time. The other 2% have received full refunds.</p>
<p>In 2012, I successfully defended my company and the timeshare cancellation industry in a landmark case versus one of the largest timeshare companies in the world…and I’m ready to do it again. We’ve obviously caused disruption in a billion dollar industry and we are prepared to defend our right to help those who need our services.”</p>

<p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.46357233400170555%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_630%2C$y_586/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/f6febcffb815ed75f9587282b8fd07ab8f587be3" alt="img">
“So we’re now up to 41 families who are in dire [need of] help and none of them have been forced to leave the College because we’ve had the money to try and help those families over the next six or 12 months. “The goodwill of people never ceases to surprise me; it’s amazing the goodness that I’ve seen in people.” Mr Barron was also referring to families who nominated to pay full fees to help supplement those less fortunate. “I was absolutely blown away by the number who said they were fortunate at the moment and would like the 20 per cent [rebate] or 100 per cent in boarding [fees] going to families who may not be able to continue their journey at Wesley,” he said. “So we called it the Wesley Helping Hands Fund.”</p>
<p>One family to benefit was a Perth mother-of-three, whose son has remained at the school despite her being made redundant due to the economic downturn. “It was quite a big shock because it came very quickly and so it obviously put some financial strain on us,” said the mother, who wished to remain anonymous. “Our children’s education is so important to us and we want to be able to give them the best and they have so many wonderful opportunities through school and we wanted them to continue that.” Wesley College in South Perth. Although her husband did not lose his job, she said they were a mainstream family who could not sacrifice an income and still afford three sets of private school fees and the additional costs associated.</p>
<p>“We don’t go on lavish holidays or anything like that because they are at school for such a short period of their life that my husband and I made the decision that this is what we want to focus on and to give them the best start in life,” she said. “I think where people have been able to help, they will because it’s such an unknown [situation] and they appreciate from a parent’s point of view you very much want to give your children the best education. “The school obviously wants to help out where they can, because if you were in the situation where you take the child out and they go through the whole process of going somewhere else it’s disruptive to the child and it can be detrimental to them.” Many private schools have offered rebates of about 20 per cent, with the opportunity to donate the rebate to struggling families. St Hilda’s Anglican School For Girls headmistress Fiona Johnston said they were among the first to give 25 per cent back for term two fees.

<h3 id="timeshare-cancellation-company-sued-for-allegedly-driving-people-into-financial-problems-and-foreclosure">&ldquo;Timeshare Cancellation Company Sued for Allegedly Driving People into Financial Problems and Foreclosure&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chuck-McDowell-via-Wesley-Financial-Group.jpg" alt="img">
A timeshare company is suing a rival for allegedly driving clients into financial problems and even foreclosure.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs from the timeshare company Diamond Resorts argued that Wesley Financial Group makes false promises about relieving timeshare owners of obligations, and that the defendant discourages possible customers from getting a lawyer. It was alleged that Wesley makes people sign a service agreement to keep people quiet about their relationship with the company; works to discourage communications between timeshare developers and customers; tells the timeshare owner to stop making payments on valid debts or else the process will take longer.</p>
<p>From the complaint:</p>
<p>[Wesley Financial Group] is a completely unregulated and unrestrained business whose sole purpose is to cancel another business’s valid and enforceable contracts. Wesley has made a business of and monetized the tort of tortious interference with contract. Wesley targets and disrupts valid contracts between timeshare developers, like the Diamond Collections, and their customers. Wesley exacts exorbitant, up-front fees. Defendant Charles William “Chuck” McDowell, III (“McDowell”) is Wesley’s founder and CEO. While McDowell touts himself as a pioneer in the timeshare exit industry who has “fought and won” against timeshare developers, in reality he is a thricebankrupt, tax-liened huckster, oft-vilified sports betting tout, selling snake-oil: false and meaningless promises which, in the end, leave the timeshare owner – many Diamond Collections’ members – in a worse position than when they started.</p>
<p>“Wesley provides detailed instructions of how to cancel automatic payments depending on the method of payments the customer has established with the timeshare developer,” according to the lawsuit. “Wesley exposes the timeshare owner to delinquency and default because it knows that only the developer’s foreclosure or forfeiture of the timeshare interest, with attendant adverse credit and other consequences to the timeshare owner, will cancel the customer’s timeshare.”</p>
<p>Wesley Financial Group founder Chuck McDowell released a statement in response to the lawsuit via Globe News Wire.</p>
<p>“Once again, my company is faced with a David versus Goliath situation with the timeshare industry,” said McDowell. “Not only has Diamond Resorts attacked Wesley Financial Group but they are also making it personal by attacking me.”</p>
<p>He said he never hid the “ups and downs” in his life, and that he never quit after sometimes getting “knocked down.” McDowell defended the work his company did, and said they only accepted a portion of potential clients.</p>
<p>“For those approved, we do charge an upfront fee – with many payment options – for our services…but we also offer a money-back guarantee if we cannot get our clients freed within a mutually-agreed upon timeline, generally between 18 and 36 months depending on the situation,” he said. “I’m proud that we’ve been able get timeshare owners relief in an average of less than 300 days and that we’ve been successful 98% of the time. The other 2% have received full refunds.”</p>

<h3 id="breaking-down-top-notre-dame-hoops-target-blake-wesley">&ldquo;Breaking Down Top Notre Dame Hoops Target Blake Wesley&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imageproxy.themaven.net/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.saymedia-content.com%2F.image%2FMTcxNzk0MDUxMzk2MzQ2ODky%2Fusatsi_13983266.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=40&amp;h=683&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max" alt="img">
Notre Dame put together a quality 2020 recruiting class and already has a commitment from 2021 wing J.R. Konieczny of South Bend (Ind.) St. Joseph’s.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak slowed down Notre Dame’s recruiting for 2021 by eliminating the AAU circuit and also bringing out a dead period that is still in effect.</p>
<p>There is one 2021 target that is already on the radar for Notre Dame, and it’s another local talent. Notre Dame is making a push for South Bend (Ind.) Riley guard Blake Wesley, a four-star player and Top 100 player nationally according to Rivals and 247Sports.</p>
<p>Offers: Maryland, Louisville, Purdue, Indiana, Texas, Ohio State, Illinois, Wichita State, Cincinnati, Butler, Iowa, Xavier, DePaul, Northwestern, Toledo, Ball State, Miami (Ohio)</p>
<p>Size-Athleticism — At 6-5 and 180 pounds, Wesley continues a trend of new age ball handlers with size and body strength to shoot over defenders both on the perimeter and in the paint.</p>
<p>The first thing that jumped out at me is his athleticism. Notre Dame typically lands elite shooters and players that are unselfish and willing to distribute the ball. While Wesley shows those attributes, he is the type of athlete that the men’s program doesn’t land on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>In fact, from a slashing and penetrating standpoint on the perimeter, he is more reminiscent of former Notre Dame and current Vanderbilt swingman D.J. Harvey. Harvey has the edge in length, but in comparing high school films both guys drive past defenders with little effort and often finish above the rim.</p>
<p>Wesley’s athleticism is elevated even further by a quick first step and efficient handle. Probably his best attribute is when he is able to get out in space and on the fast break. His speed and physicality really shows when he is able get his momentum going to the rim.</p>
<p>Handle-Passing Ability — While not Riley high school’s primary ball handler, the offense runs through Wesley, and he shows an outstanding ability to handle and distribute the basketball. The team goes as he goes, and not many possessions go by without Wesley creating a shot for himself or a teammate.</p>
<p>He’s adept at finding the open man after picking up his dribble and is also good at getting out of trouble. Often times on film, the Riley star was able to dribble past double teams for an easy penetration where he could either score at the basket or kick it out to a wide open teammate. While Wesley can play with the ball, he’s at his best when he’s playing off the ball.</p>
<p>Shooting Ability — Wesley isn’t a lights out shooter from deep, but he shows enough range and a clean enough stroke to be effective further away from the rim. The Riley wing combines that with a quality mid-range jumper and the ability to finish at the rim.</p>
<p>In high school he is a high volume shooter, but there are times when he forces shots, so improving his shot selection at the next level will make him an even more effective offensive player.</p>
<p>Wesley shows a clean stroke from deep with a slightly inverted elbow on the delivery. Even with the ability to hit shots from deep, Wesley has the chance to be special as a slasher in college.</p>
<p>Defense — Wesley can be an aggressive defender at times, showing the ability to be disruptive using solid instincts when the opposition is on the fast break. The quicker the game is, the better he is on the both ends of the court.</p>
<p>As an on ball defender, and specifically on the perimeter he is too athletic and tall for most high school guards to get past him or get off clean passes or shots. He often tips or steals passes because of his lengthy arms and swarming defense.</p>
<p>He usually plays the team’s best player, and in his 2019 game versus St. Joseph’s Wesley guarded Koniecnzy most of the game. Wesley is not an active rebounder on either end and is often already looking to get back or start the fast break instead of mixing it up down low.</p>
<p>System Fit — One of his greatest strengths is how he moves without the ball, and in Mike Brey’s system it is imperative to keep moving instead of standing still. Wesley is not an iso player like Harvey, which is why he’s a much better fit.</p>
<p>While he is a primary ball handler at Riley, in Brey’s system he offers versatility to play anywhere on the wing. If need be he can play the point, but his best fit will be off-ball at either the two or three spots.</p>
<p>Brey’s offense is unique in that they often play four guards, and while that sometimes can affect the defensive side negatively, Brey’s best teams can really dominate on offense with shot making, distribution and low turnover ratios. All three of those skills are strengths of Wesley. With Wesley’s size and skillset, he should be able to keep the 4 around 1 look Brey loves a positive part of the offense if he signs with the Irish.</p>
<p>Final Analysis</p>
<p>Wesley is a young player well deserving of his ranking. He is not yet a finished product, but his game is pretty mature for his age and once he is able to play with athletes more like him, his abilities can really shine.</p>
<p>At a program like Notre Dame, he should be able to provide quality minutes early on his career. I don’t see him as an elite college perimeter shooter like the Irish typically land at the guard spots, but Wesley is also a much better overall athlete than many of the prospects that end up in South Bend, which makes him the ideal complementary type of player.</p>
<p>He is naturally strong and his 6-5 frame has room to add weight while keeping his high-level speed. As he grows into his body, he should become a more willing rebounder as well. Overall, Wesley is a good fit for Notre Dame and a local kid the staff doesn’t want to miss on.</p>
<p>As it stands, Wesley is the main uncommitted target to keep an eye on for Notre Dame Men’s basketball. Konieczny and the possibility of Wesley provides Notre Dame with continued perimeter success, and it would be a fun story to track with both guys local to South Bend.</p>

<p>Highly-skilled defender Lawson Humphries, from Wickham in the Pilbara, Subiaco colts ruckman Bryce McDonald and Fremantle Next Generation Academy member Conrad Williams are also ones to watch this season.</p>
<p>Hayden will play mainly up forward and pinch hit in the ruck when McDonald needs a rest.</p>
<p>“Elijah is a gun basketballer, he plays SBL for Perry Lakes Hawks and is super fit, has got good skills and is a good size at about 6’5”,” Norrish said.</p>
<p>“He’s got a massive leap on him and spent the shutdown period training with his older brother Kyron.</p>
<p>“If he can mark a few at full-forward, he’ll have AFL scouts all over him.”</p>

<p>Norris expects the competition to even out this season with a large number of his premiership side graduating.</p>
<p>Wesley also has a proud PSA football history with Ben Cousins, Lance Franklin and Brad Sheppard among its former pupils.</p>
<p>The school’s director of football Clay McLernon, who had a fine 97-game WAFL career including a premiership at Claremont in 2011, had high hopes for captain Angus Luers and Year 11 Jake Watson.</p>
<p>Luers is part of Perth’s WAFL colts squad and Watson is a former State under-12s midfielder/forward who won a reserves flag at Cervantes last season.</p>
<p>McLernon said the squad, coached by ex-Melbourne player Clayton Gardiner, was ready for the daunting test of facing the PSA footy benchmark on their home turf.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be quite difficult first up, Hale at Hale is always daunting and that’s what we’ve been preparing out boys for over the last few years, to match it with the best,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a really even side this year and a good balance of players who can play their role for the team.”</p>
<p>Aquinas, Scotch, Christ Church, Guildford Grammar and Trinity are also in the seven-team competition.</p>
<p>Several players were drafted last year who came through the PSA system including Georgiades (Hale), Deven Robertson, Jeremy Sharp, Trey Ruscoe, Chad Warner (Aquinas), Liam Henry and Isaiah Butters (Christ Church).</p>
<p>Scotch hosts Aquinas in Saturday’s other match, with the Christ Church versus Trinity clash postponed until later in the season.</p>
<p>The first four weeks of fixtures have been released so far.</p>
<p>A meeting between the headmasters today will determine how the rest of the season looks, but the no grand final format with top side winning the Alcock Cup will remain.</p>
<p>PSA executive officer Verity Keogh said it was an exciting time for the students after an uncertain few months due to COVID-19 fears, while the live streaming would add another dimension to the competition.</p>
<p>“The boys across all of our schools are really itching to get out there and play,” Ms Keogh said.</p>
<p>“We’re really thrilled to have the opportunity to expand our audience, particularly to boarders and in the circumstances where numbers are a bit restricted.</p>
<p>“The opportunity to have live streaming has been a fantastic innovation and we’re looking forward to working with The West Australian on that.”
