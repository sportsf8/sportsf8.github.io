<p>Large indoor gatherings banned, schools to stay open, Scott Morrison tells Australians not to leave the country in face of coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>Updated</p>
<p>Non-essential indoor gatherings of more than 100 people have been banned by the Federal Government as the country responds to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison also warned Australians not to leave the country as the disease spreads, saying: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen this sort of thing in Australia since the end of the First World War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced measures in the following areas:</p>
<p>Aged care: Residents of aged care homes will only be able to have one visit per day, of no more than two people</p>
<p>Gatherings: Indoor gatherings of more than 100 people are banned, with exceptions</p>
<p>Social distancing: A renewed call for Australians to stay 1.5 metres away from others</p>
<p>Shopping: A plea to end &ldquo;un-Australian&rdquo; panic buying</p>
<p>Schools: To remain open, for now</p>
<p>Travel: The Government recommends abandoning international travel</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a once-in-a-100-year-type event,&rdquo; Mr Morrison said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is changing in Australia, as it is changing all around the world. Life is going to continue to change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The travel advice to every Australian is do not travel abroad. Do not go overseas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new restrictions were agreed to during a phone hook-up with federal, state and territory leaders last night.</p>
<p>A human biosecurity emergency has been declared, giving the Federal Government extra powers to respond to the crisis</p>
<p>Work restrictions on 20,000 student nurses have been lifted, so that they can help with the health response.</p>
<p>Aged care</p>
<p>Anyone who has been overseas or in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 within a fortnight will be banned from visiting aged care homes.</p>
<p>Aged care residents will only be able to receive one visit a day, with a maximum of two people visiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This could be very difficult for families,&rdquo; Mr Morrison acknowledged.</p>
<p>No school groups will be allowed to visit, and children under 17 are advised to visit &ldquo;only by exception&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Gatherings</p>
<p>While imposing the 100-person indoor restriction, the Government is also considering further restrictions on crowded indoor environments.</p>
<p>Schools, universities, airports, public transport, medical and emergency services facilities, aged care homes, jails, courts, parliaments, supermarkets and many workplaces are exempt.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said religious gatherings must comply with the new measures.</p>
<p>The pre-existing ban restricting mass outdoor gatherings to 500 people will remain in place.</p>
<p>Social distancing</p>
<p>Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy urged Australians to continue social distancing and keep at least 1.5 metres apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more hand-shaking, no more hugging, except in your family,&rdquo; Dr Murphy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that in your family because you&rsquo;re already close to your family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more scant attention to hand hygiene. Wash your hands all the time. Use hand sanitiser and just practice sensible practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shopping</p>
<p>Mr Morrison also pleaded with Australians to stop panic buying and hoarding, which has stripped supermarkets of supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be more blunt about it. Stop it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said there were no supply shortages and that health experts had advised the Government there was no need for &ldquo;bulk purchases&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no reason for people to be hoarding supplies in fear of a lockdown or anything like this,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Government&rsquo;s advice is for people to have a few days&rsquo; worth of supplies. They have been urged to return to regular shopping habits to give supermarkets a chance to restock their shelves.</p>
<p>Schools</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said health officials had advised federal and state governments to keep schools open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all love our kids and there is nothing we wouldn&rsquo;t do for them,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am telling you that, as a father, I&rsquo;m happy for my kids to go to school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he said state governments had the power to close schools on a case-by-case basis if there was an outbreak.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said if a school was to close today, it would likely not reopen until September at the earliest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means the disruption that would occur from the closure of schools around this country, make no mistake, would be severe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travel</p>
<p>The Prime Minister declared air travel itself was low-risk, but said the movement of people from place to place was a problem.</p>
<p>The Government hopes travel restrictions will reduce the number of cases of the virus imported into the country.</p>
<p>However, travel bans and a fall in tourist numbers are having a major economic impact.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said the aviation sector had been the &ldquo;hardest hit&rdquo; and this morning the Government announced measures to support airlines.</p>
<p>Some parts of the country with vulnerable residents, such as remote Indigenous communities, will be restricted to visitors. A list of sites is currently being prepared by states and territories.</p>
<p>Public transport and ridesharing services remain operating, but social distancing is recommended.</p>
