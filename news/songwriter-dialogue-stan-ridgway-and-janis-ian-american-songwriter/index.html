<p>A double interview with two great songwriters together, Janis Ian and Stan Ridgway, about use of gender designation in song, and other issues.</p>
<p>The following interview was conducted in 1999 though never before published in its entirety. I’d interviewed both Stan Ridgway and Janis Ian individually prior to this, and when the idea arose of speaking to them together, I said yes. I wasn’t sure what would happen, though.</p>
<p>That they are each a different kind of songwriter is obvious. But they are also quite alike in many ways; both are super intelligent, informed, and thoughtful. Both are also funny, and see the world in comic ways. Although they didn’t agree on all things, their bond as songwriters and performers forged an unspoken, respectful alliance, and sparked a compelling, dimensional conversation.</p>
<p>Stan Ridgway is best known for writing and recording ‘Mexican Radio’ during his stint with Wall of Voodoo, and has since created many brilliantly solo albums. Janis Ian first achieved fame when a teenager with the beautiful “Society’s Child,” about an interracial romance, before she wrote ‘At Seventeen,’ her most famous song. She recorded many albums after that of beautiful and poignant songs, and alone and with others wrote a lot of songs recorded by others.</p>
<p>We spoke the day after learning that Frank Sinatra died at Cedars Sinai hospital in L.A., not far from where we spoke. He’d been sick for a long time, so his death wasn’t unexpected, yet still represented the end of an era.</p>
<p>Also, it provided a natural bridge into this discussion about songwriting, and specificially about the late Sammy Cahn, who I’d interviewed a year earlier. Sammy wrote the lyrics to 87 songs recorded by Frank, and tailor-made each to fit the Sinatra persona. In this role, he played a big role in building the singer’s image as a swinging celebrant of women. There was poetry in Sammy’s lyrics, and great craft, but relatively little obscurity: Men were men, and women were any one of a number of things, much of which clashes with modern times.</p>
<p>There is an undeniable appeal to his lyrics, and certainly those melodies by Jimmy Van Heusen and others. But much of the use of specified gender in these songs seems oddly out of tune now, causing us to question if this school of songwriting was still appropriate.</p>
<p>Janis Ian: Writing those kinds of macho, male-oriented songs was real important at the time that Sammy Cahn and others were writing them. The old saw was that women could sing a song that was gender-directed to women — they could just switch the gender — but men would never sing a song that was gender-directed to men. Even now, when you make demos as a songwriter, you’re usually told to make male demos if you must choose, because women can hear a song when a man sings and translate it easier than a man hearing a woman sing.</p>
<p>Is gender specificity a priority for you in your writing?</p>
<p>Ian: Not really. I’ve always tried to write non-gender-specific songs, unless it’s a song like ‘Jesse’ that was written obviously to a male — though I have heard people think it was about a woman.</p>
<p>‘At Seventeen’, probably your most famous song, was written very much from a female orientation.</p>
<p>Ian: Well, I would argue with that. Fifty percent of the buying audience for that was male. I think that ‘At Seventeen’ could have done just as well if it was sung by a man.</p>
<p>Stan Ridgway: I bought it [laughs]</p>
<p>Bernie Taupin complained to me recently about how restrictive it is to write words these days for Elton John, because Elton wants every song to be universal and gender-neutral — no “he” or “she.”</p>
<p>Ian: There’s a big difference between Elton and Bernie in that Elton is onstage, so he is seeing the universal; he is seeing the archetype right in front of him, and Bernie is not. But I think I would have a hard time as a songwriter if my singer restricted me. That’s a valid complaint on Bernie’s part.</p>
<p>Ridgway: It’s a natural thing that happens when you write a lot of songs. You start to feel that you want to relate to everyone. I think you’re right, Janis, that you just start to naturally write in a more gender-neutral way as you progress.</p>
<p>Ian: The artist at the end of the day always strives for the universal…</p>
<p>Ridgway: …if you want to communicate. Otherwise you can be cutting out half of the population. But in the ear of Sinatra and Sammy Cahn, those kinds of songs had something else at work, a kind of postwar ennui…</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, the setting of a scene.</p>
<p>Ridgway: That kind of romance. I just love that era, and I love those kinds of songs. There are standards such as ‘Yesterdays’ that don’t have a gender in them.</p>
<p>Ian: But if you look at Johnny Mercer or anyone from that school, even the show tunes tend not to be gender-specific, unless they’re building a story. It’s hard to imagine the dustman in My Fair Lady singing something that isn’t gender-specific: “I’m getting to the church on time.” But you can also imagine Ethel Merman singing that song.</p>
<p>Stan, I’m surprised to hear you say that a songwriter’s songs become more universal as he or she matures, because so many of your songs tell stories and are very character-specific.</p>
<p>Ridgway: It was about building songs almost like theater pieces. In those songs there was a period where I was building stories and a scene and a specific place, and it was a little bit like making a film — a lot like that, almost writing a novel. And casting it like a movie. Casting myself in it, I would have a hard time sounding like a woman — certainly not a woman you would want to go out with [laughter]. I had to fashion a certain character, or at least I wanted to. A lot of that is natural. Songwriting springs from a place where you just have to do it.</p>
<p>Ian: Yeah, songs lead you. The trick is learning to accept that and then have the craft to bend them and mold them. But Stan is right: If you become an older writer — and by that I mean if you have someone who starts writing at thirteen and is now eighteen, even — your world broadens past keeping track of every single song you write and gloating over them. It broadens past creating a catalog. You broaden past your home town and your family. And the more your world broadens, the more you tend to have a universal outlook on things anyway, and you begin to feel like a citizen of the world rather than a prisoner of your times.</p>
<p>Your song ‘Hunger’ is entirely universal, except for that one line, “I hunger for you like a whore for a man to call a friend.”</p>
<p>Ian: When I wrote ‘Hunger’, I had written ‘Ride Me Like a Wave’, which ‘Hunger’ stands on. I had been listening to a lot of Brazilian music and a lot of older music, and I realized that in the past thirty years there’s not a lot of sex in songs. There’s a lot of dirt sex, a lot of “I want to do this and do that to you,” but not a lot of overt sexuality in songs, especially in American songs. English is a very hard language to use to write sexual imagery that isn’t just bludgeoning people. It really surprised me how uncomfortable the audience was, listening to those two songs. Because for me as a writer — and I think Stan probably agrees with this, judging from his recent work — there’s a point where it’s good for an audience to be uncomfortable. You want to shake them out of their complacency, but you don’t want to threaten them to the point where they stop listening. And you try to find avenues that allow you to do that.</p>
<p>In ‘Knife and Fork’, Stan, you pull off metaphor — “I’ll be the knife and fork/You be the plate” — that’s about as blunt as what Janis wrote in ‘Ride Me Like a Wave’.</p>
<p>Ian: It’s difficult to find metaphors for sex that are understandable and not offensive, and at the same time sexy.</p>
<p>Ridgway: It’s hard to write a song about sex, and when that one came along, I said, “My God, I’ve written a song about sex!” I’d never done that before. Not that way. I find writing songs about sex to be really difficult. What was that Boyz II Men song [sings]: “I want to take a shower with you”… [laughs]. I couldn’t believe it, just totally absurd. Songs fulfill certain rituals for people, but the subtlety of language is leaving us, so they cut to the chase very quickly.</p>
<p>Ian: It works for some people.</p>
<p>Ridgway: And the rest of us wonder if anybody even knows what we are talking about. This is a world filled with blasting sensations. People get numb. Sometimes the thing that really gets people’s attention is extreme sensitivity, or a sensitive statement that is expressed in a way that makes you think someone is opening up their soul. The problem is that people are asked to become personal writers so quickly that I think they confuse honest writing with telling the truth. And sometimes telling the truth is just a bore.</p>
<p>Ian: Yes, they confuse vulnerability with bleeding all over somebody. It’s irritating to hear someone go on and on about their navel.</p>
<p>Which takes us back to the idea of the universal song. It’s a real accomplishment to write something that’s specific in its details yet still transcends gender and other barriers.</p>
<p>Ian: It’s a real accomplishment because it means that you face your dragons and put them out into the sunlight and make that understandable to the people who are listening. But there is a lamentable tendency that goes back, unfortunately, to when ‘At Seventeen’ was a hit. There were a number of female singer/songwriters at that time who wrote about their therapy. Personally, I am not interested in those details.</p>
<p>Ridgway: It becomes voyeuristic.</p>
<p>Ian: Exactly. And as a writer you end up cannibalizing your own life rather than living. I think it’s brilliant to go back to the [old] songs and spend a while singing them, because you do tend to write from your own experience and your world starts to narrow. If you can go back to those writers who wrote with no thought of singing it themselves, you can train yourself out of it.</p>
<p>Ridgway: Absolutely. I’ve been going through all these old standards, old Sammy Cahn and Johnny Mandel songs, just singing them and getting them into my body. Singing songs by other writers is great: It’s like reading a great book or going to a museum. If you take that in, a lot of it starts to work its way into your work.</p>
<p>Ian: It’s a double-edged sword there, because if you’re only listening to garbage, that’s what you end up absorbing.</p>
<p>Ridgway: Garbage in, garbage out. That’s absolutely true.</p>
<p>Ian: I don’t know if you would agree, Stan, but that’s something that people really underestimate. If you can spend some time going back to the basics, whether it’s poetry or literature or songwriting, and put it into your body in some way, it makes all the difference. People forget how much of this stuff in the arts is mechanical; it’s body memory, it’s voice memory, it’s emotional memory. It’s much like teaching somebody guitar: You can teach somebody all you know, but there are times I go back to boom-chuck-boom-chuck. Because it reminds me of a lot of stuff that I’ve forgotten.

BETTER Times Will Come is not only a hopeful message but a project launched by singer-songwriter Janis Ian, who is urging fellow musicians to record her new song inspired by the death of renowned performer John Prine.</p>
<p>Ian, who got in touch with the Morning Star after a recent mention in this column, is providing free downloads and sheet music so that the song can be recorded by amateurs and professionals alike.</p>
<p>So far, there’s an up-tempo version from English punk/folk singer Frank Turner, a sweetly melancholic offering from Americana performer Janie Barnett and a deeply cool version from British blues man Trevor Sewell.</p>
<p>“John Prine’s death hit me very hard,” Ian says. “I felt so hopeless, so defeated, but I resolved not to give in to my despair.” She wrote the song in only two hours and recorded it on her ‘ancient’ phone, “complete with my dog barking in the background.”</p>
<p>Ian says there are now more than 50 musicians who&rsquo;ve recoded the song – and 16 Japanese ones to come, one Dutch and one by the San Diego Women’s Chorus. And several choral groups have been singing the song to thank emergency workers and carers. youtube.com/watch?v=Mr7rXgQwggk</p>
<p>Ian is encouraging others to film and record their own take on the piece. Free downloads and sheet music are at tinyurl.com/JIFree</p>
<p>In a new series of events from Seren Books, there’s a chance to see novelist David Llewellyn talking about his latest, A Simple Scale.</p>
<p>His story takes readers across Soviet Russia, to McCarthyite Hollywood and post-9/11 New York, as the secrets of the lives of two gay composers are uncovered. Llewellyn explores the points at which the personal and the political meet as narratives of love, death, deceit, the CIA, atomic bombs and classical music unfold.</p>
<p>Seren, the top publisher in English language titles from Wales, is hosting an interview with the author on May 22 at 7.30pm and there are half a dozen other events, with tickets at £5. There&rsquo;s a 30 per cent discount on the publisher’s website serenbooks.com/seren-stay-home-series</p>
<p>With all actors having recorded their lines in isolation at home, The Lawrence Batley Theatre in Huddersfield is airing new play The Understudy in two parts on May 20 and 27.</p>
<p>Featuring Sheila Atim, Russell Tovey, Stephen Fry among the cast, this is the story of an underdog — a failed husband, a failing father, a failing actor — who faces the impossible choice between stealing the show and stealing another man’s wife.</p>
<p>Tickets are £5 and proceeds go to a number of theatre charities and the website announces that “this is a general admission area; you can sit anywhere you like.” I favour the big armchair by the window, though I may relocate to the sofa next week. understudyplay.com</p>
<p>London’s Barbican has a tribute to legendary Afrobeat drummer Tony Allen, who died at the end of April. The career retrospective is a playlist curated by Strut Records, covering the breadth of music performed by Allen, starting with his work with Fela Kuti and ending with his final track with Gorillaz. open.spotify.com/playlist/1tAPVdgjdIzzU3UrXnJRAa?si=NDpw9PtrQQ2OcnHcCtEIsQ</p>
<p>Also on the Barbican site is material relating to the exhibition Masculinities: Liberation through Photography, which looks at the ways masculinity has been coded, performed and socially constructed from the 1960s to the present day.</p>
<p>There are several videos, articles and a playlist on the same theme. Go to barbican.org.uk and search “Masculinities.”</p>
<p>The OperaUpClose company would have been touring with a new English production of Madam Butterfly this spring. Undaunted by the lockdown, they’ve created the Coffee Break Concert online.</p>
<p>The 20-minute shows are available for a month. with the first from soprano Sarah Minns and harpist Mary Reid. operaupclose.com/at-home-with-operaupclose

Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks is working on a film based on the band&rsquo;s 1975 hit song Rhiannon</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Birthday, May 26: American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks (1948 - )</p>
<p>Stevie Nicks has been spending her lockdown time working on a film inspired by Fleetwood Mac&rsquo;s 1975 hit Rhiannon.</p>
<p>Nicks told Rolling Stone magazine she flagged an interest in the project - said to based on the classic Welsh myths that inspired the hit song - before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What all we have right now, if you&rsquo;re home in quarantine, is time, unless you&rsquo;re taking care of kids. So, really, you could do anything that you&rsquo;ve been wanting to do your whole life,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Born Stephanie Lynn Nicks in Phoenix, Arizona in 1948, she was given a handcrafted guitar at an early age by her grandfather, a country singer who she performed with while writing her own music.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s she joined Lindsey Buckingham in his psychedelic rock band Fritz, replacing the original lead singer, and dropped out of university soon after.</p>
<p>Fritz opened concerts for Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin before disbanding in 1972.</p>
<p>Nicks and then-partner Buckingham kept writing as a duo, releasing their album Buckingham Nicks the following year.</p>
<p>They joined Fleetwood Mac in 1975 after Mick Fleetwood approached Buckingham, who insisted he and Nicks were a package deal.</p>
<p>Nicks had already written the tracks Rhiannon and Landslide, which featured on the band&rsquo;s self-titled album that year and brought worldwide success.</p>
<p>Following albums included the Grammy Award-winning Rumours (1977), Tusk (1979) and Tango in the Night (1987).</p>
<p>Nicks, of the gypsy-boho flowing skirts, shawls and boots, also found success as a solo artist, releasing albums including Bella Donna (1981), The Wild Heart (1983) and Rock a Little (1985).</p>
<p>Australia saw Nicks performing with Bob Dylan and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers during their 1986 tour. On her return to the US, she sought treatment for cocaine addiction and was prescribed a tranquiliser which she says &ldquo;stole&rdquo; eight years of her life.</p>
<p>Fleetwood Mac reunited in 1997, two decades after releasing Rumours, and was inducted into the Rock and Hall of Fame in 1998.</p>
<p>In 2019 Nicks, the solo artist, was inducted into the Hall of Fame by Harry Styles, who joined her onstage for a duet of her 1981 smash hit Stop Draggin&rsquo; My Heart Around.

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Janis-Jolin.jpg?fit=876%2C560&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
We have taken a trip down the Far Out archives and unearthed this powerful footage of the great Janis Joplin performing ‘Piece Of My Heart’ from 1969 live concert in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The show, which took place during Joplin’s April European tour, included a two-night residency at Frankfurt’s famous Jahrhunderthalle venue on what would turn out to be her final ever run of dates on the continent before her premature death a year later.</p>
<p>‘Piece Of My Heart’ was originally performed by Aretha Franklin‘s elder sister, Erma, in 1967 and was written by Bert Burns and Jerry Ragavoy. Burns had originally pleaded with Van Morrison to take the song, but the Irishman politely declined and insisted he instead wanted to focus on material which he has written. The original version was a reasonable chart success that made the Top 10 of the Billboard R&amp;B chart. However, it wasn’t until Joplin got her distinct tones on the track that it would become the familiar favourite we all know and love.</p>
<p>Just a year after the original was released, Joplin along with her band Big Brother &amp; The Holding Company, would record a cover of the track which featured on their hugely successful Cheap Thrills LP. The vocal arrangement could not be any different from Franklin’s and, if you listen to the two side-by-side, you would struggle to come to the conclusion that the two now-iconic musicians are singing the same song.</p>
<p>The two tracks were so different that when Erma Franklin heard Joplin’s cover on the radio she barely recognised the song. Franklin courteously said in a 1973 interview: “Her version is so different from mine that I really don’t resent it too much.”</p>
<p>‘Piece Of My Heart’ would become Joplin’s biggest hit while she was still alive and cemented 1969 as her breakout year, with the world knowing full well who she was before the year was out. The singer had gone from being an obscure San Franciso-based singer-songwriter to a household name thanks to her success with her band Big Brother in just a matter of years. Joplin then broke free into her own right and fastly became one of the defining voices of the decade as it was beginning to draw to a close and was set to dominate the 1970s.</p>
<p>Tragically, however, Joplin would succumb to an accidental overdose on heroin in 1970 which cut one of the most distinctive and pioneering musical careers painfully short. It was soon after her passing that more rare recordings would be released posthumously, a body of work that further cemented her legacy as a one of a kind talent.</p>
<p>Take some time out and watch this spine-tingling performance in Frankfurt of ‘Piece Of My Heart’ below.

<h3 id="listen-to-janis-joplins-striking-isolated-vocals-on-move-over">&ldquo;Listen to Janis Joplin’s striking isolated vocals on ‘Move Over’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Janis-Jolin.jpg?fit=876%2C560&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Taking a visit down the Far Out archives, we’ve discovered a glorious isolated vocal recording of the incredible Janis Joplin performing her wonderous hit ‘Move Over’.</p>
<p>‘Move Over’ featured on her much-adored second album, Pearl, which would be released just two months following her death which meant, of course, that Joplin sadly never lived to see the song and the album become the staple of any good record collection. The record, which sold four million copies and hit number one on the charts, all tragically after Joplin passed away.</p>
<p>The song arrived like a piece of art, a project that was of immense pride to Joplin as she was known primarily for her voice alone rather than her songwriting brilliance which is on full flow on this track. It’s the only number on Pearl that was penned solely by Joplin.</p>
<p>Joplin appeared on The Dick Cavett Show on June 25, 1970, to perform ‘Move Over’, stated that the song was about men and specifies it is about the sort of man who tells you your relationship is over but equally won’t let you move on.</p>
<p>It’s a song that clearly carried a lot of emotional weight for Joplin and used it as a mechanism for airing the personal issues she was dealing with at the time. The song was delivered as a perfect opportunity to have a subtle swipe at her problematic ex.</p>
<p>The legendary singer would only perform the track on four occasions before she would, unfortunately, succumb to addiction and accidentally overdose on heroin in 1970, an incident which cut one of the most distinctive and pioneering musical careers painfully short. It was soon after her passing that more rare recordings would be released posthumously, a body of work that further cemented her legacy as a one of a kind talent.</p>
<p>Florence Welch detailed how much Joplin inspired her as an artist because of how she managed to turn her turbulent personal struggles into something beautiful with her music, a discussion that perfectly summarises the late singer’s talent: “She was so vulnerable, self-conscious and full of suffering. She tore herself apart yet on stage she was totally different. She was so unrestrained, so free, so raw and she wasn’t afraid to wail.”</p>
<p>She continued: “It seems to me the suffering and intensity of her performance go hand in hand. There was always a sense of longing, of searching for something. I think she really sums up the idea that soul is about putting your pain into something beautiful.”</p>
<p>On this isolated vocal version of the track, Joplin’s voice sounds striking and through her voice, she manages to navigate the listener to this emotion which you can viscerally feel travelling straight from her heart, to her lungs and into her voice which is amplified further when you hear it isolated.</p>
<p>Enjoy, below.

<h3 id="revisit-janis-joplins-epic-cover-of-jazz-standard-summertime-from-back-in-1969">&ldquo;Revisit Janis Joplin’s epic cover of jazz standard ‘Summertime’ from back in 1969&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Janis-Jolin.jpg?fit=876%2C560&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
There are few artists who can hold a torch to the vocal power of a small girl from Fort Worth, Texas, AKA Janis Joplin. The impassioned singer soon became the face of the counterculture movement with her refusal to conform to any pigeonhole she was put in.</p>
<p>It’s part of what endeared her to the hearts and minds of countless music lovers. But aside from her unwavering attitude and her powerful lungs, Joplin was revered for bringing jazz back into the charts and into the collective consciousness.</p>
<p>Originally composed by George Gershwin for the opera Porgy and Bess the track is largely regarded as Gershwin’s finest work and has seen countless artists cover the track. From Billie Holiday to Sam Cooke, to Ella Fitzgerald and, of course, to Janis Joplin and her band Big Brother and the Holding Company.</p>
<p>Only released as part of a live album, the track remained in the band’s live set up until Joplin left the group to pursue her solo career. In truth, much of the song’s success with the band resides in Joplin’s passionate and unique vocal delivery.</p>
<p>It is this delivery which is encapsulated in her performance of the song which you can find below. There’s surprisingly little information about the performance despite the huge viewing numbers but what we do know is that Joplin approaches it as she did everything else in her life—with unbridled vigour.</p>
<p>Joplin was once quoted as saying: “If I hold back, I’m no good. I’m no good. I’d rather be good sometimes, than holding back all the time.” It’s hard to see how anything was held back in this performance.</p>
<p>The track may be rooted in black culture but perhaps the finest performance of Gerge Gershwin’s ‘Summertime’ comes for a little white girl from Texas and her big lungs.
