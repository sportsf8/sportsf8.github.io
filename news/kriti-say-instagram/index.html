<p>The death of 34-year-old Sushant Singh Rajput has shocked the Indian film industry with fans taking to social media to express their condolences. From Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli, many prominent personalities have written heartfelt notes to pay their tribute to Sushant. However, three actresses, who Sushant reportedly dated, have not said anything yet on his sad demise. They are Ankita Lokhande, Kriti Sanon and Rhea Chakraborty.</p>
<p>Sushant had made his TV debut with Ekta Kapoor’s Pavitra Rishta opposite Ankita Lokhande. The show became a rage of sorts as its popularity soared. Both Sushant and Ankita fell in love with each other. However, six years after dating each other, the couple called off their relationship in 2016.</p>
<p>Ankita has not posted anything on her Instagram, where the actress is pretty active. According to India TV, when its reporter contacted her for a reaction, she said ‘what’ before hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>Ankita’s last Instagram post is about her TikTok video that she shared on the Facebook-owned platform on Saturday. She has also not posted anything about Sushant on her Insta story until 6.40 PM on Sunday.</p>
<p>After splitting with Ankita, Sushant was romantically linked with Kriti Sanon. Although both of them never publicly spoke about their relationship, India Today had once quoted Kriti as saying, “Sushant and I are friends and we recently met at Dino’s [Dinesh Vijan] wedding. I’m fond of him and we are really good friends. It’s always going to be like that.”</p>
<p>Both Sushant and Kriti also featured in the film Raabta. Kriti would frequently post photos with Sushant during their dating period but most of those posts appear to have disappeared from her timeline now.</p>
<p>Kriti too has not posted anything on Instagram in the hours following Sushant’s tragic death.</p>
<p>Sushant was last rumoured to be dating Rhea Chakraborty, who made her film debut with Mere Dad Ki Maruti in 2013 before featuring in films such as Sonali Cable and Jalebi. Wishing Sushant on his birthday in January this year, Rhea had written, “Happy birthday to the most beautiful ” supermassive black hole “ that is known to mankind !</p>
<p>Shine on you crazy diamond.”</p>
<p>A native of Patna in Bihar, Sushant is survived by his father and three sisters. His Mom had passed away in 2002.

<p><img src="https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/0p9qcp4b1ywjblbt_1591958301.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg" alt="img">
Just days before the release of the much-awaited film Gulabo Sitabo, co-stars Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana dropped a fun challenge to their friends and fans. The challenge is to say the tongue twister &ldquo;Gulabo ki khatar patar se, titar witar Sitabo. Sitabo ke agar magar se uthal puthal Gulabo&hellip;&rdquo; five times without making any mistake. This challenge given by Ayushmann and Amitabh has kept celebrities such as Varun Dhawan, Yami Gautam, Vicky Kaushal and more quite busy.</p>
<p>Recently, Bollywood actor Kriti Sanon, who was challenged by Vicky Kaushal, also went on to try the Gulabo Sitabo tongue twister but it seems like she was able to complete it because of her adorable pet. Kriti Sanon took to Instagram to share a video of her doing the tongue twister along with her pet, Phoebe. Yes, she said the tongue twister by playing with Phoebe until when Phoebe decided to interrupt her by licking her mouth.</p>
<p>She then went on to tell her fans and netizens that the film Gulabo Sitabo has released on Amazon Prime Video. She also went on to tell them to stop practising the tongue twister and watch the film at home.</p>
<p>Along with the post, she also wrote, “I think Phoebe thought I had gone crazy but still found me cute… Here u go @vickykaushal09 &hellip; I would have done a few more had she not licked me. Tonight’s plan- Gulabo Sitabo on @primevideoin&hellip; Two of my favourite actors @amitabhbachchan sir and @ayushmannk and one of the best directors we have here @shoojitsircar da… Don’t Miss It!!

<h3 id="best-beauty-instagrams-of-the-week-kriti-sanon-and-malaika-arora">&ldquo;Best beauty Instagrams of the week: Kriti Sanon and Malaika Arora&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.vogue.in/photos/5ed0c523b107db5a4f641181/16:9/w_1920,c_limit/kriti%20sanon%20makeup%20hairstyle%20best%20beauty%20instagrams.jpg" alt="img">
Celebrities are proving more than ever, that Instagram is a great place to celebrate all the most authentic parts of your days. Whether you&rsquo;re trying a new bold makeup trend or would rather spend time sans a beauty routine, it&rsquo;s all fair game—just ask Kylie Jenner and Kriti Sanon.</p>
<p>Kylie Jenner and Karisma Kapoor play with fun eye makeup looks</p>
<p>Since wearing a bold lipstick might not work in today&rsquo;s mask-wearing days, fun and inventive eye makeup has gotten really important. If you&rsquo;re looking for inspiration, look to Kylie Jenner, who wore pink eyeshadow and a perfect cat eye for her latest selfie session. “I&rsquo;m pretty good at this makeup thing,” she confirmed in her caption. Ariana Grande—who made graphic, abstract eyeliner cool in her newest video ‘Rain On Me’—showed behind the scenes photos of the white opaque makeup while on set. Karisma Kapoor went with a more subtle approach—lining her eyes with a dark green eyeliner, which she smudged around the edges. She even went without her signature red pout.</p>
<p>Malaika Arora and Kriti Sanon stick with fuss-free looks</p>
<p>As the lockdown continues, some celebrities are giving up on every form of makeup—eschewing even just a slick of mascara and lip balm for totally clean skin and bedhead hair. Hailey Bieber, who has been focusing on her skincare routine in quarantine, showed off the fruits of her labour in a sun-kissed photo that put her glass-like skin in full focus. Katrina Kaif and Ananya Panday took the same route, letting their flushed cheeks take centerstage. Malaika Arora, who is usually a fan of a full glam look, is letting her guard down through this time. “Yeah my bebo ,, I have swapped my #gym wear for kaftans , blow dry hair for messy hair n make up for no make up in lockdown,” she shared, referring to Kareena Kapoor Khan&rsquo;s love for bare skin and comfortable loungewear.</p>
<p>Kriti Sanon shared a photo of her new blunt lob, a product of a quarantine haircut by her sister, while Priyanka Chopra Jonas shared two photos of herself sunbathing—a posed photo with sunglasses, and then a candid of her covering her face from the sun with a scarf.</p>
