<h3 id="a-parenting-youtuber-faced-backlash-for-rehoming-her-adopted-son-with-autism-after-monetizing-his-videos-this-is-how-the-story-unfolded">&ldquo;A parenting YouTuber faced backlash for &lsquo;rehoming&rsquo; her adopted son with autism after monetizing his videos. This is how the story unfolded.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5ecfe5b3988ee3235d39d135?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Over the last six years, Myka Stauffer has become a popular parenting YouTuber and lifestyle influencer, boasting over 700,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Since starting her channel in 2014, Stauffer has shared parenting tips, home organization tutorials, updates on her pregnancies and children, and her &ldquo;adoption journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a series of videos, the YouTuber and her husband revealed their plans to adopt, updated subscribers on their process of navigating an international adoption, and shared their son&rsquo;s progress as he adapted to his new home and family.</p>
<p>In a recent video, the influencer and her husband told viewers that they had placed the boy in a new home that could better address his medical needs.</p>
<p>Since posting the video, Stauffer has received intense backlash online, with critics questioning the monetization of her lifestyle, her parenting abilities, and her lack of transparency online.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Since founding her YouTube channel in 2014, Myka Stauffer has established herself as a popular parenting vlogger, lifestyle influencer, and international adoption advocate. The one-time mother of five from Columbus, Ohio racked up a dedicated 700,000-subscriber following with her home organizing tutorials, parenting and homeschooling tips, and an emotional video series chronicling her adoption journey and the realities of parenting a child with developmental disabilities and autism. Her digital brand proved to be lucrative, as she secured high-profile partnerships and sponsorships with companies like Danimals and Dreft.</p>
<p>Stauffer&rsquo;s most recent content, however, has thrust her into the spotlight beyond her select YouTube following. In her latest video, she and her husband, James, revealed that they were no longer parents of five, but rather parents of four. Nearly three years after adopting a son, Huxley, from China — and sharing updates on his progress in monetized videos — they announced their decision to place him in a new home that would be better equipped to address his medical needs.</p>
<p>Since posting the video on May 26, the couple has received intense backlash online from critics accusing them of &lsquo;giving away&rsquo; their child, exploitation, and problematic parenting.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a timeline of the YouTuber&rsquo;s content creation that stirred up controversy online.

<h3 id="a-mom-shared-how-having-autism-helps-her-parent-her-sons-with-the-same-diagnosis">&ldquo;A Mom Shared How Having Autism Helps Her Parent Her Sons With the Same Diagnosis&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OdZLOkR8jyXQ_T26X1bnBA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD0xMjgw/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/15nildjLXxy3NhesM5e5fA--~B/aD0xOTYxO3c9MTk2MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/popsugar_moms_359/2041273b6c7d858e250485c8dbbe4ee5" alt="img">
Mom of two Rebekah McClelland learned that she had Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome as an adult in 2014. As a mother, she&rsquo;s been dedicated to raising her sons - who have also been diagnosed with autism - with the understanding that it doesn&rsquo;t hold them back in any way. For Rebekah, learning that she had Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome was the answer she had been looking for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the key, the answer, the why and the why not,&rdquo; she told POPSUGAR. &ldquo;My oldest son had been diagnosed shortly before. I was very open with him about what it meant when he was diagnosed and we were actively learning and growing with it. I remember one day very clearly: we were sitting and doing his homework and I had to get up to stop the dishwasher so I could focus. My kiddo looked up, cocked his head to one side and said, &lsquo;Momma, you do a lot of things like me. I&rsquo;m pretty sure you&rsquo;re autistic, too.&rsquo; And then looked back down at his paper like he&rsquo;d asked me what was for dinner. It was the beginning of a lot of realizations for me. It was also so much relief. I had always known I was different. Now I could understand it and learn how to move forward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Rebekah wants to clear up some misconceptions about individuals with autism, noting that, of course, people on the spectrum still have plenty of empathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My biggest pet peeve is others may think we lack empathy,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;We are capable at times of shutting it down but only because when we feel a situation we feel it BIG. Once I was at a school basketball game where one of the boys fell and hit his head. His mother got up and went calmly to him and then calmly back to her seat. I, on the other hand, couldn&rsquo;t stop my full-body sobs. We feel everything immensely bigger than a typical person: fear, pain, empathy, love, joy, everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, Rebekah wants others to know that although people with autism might need to socialize in smaller doses, they still very much enjoy being around people.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it feels like to hate the tag in my shirt, to be overwhelmed in a crowd, feel confused by a social situation, or be unable to focus because of a continuous sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true that we may need it in smaller doses and it is much more enjoyable with people that we know and are comfortable with,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But many of us actually enjoy it very much. I have put a lot of work into my social abilities. I learn specific patterns of those that I interact with: body language, language cues, and things that I can or cannot say to them. I keep running lists for everyone and access them as I need them. It sounds robotic in a way, but it is used because I care deeply about people and want to make them comfortable and happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Given her diagnosis, Rebekah can understand some of the struggles her sons have gone through, whether it&rsquo;s a reaction to being overstimulated or managing their feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it feels like to hate the tag in my shirt, to be overwhelmed in a crowd, feel confused by a social situation, or be unable to focus because of a continuous sound,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Most times it means that when they are experiencing those things that I can be extremely understanding. There are other times that we are all frustrated, and it&rsquo;s not an uncommon thing to hear &lsquo;I&rsquo;m having sensory issues&rsquo; in our house. We are pretty good about giving space/quiet when it&rsquo;s heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebekah is also able to share &ldquo;hacks&rdquo; with her sons when challenges crop up, as she&rsquo;s learned to manage some of her personal struggles over the years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Autism tends to come with a lot of rigidity in order to reduce anxiety but we all work very hard to not be rigid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These hacks make little things that may seem impossible possible,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is also where the ingenuity comes in. My brain thinks in patterns and problem solves in an extremely logical way. So when new things pop up, I am immediately working away on what the solution will look like. All of this takes adaptation. I&rsquo;m sure my boys are tired of hearing me say that it will be the key to their success, but I will keep saying it. We live in a world that we are extremely sensitive to and that will be constantly changing. Autism tends to come with a lot of rigidity to reduce anxiety but we all work very hard to not be rigid. A situation comes up and we are immediately looking for what our options are. And then we move forward. Simple, but it takes practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although no two people with autism are alike - it&rsquo;s a spectrum, after all - being able to understand what her children may be experiencing helps Rebekah navigate challenging situations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am grateful that in a lot of cases I know how they are feeling,&rdquo; she shared. &ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t exactly alike, most people on the spectrum aren&rsquo;t. But it at least gives us a jumping off point in a tough situation. We talk about everything: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking/feeling this,&rsquo; &lsquo;I need this right now,&rsquo; and &lsquo;This would make it easier/harder for me.&rsquo; One of my biggest hopes for them is that they are self-aware and self-reliant. My personal goal for each day is that my children feel loved, safe, and understood. And sometimes that means other things get let go. &quot;

Welcome back to this week&rsquo;s Influencer Dashboard newsletter!</p>
<p>As always, this is Amanda Perelli (from home) with a weekly update on what&rsquo;s new in the business of influencers and creators.</p>
<p>This week, my colleague Dan Whateley and I published four influencer media kits from creators who are popular on YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>
<p>Brand sponsorships are one of the main ways influencers earn money — and the first thing advertisers ask for during a pitch is a media kit.</p>
<p>But what does an influencer media kit look like?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a document that creators use to show a brand the need-to-know information on their digital business and the impact they can have. The media kits we published — which were the exact ones the influencers used — range from 8 to 24 pages, and include audience demographics and rates, all wrapped up into one digital booklet that reflects what the influencer has to offer.</p>
<p>These are the 4 creators we spoke to:</p>
<p>Roberto Blake: 445,000 YouTube subscribers. Blake is a tech YouTuber who shared his 11-page media kit in February, which features a scale of the different rates he charges for a collaboration.</p>
<p>Marina Mogilko: over 2 million YouTube subscribers. Mogilko runs three YouTube channels: language, technology, and business. She shared her 24-page media kit in May that breaks down case studies of past sponsorships.</p>
<p>Macy Mariano: 105,000 Instagram followers. She said media kits are &ldquo;a good way to express who you are and what you&rsquo;ve done so they can see your past and current work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Girls in the Valley: a TikTok collab group with over 10 million followers. They use this 8-page document to pitch their collab-house group to brands.</p>
<p>See the landing page with all of the media kits, here.</p>
<p>You can read most of the articles here by subscribing to BI Prime. And if this is your first time reading Influencer Dashboard, subscribe to the newsletter here.</p>
<p>You can now text the music artist Eminem on his &ldquo;personal&rdquo; phone number: 313-666-7440.</p>
<p>The rapper is using the text-marketing app Community, which allows him to promote a new line of merchandise he&rsquo;s releasing.</p>
<p>Dan broke down what you should know about how Community works and why the invite-only platform has taken off recently among celebrities and influencers alike.</p>
<p>Community gives each celebrity a unique phone number that they send out to their followers. Fans can sign up to receive texts from a public figure like Eminem by filling out an informational form, similar to how a brand or media company might ask customers to opt in to receiving promotional emails or newsletters.</p>
<p>Check out exactly what Community is and how influencers are using it as a marketing tool, here.</p>
<p>Ryan Scribner started his YouTube channel in 2016 by talking to a camera that he attached to the steering wheel of his car.</p>
<p>Now he runs a channel with 623,000 subscribers all about investing apps, stock market advice, and other personal-finance tips.</p>
<p>I spoke to Scribner who shared that his YouTube channel earned $220,000 in 2019.</p>
<p>Outside of YouTube ad revenue, Scribner said he relies on money earned through course sales, the stock market membership site he runs, and affiliate commission.</p>
<p>Read more on his digital business and how he built it, here.</p>
<p>As the demand from advertisers for sponsored posts falls, many influencers have decided to lower their rates.</p>
<p>Dan reported that 22% of influencers have dropped their prices for sponsored content in recent weeks, according to a new report by the influencer-marketing platform Mavrck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would estimate that the average macro influencer would reduce their rate if it means they are building a long-term partnership with a great, strategic brand,&rdquo; said Mae Karwowski, founder and CEO of the influencer-marketing platform Obviously.</p>
<p>A drop in sponsored-post opportunities has forced many influencers to lean into alternative revenue streams, like merchandise, direct-to-consumer products, and membership programs.</p>
<p>Read more on the reported drop in rates, here.</p>
<p>Seeking nominations: Top investors in the influencer industry</p>
<p>Dan and I are putting together a power list of the top venture capital and investment professionals funding the companies focused on digital creators.</p>

Sofia Richie is 21 and reportedly single – finally! Who can we Gossip Genie her with? My first pick is Noah Centineo (he seems to be single, too). Come on. This would be great.</p>
<p>Page Six continues to have the scoop on Mary-Kate and Olivier Sarkozy, the latest story being that MK didn’t want to quarantine with Olivier’s family in Bridgehampton (his family includes his children, ex-wife, and mother). So now he’s living with his ex Charlotte Bernard, which a source chalks up to a cultural difference, which is a continuation of the “French ugly” story from earlier in the week. To be clear, there’s no disagreement about the ex (Charlotte attended their wedding and has stayed overnight at their home) but MK didn’t want to indefinitely quarantine with her. According to the source, as soon MK left the home in April, the family moved in and are enjoying “long lunches” while MK is renting yet another home in the Hamptons. But who gets custody of the bowls of cigarettes?</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve read the story about a YouTuber/mommy influencer who has rehomed her adopted son due to what she says are developmental issues that overwhelmed her family. I’m not going to assess her parenting (or lack thereof) but rather the business aspect of it because she works with brands like Fabletics and Good America, sponsorships that are based on the audience she has built up for her posts about parenting (the children often appear in the posts). So does she have a fiscal responsibility to this boy, seeing as his adoption was used to build her audience and make her money? He, essentially, was as a branding tool and she has recent photos of him up; if the YouTube series about his adoption is still live, she’s making money from those views. Now some would say that maybe that money went to his care, but kids are not meant to be financially independent – they don’t get a bill at the end of their childhood. And this isn’t a question of this one family but all of the parents who are using their kids for content – are they splitting the proceeds? Will there one day be mini-influencer financial protection laws like they have for child actors? (The photo is of Sara Foster; it’s a sponsored post about her daughter’s birthday party.)</p>
<p>Kristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler’s divorce continues with some vague story about him being “shady”– is this a warning shot? Maybe she has something on him she’s holding onto if he doesn’t play nice.</p>
<p>If you think about it, Liam Gallagher has the same issue with the tabloids as the British royal family – invasion of privacy concerning their children. Whose strategy is more effective?

The boys were about to age out of the foster care system — so Sia adopted them</p>
<p>In case we needed a reason to love her even more, Sia just revealed that she’s a mom — after she quietly adopted two teenage boys last year. And her reasoning for doing so makes it even better.</p>
<p>Sia, who is 44, opened up about her decision to grow her family in an interview with SiriusXM’s “The Morning Mash Up.”</p>
<p>“I actually adopted two sons last year,” she revealed. “They were both 18 — they’re both 19 years old now. They were aging out of the foster care system. Yeah, and I love them.”</p>
<p>According to Social Race Media, more than 23,000 kids turn 18 and “age out” of the foster care system every year. And when they turn 18, 20 percent of those kids become instantly homeless. Less than 3 percent of kids who age out of the system ever earn a college degree, and only half have gainful employment by the time they turn 24. 25 percent of kids who age out suffer from PTSD, often untreated.</p>
<p>The fact that Sia saw two kids facing those kinds of bleak statistics and decided to step in, giving them a loving family home forever? That makes her an angel — no questions asked.</p>
<p>Later in the interview, Sia opened up a little bit about how she and her sons are handling being in quarantine together amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“They are both finding it pretty difficult, one more so than the other,” she said. “But they’re both doing things that are really good for them right now, that are really helpful. They’re really doing a lot of educational stuff that’s good for them.”</p>
<p>We all feel that. Quarantine is hard on all of us, but we’re really glad to know that Sia’s sons now have a safe, loving place to be during this crisis.</p>
<p>Before making the news of the adoptions public, Sia hinted at having plans to expand her family. She tweeted at Dasani, the teenage boy featured in the HBO documentary, Foster, saying she’d like to open her home to him. She’s since deleted that tweet.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Sia married filmmaker Erik Anders Lang in 2014, but in 2016, they announced their split, saying they were going their separate ways but planned to remain friends. Since then, the “Chandelier” singer has been pretty open about her decision to stay single, even when joking about things like asking her friend Diplo to be a friend-with-benefits, since she doesn’t plan on having a boyfriend ever again.</p>
<p>What can we say? We stan.</p>
