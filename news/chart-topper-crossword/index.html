<p>His distinctive nasal tone and body of work is known to millions, so it may come as a surprise that Bob Dylan has never had a No 1 single before now — and even more of a surprise that his first chart topper is a 17-minute track about the assassination of JFK.</p>
<p>The folk singer and Nobel laureate has come close to No 1 with some arguably more memorable songs: Like a Rolling Stone and Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35 made it to No 2 on the Hot 100 in 1965 and 1966 respectively.</p>
<p>The release of Murder Most Foul prompted amazement and some amusement. It sold 10,000 digital downloads in its first week, was streamed 1.8 million times, and entered at No 1

<p>The surprise honours cap a remarkable year for the 19-year-old, real name Toni Watson, which was essentially fuelled off the strength of one hit.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Dance Monkey – with its infectious Euro-pop beat and off-kilter vocals – broke Kylie Minogue&rsquo;s 32-year record for single with most weeks at No.1 by a female Australian artist after claiming its 10th consecutive week atop the ARIA singles chart. It has now overtaken Justice Crew&rsquo;s Que Sera for the most weeks at No.1 for any Australian artist. The song has also topped charts in the UK and much of Europe.

Stockport quintet Blossoms are quite the pop chameleons. They emerged in 2014 as a bob-cut, black-clad indie-psychedelic band, but by 2018 and their second album, Cool Like You, they were a shiny pop thing with bouncy electro keyboards and big choruses. The new – and second chart-topping – album Foolish Loving Spaces sees them shapeshift once again, ramping up the pop and funk to emerge as a shamelessly joyous and melodious mix of bubblegum, Abba and Talking Heads.</p>
<p>There are shades of the latter band’s Remain in Light era as Blossoms take the stage, their five-piece lineup augmented by percussionists, backing vocals and a second guitarist. They end up with 12 people on stage, and guitarist Josh Dewhurst doubling on zither. Their wardrobe has undergone a similar outlandish expansion. The polo necks and medallions of their early Pink Floyd look have now completely given way to very long hairstyles, inscrutable moustaches, brightly coloured flares and garish shirts that could double as women’s blouses.</p>

<p>Vocalist Tom Ogden sports the pièce de résistance, a pink trouser suit paired with the sort of scarf worn by 70s air hostesses. His stage mannerisms are best described as flouncy. When a gruff voice yells: “Love yer suit, Tom,” he quips, “Cheers babe.” It all comes across like a fiendish way of subverting any remaining hints that Blossoms are a northern lad band and, in songs, the 26-year-old pours out his heart in a way that blokes of his age rarely do in pubs. There are songs about love, unrequited love and, well, more love, occasionally with bone-dry humour. The exuberant Romance, Eh? sounds as if a mate wrote the title on a beer mat and said: “Write a great song called that, then.” And they have.</p>
<p>They are back in their home town – this is the first of two special nights showcasing the album – and the Stockport audience responds in kind, rising to their feet for the lovely The Keeper and My Vacant Days and singing sections of Falling for Someone a cappella. Blossoms return with a clutch of oldies, but sound like a band whose mission is to outstrip their former selves.</p>
<p>• At Stockport Plaza 12 February. Then touring.

Exclusive: Jeremy Marou - one half of band Busby Marou - reveals his heartache at witnessing sea level rise in his father’s homeland</p>
<p>Chart topper Jeremy Marou says it&rsquo;s time for him to speak up on climate impacts in Torres Strait</p>
<p>Jeremy Marou hadn’t been back to the Torres Straits for 12 years – long enough to meet Tom Busby in a Rockhampton pub, form a band called Busby Marou, sign to a major label and produce four albums.</p>
<p>But a trip with Busby to Murray Island in June, and then another on his own last month to tiny Masig Island, has shaken the 36-year-old musician.</p>
<p>“They are losing their burial sites, streets and shops,” Marou tells Guardian Australia.</p>

<p>“Dead set I don’t know how many times I almost came to tears. It just blew me away how serious the rising sea levels are affecting the straits.”</p>
<p>Marou has has been forced to a conclusion that he struggles to articulate. A duty to become a voice.</p>
<p>“I guess now I have been up there, I’m feeling it’s expected of me. It’s a role I need to take – I need to step up. We have stayed away from being a political band, but this affects my homeland and my family,” he says.</p>
<p>Marou’s father, Segar Marou, left Murray Island in his early 20s and settled in Rockhampton, where Jeremy was born. As a child, there were the occasional trips back home to Murray Island.</p>
<p>But Marou’s father died young. Although seemingly strong and healthy, the 53-year-old collapsed during a family game of touch football. Marou was 19.</p>
<p>Busby Marou’s fourth studio album – The Great Divide – was released in September. The band’s previous album – Postcards from the Shell House – debuted at number one in the ARIA album chart.</p>
<p>In June, the band went to Murray Island to get closer to Marou’s musical influences, and record a film to go with a new single, Naba Norem – meaning “let’s go to the reef” in the Meriam language.</p>
<p>They are watching their islands fading away. It’s like a cancer eating at them. Jeremy Marou</p>
<p>“It’s not a coral cay so the impacts [of sea level rise] aren’t as bad there, but my uncles pointed out some areas to me where my dad used to play, and where there used to be grassy banks. It was mind blowing.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later and Marou was back in the straits, working on a Queensland government project to find ways that tiny Masig Island could adopt lower-emissions technologies or renewable energy.</p>
<p>His role is “not to be a guy from a band or a bureaucrat”, he says, but to be a friendly face to break down a few barriers.</p>
<p>“That was a real eye opener to see how it’s affecting those low lying islands,” he says.</p>
<p>“One old guy just said they were becoming sad, and they were having mental health issues because they are watching their islands fading away. It’s like a cancer eating at them. It breaks my heart to listen to these stories. These people are so connected to their country.</p>

<p>“There are not too many high profile people coming out of there, so I’m feeling like I should step up. I feel like I’m responsible for being a voice for the Torres Straits.”</p>
<p>Since starting the band in 2007, Marou says they’ve been busy “writing music and trying to be rock stars” and were “oblivious” to the impacts in the Torres Strait.</p>
<p>“In the past, we have been scared to mention global warming” he says.</p>
<p>“On Masig island, one side where they get the northerlies their roads are totally gone now. On Mabuiag, if they get a tidal surge or a low at the same time as a king tide, houses are going under water and burial sites are going under water.</p>
<p>“One thing we know for certain is that sea levels are rising. Yes, it’s climate change.”</p>

<p>According to a climate change resilience plan developed for the Torres Straits, the island is seeing sea levels rising at between 6 and 8 millimetres per year – at least double the global average.</p>
<p>“I try to be realistic about this,” says Marou. “I’m from central Queensland where the economy has relied on mining, so shutting down mine sites won’t fix that beach, or stop those houses going under water.</p>
<p>“The sea levels are rising and there are always climate shifts. But I have no doubt though that human influence is speeding up the process. I’m still learning a lot. I certainly believe in global warming and we have definitely sped things up.”</p>
<p>Marou says locals told him they could fix some of the erosion issues “with some excavators and some sand” but were frustrated at what they felt was government bureaucracy getting in the way.</p>

<p>In 2016, islands in the western portion of the Torres Strait group were hit with severe coral bleaching caused by the same rising ocean temperatures that bleached large sections of the northern Great Barrier Reef.</p>
<p>“They live off the reef,” says Marou. “Murray Island is surrounded by reefs and if the reef dies, the island dies because the reef protects the island.”</p>
<p>He said he was shocked at the rubbish that comes up onto the reef and beaches on ocean currents, in particular so-called “ghost nets” – discarded fishing nets from commercial boats that get caught on reefs and entangle wildlife.</p>
<p>“It’s just insane. It make me so angry,” he says.</p>
<p>“Both Tom and I are passionate in raising awareness of what’s going on up there. It’s houses and grave sites under water, but people down in Sydney have no idea what’s going on.</p>
<p>“We’re not a third world country and I found that aspect of it extremely sad.”

<h3 id="dermot-kennedy-review--intimate-theatrics-from-grizzled-chart-topper">&ldquo;Dermot Kennedy review – intimate theatrics from grizzled chart-topper&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/643e1b67a944db72791bb8c3a8a56181b59fbd51/0_423_3902_2342/master/3902.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=bd7eb3525cbab7cc43c82a6b708830eb" alt="img">
I</p>
<p>rish singer-songwriter Dermot Kennedy’s timely puree of folky songwriting and moody beats has racked up millions of streams, a devoted audience and a No 1 debut album. Pinballing from viral buzz to fully-fledged chart sensation can lead to a slapdash live show, as artists struggle to scale up their music. But, in an ambitious evening in which London’s Hammersmith Apollo is packed to its scalloped rafters, Kennedy neatly sidesteps any teething troubles.</p>
<p>Tonight his music gains an impressive sense of scale, with a three-piece band framed by intertwining tree trunks and a giant video screen showing abstract images (swooping birds, the white of an eye). Yet Kennedy’s versatile voice is the real draw. At times, it could soundtrack a Netflix weepie; at others, he sounds like a grizzled sailor. The hip-hop/indie hybrid Outnumbered is speeded up, its rapped verses sharpened, while acoustic mea culpa For Island Fires and Family is played to pin-drop silence.</p>
<p>Kennedy deftly blends stagey moments with intimacy on the gospel-inspired Glory: the stage is drenched in red light and dry ice, recalling Bat Out of Hell: The Musical. Yet he quickly snuffs out theatrics for a touching singalong. For the devoted ballad After Rain, fans pull out paper sleeves, transforming their phone lights to coloured lanterns.</p>
<p>He brings an of-the-moment dynamism to Radio 2-friendly balladry, but the formula of hushed verses and booming choruses begins to wear. Big slots seem within reach, even if his current range of material might not fully compel a casual audience.</p>
<p>• Touring the UK until 19 December.

The veteran’s cover of You’ll Never Walk Alone, recorded alongside Michael Ball and the NHS Voices of Care choir, knocked the Weeknd off the top spot</p>
<p>Captain Tom Moore, who turns 100 on 30 April, has become the oldest artist ever to claim the UK No 1 spot with his cover of You’ll Never Walk Alone, a collaboration with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices of Care choir.</p>
<p>The charity single, released to raise money for the NHS, racked up combined chart sales of 82,000 units – the fastest-selling single of 2020 – pipping the Weeknd’s Blinding Lights to No 2 with 69,000.</p>
<p>Moore, who has already raised more than £28m in recent weeks for NHS staff, welcomed the “wonderful news”, saying: “My grandchildren can’t believe I am a chart-topper!” He thanked Ball, the choir, those behind the scenes who facilitated the release, and the general public. “We’re in this together, and I am for ever grateful for your support. And this just proves: you’ll never walk alone.’”</p>
<p>It is Ball’s first No 1 single. He said: “This is the most extraordinary thing, one of the proudest moments of my career, but it’s not about me, it’s about Captain Tom. Thank you for giving him a No 1 on his 100th birthday. You are the best, God bless ya.”</p>
<p>Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, said there was “almost nothing” between Moore and the Weeknd’s respective tracks on Thursday – until the latter’s Abel Tesfaye tweeted encouraging fans to support Moore. “We’re rooting for you,” he said. Moore thanked the Canadian R&amp;B star for his “kind gesture”.</p>
<p>Sales from the track will add to the millions of pounds Moore has already raised for the NHS after walking 100 lengths of his garden prior to his centenary on 30 April in the hope of raising £1,000. Prince William paid tribute to Moore, calling him a “one-man fundraising machine”.</p>

<p>You’ll Never Walk Alone will occupy its chart position at least for the next seven days, meaning that Moore will become the first centenarian to have a UK No 1. The second-oldest UK No 1 holder is Tom Jones, who was 68 years and nine months old when (Barry) Islands in the Stream reached the top in 2009. The success of You’ll Never Walk Alone makes Ball, at 57 years and nine months, the seventh-oldest musician to claim a No 1.</p>
<p>Giving is good – but we should never forget that the NHS is not a charity | David Ainsworth Read more</p>
<p>Moore was born 32 years before the UK singles chart was first compiled by the New Musical Express on 14 November 1952. Al Martino’s Here in My Heart was the first chart-topper.</p>
<p>You’ll Never Walk Alone is not the only charity single in the Top 5. The BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge Allstars’s cover of the Foo Fighters’s 2002 song Times Like These – featuring such stars as Dua Lipa, Coldplay’s Chris Martin, AJ Tracey and original writer Dave Grohl – debuts at No 5 less than 24 hours after its premiere on the BBC’s The Big Night In.</p>
<p>Scottish songwriter Gerry Cinnamon’s second album, The Bonny, debuts at No 1 on the album chart.
