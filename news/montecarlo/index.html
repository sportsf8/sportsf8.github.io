<p>Magnetic ionic liquid structures were elucidated through hybrid reverse Monte Carlo simulation. The research results elucidated fundamental understanding of pure liquids with magnetic responses as well as lead to the development of MIL for a variety of practical applications. Credit: Ryusuke Futamura, Faculty of Science, Department of Chemistry, Shinshu University</p>
<p>A research team lead by Ryusuke Futamura of Shinshu University investigated the response of magnetic ionic liquids (MIL) to magnetic fields from the microscopic view points. Magnetic fluids, which can respond to magnetic fields, can be made by dispersing ferromagnetic nanoparticles in a solvent. Some pure liquids that are not mixtures also respond to magnetic feilds. For example, oxygen is a liquid around -200°C and is attracted to magnets. In this study, pure magnetic ionic liquids Emim[FeCl 4 ] and Bmim[FeCl 4 ] were examined in the microscopic scale. These liquids are attracted to magnets at room temperature, but Emim[FeCl 4 ] also undergoes a change from paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic behavior at 3.8K.</p>
<p>Ferromagnetism occurs in the objects people think of as &ldquo;magnets,&rdquo; such as refrigerator magnets. Magnetic atoms or ions have magnetic dipoles (north and south) in the molecular scale that interact with each other and show ferro- or antiferro-magnetism over a long distance in their crystal structures. Bmim[FeCl 4 ] does not crystalize even at low temperatures, and are amorphous, or formless. It was shown in this study that even in this amorphous state, there is structurality in the short range and several magnetic ions form an aligned association structure. This is thought to be the reason for the negative Curie-Weiss temperature, which can be observed as a macroscopic physical property.</p>
<p>It was difficult to investigate and understand the formation of the liquid structure of Emim[FeCl 4 ] and Bmim[FeCl 4 ]. Liquids and amorphous objects do not have a long-range ordered structure, which means structural analysis of such materials is performed through X-ray scattering measurements followed by radial distribution analysis. However, MILs are binary systems consisting of cations and anions. This makes examination by ordinary radial distribution analysis difficult. This is where the hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) method helped. It combined the X-ray scattering measurement with molecular simulation to clearly demonstrate the precise coordination structures of the two MIL. This has made it possible to discuss the cation-cation, anion-anion, and cation-anion of the liquid structure.</p>

<p>By the use of spatial distribution function analysis, it has become possible to visualize the ion coordination structure. The temperature dependence of the spatial distribution function showing the coordination structure of the anions around the cations in the MIL can be seen that the lower the temperature, the wider the coordination sphere and more blurred the site. The researchers were able to clarify the characteristics of substances that appear in macroscopic physical properties from a microscopic perspective.</p>
<p>First author Futamura specializes in the nanospaces of porous materials. He hopes to synthesize new composite materials by combining porous materials and ionic liquids. By confining MIL in the nanospace of porous materials, he hopes to create new functional materials for various applications. These MIL are considered organic-inorganic hybrid functional materials that hold potential for outstanding chemical and physical uses.</p>

Schematic figure of the TurboRVB workflow [K. Nakano et al. J. Chem. Phys. 152, 204121 (2020)]. The code implements flexible many-body wave function ansatz, such as JSD: Jastrow Slater, JAGP: Jastrow Geminal, and JPf: Jastrow Pfaffian. One can prepare a trial wave function using a build-in density functional theory (DFT) code and perform subsequent first-principles variational quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and lattice discretized diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (LRDMC) calculations. Since forces acting on atoms can be computed, structural optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations are also feasible in TurboRVB. Credit: AIP Publishing</p>
<p>First-principles quantum Monte Carlo is a framework used to tackle the solution of the many-body Schrödinger equation by means of a stochastic approach. This framework is expected to be the next generation of electronic structure calculations because it can overcome some of the drawbacks in density functional theory and wavefunction-based calculations. In particular, the quantum Monte Carlo framework does not rely on exchange-correlation functionals, the algorithm is well suited for massively parallel supercomputers, and it is easily applicable to both isolated and periodic systems.</p>
<p>TurboRVB is a first-principles quantum Monte Carlo software package that was initially launched by Prof. Sandro Sorella (International School for Advanced Studies/Italy) and Dr. Michele Casula (Sorbonne University/France), and has been continuously developed by many contributors for over 20 years. Very recently, Assist. Prof. Kosuke Nakano at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST, President: Minoru Terano, located at Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan) and his collaborators have published a comprehensive review paper in the Journal of Chemical Physics.</p>
<p>TurboRVB is distinguishable from other first-principles quantum Monte Carlo codes in the following features. (a) The code employs resonating valence bond (RVB)-type wave functions, such as the Jastrow Geminal/Jastrow Pfaffian, which include the correlation effect beyond the Jastrow-Slater wave function that is commonly used in other QMC codes. (b) It implements state-of-art optimization algorithms, such as the stochastic reconfiguration and the linear method, helps realize a stable optimization of the amplitude and nodal surface of a many-body wave function at the variational quantum Monte Carlo level. (c) The so-called lattice-regularized diffusion Monte Carlo method is implemented in the code, which provides a numerically stable diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculation. (d) The implementation of an adjoint algorithmic differentiation allows us to compute derivatives of many-body wave functions very efficiently and to perform structural optimizations and molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

<h3 id="monte-carlo-method-and-price-testing-old-solution-for-modern-problems">&ldquo;Monte Carlo Method and Price Testing: Old Solution for Modern Problems&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://insidebigdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Vladimir-Kuchkanov_Competera.jpg" alt="img">
In this special guest feature, Vladimir Kuchkanov, Pricing Solution Architect at Competera, examines how data scientists often forget about classics while good old algorithms are still relevant and efficient. In particular, Monte Carlo method (MCM) pops up in mind. Among many fields of its application, MCM has established itself as a solid solution in price prediction and automation of pricing rules in retail. Like any analytical approach, MCM has limitations and inaccuracies. Despite this, many fields, including retail, still utilize it.</p>
<p>Currently, data scientists praise various supervised and unsupervised solutions. Unfairly, more experts forget about classics while good old algorithms are still relevant and efficient. And Monte Carlo method (MCM) pops up in mind. Among many fields of its application, MCM has established itself as a solid solution in price prediction and automation of pricing rules in retail.</p>
<p>From Solitaire to Powerful Tool</p>
<p>As many practical solutions, the basic idea of MCM was born spontaneously. In the pre-computer era, Stanislaw Ulam wondered what the chances of successful Canfield solitaire laid out were. To examine it, the scientist intentionally declined combinatorial calculations and considered statistical sampling with an increased number of simulations. Simply put, the more simulations of one process we have, the more accurate prognosis we can receive. This became a core notion of Monte Carlo simulations (MCS).</p>
<p>With time, analysts obtained computers, the method evolved and got empowered by machine learning (ML) capabilities. Even though there are disputes on the definition of Monte Carlo method (some scientists classify it as a stochastic simulation; some categorize it as a repeating simulation with deterministic nature), it is used in statistical physics, engineering, geostatistics, and, as it was outlined above, in pricing.</p>
<p>MCM and ML – the Best Duo in Price Testing</p>
<p>At first glance, retail pricing seems to be pretty simple: it can be done in a primitive table via the manual change of products’ prices. In fact, this practice doesn’t work in 2020, while prices still matter much.</p>
<p>The naive approach cannot solve the pricing issues of big retailers; it does not take into account the external factors. For example, it is nearly impossible or even preposterous to manually test prices of a good within a category of similar goods, cross categories, with new products emerging, etc. Even more, competitors, promos, sales, prices cannibalization, loyalty programs, and other influencers make modern retail vigorous.</p>
<p>To deal with the pricing challenges, retailers asked data scientists for help. An average retailer has thousands of items to price and dozens of factors to assess. Fortunately, MCS can solve these challenges with confidence. Pricing simulations based on the Monte Carlo approach and driven by deep learning (DL) have three key advantages comparing to any econometric or other models of price projecting.</p>
<p>Predict how the price of one product affects a key metric</p>
<p>In price testing, speed and volumes are two major opportunities provided by MCM. The algorithm allows to quickly track how one primary metric (for instance, a company’s revenue) modifies under the effects of other factors.</p>
<p>As an illustration, a price architect may take one product (Smartphone A), change its price gradually ($10 per simulation), and forecast its sales during a set time considering market rules. Then, the expert can choose another product or change the step of the previous simulation. After this, the obtained data of each test can be combined and compared in order to understand how price changes of some products influence the company’s revenue.</p>
<p>This is a single scenario while DL solutions can proceed with thousands of such simulations during a short period. As a result, a retailer has a pattern of tested prices; there is no need to experiment in real-life conditions.</p>
<p>Find and track correlations of same-category products</p>
<p>Monte Carlo method driven by deep learning (MCM-DL) facilitates retailers efforts to tracking the behavior of similar products within the category. Experts simulate the price of Smartphone A, examine how the alteration affects Smartphone B and vice versa. Needless to say, the number of comparing same-category items may be substantially bigger.</p>
<p>To get more precise statistics, it is critical to use a price confidence interval of a tested product. The findings can help retailers to find out in what number of cases the price change meet the compliance level and set an optimal price for a tested product in terms of existing market rules and conditions.</p>
<p>Evaluate complementary goods and adjacent segments</p>
<p>Using MCM-DL, experts can test the behavior of complementary (paired) goods. For example, how changes of TV X prices correlate with sales of TV holder A, and more.</p>
<p>Again, this is a simplified visualization. Giant retailers may have hundreds yet thousands of paired goods, price testing of which can be effortlessly done by deep learning.</p>
<p>Also, one can test how adjacent segments (cross categories) will behave. It means, there are mass-market smartphones, middle-up-market devices, and premium ones. The price simulations aimed at the items of these categories can give insights into the dependencies and sale fluctuations of neighboring products.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a retailer gets graphs of links and impacts between goods of the same category, goods of adjacent segments, their interactions, etc. This data is highly valuable for establishing timely discounts, forecasting sales of new products, and more.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Like any analytical approach, MCM has limitations and inaccuracies. Despite this, many fields, including retail, still utilize it. MCM-DL works impressively in the dynamic and oversaturated modern retail industry. It assists data scientists and price architects in conducting price testing.

<h3 id="how-will-the-monte-carlo-ballet-get-back-to-the-studio">&ldquo;How will the Monte-Carlo Ballet get back to the studio?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.monaco-tribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/screenshot-2020-05-18-at-17.30.48.png" alt="img">
Last Wednesday, each member of the Monte-Carlo Ballet company, including dancers, artistic staff, administration, and the technical team, received an antibody test carried out by the Monaco Red Cross. While they still have no confirmed date for their return to the studio, they have taken the first steps in getting back to the barre.</p>
<p>The ballet company was allowed to start training again on 4th May, although given the impossibility to enforce social distancing for the profession, the only way to ensure a safe return to the studio was through antibody testing. Each test came back negative.</p>
<p>Aside from this, the studios have been thoroughly disinfected, and the company gave dancers strict advice about the precautions needed to be taken, such as regular hand washing, social distancing, wearing masks and regular temperature taking. Antibacterial gel dispensers have also been installed in the studios.</p>
<p>Training at home</p>
<p>For members of the company who can work from home, they will continue to do so until further notice. Given the inherently physical nature of the dancers’ profession and the significant lack of movement for which lockdown allowed, the training process will be gradual. During lockdown, the dancers had no opportunity to keep up regular practice, aside from some pilates, pointe and yoga classes held over Zoom.</p>
<p>With regular training and close monitoring by the ballet’s medical team, the company directors ensured dancers would be able to avoid incurring any injury due to reduced activity.</p>
<p>“Wake up” call</p>
<p>Jean-Christophe Maillot, the Director and Choreographer of the Monte-Carlo Ballet, featured in a video released by the company last week to encourage the Principality to wear masks when going outside.

<h3 id="open-letter-calls-for-virtual-monte-carlo-rendez-vous">&ldquo;Open letter calls for virtual Monte Carlo Rendez-Vous&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.reinsurancene.ws/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/monte-carlo-291339_960_720.jpg" alt="img">
An open letter penned by senior members of DEVK Re, Gossmann &amp; Cie, and TigerRisk Partners has called on the re/insurance industry to move forward with its Monte Carlo agendas via digital tools and video calls.</p>
<p>It was announced recently that the 64th edition of the Rendez-Vous de Septembre would be cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Their open letter states that, in this context, events such as Monte Carlo or Baden-Baden go beyond being an opportunity to meet and entertain.</p>
<p>“They protect and defend the soul of the industry, reaffirm our shared purpose and values and provide the platform for profound discussions and efficient solutions,” the statement reads.</p>
<p>Member of the Board at DEVK Re Bernd Zens, Gossmann &amp; Cie CEO Arndt Gossmann, and TigerRisk Partners Head of EMEA Marc Beckers all agreed that the call for action being faced is equal to a mandate to re-invent the re/insurance industry.</p>
<p>“In the context of our role as risk-mitigators, capital providers and investors, we are asked not only to face this challenge but to shape it in a way that safeguards our values of trust, integrity, proximity, collective sharing and forward planning.”</p>
<p>Therefore, the letter states a need to dedicate time and to showcase willingness to facilitate a digital Monte Carlo dimension.</p>
<p>As to the next scheduled event, Baden-Baden, depending on the level of health risk, it is suggested that the industry should examine the creation of health protocols that could enable the event to take place under fewer attendees/per company guidelines.</p>
<p>“Before cancelling the Baden-Baden event altogether, we should carefully and thoughtfully consider its proper and safe implementation, under the right precautionary measures, this year and until the successful development of a vaccine.</p>
<p>“While we are all confident that the human tragedy of Covid-19 will not compare to the experience of a war, it becomes painfully evident that the economic, social and political implications will be immense. And so our industry today faces another unprecedented challenge.”
