<p>The House of Hanover (formally known as the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Hanover line) is a German royal house that came to rule Great Britain. The Hanoverians, as they are known, gained the British throne in the 18 th century, and held on to it until the early 20 th century. During this period, a total of six Hanoverians monarchs ruled Britain, the most famous of whom was probably Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>The House of Hanover is a cadet branch of the German House of Welf (also known as Guelph), which itself is a branch of the Italian House of Este. This dynasty was created in 1638 as a result of the division of territories of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Initially, the new state was known as the Principality of Brunswick-Calenberg-Göttingen. Later on, however, it was renamed after its principal town, Hanover, which is today the capital of the northwestern German state of Lower Saxony . Thus, the dynasty became known as the House of Hanover. The prestige of the House of Hanover grew as the century progressed. In 1692, in return for lavish promises of assistance to the Habsburgs, Hanover was designated by the Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, as the empire’s 9 th electorate.</p>
<p>The ruler of Hanover at the time was Ernest Augustus, who had been its duke since 1679. Apart from transforming Hanover into an electorate of the Holy Roman Empire, Ernest Augustus also contributed to his dynasty’s possession of the British throne . In 1658, the duke married Sophia, the daughter of Frederick V of the Palatinate, and more importantly, the granddaughter of James VI of Scotland (James I of England and Ireland from 1603). This would have a significant impact on the House of Hanover in the future.</p>
<p>How Religion Played Its Part in The Elaborate Web of Royals</p>
<p>Anne became Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland in 1702. Following the Acts of Union 1707, Anne’s title was changed to Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. Anne was the last monarch of the House of Stuart, which had ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland since 1603. When she died in 1714, she did not leave behind an heir, and there were uncertainties about the succession. One of Anne’s potential successors was her brother James, whose nickname was ‘The Old Pretender’, a Roman Catholic in exile.</p>
<p>Anne (centre) and her sister Mary (left) with their parents, the Duke (later King James II and VII) and Duchess of York, painted by Peter Lely and Benedetto Gennari II in 1668 to 1670 ( Public Domain )</p>
<p>A year before Anne had come to power, however, the Act of Settlement 1701 was passed, which confirmed a provision in the Bill of Rights that the throne would not pass into the hands of a Roman Catholic, or a ruler with a Roman Catholic spouse. Although efforts were made by some parties to secure the throne for the Old Pretender, they did not succeed and upon Anne’s death, the throne of Great Britain was to pass to her closest Protestant relative. It so happened to be Sophia, the wife of Ernest Augustus. Unfortunately, Sophia died about two months before Anne. As a result, the throne passed to Sophia’s son, who became George I of Great Britain. Incidentally, George I was the 52 nd in line to the British throne.</p>
<p>George I</p>
<p>George I was the first Hanoverian monarch of Great Britain and ruled until 1727. Being from a foreign dynasty, George I was not exactly a popular figure in his new kingdom. This was partly due to the fact that the new king could not speak English, the rumors regarding George I’s terrible treatment of his wife (also named Sophia), the supposed greed of his German mistresses, and the economic crisis that resulted from the collapse of the South Sea Company in 1720. Nevertheless, George I did make an effort to fulfil his obligations as king. For instance, he communicated with his ministers in French. Additionally, he was shrewd in matters of foreign policy and formed an alliance with France against Spain between 1717 and 1718. Still, the powers of the monarchy were steadily decreasing during his reign, as it had been during Anne’s reign . The modern system of government by a cabinet was developing, and by the end of George I’s reign, the real power was in the hands of Sir Robert Walpole, Britain’s first prime minister.</p>
<p>George II and Walpole Holding the Reigns</p>
<p>George I was succeeded by his son, George II, under whom Walpole continued his domination of the British government. Walpole was almost dismissed from his post as prime minister. The relationship between the two Georges had been strained since 1717, but the two were reconciled by Walpole in 1720. This won Walpole the premiership under George I, at the expense of his favor with George II. Thanks to the intervention of the queen, Caroline of Ansbach, Walpole was able to keep his post.</p>
<p>Walpole would repay the Hanoverians by obtaining the acknowledgement of George II’s legitimacy as ruler from the leading Tories of the kingdom. Many influential members of this party had been supporters of the Stuart pretenders to the British throne. In 1745, the Jacobites (who wanted to restore of the House of Stuart) launched an uprising. Thanks to Walpole, however, no senior politician deserted the king. Although the Jacobites had some initial success, they were ultimately defeated, and this marked the end their threat to the House of Hanover. The Jacobites had also made two attempts to restore the House of Stuart during the reign of George I, once in 1715 and another in 1719. They were unsuccessful on both occasions.</p>
<p>George II envisioned at the Battle of Dettingen in 1743 by John Wootton ( Public Domain )</p>
<p>Three years before the Jacobite uprising, Walpole was forced to resign as prime minister. His role as the king’s mentor, however, was soon taken up by John Carteret. Although Carteret was not prime minister, he was in fact one of the most powerful men in the British government. Carteret advocated British involvement in the War of the Austrian Succession, which had broken out in 1740. This was supported by George II, but Great Britain’s entry into the war was used by the king’s opponents to accuse him of subordinating British interests in favor of his German possessions. Incidentally, in 1743, George II personally led his troops against the French at the Battle of Dettingen, making him the last British monarch to perform such a feat.</p>
<p>George III</p>
<p>George II reigned until 1760 but took little interest in politics during the last decade of his life. He was succeeded by his grandson, George III, as his son, Frederick, had died in 1751. Unlike his two predecessors, George III was born in Britain, and used English as his first language. During the early reign of George III, the kingdom suffered from political instability and financial difficulties. On the foreign front, however, Britain was enjoying much success. At the end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763, France lost its supremacy in Europe to Britain. Moreover, the British became the dominant European power in North America and India.</p>
<p>The situation back home also improved in 1770, when Frederick North was appointed Prime Minister. Another problem, however, soon arose. Although North was a capable administrator, his government was at odds with the American colonists on the issue of Britain’s attempt to levy taxes on them. As a consequence, war broke out in 1775. In 1779, George III insisted that the war in the American colonies be prolonged, in order to avoid similar rebellions from breaking out elsewhere in the empire. When the British were defeated in 1781, North was forced to resign.</p>
<p>Two other notable events that occurred during the reign of George III were the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleonic France. On both occasions, Britain was dragged into yet more wars. Around this time, however, the king suffered several serious bouts of acute mania. By the time Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, George III was permanently insane. It has been speculated that the king’s madness was caused by a blood disease called porphyria. Recent studies have found that George III’s hair contained high levels of arsenic, making it possible that the king’s madness was caused by this poisonous substance.</p>
<p>George IV, From Regent to King</p>
<p>From 1811 until 1820, George III’s heir, the future George IV, served as prince regent. This period is known also as the Regency. George IV was notorious for his extravagant lifestyle, which caused his father to regard him with contempt. On one occasion, for instance, he agreed to marry his cousin, Caroline, in order to induce the British Parliament to pay his debts. On the plus side, George IV was a generous patron of the arts . The architect John Nash received the king’s patronage, and many of his works may still be seen today. These include the Marble Arch, Regent Street, and the Royal Pavilion. The last of these is located in Brighton and is considered to be exotic due to its heavy use of Mughal Indian elements.</p>

<p>George IV reigned as king from 1820 until 1830. Since his only child, Charlotte, had died in 1817 during childbirth, George IV did not leave an heir. His brother, William IV, who was 65 years old at that time, ascended the throne. Since William IV had served in the Royal Navy during his youth, he was known also as the ‘Sailor King’.</p>
<p>From William IV to Queen Victoria</p>
<p>William IV ruled for seven years, and the most notable event of his reign was the passing of the Reform Act 1832. The king was opposed to parliamentary reform but was forced to accept the Act. Amongst other things, the Act reduced the power of the monarch over the government, and the transfer of representation from ‘rotten boroughs’ (known also as pocket boroughs), which were normally depopulated to the industrialized districts. Incidentally, William IV’s short reign is often included as part of the Georgian era, which is named after the four Hanoverian Georges.</p>
<p>William IV’s died in 1837. By that time, all his legitimate children had died, whilst his illegitimate ones were not entitled to succeed him. Therefore, the throne passed to his niece, Victoria. Although Victoria was the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, she did not inherit the throne of Hanover, which had attained the status of ‘kingdom’ in 1814. As the kingdom’s succession was regulated the Salic Law, women were not allowed to sit on the Hanoverian throne. Therefore, Ernest Augustus, William IV’s eldest surviving brother, became the new King of Hanover.</p>
<p>Ushering in the Victoria Era, Queen and Empress</p>
<p>Victoria reigned for almost 64 years (63 years, 216 days, to be exact), the second longest of any British monarch. The longest reigning British monarch is the current queen, Elizabeth II, who has reigned for 68 years, 96 days, and counting…</p>
<p>The period of her reign is referred to as the Victorian era and was a time of great change not only in Great Britain, but also in the British Empire. The Second Industrial Revolution, for instance, began during her reign. Victoria’s reign also witnessed the great expansion of the British Empire. India, which had been ruled by the East India Company, was transferred to the British Crown in 1858, and Victoria adopted the title ‘Empress of India’ in 1876. Like her predecessors, Victoria attempted to retain political power, but was unable to do so. During her reign, the British monarchy lost its political role, and attained a ceremonial one. This new role, however, ensured the monarchy’s survival.</p>

<p>Victoria was the last British ruler form the House of Hanover. When she died in 1901, she was succeeded by her son, Edward VII, who belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. This was due to the fact that Edward VII’s father (Victoria’s husband), Prince Albert , was a member of that dynasty. Edward VII’s successor, George V, changed the name of the dynasty to the House of Windsor in 1917. This change was made due to the anti-German sentiment amongst the British public caused by the First World War. The House of Windsor is the current royal house of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The House of Hanover played a significant role in British history. The dynasty’s almost 200-year rule saw Great Britain transforming form a dominant power in Europe into a world superpower. At the same time, it was during the reign of the Hanoverian monarchs that the current relation between the British monarchy and the government was attained. Whilst the monarchs sought to retain their political powers, their governments sought to reduce them. In the end, the British monarchy was changed from a political institution to a ceremonial one. Thanks to this transformation, the British monarchy has survived till this day.</p>

<h3 id="78-uk-statues-named-in-topple-the-racists-campaign">&ldquo;78 UK statues named in &lsquo;Topple The Racists&rsquo; campaign&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/10/20/29460200-0-image-a-15_1591817777241.jpg" alt="img">

<p>The campaign to tear down monuments in towns and cities across Britain gathered pace today as a &lsquo;hit list&rsquo; of statues and memorials deemed to be &lsquo;celebrating racism and slavery&rsquo; reached 78.</p>
<p>A website called &lsquo;Topple The Racists&rsquo; has controversially identified dozens of landmarks from Sir Walter Raleigh Gilbert&rsquo;s Bodmin Beacon to Lord Kitchener&rsquo;s memorial in the Orkney Islands that they say need to be removed &lsquo;so that Britain can finally face the truth about its past&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Organisers have said they were inspired by the &lsquo;direct action taken by Bristolians&rsquo;, referring to the tearing down of slave trader Edward Colston&rsquo;s statue on Sunday in the city, before it was thrown into the harbour.</p>
<p>In details showing how statues are chosen, the website says the hit list includes &lsquo;cases where there is responsibility for colonial violence&rsquo;, adding that &lsquo;judgement calls&rsquo; had been on cases where history is more &lsquo;complicated&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Memorials to monarchs such as King Charles II and King James II make appearances on the list, as well as Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell.</p>
<p>Monuments have been targeted in 39 towns and cities, with 12 located in London, and six in Bristol. Five of the one in Bristol celebrate Colston, including two schools, a tower and a renowned music venue which is set to change its when it reopens in the autumn.</p>
<p>Responding to the suggestions that some buildings built with the profits of the slave trade could be torn down, the group said they can &lsquo;just be renamed&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yesterday, anti-racism protestors forced the removal of 18th Century slave dealer Robert Milligan from outside the Museum of London in West India Quay, Docklands.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson&rsquo;s Business and Industry Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Iraq and moved to the UK with his Kurdish parents aged nine, has since said there should be no statues of slave traders in Britain.</p>
<p>Mr Zahawi said they should not be torn down illegally like Edward Colston&rsquo;s in Bristol, but said: &lsquo;Any slave trader should not have a statue. But I wouldn&rsquo;t be breaking the law to take statues down, it should be done through our democratic process. It should be up to local people to decide what they want to do. If the majority of people decide that we want the statues down, then they should be taken down&rsquo;.</p>
<p>As debate rages over the future of many of Britain&rsquo;s most famous monuments, it has also emerged:</p>
<p>Boris Johnson reiterated that &lsquo;black lives matter&rsquo; to him during fiery PMQs with Sir Keir Starmer;</p>
<p>Colston&rsquo;s School in Bristol is considering changing its name after statue of Edward Colston was torn down on Sunday;</p>
<p>Oxford University chancellor Chris Patten accuses Cecil Rhodes statue protesters of &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; because imperialist&rsquo;s trust funds scholarships for 20 African students a year;</p>
<p>An Oxford-educated museum curator tweets to BLM supporters instructions on how to destroy statues with household chemicals - and says next target should be memorial to Winston Churchill&rsquo;s Parliament Square statue;</p>
<p>Football hooligans and far-Right activists have called for a &lsquo;ring of steel&rsquo; around Churchill and the Cenotaph this weekend as Tommy Robinson slams &lsquo;soft-handed police&rsquo; ahead of more protests;</p>
<p>A &lsquo;hit list&rsquo; of 78 statues and memorials to some of Britain&rsquo;s most famous figures has been created by an anti-racism group urging local communities to remove them because they &lsquo;celebrate racism and slavery&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next in line? BLM supporters have pinpointed a list of their next targets, but the most widely shared are (top left to bottom right) 1) Lord Nelson – tried to stop abolition (Nelson&rsquo;s column) 2) Sir Thomas Picton 3) Thomas Guy - London, Guy&rsquo;s Hospital 4) Sir Robert Peel 5) Sir Francis Drake 6) William Beckford 7) Henry Dundas 8) Clive of India 9) John Cass 10) General Sir Redvers Buller 11) Lord Kitchener 12) Ronald Fisher 13) Lord Grey - Grey&rsquo;s Monument - Newcastle Upon Tyne, Grainger Street 14) Oliver Cromwell – Statue - London, Houses of Parliament 15) Colin Campbell, Lord Clyde – Statue - Glasgow, George Square 16) William Ewart Gladstone 17) William Leverhulme – Statue - Wirral, outside Lady Lever Art Gallery 18) William Armstrong - Memorial - Newcastle Upon Tyne, Eldon Place 19) King James II – Statue - London, Trafalgar Square 20) General James George Smith Neill, Wellington Square, Ayr</p>
<p>There are at least five statues of two-time British prime minister Sir Robert Peel also under threat because his MP father, also called Robert Peel, campaigned for slavery to continue. His son is considered the father of the modern police, after setting up the Met as Home Secretary in 1829. Some BLM supporters are also angry because of his links to policing.</p>
<p>Internationally-renowned Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London has revealed it will consider whether to remove a statue of its founder Sir Thomas Guy - but will not change its name - as a senior minister backed a Black Lives Matter campaign to topple upwards of 70 monuments to slave traders.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas helped set up the hospital near London Bridge in 1721 having made his fortune in the 17th and 18th centuries as a major shareholder of a company selling slaves to the Spanish Colonies.</p>
<p>Today Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; welcomed Mayor of London Sadiq Khan&rsquo;s review of statues and street names in the capital and said the future of its own monument to its founder outside the Guy&rsquo;s building should be considered.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &lsquo;We recognise and understand the anger felt by the black community and are fully committed to playing our part in ending racism, discrimination and inequality&rsquo;, adding: &lsquo;There are no plans to change the name of the hospital&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The removal of a statue of the so-called &lsquo;Tyrant of Trinidad&rsquo; Sir Thomas Picton from Cardiff city hall is nearing success as all of Labour&rsquo;s 130 UK local authorities agreed to draw up a list of controversial statues in their communities which could be ripped down after Edward Colston&rsquo;s was destroyed in Bristol on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cardiff City Council&rsquo;s leader Huw Thomas has backed the campaign to rip it down calling it an &lsquo;affront&rsquo; to black people in the Welsh capital because he executed dozens of slaves. He was even put on trial in England for illegally torturing a 14-year-old girl - extremely rare at the turn of the 19th century - but after being convicted he successfully appealed.</p>
<p>While noting Picton&rsquo;s statue commemorated his part in the Napoleonic Wars and being the highest ranking officer to die at Waterloo, Councillor Thomas said: &lsquo;The growing awareness and understanding of the brutal nature of his governorship of Trinidad and his involvement in slavery makes it, in my view, very difficult to reconcile his presence in City Hall&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A 25ft obelisk dedicated to him on the outskirts of Carmarthen town centre, which has been there since 1888, is also subject to a petition for removal. It stands on Picton Terrace, which also faces calls to be renamed.</p>
<p>A statue of Sir Thomas Guy, sits outside Guy&rsquo;s Hospital, which he founded in 1721 with £19,000 of his own money, equivalent to £2million today. Today the NHS Trust admitted it would consider its removal in a review set up by Sadiq Khan demands it because he made his money from slavery. Former bookseller Thomas Guy made his fortune through the ownership of shares in the South Sea Company, which had a monopoly on trafficking slaves to Spain&rsquo;s colonies in South America in 1713</p>
<p>The next to fall? This tribute to Sir Thomas Picton in Cardiff City Hall is expected to fall after the council&rsquo;s leader also demanded its removal. There are at least five statues of two-time British prime minister Sir Robert Peel (right in Parliament Square) also under threat because his MP father, also called Robert Peel, campaigned for slavery to continue</p>
<p>An aerial view of the Sir Thomas Picton obelisk on Picton Terrace in Camerthen, Wales, which is also on the BLM supporters&rsquo; hit list. Picton was known as the &lsquo;Tyrant of Trinidad&rsquo; owing to his brutal regime as governor of the Caribbean island. In 1806 he was convicted of ordering the illegal torture of a 14-year-old girl, Louisa Calderon. A charge that was later overturned.</p>
<p>Thomas Guy: The London bookseller who made his fortune through shares in slave trading firm&hellip; then sold them to found hospital in his name Former bookseller Thomas Guy made his fortune through the ownership of shares in the South Sea Company, which had a monopoly on trafficking slaves to Spain&rsquo;s colonies in South America in 1713. The British firm was created predominantly to sell enslaved people and had a target to trade 4,800 adult men every year. Guy sold his shares in the company at the top of the market in 1720, letting £50,000 of stock go for more than £250,000 - the equivalent of £400million in modern-day prices. Having created almshouses, he founded Guy&rsquo;s Hospital close to this London birthplace with the aim of providing care to &lsquo;incurables and lunatics&rsquo;. He died in 1724 and his will was so complex and so high in value that an Act of Parliament was needed to enact it, and he left nearly £220,000 to the hospital. The bulk of his estate was left in trust to complete work on the hospital, while a further sum was set aside for the release of prisoners in the capital who owed debts. Advertisement</p>
<p>In Edinburgh SNP city council leader Adam McVey said he would feel &lsquo;no sense of loss&rsquo; if a statue to Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of slavery, was removed, amid mounting calls for action in the Scottish capital.</p>
<p>Also in Scotland a memorial to General James George Smith Neill, which stands in Wellington Square, Ayr, is also under threat. General Neill served during the Indian rebellion of 1857 and accused of ordering the deaths of many Indians following the Bibighar massacre.</p>
<p>Plymouth council said a public square named after slave trader Sir John Hawkins would be renamed while in nearby Exeter council chiefs will review the future of the city&rsquo;s statue of General Buller, who is rumoured to have had a hand in the introduction of concentration camps seen during the Boer War.</p>
<p>A debate has erupted over the legacy of 19th century prime minister Sir Robert Peel after those calling for his statues to be removed were accused of targeting the wrong man.</p>
<p>Lancashire-born Sir Robert, who is best known for founding the Metropolitan Police, is immortalised in a number of statues across the north of England and Scotland.</p>
<p>Five of these - in Leeds, Glasgow, Bury, Manchester and Preston - were included on a map of possible other targets following the toppling of the monument to Edward Colston in Bristol.</p>
<p>The Glasgow statue was daubed with graffiti at the weekend.</p>
<p>But many people have come to the two-time PM&rsquo;s defence, suggesting anti-racist campaigners may have got the wrong Sir Robert.</p>
<p>References to him being a vocal opponent of the abolition of slavery because it threatened his fortune in the cotton trade appear to have confused him with his father, also called Sir Robert Peel.</p>
<p>At a press conference in Leeds on Wednesday, Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said: &lsquo;There seems to be now a recognition that there has been some misunderstanding about the Robert Peel whose statue is in Leeds and that it was actually his father who worked in the cotton trade.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting looking at comments over in the North West where he was born in Bury. There&rsquo;s a really strong reaction that actually Robert Peel was a reformer and did do many things that have had a lasting impression and impact, not least establishing a police force that doesn&rsquo;t carry arms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: &lsquo;I think there is a feeling there is a misunderstanding here which is that his father had links to the slave trade rather than Peel himself, or the Peel who is commemorated in different places in Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>Dozens more monuments are expected to fall after all 130 Labour-led authorities in England, Wales and Scotland have come together to promise to &lsquo;review the appropriateness of local monuments and statues on public land and council property&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 130 Labour councils won the blessing of Sir Keir Starmer&rsquo;s central party, but senior Tories have lined up to admonish the behaviour.</p>
<p>Andrew Rosindell, Conservative MP for Romford, told MailOnline the wave of statue scrutiny was being driven by &lsquo;a politically-correct gang of anarchists who hate everything about this country&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is also conducting his own review of statues in the capital and believes all the city&rsquo;s slave trader monuments should be axed.</p>
<p>Campaigners have set their sights on statues on private property, such as the monument of Cecil Rhodes at Oxford University, where yesterday crowds of protesters rallied.</p>
<p>A statue of the colonialist who claimed Bermuda as part of the British Empire has been vandalised amid anti-racism protests.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;murderer&rsquo; has been daubed across an information board next to the bronze figure of Sir George Somers in Lyme Regis, Dorset.</p>
<p>Somers discovered the island in 1609 after his ship, destined for Virigina, US, was blown off course by a hurricane.</p>
<p>He died there just a year later by which time the region had been claimed by the British Crown.</p>
<p>A bustling slave trade later emerged on the island in the 1640s.</p>
<p>By 1720 there were more than 3,500 slaves among a population of just 8,000 people.</p>
<p>Many have since argued that Somers&rsquo; discovery paved the way for slavery - which is believed to be why his statue has now been targeted.</p>
<p>Yet another 19th century statue - of the man who found lost explorer Dr David Livingstone in an African jungle looks set for the chop.</p>
<p>A petition to remove the statue of Sir Henry Stanley from the centre of Denbiegh in Wales - where he was born - has already attracted more than 1,500 signatures.</p>
<p>The tribute to Sir Henry was installed by Denbigh Town Council ten years ago and re-creates the moment he uttered the famous phrase - &lsquo;Dr Livingstone, I presume?&rsquo; - when he found the explorer in East Africa in 1871.</p>
<p>There was criticism at the time amid claims that the 19th-century explorer was guilty of crimes against humanity and supported slavery.</p>
<p>Organiser Simon Jones said: &lsquo;Out of respect to the Black Lives Matter campaign, the statue of Stanley should be removed from Denbigh town centre immediately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was known for his brutal treatment of Africans to the extent that he used to shoot black children from his boat to calibrate his rifle sights while sailing down river.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A statue to a man like that has no place in Welsh society in 2020. It is an insult to African people that it stands pride of place in the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter demonstrators were joined by a police chief constable taking the knee at a special event in memory of George Floyd.</p>
<p>Kent Police&rsquo;s Alan Pughsley is believed to be the first top cop in the UK to kneel in solidarity with the 46-year-old&rsquo;s death in Minneapolis, USA.</p>
<p>Mr Pughsley was filmed performing the symbolic gesture at an event in Gravesend, Kent while other officers also joined the socially distanced group of more than 50 people.</p>
<p>Last night in London there was a commemoration event, organised by Stand Up To Racism, to mark George Floyd&rsquo;s funeral in Houston, Texas, with police forming a ring of steel around statues including Sir Winston Churchill&rsquo;s in case it is attacked again.</p>
<p>Workmen were yesterday seen uprooting a statue of Robert Milligan from its spot on West India Quay in London&rsquo;s docklands to cheers from spectators. Protesters had drawn up a hit list of 60 &lsquo;racist&rsquo; monuments to be taken down, including Milligan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Amid growing pressure to act, the charity Canal and River Trust worked with the Museum of London and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets to remove the bronze figure of the Scottish merchant who owned 526 slaves at his Jamaican sugar plantation.</p>
<p>Statues glorifying slave traders and colonialists have come into sharp focus in recent days, as part of a broader movement inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests that started in the United States following the death of George Floyd on May 25.</p>
<p>On Sunday, protesters in Bristol tore down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it in the harbour, receiving a mixed reactions of celebrations from anti-racism campaigners and protestors while some politicians and officials questioned the &lsquo;anti-democratic&rsquo; manner in how the statue was taken down.</p>
<p>And in Oxford yesterday more than 1,000 demonstrators have demanded the removal of a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes, an imperialist who provided philanthropical support to Oriel College in Oxford University where the monument stands.</p>
<p>The Canal and River Trust, which owns the land where Milligan&rsquo;s statue is located, issued a statement on Twitter following a petition launched by Tower Hamlets Labour councillor Ehtasham Haque, which demanded the removal of the figure and reached over 1,000 signatures in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Exeter City Council, a Labour authority, will review the future of the city&rsquo;s statue of General Redvers Buller - who was linked to the introduction of concentration camps in the Boer War. The Old Etonian was awarded the Victoria Cross in the Zulu War after rescuing a number of comrades under fire, before being promoted to the Head of the Army and sent to South Africa at the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;murderer&rsquo; has been daubed across an information board next to the bronze figure of Sir George Somers in Lyme Regis, Dorset. Sir Somers was English privateer who claimed the English colony of Bermuda, also known as the Somers Isles.</p>

<p>It earlier said: &lsquo;We recognise the wishes of the local community concerning the statue of Robert Milligan at London Docklands and are committed to working with London Borough of Tower Hamlets, the Museum of London Docklands and partners at Canary Wharf to organise its safe removal as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Trust stands with out waterside communities against racism. We promote equality, diversity and inclusion, using our canals to enrich the lives of all those alongside our waterways from every community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A video shows people cheering and clapping as workers used a crane to remove the statue from its plinth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While it&rsquo;s a sad truth that much of our city and nation&rsquo;s wealth was derived from the slave trade, this does not have to be celebrated in our public spaces,&rsquo; said London Mayor Sadiq Khan in a tweet with a photo of the statue.</p>
<p>John Biggs, the mayor of Tower Hamlets, posted a video of himself at the scene, in which he says: &lsquo;This has become the focus of a lot of anxiety and anger in our community. We need to take it, put it into storage and then talk about what we can learn from this and how we can help these events to make us a stronger community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Museum of London said it &lsquo;recognises that the monument is part of the ongoing problematic regime of white-washing history, which disregards the pain of those who are still wrestling with the remnants of the crimes Milligan committed against humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The commemorative statue, sculpted by Richard Westmacott, was commissioned by the West India Dock Company, of which Milligan was Chairman, following his death in May 1809. He also has a street in the area named after him, Milligan Street, near Westferry DLR station.</p>
<p>The museum also tweeted: &lsquo;The statue presently stands shrouded with placards and is now an object of protest, we believe these protests should remain as long as the statue remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The decision follows huge crowds of Black Lives Matter supporters gathering outside Oriel College at the University of Oxford last night to campaign for a monument of imperialist Cecil Rhodes to be removed.</p>
<p>The demonstration was organised by the Rhodes Must Fall campaign group and came after activists identified 60 UK statues they want removed for &lsquo;celebrating slavery and racism&rsquo; as councils and museums rushed to bring down their controversial monuments.</p>
<p>Some of Briton&rsquo;s most famous people on the hit list include the Edinburgh statue of former Home Secretary Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of slavery, and a statue of Sir Francis Drake on Plymouth Hoe.</p>
<p>The interactive map, called &lsquo;topple the racists&rsquo;, was set up by the Stop Trump Coalition in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, and lists plaques and monuments in more than 30 towns and cities across the UK. The online list is unregulated and can be added to by the public.</p>
<p>Who is Nadhim Zahawi, the Iraqi-born minister saying slave trader statues should not exist Nadhim Zahawi was born in Baghdad to Kurdish parents in 1967. Under threat of persecution from Saddam Hussein’s regime, his family immigrated to the UK when he was nine. He grew up in Sussex and was educated at King’s College School in West London and University College London where he studied Chemical Engineering. In 2000 he founded YouGov, a leading market research company which has since become famous for the accuracy of its political polling. Having started life in an office in Mr Zahawi’s garden shed, YouGov now employs over 400 people on three continents. He floated the company on the London Stock Exchange in 2005 and was named Entrepreneur of the year by Ernst &amp; Young in 2008. In January 2010 he stood down from YouGov to run for election as Member of Parliament for Stratford-on-Avon. Upon winning the seat, he was elected to the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee, which scrutinises the impact of government policy on business. In 2011 he co-authored Masters of Nothing with fellow MP and now Health Secretary Matt Hancock, detailing an account of the human behaviour behind the banking crash and offering policy recommendations designed to prevent a future crisis. In January 2018 then Prime Minister Theresa May appointed him as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Education. Mr Zahawi was appointed as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy on 26 July 2019. He was previously Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Education from 9 January 2018 to 26 July 2019. Continuing his career in politics he was later elected as Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in May 2010.</p>
<p>At last night&rsquo;s Oxford protest, organisers placed chalk crosses on the floors in either side of the street outside the entrance to the college, to enforce social distancing.</p>
<p>The crowd took to their knees for eight minutes 46 seconds, to reflect the time Mr Floyd, a father-of-two, spent with a police officer kneeling on his neck which killed him in America last month.</p>
<p>Hours before the rally began Oxford City Council&rsquo;s leader Susan Brown wrote to Oriel College inviting them to apply for planning permission to remove the statue, after 26 councillors signed a letter saying it is &lsquo;incompatible&rsquo; with the city&rsquo;s &lsquo;commitment to anti-racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Councillor Brown said: &lsquo;Typically such actions are only allowed in the most exceptional of circumstances. But these are exceptional circumstances, and as a city council we are keen to work with Oriel to help them find the right balance between the laws that protect our historic buildings and the moral obligation to reflect on the malign symbolism of this statue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oriel College has said it will &lsquo;continue to debate&rsquo; the issue - but did not commit to removing it.</p>
<p>Ndjodi Ndeunyema, an Oxford University law student and a former Rhodes scholar, organised las night&rsquo;s Oxford rally after starting the Rhodes Must Fall campaign for its removal five years ago, and said: &lsquo;The statue remaining is an affront on the university&rsquo;s support for movements such as Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rhodes is not worth of veneration or glorification because of the racism and subjugation he represents&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Protesters also packed into Leicester city centre last night during another evening of demonstrations against racism.</p>
<p>It comes as the University of Leicester has increased its efforts to &lsquo;decolonise the curriculum&rsquo; in subjects like English, history and law in recent months - and it is launching a scheme to recruit more BAME academics in teaching roles.</p>
<p>Professor Nishan Canagarajah, vice-chancellor of the university, said: &lsquo;It is about a sense of belonging in the university. That comes from having students who are diverse, from having staff who are diverse, and from having a curriculum that is diverse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not something you can easily fix because I think the students have certain perceptions and that&rsquo;s not going to change overnight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They see certain universities as not welcoming for them. That may not be true, but that might be what they have been feeling since they were very young.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think if you go and visit Oxford and places like Bristol you will think they&rsquo;re welcoming for ethnic minorities, but there is a gap between that reality and what the community outside perceives them to be, as not really representing them. I know these universities are taking a lot of action to address that.</p>
<p>More than half (52%) of students are from a BAME background at the University of Leicester but currently only 14.2% of teaching staff and 9.8% of professors are from a BAME background.</p>

<p>Oxford University chancellor Chris Patten accuses Cecil Rhodes statue protesters of &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; because imperialist&rsquo;s trust funds scholarships for 20 African students a year Lord Chris Patten (pictured left), who has no power to remove the Rhodes statue (pictured right), located at Oxford University&rsquo;s Oriel College, said a trust set up after the mining magnate&rsquo;s death pays for the education of more than a dozen African students at the prestigious each year. The chancellor of Oxford University has hit out at the &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; around protests to remove a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Lord Chris Patten, who has no power to remove the Rhodes statue, located at Oxford University&rsquo;s Oriel College, said a trust set up after the mining magnate&rsquo;s death pays for the education of more than a dozen African students at the prestigious university each year. But he also called for a &lsquo;sensible discussion&rsquo; over the removal of Rhodes&rsquo; statue, which has become a focal point amid continuing anti-racism protests from the Black Lives Matter movement - who at the weekend toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. Meanwhile, concern continues that Oriel College chiefs may be reluctant to remove the statue over fears they face the loss of millions of pounds in funding, as revealed by a leaked report in 2016. Commenting on the protests, Lord Patten, who was the last Governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997 and Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1992, told BBC Radio Four&rsquo;s Today Programme: &lsquo;Firstly I am very pleased the demonstrations were peaceful and secondly I don&rsquo;t make the decision on whether the statue comes down&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The university has launched a £1.5 million annual scheme to create three funded PhD studentships and ten postgraduate scholarships to attract students from BAME backgrounds into academia.</p>
<p>And from this year, the English BA at Leicester has been changed to include more diverse texts and authors set and written in countries across the world.</p>
<p>The reading list now includes Giovanni&rsquo;s Room by James Baldwin, Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys and NW by Zadie Smith.</p>
<p>A history teacher who was standing opposite the Cecil Rhodes statue revealed he had travelled from London to &lsquo;guard it&rsquo; as he felt that it should not be brought down.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who did not want to give his name, said: &lsquo;I am here to make sure they do not tear it down. I am a history teacher and about seven years ago I went to the grave of Cecil Rhodes in Zimbabwe after sitting with the Matabele chiefs.</p>
<p>The teacher wore a tweed suit and a fedora hat, while clutching a paperback copy of a book called &lsquo;1066 and all that&rsquo; behind his back.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;Accounts of Cecil Rhodes that are being printed are one-sided and while I definitely think a plaque or something would be a good idea, we do not tear things down and we certainly do not do it without due process. I am going to talk to my school about the monuments and the children will debate the legacy and the history.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you dig into most of the statues in London, you get some pretty horrible things. I do not suppose that tearing things down just because 2,000 people ask for it is in any way correct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The teacher watched as a woman organiser began to speak though a megaphone and chanted &lsquo;down with the king of the blood diamond&rsquo; and &lsquo;take it down&rsquo; which the crowd of several hundred people echoed.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;It is about time you started to listen to the people of this city and not your funders. We want this statue down. We declare ourselves anti-racist and we do not want this statue in our city. It does not reflect our own views, it does not reflect our values.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sadiq Khan has called for the removal of all slave trader statues in the capital as he promised to personally &lsquo;review and improve&rsquo; the diversity of the capital&rsquo;s landmarks. The Mayor of London has launched his own Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm after Black Lives Matter protesters pulled down the monument to Edward Colston in Bristol and hurled it in the city&rsquo;s harbour.</p>
<p>Mayor Khan today said he wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;pre-empt&rsquo; the commission&rsquo;s findings on the suitability of London&rsquo;s street names, murals, statues and memorials, but admitted he would like any statues of slave traders removed in London and to build more &lsquo;people of colour, black people, women, those from the LGBT community&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Queen Victoria Statue in Woodhouse Moor Park in Leeds today, West Yorkshire which has had &lsquo;Black Lives Matter&rsquo;, &lsquo;BLM&rsquo; and &lsquo;Slave Owner&rsquo; spray painted on it. Queen Victoria became the British monarch in 1837, four years after the Abolition of Slavery Act.</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter and &lsquo;slave owner&rsquo; were among the phrases daubed on the statue of Queen Victoria in Woodhouse Moor Park in Leeds before being removed today.</p>
<p>Who are the men behind the statues BLM activists want to tear down Cecil Rhodes Where is his statue? A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university Who was he? Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902) was the Former Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, the modern day South Africa. He was a British supremacist, imperialist, mining magnate, and politician in southern Africa who drove the annexation of vast swathes of Africa. What did he do? The bad • Colonised much of Southern Africa for Victorian Britain and established a vast new British territory in Rhodesia, today&rsquo;s Zimbabwe and Zambia • Rhodes believed that the British were &lsquo;the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race&rsquo; • He secured control of Rhodesia by swindling the king of Matabeleland, and showed scant regard for his African employees, whom he dismissed as &lsquo;n***ers&rsquo; • Founded De Beers mining company, trading diamonds mined with slave labour The good • Established Rhodes Scholarships, which paid for brilliant young students from former British possessions to study at Oxford, among them the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott Thomas Guy Where is his statue? Outside Guy&rsquo;s Hospital in London, England Guy was founder of Guys&rsquo; Hospital, London. He made his fortune through ownership of a very large amount of shares in the South Sea Company, whose main purpose was to sell slaves to the Spanish Colonies. The South Sea Company supplied 4800 slaves each year for 30 years to Spanish plantations in Central and Southern America What did he do ? The bad • He bought £42,000 shares in the South Sea Company, amassing a fortune when he sold them in 1720 • The South Sea Company supplied 4800 slaves each year for 30 years to Spanish plantations in Central and Southern America The good • He became a governor of St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, after building three wards • He later opened Guy&rsquo;s Hospital opposite St Thomas&rsquo; which cost him £19,000 • In his will Guy bequeathed financial support for prisoners with debt in London, Middlesex and Surrey to be released William Beckford - Slave owner and politician Where is his statue? In the Guildhall in London William Beckford (1709-1770) was born in Jamaica, the son Peter Beckford, one of the most powerful slave-owners of the colonial era. Peter had purchased sugar plantations on the Caribbean island in 1661, where he also served as Speaker of the legislature. When both Peter and William&rsquo;s elder brother - also Peter - died, he inherited the enormous fortune and estate which included 13 plantations and over 1,000 slaves. By the time of his death, Beckford&rsquo;s plantations were raking in over £50,000 each year and he is estimated to have amassed £1million in the bank - an eye-watering sum in 18th century Britain. In the early 1700s he returned to London and used his riches to buy the sprawling Fonthill estate in Wiltshire, which he stuffed with art and expensive furniture. The house burned down in 1755, but Beckford poured money and resources into rebuilding it. He later embarked on a political career and was elected as an MP in 1754 before serving twice as Lord Mayor of London in 1762 and 1769. Beckford also used his money to bankroll the rise of future prime minister William Pitt the Elder and ferociously lobbied in favour of the West Indies sugar industry. In 1758, when Pitt was in the cabinet, Beckford advised him to attack the French in the island of Martinique because of the lucrative haul of slaves they could capture. Beckford had nine children, eight of which were out of wedlock. The only son he had with his wife, Maria Marsh, was the novelist William Thomas Beckford. Despite enslaving scores of men, at home he banged the drum for liberties, and once even answered back to King George after he arrested notorious critic John Wilkes. What did he do? • Inherited and oversaw 13 sugar plantations and more than 1,000 slaves in Jamaica. • Campaigned for civil liberties as an MP and in 1770 demanded the King dissolve parliament to remove evil ministers.</p>
<p>But he said he did not think statues such as of Sir Winston Churchill&rsquo;s in Parliament Square should be included in the review it was tagged with &lsquo;racist&rsquo; on Sunday. He said Londoners needed to be educated about famous figures &lsquo;warts and all&rsquo; and that &lsquo;nobody was perfect&rsquo;, including the likes of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X.</p>
<p>The leader of Oxford City Council has this afternoon invited Oriel College to make a planning request to remove the statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes, which has been at the centre of a long-running row.</p>
<p>Councillor Susan Brown said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m clear in my support for the Black Lives Matter movement and I have a great deal of sympathy with the Rhodes Must Fall campaign. The question of statues and their historical context is not a simple matter, but sometimes acts of symbolism are important. I know my views are shared by a majority of my fellow councillors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be better for the statue to be placed in a museum, such as the Ashmolean or the Museum of Oxford, to ensure this noteworthy piece of the story of our city isn&rsquo;t lost to history.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, bringing down statues alone isn&rsquo;t sufficient to address the issue of racism in our society and continued action on this should involve all our city&rsquo;s key institutions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have today written to Oriel College to invite them to apply for planning permission to remove the statue, as it is a Grade II* listed building&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In 2016, Oriel College decided to keep the statue despite widespread student demands to remove it. Campaigners from the Rhodes Must Fall group argued that the row illustrated Britain&rsquo;s &lsquo;imperial blind spot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In a statement ahead of the protest, Oriel College pledged to discuss the issues raised by protests against the Rhodes statue.</p>
<p>The statement read: &lsquo;Oriel College abhors racism and discrimination in all its forms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Governing Body are deeply committed to equality within our community at Oriel, the University of Oxford and the wider world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As an academic institution we aim to fight prejudice and champion equal opportunities for everyone regardless of race, gender, sexuality or faith. We believe Black Lives Matter and support the right to peaceful protest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The power of education is a catalyst for equality and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We understand that we are, and we want to be, a part of the public conversation about the relationship between the study of history, public commemoration, social justice, and educational equality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a college, we continue to debate and discuss the issues raised by the presence on our site of examples of contested heritage relating to Cecil Rhodes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speaking out against injustice and discrimination is vital and we are committed to doing so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will continue to examine our practices and strive to improve them to ensure that Oriel is open to students and staff of all backgrounds, and we are determined to build a more equal and inclusive community and society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Monuments that could be under threat in London would include statues of William Beckford at London&rsquo;s Guildhall, John Cass on Jewry Street and one Thomas Guy, which stands in the courtyard at Guy&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Campaigners are targeting statues all over the UK including a Edinburgh statue of Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of slavery in Scotland, while in Glasgow Barclays Bank has confirmed the &lsquo;Buchanan&rsquo; name will be dropped from a major riverside development over its connection with the slave trade.</p>
<p>The Sir Francis Drake statue on Plymouth&rsquo;s Hoe, where he was playing bowls when he learned Britain was set to be invaded by the Spanish Armada in 1588, is also said to be under threat after BLM supporters set up a &lsquo;topple the racists&rsquo; website mapping more than 30 statues and monuments organisers claim &lsquo;celebrate slavery and racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sadiq Khan said he &lsquo;hopes&rsquo; the new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will recommend some memorials in the capital should be removed.</p>
<p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today programme, the Mayor of London: &lsquo;One of the things that I realise is that I&rsquo;ve not got ownership of the statutes or indeed some of the land that these statues are on. But it is a wider conversation I want to have about the diversity of the public realm in our city.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you look at the public realm - street names, street squares, murals - not only are there some of slavers that I think should be taken down, and the commission will advise us on that, but actually we don&rsquo;t have enough representation of people of colour, black people, women, those from the LGBT community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But critics have called his approach &lsquo;distracting and divisive&rsquo;, with Shaun Bailey, Tory candidate for Mayor of London ,saying: &lsquo;He [Mayor Khan] is seeking to distract Londoners from the fact he failed to support his police service during the protests, allowing a small group to hijack a largely peaceful protest and betray the cause of fairness that the vast majority were there to promote. He should be focusing on keeping all Londoners safe and promoting opportunities for all people of colour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Andrew Rosindell, MP for Romford, told MailOnline: &lsquo;I think the Mayor of London should be focusing on issues that matter to Londoners. Like the bankrupt TFL, the recent crime wave and many other issues.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ripping down our history is not something the Mayor was elected to do. Our history is who we are and you can find something bad in everything, be it prime ministers or anyone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The idea of going around London tearing down statues and renaming streets is absurd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is pandering to a politically correct gang of anarchists who hate everything about this country - they are anti-British.&rsquo;</p>
<p>City Hall called London &lsquo;one of the most diverse cities in the world&rsquo;, but said the capital&rsquo;s statues, plaques and street names largely reflect Victorian Britain.</p>

<p>Racists or heroes? It&rsquo;s not black or white: Black Lives Matter want to topple statues of some of the most famous Britons because of their links to colonialism and slavery - but they also gave fortunes away, and helped build Britain and a modern world</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter activists are calling for the removal of 60-plus statues of slave owners and racists across Britain. Top of their target list is the statue of Cecil Rhodes and petitions also exist to remove the statue of slave-trading West India Docks founder Robert Milligan, and the statue of former Home Secretary Henry Dundas who delayed the abolition of slavery and that stands atop a column in Edinburgh. But on a website called Topple The Racists, set up by Black Lives Matter activists, members are invited to propose other statues that should be torn down across Britain. There, a wide range of figures from Britain&rsquo;s colonial past are being proposed for destruction. Among them are leaders who held undeniably racist views and others who performed evil acts against people of colour, such as slave owners and Thomas Picton who ruled Trinidad with an iron fist and ordered the torture of a 14-year-old accused of theft. But others also played a leading role shaping the cities and institutions that form modern day Britain. The statues targeted by BLM activists are: Cecil Rhodes Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902). A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university Where is his statue? A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university. Who was he? Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902) was the Former Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, the modern day South Africa. He was a British supremacist, imperialist, mining magnate, and politician in southern Africa who drove the annexation of vast swathes of Africa. What did he do? The bad: Colonised much of Southern Africa for Victorian Britain and established a vast new British territory in Rhodesia, today&rsquo;s Zimbabwe and Zambia</p>
<p>Rhodes believed that the British were &lsquo;the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race&rsquo;</p>
<p>He secured control of Rhodesia by swindling the king of Matabeleland, and showed scant regard for his African employees, whom he dismissed as &lsquo;n***ers&rsquo;</p>
<p>Founded De Beers mining company, trading diamonds mined with slave labour The good: • Established Rhodes Scholarships, which paid for brilliant young students from former British possessions to study at Oxford, among them the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott Who wants the statue removed? University of Oxford campaigners claim that forcing ethnic minority students to walk past the Rhodes memorials amounts to &lsquo;violence&rsquo; as he helped pave the way for apartheid. Robert Milligan Robert Milligan (1746-1809) was a Scottish merchant and slave owner. His statue stands at West India Quay outside the Museum London Docklands Where is his statue? West India Quay outside the Museum London Docklands, where it has stood since 1997 after being moved from its original plinth nearby in 1813. Who was he? Robert Milligan (1746-1809) was a Scottish merchant and slave owner. He was born in Dumfries, Scotland, but soon moved to Kingston, Jamaica, where he managed his wealthy family&rsquo;s sugar plantations. He returned to London in 1779 where he became instrumental in the construction of the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs. According to the inscription on the bronze statue&rsquo;s plinth, it was to Milligan&rsquo;s &lsquo;genius, perseverance and guardian care&rsquo; that the docks owed their &lsquo;design, accomplishment and regulation&rsquo;. From the Docks, ships would sail to West Africa where shipowners such as Milligan bought enslaved Africans. The ships then crossed the seas to the Caribbean to buy sugar, rum and coffee before returning to England. At the time of his death in 1809, 526 slaves were registered on Milligan&rsquo;s Jamaican plant called Kellet&rsquo;s and Mammee Gully. What did he do? The Bad: Used slaves to amass great wealth through trade</p>
<p>Was a vocal opponent of the abolition of slavery The good: Built London&rsquo;s docks: Pooled together a group of wealthy businessmen to create the West India Docks which brought in shiploads of produce to England Who wants the statue removed? Tower Hamlets councillor Ehtasham Haque has started a petition for the statue of Robert Milligan to be removed from Canary Wharf. He said: &lsquo;He has no place in London, and he does not deserve the honour of a statue&rsquo;. Horatio Nelson Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758 - 1805) was a British flag officer in the Royal Navy known for inspirational leadership. Nelson&rsquo;s column, Trafalgar Square, London (right) Where is the statue? Nelson&rsquo;s column, Trafalgar Square, London has not been targeted. But another statue of Nelson has been at Deptford Town Hall, a department at Goldsmiths University, London. Who is he? Horatio Nelson was born in a Norfolk rectory in 1758, and secured his first command 20 years later through the influence of his uncle, who was a senior naval officer. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars opened the way for a long succession of triumphs, the earliest taking place in the Mediterranean, where he was blinded in his right eye. He distinguished himself commanding HMS Captain at the 1797 Battle of Cape St Vincent against a larger Spanish force off the coast of Portugal, and mislaid his right arm in the unsuccessful action at Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In the following year, he commanded a British fleet in the first of his historic victories at the Battle of the Nile. Nelson&rsquo;s reputation — for personal courage, aggression and tactical brilliance — won him the adoration of his captains and indeed crews. In 1801, he secured another victory, this time over the Danes, at Copenhagen, bequeathing to folklore the story that he ignored an order to withdraw by putting a telescope to his blind eye to read the flag signal. He subsequently commanded fleets involved in a blockade of French ships in Toulon harbour, and in unsuccessful pursuit of the French and Spanish fleets to the West Indies. Only on October 21, 1805, did he finally bring the enemy to battle off Spain&rsquo;s Cape Trafalgar, which became his greatest victory and secured Britain against invasion by the vast army Napoleon had assembled on the Channel coast. At Trafalgar and in the actions that immediately followed, the French and Spanish lost 24 ships of the line, more than Nelson commanded when he engaged. He was shot down by a sharpshooter in the tops of the French Redoubt-able, and died three hours later. However some believe Nelson was a white supremacist, citing Nelson&rsquo;s friendships with West Indian slave traders, and his description of the ideals of abolitionist William Wilberforce as &lsquo;a damnable and cruel doctrine&rsquo;. Nelson&rsquo;s finest John Sugden, believes Nelson was exemplarily kind to black sailors who did good service on his ships, and in 1802 wrote another letter in support of a proposal by one of his own officers to employ free Chinese labour in the West Indies instead of slaves. What did he do ? The good: Secured victory for the British in the Battle of Trafalgar, the greatest naval victory in British history</p>
<p>The greatest British naval hero ever to have lived The bad: He described of ideals of abolitionist William Wilberforce as &lsquo;a damnable and cruel doctrine&rsquo; Who wants the statue removed? Goldsmiths Anti-Racist Action student group. Sir Robert Peel Sir Robert Peel (1788 - 1850), served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (left). Statues of Sir Robert Peel stand in London&rsquo;s Parliament Square (right), Glasgow&rsquo;s George Square, Bury and Manchester&rsquo;s Piccadilly Gardens Where is the statue? Statues of Sir Robert Peel stand in London&rsquo;s Parliament Square, Glasgow&rsquo;s George Square, Bury and Manchester&rsquo;s Piccadilly Gardens. Who wants the statue removed? Several petitions have been started by locals in Manchester - both to keep and remove the statue. Who is he? Sir Robert Peel (1788 - 1850), served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and is regarded as the father of modern British policing having founded the Metropolitan Police Service. He is also a founder of the The Conservative Party. Black Lives Matter activists have targeted statues of the former Prime Minister due to his father&rsquo;s involvement with the slave trade. A petition to remove Peel&rsquo;s statue in central Manchester was started by Sami Pinarbasi, who said Sir Robert is a &lsquo;icon of hate and racism&rsquo;. His father Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, (1750 - 1830), was a British politician, industrialist and textile manufacturer. He amassed wealth through industry and became one of ten known British millionaires in 1799. However to &lsquo;protect the cotton industry&rsquo; in Manchester Peel petitioned against the Foreign Slave Trade Abolition Bill. What did he do ? Good: Issued the Tamworth manifesto in 1834, laying down the founding principles for Britain&rsquo;s modern day Conservative party</p>
<p>Regarded as the father of British policing, founding Metropolitan Police in 1829 - and was against having an armed police force</p>

His statue stands in Shrewsbury Square and King Charles Street, London. Who is he? Robert Clive was an East India Company officer who helped Britain seize control of much of the subcontinent in the mid-18th century and was hailed back in Westminster for delivering important military victories without formal field training. But his reputation was muddied by his spell as Governor of Bengal from 1755 when he faced accusations of corruption. Amid a fierce backlash to his rule in India, as well as sliding health, he took his own life in 1767. At the time of his death, Clive&rsquo;s fortune was worth about £500,000 - around £33million today. What did he do ? The bad: Conquered Bengal at the Battle of Plassey, and helped himself to £160,000 from the defeated Nawab&rsquo;s treasury</p>
<p>Caused the Bengal famine of 1770 with his taxes on Indians and changes to agricultural practices that killed an estimated 10 million Indians</p>

Who wants his statue removed? A petition to Plymouth City Council claiming to be in support of Black Lives Matter, has amassed over 1,000 signatures. Who was he? Sir Francis Drake (1540 - 1596) was an English admiral and renowned Elizabethan seaman who circumnavigated the globe. He spent much of his career plundering ports in South America and the Carribean, particularly those owned by the Spanish, who branded him a pirate. He was knighted for his efforts and made Vice Admiral of the Navy where he was instrumental during the successful defence of the Spanish Armada in 1588. What did he do?

His state, 150ft high, on the top of the Melville Monument in St Andrew Square, Edinburgh, Scotland Where is the statue? On the top of the Melville Monument in St Andrew Square, Edinburgh, Scotland. Who wants his statue removed? A petition to the Scottish government was started by Nancy Barrett last week.

Who was he? Henry Dundas (1742 – 1811) was a Conservative politician, Scottish Advocate and the first Secretary of State for War - he is best known for delaying the abolition of slavery in 1792. During his time as Home Secretary Dundas proposed that slavery be abolished in &lsquo;three stages&rsquo; over a decade, which prolonged the suffering and cost thousands of lives. He gained the nickname of &lsquo;The Great Tyrant&rsquo; which he lived up to when he was caught misusing public money in 1806 and impeached.</p>

He made his fortune through ownership of a very large amount of shares in the South Sea Company, whose main purpose was to sell slaves to the Spanish Colonies. The South Sea Company was responsible for the transportation of around 64,000 enslaved Africans between 1715 and 1731 to Spanish plantations in Central and Southern America. After selling his shares in South Sea Company at the peak of their value, Guy used his massive fortune to establish Guy&rsquo;s Hospital for &lsquo;the poorest and sickest of the poor&rsquo; in London. What did he do ? The bad: He bought £42,000 shares in the South Sea Company, amassing a fortune when he sold them in 1720</p>

William Beckford (1709-1770) was a Slave owner and politician. He was born in Jamaica, the son Peter Beckford, one of the most powerful slave-owners of the colonial era. Peter had purchased sugar plantations on the Caribbean island in 1661, where he also served as Speaker of the legislature. When both Peter and William&rsquo;s elder brother - also Peter - died, he inherited the enormous fortune and estate which included 13 plantations and over 1,000 slaves. By the time of his death, Beckford&rsquo;s plantations were raking in over £50,000 each year and he is estimated to have amassed £1million in the bank - an eye-watering sum in 18th century Britain. In the early 1700s he returned to London and used his riches to buy the sprawling Fonthill estate in Wiltshire, which he stuffed with art and expensive furniture. The house burned down in 1755, but Beckford poured money and resources into rebuilding it. He later embarked on a political career and was elected as an MP in 1754 before serving twice as Lord Mayor of London in 1762 and 1769. Beckford also used his money to bankroll the rise of future prime minister William Pitt the Elder and ferociously lobbied in favour of the West Indies sugar industry. In 1758, when Pitt was in the cabinet, Beckford advised him to attack the French in the island of Martinique because of the lucrative haul of slaves they could capture. Beckford had nine children, eight of which were out of wedlock. The only son he had with his wife, Maria Marsh, was the novelist William Thomas Beckford. Despite enslaving scores of men, at home he banged the drum for liberties, and once even answered back to King George after he arrested notorious critic John Wilkes. What did he do?

Protestors claim that it has links to slave ship owner and anti-abolitionist James Penny who defended slavery</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The Mayor of Liverpool has slapped down calls to change the street name Penny Lane after allegations resurfaced that it is linked to an 18th Century slave ship owner.</p>
<p>Joe Anderson said there is no evidence to support the claim that the south Liverpool road - made famous by The Beatles&rsquo; song of the same name - is derived from James Penny, a merchant and anti-abolitionist who made his wealth working from Merseyside.</p>
<p>The landmark was not included in a list of dozens of statues, street names and artworks that Black Lives Matter protestors are demanding should be taken down due to connections to the slave trade</p>
<p>Speaking to followers on social media this week, the reflective Labour mayor admitted that Liverpool &lsquo;has not done anywhere near enough in making changes’ to help ethnic minorities, and after making an apology for the inaction said the council needed to &lsquo;follow up&rsquo; by making changes.</p>
<p>But when a Twitter user challenged Mr Anderson to take &lsquo;the bold step&rsquo; and change Penny Lane’s name, he responded by saying there is &lsquo;no evidence that “Penny Lane” is named after slave trader James Penny&rsquo;, saying it comes instead from a historic toll bridge &lsquo;that cost a penny&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;We are working with BAME community and historians to look at this and what we should do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now at least 72 memorials honouring colonial figures have been targeted for destruction of activists on its &lsquo;Topple the Racists&rsquo; website and yesterday they forced the removal of 18th Century slave dealer Robert Milligan from outside the Museum of London in West India Quay, Docklands.</p>
<p>The move began on Sunday when Black Lives Matter protestors in Bristol tore down slave trader Edward Colston&rsquo;s statue and rolled it into the harbour.</p>
<p>Over 130 councils have now announced plans to review monuments in their authorities for &lsquo;appropriateness&rsquo;, and London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he would conduct his own review into statues and street names in the capital.</p>
<p>Mayor Anderson also announced that Liverpool Council will proceed with plans to fix signs describing Liverpool&rsquo;s role in slavery to roads named after slave owners. Roads that could be included are Rodney Street, Parr Street and Earle Street in the city centre, but not Penny Lane.</p>
<p>Penny Lane became famous after The Beatles released a song of the same name and now the road has become a place where many fans visit to commemorate the band.</p>
<p>As debate rages over the future of many of Britain&rsquo;s most famous monuments, it has also emerged:</p>
<p>Boris Johnson reiterated that &lsquo;black lives matter&rsquo; to him during fiery PMQs with Sir Keir Starmer;</p>
<p>Colston&rsquo;s School in Bristol is considering changing its name after statue of Edward Colston was torn down on Sunday;</p>
<p>Oxford University chancellor Chris Patten accuses Cecil Rhodes statue protesters of &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; because imperialist&rsquo;s trust funds scholarships for 20 African students a year;</p>
<p>An Oxford-educated museum curator tweets to BLM supporters instructions on how to destroy statues with household chemicals - and says next target should be memorial to Winston Churchill&rsquo;s Parliament Square statue;</p>

<p>The road is not believed to have any connection to James Penny a merchant and slave ship owner who infamously opposed the abolition of slavery. In an inquiry into the slave trade following America&rsquo;s declaration of independence, Penny even defended the slave trade to the British Parliament.</p>
<p>It comes as the University of Liverpool has said it has agreed to change the name of its Gladstone Hall residential building after a group of students called on it to remove former Prime Minister William Gladstone&rsquo;s name due to &lsquo;his views on slavery&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In London, the internationally-renowned Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London has revealed it will consider whether to remove a statue of its founder Sir Thomas Guy - but will not change its name - as a senior minister backed a Black Lives Matter campaign to topple upwards of 70 monuments to slave traders.</p>
<p>Sir Thomas helped set up the hospital near London Bridge in 1721 having made his fortune in the 17th and 18th centuries as a major shareholder of a company selling slaves to the Spanish Colonies.</p>
<p>Today Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; welcomed Mayor of London Sadiq Khan&rsquo;s review of statues and street names in the capital and said the future of its own monument to its founder outside the Guy&rsquo;s building should be considered.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: &lsquo;We recognise and understand the anger felt by the black community and are fully committed to playing our part in ending racism, discrimination and inequality&rsquo;, adding: &lsquo;There are no plans to change the name of the hospital&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Today Boris Johnson&rsquo;s Business and Industry Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who was born in Iraq and moved to the UK with his Kurdish parents aged nine, said there should be no statues of slave traders in Britain.</p>
<p>Mr Zahawi said they should not be torn down illegally like Edward Colston&rsquo;s in Bristol, but said: &lsquo;Any slave trader should not have a statue. But I wouldn&rsquo;t be breaking the law to take statues down, it should be done through our democratic process. It should be up to local people to decide what they want to do. If the majority of people decide that we want the statues down, then they should be taken down&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The removal of a statue of the so-called &lsquo;Tyrant of Trinidad&rsquo; Sir Thomas Picton from Cardiff city hall is nearing success as all of Labour&rsquo;s 130 UK local authorities agreed to draw up a list of controversial statues in their communities which could be ripped down after Edward Colston&rsquo;s was destroyed in Bristol on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cardiff City Council&rsquo;s leader Huw Thomas has backed the campaign to rip it down calling it an &lsquo;affront&rsquo; to black people in the Welsh capital because he executed dozens of slaves. He was even put on trial in England for illegally torturing a 14-year-old girl - extremely rare at the turn of the 19th century - but after being convicted he successfully appealed.</p>
<p>While noting Picton&rsquo;s statue commemorated his part in the Napoleonic Wars and being the highest ranking officer to die at Waterloo, Councillor Thomas said: &lsquo;The growing awareness and understanding of the brutal nature of his governorship of Trinidad and his involvement in slavery makes it, in my view, very difficult to reconcile his presence in City Hall&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A 25ft obelisk dedicated to him on the outskirts of Carmarthen town centre, which has been there since 1888, is also subject to a petition for removal. It stands on Picton Terrace, which also faces calls to be renamed.</p>
<p>There are at least five statues of two-time British prime minister Sir Robert Peel also under threat because his MP father, also called Robert Peel, campaigned for slavery to continue. His son is considered the father of the modern police, after setting up the Met as Home Secretary in 1829. Some BLM supporters are also angry because of his links to policing.</p>
<p>A statue of Sir Thomas Guy, sits outside Guy&rsquo;s Hospital, which he founded in 1721 with £19,000 of his own money, equivalent to £2million today. Today the NHS Trust admitted it would consider its removal in a review set up by Sadiq Khan demands it because he made his money from slavery. Former bookseller Thomas Guy made his fortune through the ownership of shares in the South Sea Company, which had a monopoly on trafficking slaves to Spain&rsquo;s colonies in South America in 1713</p>
<p>The next to fall? This tribute to Sir Thomas Picton in Cardiff City Hall is expected to fall after the council&rsquo;s leader also demanded its removal. There are at least five statues of two-time British prime minister Sir Robert Peel (right in Parliament Square) also under threat because his MP father, also called Robert Peel, campaigned for slavery to continue</p>
<p>An aerial view of the Sir Thomas Picton obelisk on Picton Terrace in Camerthen, Wales, which is also on the BLM supporters&rsquo; hit list. Picton was known as the &lsquo;Tyrant of Trinidad&rsquo; owing to his brutal regime as governor of the Caribbean island. In 1806 he was convicted of ordering the illegal torture of a 14-year-old girl, Louisa Calderon. A charge that was later overturned.</p>
<p>Thomas Guy: The London bookseller who made his fortune through shares in slave trading firm&hellip; then sold them to found hospital in his name Former bookseller Thomas Guy made his fortune through the ownership of shares in the South Sea Company, which had a monopoly on trafficking slaves to Spain&rsquo;s colonies in South America in 1713. The British firm was created predominantly to sell enslaved people and had a target to trade 4,800 adult men every year. Guy sold his shares in the company at the top of the market in 1720, letting £50,000 of stock go for more than £250,000 - the equivalent of £400million in modern-day prices. Having created almshouses, he founded Guy&rsquo;s Hospital close to this London birthplace with the aim of providing care to &lsquo;incurables and lunatics&rsquo;. He died in 1724 and his will was so complex and so high in value that an Act of Parliament was needed to enact it, and he left nearly £220,000 to the hospital. The bulk of his estate was left in trust to complete work on the hospital, while a further sum was set aside for the release of prisoners in the capital who owed debts. Advertisement</p>
<p>In Edinburgh SNP city council leader Adam McVey said he would feel &lsquo;no sense of loss&rsquo; if a statue to Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of slavery, was removed, amid mounting calls for action in the Scottish capital.</p>
<p>Also in Scotland a memorial to General James George Smith Neill, which stands in Wellington Square, Ayr, is also under threat. General Neill served during the Indian rebellion of 1857 and accused of ordering the deaths of many Indians following the Bibighar massacre.</p>
<p>Plymouth council said a public square named after slave trader Sir John Hawkins would be renamed while in nearby Exeter council chiefs will review the future of the city&rsquo;s statue of General Buller, who is rumoured to have had a hand in the introduction of concentration camps seen during the Boer War.</p>
<p>A debate has erupted over the legacy of 19th century prime minister Sir Robert Peel after those calling for his statues to be removed were accused of targeting the wrong man.</p>
<p>Lancashire-born Sir Robert, who is best known for founding the Metropolitan Police, is immortalised in a number of statues across the north of England and Scotland.</p>
<p>Five of these - in Leeds, Glasgow, Bury, Manchester and Preston - were included on a map of possible other targets following the toppling of the monument to Edward Colston in Bristol.</p>
<p>The Glasgow statue was daubed with graffiti at the weekend.</p>
<p>But many people have come to the two-time PM&rsquo;s defence, suggesting anti-racist campaigners may have got the wrong Sir Robert.</p>
<p>References to him being a vocal opponent of the abolition of slavery because it threatened his fortune in the cotton trade appear to have confused him with his father, also called Sir Robert Peel.</p>
<p>At a press conference in Leeds on Wednesday, Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake said: &lsquo;There seems to be now a recognition that there has been some misunderstanding about the Robert Peel whose statue is in Leeds and that it was actually his father who worked in the cotton trade.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very interesting looking at comments over in the North West where he was born in Bury. There&rsquo;s a really strong reaction that actually Robert Peel was a reformer and did do many things that have had a lasting impression and impact, not least establishing a police force that doesn&rsquo;t carry arms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said: &lsquo;I think there is a feeling there is a misunderstanding here which is that his father had links to the slave trade rather than Peel himself, or the Peel who is commemorated in different places in Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>Dozens more monuments are expected to fall after all 130 Labour-led authorities in England, Wales and Scotland have come together to promise to &lsquo;review the appropriateness of local monuments and statues on public land and council property&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 130 Labour councils won the blessing of Sir Keir Starmer&rsquo;s central party, but senior Tories have lined up to admonish the behaviour.</p>
<p>Andrew Rosindell, Conservative MP for Romford, told MailOnline the wave of statue scrutiny was being driven by &lsquo;a politically-correct gang of anarchists who hate everything about this country&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mayor of London Sadiq Khan is also conducting his own review of statues in the capital and believes all the city&rsquo;s slave trader monuments should be axed.</p>
<p>Campaigners have set their sights on statues on private property, such as the monument of Cecil Rhodes at Oxford University, where yesterday crowds of protesters rallied.</p>
<p>A statue of the colonialist who claimed Bermuda as part of the British Empire has been vandalised amid anti-racism protests.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;murderer&rsquo; has been daubed across an information board next to the bronze figure of Sir George Somers in Lyme Regis, Dorset.</p>
<p>Somers discovered the island in 1609 after his ship, destined for Virigina, US, was blown off course by a hurricane.</p>
<p>He died there just a year later by which time the region had been claimed by the British Crown.</p>
<p>A bustling slave trade later emerged on the island in the 1640s.</p>
<p>By 1720 there were more than 3,500 slaves among a population of just 8,000 people.</p>
<p>Many have since argued that Somers&rsquo; discovery paved the way for slavery - which is believed to be why his statue has now been targeted.</p>
<p>Yet another 19th century statue - of the man who found lost explorer Dr David Livingstone in an African jungle looks set for the chop.</p>
<p>A petition to remove the statue of Sir Henry Stanley from the centre of Denbiegh in Wales - where he was born - has already attracted more than 1,500 signatures.</p>
<p>The tribute to Sir Henry was installed by Denbigh Town Council ten years ago and re-creates the moment he uttered the famous phrase - &lsquo;Dr Livingstone, I presume?&rsquo; - when he found the explorer in East Africa in 1871.</p>
<p>There was criticism at the time amid claims that the 19th-century explorer was guilty of crimes against humanity and supported slavery.</p>
<p>Organiser Simon Jones said: &lsquo;Out of respect to the Black Lives Matter campaign, the statue of Stanley should be removed from Denbigh town centre immediately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was known for his brutal treatment of Africans to the extent that he used to shoot black children from his boat to calibrate his rifle sights while sailing down river.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A statue to a man like that has no place in Welsh society in 2020. It is an insult to African people that it stands pride of place in the town.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter demonstrators were joined by a police chief constable taking the knee at a special event in memory of George Floyd.</p>
<p>Kent Police&rsquo;s Alan Pughsley is believed to be the first top cop in the UK to kneel in solidarity with the 46-year-old&rsquo;s death in Minneapolis, USA.</p>
<p>Mr Pughsley was filmed performing the symbolic gesture at an event in Gravesend, Kent while other officers also joined the socially distanced group of more than 50 people.</p>
<p>Last night in London there was a commemoration event, organised by Stand Up To Racism, to mark George Floyd&rsquo;s funeral in Houston, Texas, with police forming a ring of steel around statues including Sir Winston Churchill&rsquo;s in case it is attacked again.</p>
<p>Workmen were yesterday seen uprooting a statue of Robert Milligan from its spot on West India Quay in London&rsquo;s docklands to cheers from spectators. Protesters had drawn up a hit list of 60 &lsquo;racist&rsquo; monuments to be taken down, including Milligan&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Amid growing pressure to act, the charity Canal and River Trust worked with the Museum of London and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets to remove the bronze figure of the Scottish merchant who owned 526 slaves at his Jamaican sugar plantation.</p>
<p>Statues glorifying slave traders and colonialists have come into sharp focus in recent days, as part of a broader movement inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests that started in the United States following the death of George Floyd on May 25.</p>
<p>On Sunday, protesters in Bristol tore down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston and threw it in the harbour, receiving a mixed reactions of celebrations from anti-racism campaigners and protestors while some politicians and officials questioned the &lsquo;anti-democratic&rsquo; manner in how the statue was taken down.</p>
<p>And in Oxford yesterday more than 1,000 demonstrators have demanded the removal of a statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes, an imperialist who provided philanthropical support to Oriel College in Oxford University where the monument stands.</p>
<p>The Canal and River Trust, which owns the land where Milligan&rsquo;s statue is located, issued a statement on Twitter following a petition launched by Tower Hamlets Labour councillor Ehtasham Haque, which demanded the removal of the figure and reached over 1,000 signatures in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Exeter City Council, a Labour authority, will review the future of the city&rsquo;s statue of General Redvers Buller - who was linked to the introduction of concentration camps in the Boer War. The Old Etonian was awarded the Victoria Cross in the Zulu War after rescuing a number of comrades under fire, before being promoted to the Head of the Army and sent to South Africa at the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;murderer&rsquo; has been daubed across an information board next to the bronze figure of Sir George Somers in Lyme Regis, Dorset. Sir Somers was English privateer who claimed the English colony of Bermuda, also known as the Somers Isles.</p>

<p>&lsquo;While it&rsquo;s a sad truth that much of our city and nation&rsquo;s wealth was derived from the slave trade, this does not have to be celebrated in our public spaces,&rsquo; said London Mayor Sadiq Khan in a tweet with a photo of the statue.</p>
<p>John Biggs, the mayor of Tower Hamlets, posted a video of himself at the scene, in which he says: &lsquo;This has become the focus of a lot of anxiety and anger in our community. We need to take it, put it into storage and then talk about what we can learn from this and how we can help these events to make us a stronger community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Museum of London said it &lsquo;recognises that the monument is part of the ongoing problematic regime of white-washing history, which disregards the pain of those who are still wrestling with the remnants of the crimes Milligan committed against humanity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The commemorative statue, sculpted by Richard Westmacott, was commissioned by the West India Dock Company, of which Milligan was Chairman, following his death in May 1809. He also has a street in the area named after him, Milligan Street, near Westferry DLR station.</p>
<p>The museum also tweeted: &lsquo;The statue presently stands shrouded with placards and is now an object of protest, we believe these protests should remain as long as the statue remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The decision follows huge crowds of Black Lives Matter supporters gathering outside Oriel College at the University of Oxford last night to campaign for a monument of imperialist Cecil Rhodes to be removed.</p>
<p>The demonstration was organised by the Rhodes Must Fall campaign group and came after activists identified 60 UK statues they want removed for &lsquo;celebrating slavery and racism&rsquo; as councils and museums rushed to bring down their controversial monuments.</p>
<p>Some of Briton&rsquo;s most famous people on the hit list include the Edinburgh statue of former Home Secretary Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of slavery, and a statue of Sir Francis Drake on Plymouth Hoe.</p>
<p>The interactive map, called &lsquo;topple the racists&rsquo;, was set up by the Stop Trump Coalition in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, and lists plaques and monuments in more than 30 towns and cities across the UK. The online list is unregulated and can be added to by the public.</p>
<p>At last night&rsquo;s Oxford protest, organisers placed chalk crosses on the floors in either side of the street outside the entrance to the college, to enforce social distancing.</p>
<p>The crowd took to their knees for eight minutes 46 seconds, to reflect the time Mr Floyd, a father-of-two, spent with a police officer kneeling on his neck which killed him in America last month.</p>
<p>Hours before the rally began Oxford City Council&rsquo;s leader Susan Brown wrote to Oriel College inviting them to apply for planning permission to remove the statue, after 26 councillors signed a letter saying it is &lsquo;incompatible&rsquo; with the city&rsquo;s &lsquo;commitment to anti-racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Councillor Brown said: &lsquo;Typically such actions are only allowed in the most exceptional of circumstances. But these are exceptional circumstances, and as a city council we are keen to work with Oriel to help them find the right balance between the laws that protect our historic buildings and the moral obligation to reflect on the malign symbolism of this statue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oriel College has said it will &lsquo;continue to debate&rsquo; the issue - but did not commit to removing it.</p>
<p>Ndjodi Ndeunyema, an Oxford University law student and a former Rhodes scholar, organised las night&rsquo;s Oxford rally after starting the Rhodes Must Fall campaign for its removal five years ago, and said: &lsquo;The statue remaining is an affront on the university&rsquo;s support for movements such as Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rhodes is not worth of veneration or glorification because of the racism and subjugation he represents&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Protesters also packed into Leicester city centre last night during another evening of demonstrations against racism.</p>
<p>It comes as the University of Leicester has increased its efforts to &lsquo;decolonise the curriculum&rsquo; in subjects like English, history and law in recent months - and it is launching a scheme to recruit more BAME academics in teaching roles.</p>
<p>Professor Nishan Canagarajah, vice-chancellor of the university, said: &lsquo;It is about a sense of belonging in the university. That comes from having students who are diverse, from having staff who are diverse, and from having a curriculum that is diverse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not something you can easily fix because I think the students have certain perceptions and that&rsquo;s not going to change overnight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They see certain universities as not welcoming for them. That may not be true, but that might be what they have been feeling since they were very young.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think if you go and visit Oxford and places like Bristol you will think they&rsquo;re welcoming for ethnic minorities, but there is a gap between that reality and what the community outside perceives them to be, as not really representing them. I know these universities are taking a lot of action to address that.</p>
<p>More than half (52%) of students are from a BAME background at the University of Leicester but currently only 14.2% of teaching staff and 9.8% of professors are from a BAME background.</p>

<p>Oxford University chancellor Chris Patten accuses Cecil Rhodes statue protesters of &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; because imperialist&rsquo;s trust funds scholarships for 20 African students a year Lord Chris Patten (pictured left), who has no power to remove the Rhodes statue (pictured right), located at Oxford University&rsquo;s Oriel College, said a trust set up after the mining magnate&rsquo;s death pays for the education of more than a dozen African students at the prestigious each year. The chancellor of Oxford University has hit out at the &lsquo;hypocrisy&rsquo; around protests to remove a statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Lord Chris Patten, who has no power to remove the Rhodes statue, located at Oxford University&rsquo;s Oriel College, said a trust set up after the mining magnate&rsquo;s death pays for the education of more than a dozen African students at the prestigious university each year. But he also called for a &lsquo;sensible discussion&rsquo; over the removal of Rhodes&rsquo; statue, which has become a focal point amid continuing anti-racism protests from the Black Lives Matter movement - who at the weekend toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. Meanwhile, concern continues that Oriel College chiefs may be reluctant to remove the statue over fears they face the loss of millions of pounds in funding, as revealed by a leaked report in 2016. Commenting on the protests, Lord Patten, who was the last Governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997 and Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1992, told BBC Radio Four&rsquo;s Today Programme: &lsquo;Firstly I am very pleased the demonstrations were peaceful and secondly I don&rsquo;t make the decision on whether the statue comes down&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The university has launched a £1.5 million annual scheme to create three funded PhD studentships and ten postgraduate scholarships to attract students from BAME backgrounds into academia.</p>
<p>And from this year, the English BA at Leicester has been changed to include more diverse texts and authors set and written in countries across the world.</p>
<p>The reading list now includes Giovanni&rsquo;s Room by James Baldwin, Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys and NW by Zadie Smith.</p>
<p>A history teacher who was standing opposite the Cecil Rhodes statue revealed he had travelled from London to &lsquo;guard it&rsquo; as he felt that it should not be brought down.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who did not want to give his name, said: &lsquo;I am here to make sure they do not tear it down. I am a history teacher and about seven years ago I went to the grave of Cecil Rhodes in Zimbabwe after sitting with the Matabele chiefs.</p>
<p>The teacher wore a tweed suit and a fedora hat, while clutching a paperback copy of a book called &lsquo;1066 and all that&rsquo; behind his back.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;Accounts of Cecil Rhodes that are being printed are one-sided and while I definitely think a plaque or something would be a good idea, we do not tear things down and we certainly do not do it without due process. I am going to talk to my school about the monuments and the children will debate the legacy and the history.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you dig into most of the statues in London, you get some pretty horrible things. I do not suppose that tearing things down just because 2,000 people ask for it is in any way correct.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The teacher watched as a woman organiser began to speak though a megaphone and chanted &lsquo;down with the king of the blood diamond&rsquo; and &lsquo;take it down&rsquo; which the crowd of several hundred people echoed.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;It is about time you started to listen to the people of this city and not your funders. We want this statue down. We declare ourselves anti-racist and we do not want this statue in our city. It does not reflect our own views, it does not reflect our values.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sadiq Khan has called for the removal of all slave trader statues in the capital as he promised to personally &lsquo;review and improve&rsquo; the diversity of the capital&rsquo;s landmarks. The Mayor of London has launched his own Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm after Black Lives Matter protesters pulled down the monument to Edward Colston in Bristol and hurled it in the city&rsquo;s harbour.</p>
<p>Mayor Khan today said he wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;pre-empt&rsquo; the commission&rsquo;s findings on the suitability of London&rsquo;s street names, murals, statues and memorials, but admitted he would like any statues of slave traders removed in London and to build more &lsquo;people of colour, black people, women, those from the LGBT community&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The Queen Victoria Statue in Woodhouse Moor Park in Leeds today, West Yorkshire which has had &lsquo;Black Lives Matter&rsquo;, &lsquo;BLM&rsquo; and &lsquo;Slave Owner&rsquo; spray painted on it. Queen Victoria became the British monarch in 1837, four years after the Abolition of Slavery Act.</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter and &lsquo;slave owner&rsquo; were among the phrases daubed on the statue of Queen Victoria in Woodhouse Moor Park in Leeds before being removed today.</p>
<p>Who are the men behind the statues BLM activists want to tear down Cecil Rhodes Where is his statue? A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university Who was he? Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902) was the Former Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, the modern day South Africa. He was a British supremacist, imperialist, mining magnate, and politician in southern Africa who drove the annexation of vast swathes of Africa. What did he do? The bad • Colonised much of Southern Africa for Victorian Britain and established a vast new British territory in Rhodesia, today&rsquo;s Zimbabwe and Zambia • Rhodes believed that the British were &lsquo;the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race&rsquo; • He secured control of Rhodesia by swindling the king of Matabeleland, and showed scant regard for his African employees, whom he dismissed as &lsquo;n***ers&rsquo; • Founded De Beers mining company, trading diamonds mined with slave labour The good • Established Rhodes Scholarships, which paid for brilliant young students from former British possessions to study at Oxford, among them the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott Thomas Guy Where is his statue? Outside Guy&rsquo;s Hospital in London, England Guy was founder of Guys&rsquo; Hospital, London. He made his fortune through ownership of a very large amount of shares in the South Sea Company, whose main purpose was to sell slaves to the Spanish Colonies. The South Sea Company supplied 4800 slaves each year for 30 years to Spanish plantations in Central and Southern America What did he do ? The bad • He bought £42,000 shares in the South Sea Company, amassing a fortune when he sold them in 1720 • The South Sea Company supplied 4800 slaves each year for 30 years to Spanish plantations in Central and Southern America The good • He became a governor of St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, after building three wards • He later opened Guy&rsquo;s Hospital opposite St Thomas&rsquo; which cost him £19,000 • In his will Guy bequeathed financial support for prisoners with debt in London, Middlesex and Surrey to be released William Beckford - Slave owner and politician Where is his statue? In the Guildhall in London William Beckford (1709-1770) was born in Jamaica, the son Peter Beckford, one of the most powerful slave-owners of the colonial era. Peter had purchased sugar plantations on the Caribbean island in 1661, where he also served as Speaker of the legislature. When both Peter and William&rsquo;s elder brother - also Peter - died, he inherited the enormous fortune and estate which included 13 plantations and over 1,000 slaves. By the time of his death, Beckford&rsquo;s plantations were raking in over £50,000 each year and he is estimated to have amassed £1million in the bank - an eye-watering sum in 18th century Britain. In the early 1700s he returned to London and used his riches to buy the sprawling Fonthill estate in Wiltshire, which he stuffed with art and expensive furniture. The house burned down in 1755, but Beckford poured money and resources into rebuilding it. He later embarked on a political career and was elected as an MP in 1754 before serving twice as Lord Mayor of London in 1762 and 1769. Beckford also used his money to bankroll the rise of future prime minister William Pitt the Elder and ferociously lobbied in favour of the West Indies sugar industry. In 1758, when Pitt was in the cabinet, Beckford advised him to attack the French in the island of Martinique because of the lucrative haul of slaves they could capture. Beckford had nine children, eight of which were out of wedlock. The only son he had with his wife, Maria Marsh, was the novelist William Thomas Beckford. Despite enslaving scores of men, at home he banged the drum for liberties, and once even answered back to King George after he arrested notorious critic John Wilkes. What did he do? • Inherited and oversaw 13 sugar plantations and more than 1,000 slaves in Jamaica. • Campaigned for civil liberties as an MP and in 1770 demanded the King dissolve parliament to remove evil ministers.</p>
<p>But he said he did not think statues such as of Sir Winston Churchill&rsquo;s in Parliament Square should be included in the review it was tagged with &lsquo;racist&rsquo; on Sunday. He said Londoners needed to be educated about famous figures &lsquo;warts and all&rsquo; and that &lsquo;nobody was perfect&rsquo;, including the likes of Churchill, Gandhi and Malcolm X.</p>
<p>The leader of Oxford City Council has this afternoon invited Oriel College to make a planning request to remove the statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes, which has been at the centre of a long-running row.</p>
<p>Councillor Susan Brown said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m clear in my support for the Black Lives Matter movement and I have a great deal of sympathy with the Rhodes Must Fall campaign. The question of statues and their historical context is not a simple matter, but sometimes acts of symbolism are important. I know my views are shared by a majority of my fellow councillors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be better for the statue to be placed in a museum, such as the Ashmolean or the Museum of Oxford, to ensure this noteworthy piece of the story of our city isn&rsquo;t lost to history.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, bringing down statues alone isn&rsquo;t sufficient to address the issue of racism in our society and continued action on this should involve all our city&rsquo;s key institutions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have today written to Oriel College to invite them to apply for planning permission to remove the statue, as it is a Grade II* listed building&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In 2016, Oriel College decided to keep the statue despite widespread student demands to remove it. Campaigners from the Rhodes Must Fall group argued that the row illustrated Britain&rsquo;s &lsquo;imperial blind spot&rsquo;.</p>
<p>In a statement ahead of the protest, Oriel College pledged to discuss the issues raised by protests against the Rhodes statue.</p>
<p>The statement read: &lsquo;Oriel College abhors racism and discrimination in all its forms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Governing Body are deeply committed to equality within our community at Oriel, the University of Oxford and the wider world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As an academic institution we aim to fight prejudice and champion equal opportunities for everyone regardless of race, gender, sexuality or faith. We believe Black Lives Matter and support the right to peaceful protest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The power of education is a catalyst for equality and inclusiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We understand that we are, and we want to be, a part of the public conversation about the relationship between the study of history, public commemoration, social justice, and educational equality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As a college, we continue to debate and discuss the issues raised by the presence on our site of examples of contested heritage relating to Cecil Rhodes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Speaking out against injustice and discrimination is vital and we are committed to doing so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will continue to examine our practices and strive to improve them to ensure that Oriel is open to students and staff of all backgrounds, and we are determined to build a more equal and inclusive community and society.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Monuments that could be under threat in London would include statues of William Beckford at London&rsquo;s Guildhall, John Cass on Jewry Street and one Thomas Guy, which stands in the courtyard at Guy&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Campaigners are targeting statues all over the UK including a Edinburgh statue of Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of slavery in Scotland, while in Glasgow Barclays Bank has confirmed the &lsquo;Buchanan&rsquo; name will be dropped from a major riverside development over its connection with the slave trade.</p>
<p>The Sir Francis Drake statue on Plymouth&rsquo;s Hoe, where he was playing bowls when he learned Britain was set to be invaded by the Spanish Armada in 1588, is also said to be under threat after BLM supporters set up a &lsquo;topple the racists&rsquo; website mapping more than 30 statues and monuments organisers claim &lsquo;celebrate slavery and racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sadiq Khan said he &lsquo;hopes&rsquo; the new Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm will recommend some memorials in the capital should be removed.</p>
<p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today programme, the Mayor of London: &lsquo;One of the things that I realise is that I&rsquo;ve not got ownership of the statutes or indeed some of the land that these statues are on. But it is a wider conversation I want to have about the diversity of the public realm in our city.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you look at the public realm - street names, street squares, murals - not only are there some of slavers that I think should be taken down, and the commission will advise us on that, but actually we don&rsquo;t have enough representation of people of colour, black people, women, those from the LGBT community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But critics have called his approach &lsquo;distracting and divisive&rsquo;, with Shaun Bailey, Tory candidate for Mayor of London ,saying: &lsquo;He [Mayor Khan] is seeking to distract Londoners from the fact he failed to support his police service during the protests, allowing a small group to hijack a largely peaceful protest and betray the cause of fairness that the vast majority were there to promote. He should be focusing on keeping all Londoners safe and promoting opportunities for all people of colour&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Andrew Rosindell, MP for Romford, told MailOnline: &lsquo;I think the Mayor of London should be focusing on issues that matter to Londoners. Like the bankrupt TFL, the recent crime wave and many other issues.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ripping down our history is not something the Mayor was elected to do. Our history is who we are and you can find something bad in everything, be it prime ministers or anyone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The idea of going around London tearing down statues and renaming streets is absurd.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is pandering to a politically correct gang of anarchists who hate everything about this country - they are anti-British.&rsquo;</p>
<p>City Hall called London &lsquo;one of the most diverse cities in the world&rsquo;, but said the capital&rsquo;s statues, plaques and street names largely reflect Victorian Britain.</p>

<p>Several football &lsquo;firms&rsquo; plan further demonstrations. A group of Millwall fans spent part of yesterday guarding the statue of Churchill in Parliament Square.</p>

<p>Rally organiser Ndjodi Ndeunyema, a law student and former Rhodes scholar whose education has been partially funded by a trust set up by the 19th century colonialist, said: &lsquo;The statue remaining is an affront on the university&rsquo;s support for movements such as Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>Racists or heroes? It&rsquo;s not black or white: Black Lives Matter want to topple statues of some of the most famous Britons because of their links to colonialism and slavery - but they also gave fortunes away, and helped build Britain and a modern world</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter activists are calling for the removal of 60-plus statues of slave owners and racists across Britain. Top of their target list is the statue of Cecil Rhodes and petitions also exist to remove the statue of slave-trading West India Docks founder Robert Milligan, and the statue of former Home Secretary Henry Dundas who delayed the abolition of slavery and that stands atop a column in Edinburgh. But on a website called Topple The Racists, set up by Black Lives Matter activists, members are invited to propose other statues that should be torn down across Britain. There, a wide range of figures from Britain&rsquo;s colonial past are being proposed for destruction. Among them are leaders who held undeniably racist views and others who performed evil acts against people of colour, such as slave owners and Thomas Picton who ruled Trinidad with an iron fist and ordered the torture of a 14-year-old accused of theft. But others also played a leading role shaping the cities and institutions that form modern day Britain. The statues targeted by BLM activists are: Cecil Rhodes Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902). A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university Where is his statue? A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university. Who was he? Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902) was the Former Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, the modern day South Africa. He was a British supremacist, imperialist, mining magnate, and politician in southern Africa who drove the annexation of vast swathes of Africa. What did he do? The bad: Colonised much of Southern Africa for Victorian Britain and established a vast new British territory in Rhodesia, today&rsquo;s Zimbabwe and Zambia</p>
<p>Rhodes believed that the British were &lsquo;the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race&rsquo;</p>
<p>He secured control of Rhodesia by swindling the king of Matabeleland, and showed scant regard for his African employees, whom he dismissed as &lsquo;n***ers&rsquo;</p>
<p>Founded De Beers mining company, trading diamonds mined with slave labour The good: • Established Rhodes Scholarships, which paid for brilliant young students from former British possessions to study at Oxford, among them the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott Who wants the statue removed? University of Oxford campaigners claim that forcing ethnic minority students to walk past the Rhodes memorials amounts to &lsquo;violence&rsquo; as he helped pave the way for apartheid. Robert Milligan Robert Milligan (1746-1809) was a Scottish merchant and slave owner. His statue stands at West India Quay outside the Museum London Docklands Where is his statue? West India Quay outside the Museum London Docklands, where it has stood since 1997 after being moved from its original plinth nearby in 1813. Who was he? Robert Milligan (1746-1809) was a Scottish merchant and slave owner. He was born in Dumfries, Scotland, but soon moved to Kingston, Jamaica, where he managed his wealthy family&rsquo;s sugar plantations. He returned to London in 1779 where he became instrumental in the construction of the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs. According to the inscription on the bronze statue&rsquo;s plinth, it was to Milligan&rsquo;s &lsquo;genius, perseverance and guardian care&rsquo; that the docks owed their &lsquo;design, accomplishment and regulation&rsquo;. From the Docks, ships would sail to West Africa where shipowners such as Milligan bought enslaved Africans. The ships then crossed the seas to the Caribbean to buy sugar, rum and coffee before returning to England. At the time of his death in 1809, 526 slaves were registered on Milligan&rsquo;s Jamaican plant called Kellet&rsquo;s and Mammee Gully. What did he do? The Bad: Used slaves to amass great wealth through trade</p>
<p>Was a vocal opponent of the abolition of slavery The good: Built London&rsquo;s docks: Pooled together a group of wealthy businessmen to create the West India Docks which brought in shiploads of produce to England Who wants the statue removed? Tower Hamlets councillor Ehtasham Haque has started a petition for the statue of Robert Milligan to be removed from Canary Wharf. He said: &lsquo;He has no place in London, and he does not deserve the honour of a statue&rsquo;. Horatio Nelson Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758 - 1805) was a British flag officer in the Royal Navy known for inspirational leadership. Nelson&rsquo;s column, Trafalgar Square, London (right) Where is the statue? Nelson&rsquo;s column, Trafalgar Square, London has not been targeted. But another statue of Nelson has been at Deptford Town Hall, a department at Goldsmiths University, London. Who is he? Horatio Nelson was born in a Norfolk rectory in 1758, and secured his first command 20 years later through the influence of his uncle, who was a senior naval officer. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars opened the way for a long succession of triumphs, the earliest taking place in the Mediterranean, where he was blinded in his right eye. He distinguished himself commanding HMS Captain at the 1797 Battle of Cape St Vincent against a larger Spanish force off the coast of Portugal, and mislaid his right arm in the unsuccessful action at Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In the following year, he commanded a British fleet in the first of his historic victories at the Battle of the Nile. Nelson&rsquo;s reputation — for personal courage, aggression and tactical brilliance — won him the adoration of his captains and indeed crews. In 1801, he secured another victory, this time over the Danes, at Copenhagen, bequeathing to folklore the story that he ignored an order to withdraw by putting a telescope to his blind eye to read the flag signal. He subsequently commanded fleets involved in a blockade of French ships in Toulon harbour, and in unsuccessful pursuit of the French and Spanish fleets to the West Indies. Only on October 21, 1805, did he finally bring the enemy to battle off Spain&rsquo;s Cape Trafalgar, which became his greatest victory and secured Britain against invasion by the vast army Napoleon had assembled on the Channel coast. At Trafalgar and in the actions that immediately followed, the French and Spanish lost 24 ships of the line, more than Nelson commanded when he engaged. He was shot down by a sharpshooter in the tops of the French Redoubt-able, and died three hours later. However some believe Nelson was a white supremacist, citing Nelson&rsquo;s friendships with West Indian slave traders, and his description of the ideals of abolitionist William Wilberforce as &lsquo;a damnable and cruel doctrine&rsquo;.

In the early 1700s he returned to London and used his riches to buy the sprawling Fonthill estate in Wiltshire, which he stuffed with art and expensive furniture.

<h3 id="racists-or-heroes-black-lives-matter-want-to-topple-statues-of-famous-britons-due-to-slavery-links">&ldquo;Racists or heroes? Black Lives Matter want to topple statues of famous Britons due to slavery links&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/09/21/29421058-0-image-a-2_1591735682823.jpg" alt="img">
Black Lives Matter activists are calling for the removal of 60 statues of slave owners and racists across Britain.</p>
<p>Top of their target list is the statue of Cecil Rhodes and petitions also exist to remove the statue of slave-trading West India Docks founder Robert Milligan, and the statue of former Home Secretary Henry Dundas who delayed the abolition of slavery and that stands atop a column in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>But on a website called Topple The Racists, set up by Black Lives Matter activists, members are invited to propose other statues that should be torn down across Britain.</p>
<p>There, a wide range of figures from Britain&rsquo;s colonial past are being proposed for destruction.</p>
<p>Among them are leaders who held undeniably racist views and others who performed evil acts against people of colour, such as slave owners and Thomas Picton who ruled Trinidad with an iron fist and ordered the torture of a 14-year-old accused of theft.</p>
<p>But others also played a leading role shaping the cities and institutions that form modern day Britain.</p>
<p>The statues targeted by BLM activists are:</p>
<p>Cecil Rhodes</p>
<p>Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902). A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university</p>
<p>Where is his statue?</p>
<p>A 4ft statue of Rhodes stands outside Oriel College at Oxford university.</p>
<p>Who was he?</p>
<p>Cecil Rhodes (1853 - 1902) was the Former Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, the modern day South Africa. He was a British supremacist, imperialist, mining magnate, and politician in southern Africa who drove the annexation of vast swathes of Africa.</p>
<p>What did he do?</p>
<p>The bad:</p>
<p>Colonised much of Southern Africa for Victorian Britain and established a vast new British territory in Rhodesia, today&rsquo;s Zimbabwe and Zambia</p>
<p>Rhodes believed that the British were &lsquo;the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race&rsquo;</p>
<p>He secured control of Rhodesia by swindling the king of Matabeleland, and showed scant regard for his African employees, whom he dismissed as &lsquo;n***ers&rsquo;</p>
<p>Founded De Beers mining company, trading diamonds mined with slave labour</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<p>• Established Rhodes Scholarships, which paid for brilliant young students from former British possessions to study at Oxford, among them the former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott</p>
<p>Who wants the statue removed?</p>
<p>University of Oxford campaigners claim that forcing ethnic minority students to walk past the Rhodes memorials amounts to &lsquo;violence&rsquo; as he helped pave the way for apartheid.</p>
<p>Robert Milligan</p>
<p>Robert Milligan (1746-1809) was a Scottish merchant and slave owner. His statue stands at West India Quay outside the Museum London Docklands</p>
<p>Where is his statue?</p>
<p>West India Quay outside the Museum London Docklands, where it has stood since 1997 after being moved from its original plinth nearby in 1813.</p>
<p>Who was he?</p>
<p>Robert Milligan (1746-1809) was a Scottish merchant and slave owner. He was born in Dumfries, Scotland, but soon moved to Kingston, Jamaica, where he managed his wealthy family&rsquo;s sugar plantations.</p>
<p>He returned to London in 1779 where he became instrumental in the construction of the West India Docks on the Isle of Dogs. According to the inscription on the bronze statue&rsquo;s plinth, it was to Milligan&rsquo;s &lsquo;genius, perseverance and guardian care&rsquo; that the docks owed their &lsquo;design, accomplishment and regulation&rsquo;.</p>
<p>From the Docks, ships would sail to West Africa where shipowners such as Milligan bought enslaved Africans.</p>
<p>The ships then crossed the seas to the Caribbean to buy sugar, rum and coffee before returning to England.</p>
<p>At the time of his death in 1809, 526 slaves were registered on Milligan&rsquo;s Jamaican plant called Kellet&rsquo;s and Mammee Gully.</p>
<p>What did he do?</p>
<p>The Bad:</p>
<p>Used slaves to amass great wealth through trade</p>
<p>Was a vocal opponent of the abolition of slavery</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<p>Built London&rsquo;s docks: Pooled together a group of wealthy businessmen to create the West India Docks which brought in shiploads of produce to England</p>
<p>Who wants the statue removed?</p>
<p>Tower Hamlets councillor Ehtasham Haque has started a petition for the statue of Robert Milligan to be removed from Canary Wharf. He said: &lsquo;He has no place in London, and he does not deserve the honour of a statue&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Horatio Nelson</p>
<p>Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson (1758 - 1805) was a British flag officer in the Royal Navy known for inspirational leadership. Nelson&rsquo;s column, Trafalgar Square, London (right)</p>
<p>Where is the statue?</p>
<p>Nelson&rsquo;s column, Trafalgar Square, London has not been targeted. But another statue of Nelson has been at Deptford Town Hall, a department at Goldsmiths University, London.</p>
<p>Who is he?</p>
<p>Horatio Nelson was born in a Norfolk rectory in 1758, and secured his first command 20 years later through the influence of his uncle, who was a senior naval officer. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars opened the way for a long succession of triumphs, the earliest taking place in the Mediterranean, where he was blinded in his right eye. He distinguished himself commanding HMS Captain at the 1797 Battle of Cape St Vincent against a larger Spanish force off the coast of Portugal, and mislaid his right arm in the unsuccessful action at Santa Cruz de Tenerife. In the following year, he commanded a British fleet in the first of his historic victories at the Battle of the Nile.</p>
<p>Nelson&rsquo;s reputation — for personal courage, aggression and tactical brilliance — won him the adoration of his captains and indeed crews. In 1801, he secured another victory, this time over the Danes, at Copenhagen, bequeathing to folklore the story that he ignored an order to withdraw by putting a telescope to his blind eye to read the flag signal. He subsequently commanded fleets involved in a blockade of French ships in Toulon harbour, and in unsuccessful pursuit of the French and Spanish fleets to the West Indies.</p>
<p>Only on October 21, 1805, did he finally bring the enemy to battle off Spain&rsquo;s Cape Trafalgar, which became his greatest victory and secured Britain against invasion by the vast army Napoleon had assembled on the Channel coast. At Trafalgar and in the actions that immediately followed, the French and Spanish lost 24 ships of the line, more than Nelson commanded when he engaged. He was shot down by a sharpshooter in the tops of the French Redoubt-able, and died three hours later.</p>
<p>However some believe Nelson was a white supremacist, citing Nelson&rsquo;s friendships with West Indian slave traders, and his description of the ideals of abolitionist William Wilberforce as &lsquo;a damnable and cruel doctrine&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Nelson&rsquo;s finest John Sugden, believes Nelson was exemplarily kind to black sailors who did good service on his ships, and in 1802 wrote another letter in support of a proposal by one of his own officers to employ free Chinese labour in the West Indies instead of slaves.</p>
<p>What did he do ?</p>
<p>The good:</p>
<p>Secured victory for the British in the Battle of Trafalgar, the greatest naval victory in British history</p>
<p>The greatest British naval hero ever to have lived</p>
<p>The bad:</p>
<p>He described of ideals of abolitionist William Wilberforce as &lsquo;a damnable and cruel doctrine&rsquo;</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter activists have targeted statues of the former Prime Minister due to his father&rsquo;s involvement with the slave trade. A petition to remove Peel&rsquo;s statue in central Manchester was started by Sami Pinarbasi, who said Sir Robert is a &lsquo;icon of hate and racism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>His father Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, (1750 - 1830), was a British politician, industrialist and textile manufacturer. He amassed wealth through industry and became one of ten known British millionaires in 1799.

<p>But his reputation was muddied by his spell as Governor of Bengal from 1755 when he faced accusations of corruption.</p>
<p>Amid a fierce backlash to his rule in India, as well as sliding health, he took his own life in 1767.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Clive&rsquo;s fortune was worth about £500,000 - around £33million today.</p>

The Malthusian underpinnings of Boris Johnson’s “herd immunity” strategy</p>
<p>By Thomas Scripps</p>
<p>8 June 2020</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s name will forever be associated with the murderous strategy of “herd immunity.”</p>
<p>A policy now universally followed by the world’s ruling classes was first openly advocated in response to the coronavirus pandemic by Johnson’s government, where it found a fitting representative in a prime minister who embodies the most reactionary traditions of British imperialism. Johnson’s actions have stripped bare the fundamental savagery of a social order based on the accumulation of profit by a super-rich oligarchy, in a way that will never be forgotten or forgiven by the working class.</p>
<p>On March 13, two days after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Johnson’s Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance suggested publicly that the population could “build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission.” Johnson had spelt out the practicalities of this policy in an interview the week before, where he explained, “one of the theories is, that perhaps you could take it on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease, as it were, to move through the population.”</p>
<p>The general concept of herd immunity has a legitimate scientific background, referring to the immunisation of a sufficient percentage of the population to block transmission of and therefore contain and eradicate a virus. But with serious diseases, such immunity has only ever been conceived of as the result of mass vaccination programmes. To rely on individuals developing natural immunity through contact with the virus not only fails to guarantee effective resistance to infection, through the development of lasting antibodies. It also presupposes the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people who do not survive the disease. This is exactly what the British government intended.</p>
<p>In keeping with their plan, no significant public health measures were put in place as the pandemic spread rapidly internationally and throughout Europe. No lockdown was imposed, and major sports events were allowed to go ahead. On March 12, the government abandoned any thought of containing the virus through community tracing and quarantining. Asked on Sky News why UK society was carrying on as normal when high infection rates would lead to an unprecedented number of deaths, Vallance replied, “Well of course we do face the prospect, as the prime minister said yesterday, of an increasing number of people dying.”</p>
<p>What was being prepared was a slaughter. On March 2, a report to the government’s Science Advice Group for Emergencies (SAGE) warned that coronavirus was highly contagious and already spreading in the population. If “stringent measures” were not imposed it would result in “around 80% of the population [53 million people] becoming infected,” resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths.</p>
<p>A national lockdown was only implemented three weeks later, on March 23, under massive popular pressure and amid widespread repugnance and anger at the pronouncements of the government. Ever since, the government has been working with big business and the trade unions to get the policy reversed so that now a criminal policy of an unsafe return to work is underway.</p>
<p>“Herd immunity” is not a public health strategy. It is a policy of culling the vulnerable, while defending the economic interests of the ruling elite—a sociopathic prioritisation of profit over life. According to a senior Conservative, it was summarised by Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings as “herd immunity, protect the economy, and if that means some pensioners die, too bad.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s supporters in the right-wing media have openly championed the same agenda. On March 13, fascistic columnist Katie Hopkins tweeted, “Coronavirus is a team sport. Get it. Get immunity. Feel better. The herd triumphs. Do not fear death. Everyone has an end.”</p>
<p>On March 31, Toby Young wrote in the Sceptic, “spending £350 billion to prolong the lives of a few hundred thousand mostly elderly people is an irresponsible use of taxpayers’ money.” Telegraph economics editor Russell Lynch published an article declaring, “The cost of saving lives in this lockdown is too high.”</p>
<p>The bloody balance sheet of this policy is that Britain has the highest number of deaths from COVID-19 outside of the United States, with its far bigger population. The death toll is set to explode as the population is sent back to work without even the most minimal public health protections in place.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson and “global over-population”</p>
<p>The Johnson government is reviving and putting into practice the most barbaric of social theories. A valuable insight into the conceptions guiding the government’s response to COVID-19 is to be found in a hitherto obscure opinion piece written by Johnson for the Daily Telegraph in 2007. The article is titled, “Global over-population is the real issue.” In it, Johnson laments how “it is a tragic measure of how far the world has changed” that “the fertility of the human race” can no longer be publicly discussed as a government policy.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s Telegraph article &ldquo;Global over-population is the real issue&rdquo;</p>
<p>“We seem to have given up on population control, and all sorts of explanations are offered for the surrender. Some say Indira Gandhi gave it all a bad name, by her demented plan to sterilise Indian men with the lure of a transistor radio.</p>
<p>“Some attribute our complacency to the Green Revolution, which seemed to prove Malthus wrong. It became the received wisdom that the world’s population could rise to umpteen billions, as mankind learnt to make several ears of corn grow where one had grown before.”</p>
<p>What this means, says Johnson, is that society is “refusing to say anything sensible about the single biggest challenge facing the Earth; and no, whatever it might now be conventional to say, the single biggest challenge is not global warming. The primary challenge facing our species is the reproduction of our species itself.”</p>
<p>Attributing this situation to “political cowardice,” Johnson agitates, “It is time we had a grown-up discussion about the optimum quantity of human beings in this country and on this planet. … Isn’t it time politicians stopped being so timid, and started talking about the real number one issue?”</p>
<p>Johnson makes no real effort to conceal the fascistic character of his views. He writes that “we have reached the absurd position in which humanity bleats about the destruction of the environment, and yet there is not a peep in any communiqué from any summit of the EU, G8 or UN about the population growth that is causing that destruction.</p>
<p>“You can see it as you fly over Mexico City, a vast checkerboard of smog-bound, low-rise dwellings stretching from one horizon to the other; and when you look down on what we are doing to the planet, you have a horrifying vision of habitations multiplying and replicating like bacilli in a Petri dish.”</p>
<p>More than all the tame “investigations” of the corporate media, this article gets to the core of the British government’s murderous response to the coronavirus pandemic. Social inequality, poverty, wars and the gutting of social services are non-issues to Johnson. Any measures to address them, let alone a global pandemic, would be counterproductive: the workers in the slums of Mexico City (or anywhere else)—”replicating like bacilli in a Petri dish”—are the real virus.</p>
<p>The thrust of Johnson’s article turns on the reference to Thomas Malthus, a capitalist ideologue of the late 18th and early 19th century who argued that the “inevitability” of overpopulation made poverty and early death necessary for the poor. Johnson embraces this claim with his declaration that history only “ seemed to prove Malthus wrong.”</p>
<p>While he is blunter and appears stupider than most of his fellow capitalist politicians, Johnson was educated at Eton public school and Oxford University. He knows the intellectual and political smoke signal he is sending to his co-thinkers.</p>
<p>Since its first articulation, Malthusianism has performed a vital and vicious political function for the social layer in which Johnson is thoroughly enmeshed.</p>
<p>As leading German Marxist August Bebel explained in 1879, Malthus’s work “contained an explanation of existing evils that expressed the innermost thoughts and wishes of the ruling classes, and justified them before the world.” Namely, that while property and wealth righteously insulates them from the ravages of hunger and disease, the working class, as little more than beasts of burden for the capitalists and the landowners, should expect no such relief. The elite can live luxurious lives for as long as the labour of society can sustain them, but death for an old or infirm worker becomes “natural” at the point they can no longer meet their commitment to their betters.</p>
<p>Thomas Malthus</p>
<p>Today the toll of the pandemic is viewed as a supposedly natural “check” on sections of the population considered a drain on profits. That is the content of “herd immunity.”</p>
<p>Thomas Malthus and “population theory”</p>
<p>Born to a country gentleman, Thomas Malthus (1766-1834) was a fellow of Cambridge University, a curate in the Church of England and later a professor in the private college established by the East India Company to train its administrators. He became a fundamental figure in bourgeois politics with his publication of An Essay on the Principle Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of Society in 1798.</p>
<p>Malthus argued:</p>
<p>The power of population is so superior to the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race. The vices of mankind [wars, for example] are active and able ministers of depopulation. They are the precursors in the great army of destruction; and often finish the dreadful work themselves. But should they fail in this war of extermination, sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague, advance in terrific array, and sweep off their thousands and ten thousands. Should success be still incomplete, gigantic inevitable famine stalks in the rear, and with one mighty blow levels the population with the food of the world.</p>
<p>All social problems were resolved into the problem of a perpetual excess of people who, if left unchecked by society, would be “naturally” killed off by “sickly seasons, epidemics, pestilence, and plague.”</p>
<p>On pain of these catastrophes, Malthus advocated punitive measures of population control and insisted on the futility of the rich supporting a “redundant population.” He demanded “moral restraint,” preventing the poor from having too many children, an end to the Poor Law system of relief for the destitute, and only the most selective private charity.</p>
<p>This was a justification for the unrestrained operation of the capitalist profit system, whatever its devastating consequences for the working class.</p>
<p>Karl Marx in 1875</p>
<p>The “law of population” is an ahistorical nonsense. Karl Marx declared it a “libel on the human race,” delivering a scathing criticism of the “abstract numerical relation, which [Malthus] has fished purely out of thin air, and which rests neither on natural nor on historical laws.”</p>
<p>As Marx would later demonstrate in Capital, contemporary poverty and unemployment are a consequence not of “overpopulation” but of the exploitation of the worker by the capitalist, which produces an “Accumulation of wealth at one pole” and an “accumulation of misery, agony of toil slavery, ignorance, brutality, mental degradation, at the opposite pole.”</p>
<p>Malthus, Marx explained, sought to disguise this reality with an “apologia for the poverty of the working classes.” He gave “brutal expression to the brutal viewpoint of capital” that if workers could not maintain themselves or their children in the “struggle for existence,” to use Malthus’s terms, they should expect no support. The worker “has no work, hence no wages, and since he has no existence as a human being but only as a worker, he can go and bury himself, starve to death, etc.”</p>
<p>The concluding chapter of Malthus’s essay includes the statement:</p>
<p>That the principal and most permanent cause of poverty has little or no direct relation to forms of government, or the unequal division of property; and that, as the rich do not in reality possess the power of finding employment and maintenance for the poor, the poor cannot, in the nature of things, possess the right to demand them; are important truths flowing from the principle of population…</p>
<p>This ghoulish theory was advanced in opposition to the struggle of the masses for an improvement in their position. “A mob,” the bourgeois academic trembles, “is of all monsters the most fatal to freedom.” Malthus’s essay was first published in 1798, the year of the United Irishman uprising, and the next three editions in the years leading up to the 1819 massacre of workers protesting for parliamentary representation at Peterloo, Manchester. The fifth edition was published in 1830.</p>
<p>Malthus declared himself an enemy of the Enlightenment arguments for equality recently given explosive actuality in the American and French Revolutions. In the course of his original essay and subsequent editions, he attacked the British utopian anarchist William Godwin, utopian socialist Robert Owen, radical democrat Thomas Paine and the French revolutionary Nicholas de Condorcet. Against egalitarian arguments demanding fair access to basic social rights, Malthus provided the ruling class with a crude ideological club to justify the impoverishment and premature death of the poor as the natural order of things. He was rewarded with immediate and immense influence in ruling circles.</p>
<p>As Marx explained:</p>
<p>The great sensation this pamphlet caused, was due solely to party interest. The French Revolution had found passionate defenders in the United Kingdom; the “principle of population,” slowly worked out in the eighteenth century, and then, in the midst of a great social crisis, proclaimed with drums and trumpets as the infallible antidote to the teachings of Condorcet, &amp;c., was greeted with jubilance by the English oligarchy as the great destroyer of all hankerings after human development.</p>
<p>Malthus theoretically enshrined the principle that the working class has no right to life except as a disposable labour force for the capitalist class. He argued, “There is one right which man has generally been thought to possess which I am confident he neither does nor can possess—a right to subsistence when his labour will not fairly purchase it … no person has any claim of right on society for subsistence, if his labour will not purchase it.”</p>
<p>In the second version of his essay, Malthus stated his savage views so boldly that the following passage had to be removed in subsequent editions: “A man who is born into a world already possessed, if he cannot get subsistence from his parents on whom he has a just demand, and if the society do not want his labour, has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is. At nature’s mighty feast there is no vacant cover for him.”</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels</p>
<p>Friedrich Engels subjected Malthus’s legacy to a devastating exposure in his 1843 Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy, in words that resound with full force today:</p>
<p>Malthus … maintains that population is always pressing on the means of subsistence; that as soon as production increases, population increases in the same proportion; and that the inherent tendency of the population to multiply in excess of the available means of subsistence is the root of all misery and all vice. For, when there are too many people, they have to be disposed of in one way or another: either they must be killed by violence or they must starve. … The implications of this line of thought are that since it is precisely the poor who are the surplus, nothing should be done for them except to make their dying of starvation as easy as possible, and to convince them that it cannot be helped and that there is no other salvation for their whole class than keeping propagation down to the absolute minimum. … Charity is to be considered a crime, since it supports the augmentation of the surplus population. Indeed, it will be very advantageous to declare poverty a crime and to turn poor-houses into prisons, as has already happened in England as a result of the new “liberal” Poor Law… Am I to go on any longer elaborating this vile, infamous theory, this hideous blasphemy against nature and mankind? Am I to pursue its consequences any further? Here at last we have the immorality of the economist brought to its highest pitch. … And it is just this theory which is the keystone of the liberal system of free trade, whose fall entails the downfall of the entire edifice. For if here competition is proved to be the cause of misery, poverty and crime, who then will still dare to speak up for it?</p>
<p>Engels noted that in 1834, just a few months before the death of Malthus, his writings were used to justify a reform of the Poor Law system designed to curb the minimal cost to ratepayers of maintaining the destitute. Relief payments were replaced with the hellish workhouse system. Men, women, and children were separated and forced to live and work in prison-like conditions. Support was withdrawn from the mothers of “illegitimate” children.</p>
<p>Just over a decade later, the Malthusian claim of the inevitability and benefit of catastrophic “checks” on the population, and of the inability of society to avert their consequences, justified the British government’s genocidal response to Ireland’s Great Famine of 1845-49. A million people starved to death and a million more were forced to emigrate while the British ruling class insisted that the free operation of the market could not be interfered with. Even as Ireland’s potato crop was destroyed by blight, vast quantities of food continued to be exported for sale.</p>
<p>Charles Edward Trevelyan</p>
<p>The Whig government’s Assistant Secretary to the Treasury Charles Trevelyan thought the famine was an “effective mechanism for reducing surplus population” and a “direct stroke of an all-wise and all-merciful Providence” sent to reform the “selfish, perverse and turbulent” Irish. Trevelyan had studied under Malthus.</p>
<p>Mutatis Mutandis, there is nothing to distinguish the actions of the Whigs in the mid-19th century from Johnson’s Tories during the pandemic of 2020.</p>
<p>Malthus, social Darwinism and eugenics</p>
<p>Malthus was foundational to the “survival of the fittest” theories of social Darwinism and eugenics in the late 19th and early 20th century.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer (1820-1903), the most prominent social Darwinist, refers in A Theory on Population, deduced from the General Law of Animal Fertility, to a “constant increase of people beyond the means of subsistence,” an “excess of fertility which entails a constant pressure of population upon the means of subsistence.” Going further than Malthus’s idea of a “struggle for existence,” however, he concluded:</p>
<p>Necessarily, families and races whom this increasing difficulty of getting a living which excess of fertility entails, does not stimulate to improvements in production—that is, to greater mental activity—are on the high road to extinction; and must ultimately be supplanted by those whom the pressure does so stimulate. This truth we have recently seen exemplified in Ireland. And here, indeed, without further illustration, it will be seen that premature death, under all its forms, and from all its causes, cannot fail to work in the same direction. For as those prematurely carried off must, in the average of cases, be those in whom the power of self-preservation is the least, it unavoidably follows, that those left behind to continue the race are those in whom the power of self-preservation is the greatest—are the select of their generation.</p>
<p>This new ideological step towards barbarism was a response to a new sharpening of class tensions. Spencer wrote following the storms of working class Chartism, the European revolutions of 1848 and the publication of the Communist Manifesto, and in the midst of Britain’s “imperial century,” founded on the brutal subjugation and exploitation of India, China and other colonies. Faced with a strengthening working class and the emergence of the socialist movement, Spencer was driven to write a full-blooded defence, again citing a supposed natural law, of inequality, oppression, and imperialist violence.</p>
<p>Herbert Spencer</p>
<p>In his book Social Statistics, he attacked socialism’s “erroneous … assertions of a man’s right to a maintenance and of his right to have his work provided for him.” The prominent contemporary economist and Spencer disciple Alfred Marshall, wrote in the same spirit that social welfare might lead to “Some partial arrest of that selective influence of struggle and competition … to which more than any other single cause, the progress of the human race is due.”</p>
<p>The ruling class showered Spencer with praise; he sold over a million copies of his works in his own lifetime. Social Darwinism “proved” to the elite its belief that not only was the working class undeserving of support, but that its suffering and premature death was of active benefit to “society” and “the human race”—by which they understood their own bank accounts. A sickening passage in Social Statistics reads:</p>
<p>Meanwhile the well-being of existing humanity, and the unfolding of it into this ultimate perfection, are both secured by that same beneficent, though severe discipline, to which the animate creation at large is subject. … The poverty of the incapable, the distresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and those shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong, which leave so many “in shallows and in miseries,” are the decrees of a large, far-seeing benevolence. It seems hard that an unskilfulness which with all his efforts he cannot overcome, should entail hunger upon the artisan. It seems hard that a labourer incapacitated by sickness from competing with his stronger fellows, should have to bear the resulting privations. It seems hard that widows and orphans should be left to struggle for life or death. Nevertheless, when regarded not separately, but in connection with the interests of universal humanity, these harsh fatalities are seen to be full of the highest beneficence—the same beneficence which brings to early graves the children of diseased parents, and singles out the low-spirited, the intemperate, and the debilitated as the victims of an epidemic.</p>
<p>In the context of the worsening inter-imperialist tensions, economic turmoil and class struggles of the late 19th and early 20th century, social Darwinism spawned the eugenicist movement, whose founder, Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911), promised, “What nature does blindly, slowly, and ruthlessly, man may do providently, quickly, and kindly.”</p>
<p>Sir Francis Galton</p>
<p>Eugenics offered the ruling class another pseudo-scientific “explanation” for the poverty of the working class and of other “races,” deemed inherently mentally inferior. The most oppressed layers, considered a burden on the capitalist class and its imperialist ambitions, could be written off and disposed of as an “unfit” underclass.</p>
<p>Like its ideological forerunners, the eugenicist movement found a wide and ready audience in the middle and upper classes hostile to revolutionary socialism—from the nominally “left” reformist Fabian Society to the conservative aristocrat Winston Churchill (who Johnson constantly seeks to ape.)</p>
<p>Under the influence of these ideas, the Mental Deficiency Act 1913 led to the segregation of up to 65,000 “feeble minded” or “morally defective” people in internal colonies in the UK. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, a Joint Committee on Mental Deficiency reported that there were some 300,000 “mental defectives” in the country and defined the poorest 10 percent of the population as a “social problem group.” In 1934, the Departmental Committee on Sterilisation recommended legislation to ensure the “voluntary” sterilisation of “mentally defective women.”</p>
<p>Eugenics, like Malthusianism and social Darwinism, was a world movement, justifying tens of thousands of forced sterilisations in the United States and Scandinavia. It reached its fullest and most appalling expression in Nazi Germany, whose concept of “the life unworthy of life” saw the forced sterilisation of 400,000 and murder of 300,000 people considered mentally or physically disabled, and later the mass extermination of Jews, Slavs and Romani people.</p>
<p>In citing Malthus in his article, Johnson is aligning himself with this entire blood-soaked ideological heritage.</p>
<p>The ruling class and the pandemic</p>
<p>The revival by the ruling class of the fascist traditions of its recent past has been carefully analysed by the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) and the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) for the last six years. In 2014, the German section of the ICFI took up a fight against the relativization of the crimes of the Third Reich being carried out by sections of academia.</p>
<p>In the course of this work, which began in a struggle against the reactionary teachings of Humboldt University Professors Jörg Baberowski and Herfried Münkler, the ICFI uncovered a broader conspiracy in the ruling elite. Baberowski’s pronouncements in leading German newspapers that “Hitler was not vicious” were a preparation for the revival of German militarism now being orchestrated in the Bundestag and for the welcoming of the fascistic Alternative for Germany (AfD) and its policies into the heart of government, to facilitate the suppression of left-wing opposition.</p>
<p>The struggle against the rehabilitation of fascism has become a major question on dozens of German university campuses, and massive anti-fascist demonstrations have been held in several cities. The German section of the ICFI has been placed on the extremist watch-list of the German state security services, on behalf of the AfD.</p>
<p>Drawing the lessons from these events, and following the exposure of a eugenics conference (the London Conference on Intelligence) at University College London in January 2018, involving multiple UK academics, the British section of the ICFI began a far-sighted fight against the revival of social Darwinist and eugenicist ideology, especially in connection with former Oxford researcher Noah Carl .</p>
<p>The WSWS and the Socialist Equality Party explained in a series of articles and two public meetings that the recrudescence of these ideas was bound up with an international campaign of right-wing revanchism on university campuses, in response to widening social inequality, a ratcheting up of inter-imperialist tensions and a global resurgence of class struggle. “The return of eugenics and social Darwinism,” we wrote, “is the product of immense shifts in social forces and powerful ruling-class interests, which demand an ever-more right-wing intellectual climate.”</p>
<p>In February this year, the WSWS noted that modern-day “eugenicists have found an ally in Johnson’s viciously elitist, anti-migrant Tory government.”</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Prime Minister Boris Johnson holds a news conference giving the government&rsquo;s response to the new COVID-19</p>
<p>Johnson told the Centre for Policy Studies in 2013, “Whatever you may think of the value of IQ tests, it is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 percent of our species have an IQ below 85.” The same year, as the Mayor of London who rubbed shoulders with billionaires on a regular basis, Johnson wrote an article for the Telegraph arguing that the “super-rich” belong to “three fairly exclusive categories of human being.” They “tend to be well above average” in “mathematical, scientific or at least logical reasoning.”</p>
<p>Speaking at the Centre for Social Justice in 2016, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of the onslaught on welfare provision and an advocate for lifting the retirement age to 75, said social security “entrapped individuals &hellip; and created a growing underclass.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s key adviser, Dominic Cummings, produced a paper for Education Secretary Michael Gove arguing that since intelligence was mostly genetic, funding a well-rounded education for working class children was pointless. Cummings was responsible for hiring the self-avowed eugenicist Andrew Sabisky as a special adviser to the government in February. Sabisky was a participant, alongside white supremacists and fascists, in the London Conference on Intelligence. Several UK academics and the right-wing columnist Toby Young, who had been nominated to head the government’s student oversight body in January 2018, also attended the event.</p>
<p>Later that year, Tory Party Vice Chair for Youth Ben Bradley claimed in a blog post that Britain would soon be “drowning in a vast sea of unemployed wasters,” before telling poorer families, “Sorry but how many children you have is a choice; if you can’t afford them, stop having them! Vasectomies are free.”</p>
<p>The WSWS commented after Sabisky’s hiring that in every case this ideology “has come to prominence in the ruling class in response to a sharpening of the class struggle, under conditions of deep capitalist crisis. Its fundamental purpose is as an ideological weapon against Marxism and the socialist movement—insisting on a biological rather than social cause of inequality—and its consequences are the denigration, suppression and racial division of the working class. &hellip; This reactionary filth is the product of a deep-going rot in ruling class politics, which increasingly takes on a fascistic character.”</p>
<p>In the last three months, this process, which began deep in the bowels of bourgeois society, has erupted into a world issue confronting millions of people.</p>
<p>To the ruling class represented by Johnson, the pandemic is an inevitable and largely beneficial “Malthusian catastrophe”; a “check” on population which will filter out its “redundant” and “unfit” sections. The continued endangering of the working class and especially its lowest-paid sections and those with health complications, the turning of care homes into killing fields, and the failure to provide for the essential needs of the old and infirm while isolated at home are social crimes rooted in this abhorrent class ideology.</p>
<p>Its consequences have been most glaringly and horrifically exposed in the abandonment of the elderly. Last Friday, the Guardian revealed that the government had rejected a plan from Public Health England for a more secure public health lockdown of care homes, and for making the UK’s unused Nightingale hospitals available for the quarantining and care of their residents. Their proposal was submitted on April 28, when it was abundantly clear that the sector was being decimated by coronavirus.</p>
<p>The government shrugged its shoulders at the fate of over 400,000 old people because it considers them, in the language of the Third Reich, “empty eaters.” Early on in the crisis, Telegraph assistant editor and leading business and economics columnist Jeremy Warner wrote, “From an entirely disinterested economic perspective, the COVID-19 might even prove mildly beneficial in the long-term by disproportionately culling elderly dependents.”</p>
<p>All of this has been carried out unopposed by any section of the ruling elite, or its servants in the media, the trade unions and the Labour Party.</p>
<p>The same is underway internationally. In Germany, politicians and media figures, including representatives of the Left Party, championing a return to work, in alliance with neo-Nazi mobs, are spitting on the right to life. US President Donald Trump is carrying out a wholesale reopening of the economy and abandonment of public health measures in alliance with the Democratic Party. Sweden’s Social Democratic government and its de facto policy of herd immunity that resulted in one of the highest death rate per capita in the world has been cited repeatedly as the model to emulate.</p>
<p>Coronavirus has exposed a ruling class in a state of terminal decay, which has lost any right to rule and which responds to crises with murderous theories “unearthed from a medieval graveyard,” as Trotsky wrote of 1930s fascism. A rational and humane solution to this world catastrophe and its aftermath depends on the progressive force in society, the international working class, fulfilling its revolutionary mission and laying these retrograde social forces to rest in a conscious struggle for socialism.</p>
<p>Contribute to the fight for socialism in 2020 We need you to help the WSWS and ICFI make 2020 the year of international socialist revival. We must expand our work and our influence in the international working class. If you agree, donate today. Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="princess-maria-galitzin-31-suddenly-dies-leaving-behind-a-two-year-old-son">&ldquo;Princess Maria Galitzin, 31, suddenly dies leaving behind a two-year-old son&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/05/14/13/28387476-0-image-a-114_1589459027667.jpg" alt="img">
Descendant of Emperor Karl of Austria Princess Maria Galitzine has tragically died after suffering a sudden aneurysm, leaving behind her two-year-old son.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old was living in Houston with her chef partner Rishi Singh when she suffered a fatal cardiac aneurysm on May 4, just six days shy of her 32nd birthday.</p>
<p>The news was confirmed in an obituary in The Houston Chronicle published on Wednesday, in which her son Maxim was described as &lsquo;the apple of her eye&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The mother-of-one was laid to rest last on Friday in Houston.</p>
<p>Descendant of Emperor Karl of Austria Princess Maria Galitzine has tragically died after suffering a sudden aneurysm, leaving behind her two-year-old son</p>
<p>Princess Maria moved to Houston where she met her husband Rishi Singh, with the couple marrying in a ceremony at her parents&rsquo; house in 2018</p>
<p>The obituary read: &lsquo;Our Maria passed away in the Houston morning of Monday, May 4th, 2020, from a sudden cardiac aneurysm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was born in 1988 to Prince and Princess Piotr Galitzine in the city of Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Maria was born in Luxembourg City on 11 May, 1988, and was the daughter of Russian aristocrat Prince Piotr Galitzine, and Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria - the daughter of the Archduke Rudolf of Austria.</p>
<p>He was the youngest son of Emperor Charles I of Austria and Empress Zita of Bourbon-Parma - the last Emperor and Empress of Austria.</p>
<p>Princess Maria&rsquo;s great-grandparents were exiled from Austria following the First World War, and her great-grandfather Charles I of Austria died in 1922.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old suffered a cardiac aneurysm days before she would have celebrated her 32nd birthday (pictured, travelling in Amsterdam)</p>
<p>When Maria&rsquo;s great-grandmother Zita died aged 96, the family were given permission for her funeral to be held in Austria.</p>
<p>WHAT IS AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM? An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a bulge or swelling in the aorta, the main blood vessel that runs from the heart down through the chest and tummy. An AAA can be dangerous if it is not spotted early on. It can get bigger over time and could burst (rupture), causing life-threatening bleeding. Men aged 65 and over are most at risk of AAAs. This is why men are invited for screening to check for an AAA when they&rsquo;re 65. Symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): AAAs do not usually cause any obvious symptoms, and are often only picked up during screening or tests carried out for another reason. Some people with an AAA have: a pulsing sensation in the tummy (like a heartbeat) tummy pain that does not go away lower back pain that does not go away If an AAA bursts, it can cause: sudden, severe pain in the tummy or lower back dizziness sweaty, pale and clammy skin a fast heartbeat shortness of breath fainting or passing out SOURCE: NHS Advertisement</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s mother met her dad at a bar in New York and they went on to tie the knot in 1981.</p>
<p>Piotr is the CEO and Chairman of TMK Ipsco, a subsidiary of the Russian steel pipe giant OAO TMK.</p>
<p>Princess Maria had three sisters and two brothers - Princess Xenia, Princess Tatiana, Princess Alexandra, Prince Dimitri and Prince Ionn Teimouraz.</p>
<p>In an interview with the The Houston Chronicle in 2018, her sister Princess Tatiana, who also lives in Houston, said that they had a &lsquo;normal&rsquo; upbringing.</p>
<p>She revealed that while their parents never publicised their royal status, the family always knew what it meant to be royal.</p>
<p>Tatiana said: &lsquo;My life is completely normal unless we are invited to royal weddings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My mail sometimes says &ldquo;Princess Tatiana.&rdquo; What was weird was when I went from &ldquo;Princess&rdquo; to &ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; I had been a princess all my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She added: &lsquo;My parents both are very, very involved in charities.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As children, every summer, we had to do charity work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We would clean up a church or help in a foster home or in a homeless shelter. It was as normal for us as brushing our teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking to Paper City magazine, Maria&rsquo;s younger sister gave further insight into life growing up in their family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At home, my father speaks Russian to us, the girls speak French to each other, and the boys speak German,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She added that they also had strong loyalty towards Austria and Russia and supported both countries in the Olympics.</p>
<p>They were also advised to be &lsquo;cautious&rsquo; and not participate in any behaviour which may embarrass their family name.</p>
<p>In Maria&rsquo;s obituary, her son Maxim was described as &lsquo;the apple of her eye&rsquo;, with the proud mother often sharing snaps of her son on Facebook</p>
<p>The 31-year-old leaves behind her husband Rishi and their two-year-old son Maxim, who was described as the apple of her eye in her obituary (pictured together)</p>
<p>The royal moved to Houston, where she worked as an interior designer, and met her husband Rishi</p>
<p>In 1993, when Maria was five-years-old, she returned to Russia with her family, where she attended the German School of Moscow, before moving to Belgium to study at the College of Art and Design school.</p>
<p>She focused on her skills as an interior designer, and went on to pursue a career in the industry following her graduation.</p>
<p>Over the next few years she worked in both Brussels and Chicago, before setting up home in Houston.</p>
<p>It was there she met her future husband Rishi Singh, who is the executive chef at Hotel Derek in Houston.</p>
<p>The couple were married in an Orthodox religious ceremony at her parent&rsquo;s home in 22 April 2018.</p>
<p>They welcomed their first son, Maxim, shortly before their wedding, on 10 February 2018.</p>
<p>Maria&rsquo;s sister Princess Tatiana also lives in Houston, previously revealing how the girls were discouraged from talking about royals as children (pictured, Tatiana with her husband Guillermo)</p>
