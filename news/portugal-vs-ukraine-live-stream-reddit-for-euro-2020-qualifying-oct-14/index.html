<h3 id="fc-porto-player-moussa-marega-walks-off-pitch-after-idiots-shout-racist-chants">&ldquo;FC Porto player Moussa Marega walks off pitch after &lsquo;idiots&rsquo; shout racist chants&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/50/78/86/1000x563_cmsv2_b0868512-2ced-5c38-b061-05dacb1b3eeb-4507886.jpg" alt="img">
A furious player for one of Europe’s top football clubs has blasted “idiots” who targeted him with racist abuse so vile that he walked off the pitch during a game.</p>
<p>FC Porto striker Moussa Marega, who is from Mali, was visibly angered by monkey noises aimed at him after he scored Porto’s second goal in a 2-1 win at Guimarães in the Portuguese football league.</p>
<p>But when Marega started to walk off the field, several players from both his own side and Guimarães appeared to argue with him.</p>
<p>Porto coach Sérgio Conceição also went on the field and spoke with Marega. It took Marega several minutes to leave the field.</p>
<p>The upset player held his thumbs down at the crowd as he went into the tunnel to the changing rooms. The crowd responded with loud jeers.</p>
<p>The attitude of both the fans and other players has drawn criticism on social media.</p>
<p>“We are indignant with what has happened. Moussa was insulted from warmups (before kickoff),” Conceição said after the match. “We deserve respect and what happened was despicable.”</p>
<p>Marega posted a message on Instagram expressing fury at the episode.</p>
<p>“I would just like to tell these idiots who come to the stadium to make racist shouts &hellip; go f*** yourself,” he wrote.</p>
<p>He also took a swipe at the referee for issuing a yellow card after he pointed to his skin during his goal celebration: “I hope I never meet you on a football field again!”</p>
<p>Porto coach Sergio Conceicao said he and his club felt &ldquo;outraged&rdquo; by the racism, adding that the monkey chants began during the pre-game warm-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are a family, whatever our nationality, skin color, height, hair color,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What happened here was pitiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FC Porto has said it stands by Marega, adding it is &ldquo;compelled to take drastic action&rdquo; after repeated racist slurs during the game. In a statement, the club said the insults were &ldquo;a low point in the recent history of Portuguese soccer and must be punished appropriately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Portuguese league said the behavior of some fans in the stadium &ldquo;shame soccer and human dignity.&rdquo; Marega &ldquo;could no longer bear the insults targeted at him and chose to leave the game&rdquo;, the league said in a statement.</p>
<p>The league will do everything in its power to impose punishments and stamp out racism, the statement said.</p>
<p>Portuguese police said they were not immediately able to identify who hurled the abuse at Marega inside the stadium because of the large crowd. However, officers were investigating Monday, reportedly including sifting through closed-circuit TV images taken inside the stadium.</p>
<p>In Portugal, racist insults and threats carry a prison sentence of up to five years in prison.

<p>The United States Women&rsquo;s National Team play the first of two international friendlies against Portugal on Thursday at the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The world champions are on a five-match victory tour after their success at the 2019 FIFA World Cup in France and will play in front of a record crowd for a stand-alone friendly of over 44,100.</p>
<p>The USWNT kicked off their tour with a comfortable 3-0 win over Ireland at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on August 4.</p>
<p>Date: Thursday, August 29</p>
<p>Time: 7 p.m. (ET), 12 a.m. (BST, Friday)</p>
<p>TV Info: Fox Sports 1 (U.S.)</p>
<p>Live Stream: Fox Sports Go (U.S.)</p>
<p>Match Preview</p>
<p>The Stars and Stripes were deservedly crowned world champions in France and can expect plenty of support when they take on Portugal:</p>
<p>Manager Jill Ellis has called up North Carolina Courage forward Kristen Hamilton and Chicago Red Stars defender Casey Short to the squad for the two matches against Portugal. The second fixture takes place on Sunday at the Allianz Field in Saint Paul, Minnesota:</p>
<p>The United States manager, who has announced her decision to step down from the post after the victory tour, explained why she has called up the duo, per USSoccer.com.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the injuries we currently have to several World Cup players, and with two of our main priorities on the Victory Tour being spreading around the minutes and keeping players healthy for their clubs during this critical playoff push, it made sense to call in Casey and Kristen to give us options and depth for these games against what will be a tough Portugal team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>World Cup Golden Boot winner Megan Rapinoe is just one of several players who could miss the game. The striker has joined Alex Morgan, Kelly O&rsquo;Hara, Mallory Pugh, Alyssa Naeher, Rose Lavelle, Morgan Brian and Tierna Davidson on the injured list, per Mitchell Northam at Pro Soccer USA.</p>
<p>The injury situation could allow Hamilton to win her first cap after an impressive campaign. She has racked up eight goals to help North Carolina Courage into second place in the National Women&rsquo;s Soccer League; only Christine Sinclair and Sam Kerr have scored more.</p>

<p>Despite all the injuries the USWNT will still be expected to beat Portugal. The team have a 100 per cent record in their seven matches against Thursday&rsquo;s opponents but will be aware the visitors are on the up.</p>
<p>Portugal did not qualify for the 2019 World Cup but have lost just two of their last nine matches since their last defeat to the United States in November 2018.

The United States women’s national soccer team will continue the celebration of their July FIFA World Cup triumph with the third stop on their five-city Victory Tour. In two games so far in the series, the world champions have won both games without conceding a single goal, per Soccerway. In fact, going back to the FIFA Women’s World Cup final against the Netherlands, Team USA has now outscored opponents 9-0 in their last three games — and won 15 in a row overall going back to February’s 2-2 draw with England in the She Believes Cup.</p>
<p>Fans will see a largely changed side in Tuesday’s rematch against Portugal, which will stream live from Saint Paul, Minnesota. Coach Jill Ellis is holding back six players from last week’s win, including big-name stars Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, according to KMSP TV Sports.</p>

The crowd at Lincoln Financial Field set an attendance record for a U.S. women’s international friendly match.</p>

<h3 id="arsenal-sign-portugal-defender-cedric---prosoccertalk">&ldquo;Arsenal sign Portugal defender Cedric - ProSoccerTalk&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://soccer.nbcsports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2020/01/GettyImages-1203147263.jpg" alt="img">
Arsenal have signed Cedric Soares on loan from Southampton for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>[ MORE: Premier League schedule ]</p>
<p>The Portuguese right back, 28, is out of contract in the summer so would have left Saints for nothing in July.</p>
<p>Arsenal will reportedly pay Southampton a $4.5 million loan fee and cover Cedric’s wages for the rest of the season. The Portugal international, who won EURO 2016 with his homeland, will then be able to sign a contract with the Gunners in the summer if he performs well.</p>
<p>Watch our transfer deadline day show from 6-8 p.m. ET on Jan. 31, live on NBCSN and online via NBCSports.com.</p>
<p>Speaking about his move to the Emirates Stadium, Cedric revealed he almost joined Arsenal a few years ago and is delighted to have now arrived in north London to bolster Mikel Arteta‘s defensive options.</p>
<p>“Obviously it was important for me in my career to come here. Southampton gave me the opportunity to play in the Premier League but obviously it’s amazing this step, to come here and play for Arsenal. To be able to reach this point is unbelievable,” Cedric said. “One hundred per cent that I will give all my best every day and every game. I try to be a guy with energy, a player that goes up and down. I like to consider myself a team player and yes, what can I say? It’s difficult when you need to talk about yourself! But again, I will give my 100 per cent for the team and for the fans.”</p>
<p>Cedric is a versatile player who can play at right back and left back and Arsenal are short of options in those areas. He will provide cover for Hector Bellerin and that will allow Ainsley Maitland-Niles to move back into his preferred position in midfield.</p>
<p>👋 Welcome to the club, @OficialCedric!</p>

<p>Picking up a solid, reliable international full back for a small loan fee with the option to sign him for nothing in the summer is a smart move from the Gunners.</p>
<p>Cedric isn’t the most glamorous signing in the world but after the loan addition of center back Pablo Mari earlier this week, Arteta is making sensible signings in the area of the pitch where Arsenal need help most: defense.</p>

by Thomson Reuters</p>
<p>By Catarina Demony, Sergio Goncalves and Victoria Waldersee</p>
<p>LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa on Thursday announced a sector-by-sector plan to gradually lift lockdown measures imposed six weeks ago to combat the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Starting on May 4, the three-phase plan will open up different sectors of the economy every 15 days, starting with small neighbourhood shops, hairdressers, car dealerships and bookshops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know this process has risks,&rdquo; Costa told a news conference. &ldquo;We know that as we open up various activities, the risk of transmission will increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he added, &ldquo;I will never be ashamed to take a step back if necessary for the safety of the Portuguese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The country has reported 25,045 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 989 deaths, a comparatively low toll backed up by one of the highest testing rates worldwide at 37,000 tests per million people.</p>
<p>Its virus reproduction rate - dubbed &lsquo;R&rsquo; - stands at 0.94, meaning each infected person passes on the virus to less than one other person. The rate of new infections has slowed since 23-25 March, health ministry figures showed.</p>
<p>From Monday, the use of masks will be compulsory in various spaces including on public transport, which will operate at reduced capacity.</p>
<p>Remote working will still be recommended where possible, and gatherings must be limited to ten people, though family members will be allowed to attend funerals.</p>
<p>Government officials said last week a contact-tracing mobile app was in the works to assist in the monitoring of new cases.</p>
<p>Costa said easing lockdown measures &ldquo;does not free us from the civic duty to maintain as much social distancing as possible&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Individual sports like golf and tennis can resume on Monday as long as changing rooms stay closed, and gardens and libraries will also reopen.</p>
<p>Portugal&rsquo;s top soccer league Primeira Liga could be allowed to play the last ten matches of the competition, suspended on March 12, from 30 May, Costa said, albeit behind closed doors, if the health ministry grants approval.</p>
<p>If the outbreak continues to slow, the plan&rsquo;s second phase will launch on May 18, opening up bigger stores, restaurants, museums and coffee shops but at reduced capacity.</p>
<p>Also on May 18, childcare centres and preschools will reopen, and Grade 11 and 12 high school students will be able to return to schools under strict restrictions, including the compulsory use of face masks.</p>
<p>All other school classes will continue remotely for the rest of the academic year.</p>
<p>Workers might be able to gradually return to their offices in June, when the third phase of plan is implemented and shopping malls, cinemas and theatres can reopen then as long as physical distancing is kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all aware that until there is a vaccine available on the market (&hellip;) we must carry on living with COVID-19,&rdquo; Costa said. &ldquo;As long as there is COVID, our lives cannot be normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Portugal&rsquo;s health system has remained below 65% of hospital bed capacity throughout the pandemic, with nine out of ten cases treated at home and just 1% needing intensive care, Costa said.</p>
<p>But the pandemic is set to leave lasting scars on Portugal&rsquo;s once bailed-out economy.</p>
<p>Around one in five workers in Portugal have been laid off since the pandemic, with unemployment skyrocketing to 380,832 people - just 10,000 below the country&rsquo;s peak in 2008.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund predicted that Portugal&rsquo;s gross domestic product will contract by 8% this year.</p>
