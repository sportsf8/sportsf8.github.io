Brock Lesnar is scheduled to defend the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre at WWE WrestleMania 36. The following will identify and pontificate three reasons why Brock Lesnar must retain the championship against Drew McIntyre on the grandest stage of them all.

Brock Lesnar vs. Drew McIntyre! Indeed, this is a money match that deserves the main event of WWE WrestleMania 36. Two dangerous, brawny superstars of this nature battling it out in the middle of that ring should be a classic.

However, the superstar who should win at this year’s WrestleMania might not be the most popular choice but might actually be the best choice. The following will convey why the Beast Incarnate must retain the WWE Championship against the Scottish Psychopath.

3.) Drew McIntyre’s Royal Rumble Victory was a One-Hit Wonder

If the WWE genuinely had a plan to dethrone Brock Lesnar at WWE WrestleMania 36, Drew McIntyre would not have been a last-minute decision to win the Royal Rumble this year. As many insiders know, Roman Reigns was originally the plan to win the Royal Rumble, but it seems that there was a knee-jerk reaction to give McIntyre the victory instead since there was a thunderous reaction by the crowd when he eliminated Lesnar from the Royal Rumble match.

Our Mark Justice (a.ka. me) had already predicted a month ago before the Rumble that Drew McIntyre eliminating Brock Lesnar from the Royal Rumble Match needed to happen and would be the most important elimination in the match. It needed to happen simply because popular demand wanted Drew McIntyre vs. Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 36 and that was the ideal way to set up such a high-caliber match.

However, was winning the Rumble going to guarantee McIntyre a victory against Lesnar at WrestleMania 36? Far from it. As iconic and star-making as it was, this victory was a one-hit wonder since he was not in the original plans to win the Rumble.

In fact, Vince McMahon is even doubting this as the main event of WWE WrestleMania 36 since he is strongly considering Goldberg vs. Roman Reigns (*wink* *wink* the originally planned Royal Rumble Winner) to main event the show. Henceforth, these inside hints make it harder to believe that McIntyre is in the original plans to even dethrone Lesnar on the grandest stage of them all.
