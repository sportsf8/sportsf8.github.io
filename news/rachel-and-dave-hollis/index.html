On a recent episode of How To!, Andy, a listener in Austin, Texas, is torn about moving out of state to follow his girlfriend, Cassie, to vet school. Charles Duhigg brings in Rachel Hollis, author of Girl, Wash Your Face, and her husband, Dave, to advise on putting your partner first; Dave gave up his lucrative job at Disney to support Rachelâs career. This transcript of their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<p>Charles Duhigg: Letâs say you move to another state and youâre forecasting a year into the future after the move. Whatâs the worst-case scenario that you think happens?</p>
<p>Andy: Well, as it is now, Cassie and I live together, but I have friends and band practice and work, so I have a lot of buffers between us. So we do spend a lot of time together, but I wouldnât say itâs as much time as we would be spending if we were living together in another state and I had to get my new friends and work and stuff together. Weâre going to be spending a hell of a lot of time together. Iâm afraid that weâre going to drive each other nuts.</p>
<p>Rachel Hollis: Yeah, and you probably will.</p>
<p>Charles: This is something that Rachel and Dave have thought about a lot because they themselves recently moved, and Rachel wanted to make sure that she had other social options. That she knew where she was going to make new friends before they arrived.</p>
<p>Rachel: I really, through social media, got dialed into the community before I ever came here. So I knew where I was going to go to the gym. Basically, the things that are valuable to me, I had established that through hashtags. I literally just started following hashtags, and I knew what I was going to do. I set it up so that we hit the ground running instead of the culture shock of âOh, God, weâre here, now what?â</p>
<p>Charles: Moving to a new place, particularly when youâre moving there for another person, can be huge and scary, and if youâre not careful, it can cause resentment. So you have to do some work ahead of time. You have to do some research in advance and get to know the lay of the land so that you know that youâre making this move, not just for someone else, but for you. You have to figure out why you want this, why you should be excited, beyond just supporting your partner.</p>
<p>Dave Hollis: If you feel like you have to do this or that you do this out of an obligation or out of wanting to show loyalty, but not truly because of it being a thing that you feel driven to do, you will feel like it was being foisted upon you, a thing that you did not choose, and then you will not choose it.</p>
<p>Charles: Letâs say you decide to move with Cassie, and itâs a year in the future and things are going well with the relationship. You guys are together, youâre driving each other a little bit crazy, because youâre in a new place, youâre hanging out all the time, but sheâs the same basic person that she is today. And letâs say nothing else works out. You try and get your woodworking business off the ground, and then youâre finding that you can only get worse jobs then you got in Austin. You want to find a new band, and you just donât click with anyone, and youâre in a place thatâs cold and thereâs no good breweries around.</p>
<p>Put yourself in that head space. Do you feel like you still made the right choice, or do you think that it might be a mistake?</p>
<p>Andy: I donât know. I love Cassie a lot, and so Iâd be willing to put up with a situation like that for an extended period of time. But yeah, I feel like I would probably feel like it was a bad decision in the long run.</p>
<p>Rachel: But then you could just move back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We commit to working things out in real time instead of letting things fester.&rdquo; â Rachel Hollis</p>
<p>Andy: Yeah, thatâs true. And weâve talked about doing the long-distance thing. It was her idea, her moving and me staying here. And I feel like it would work, but I donât know for how long.</p>
<p>Rachel: Yeah. I think everybody tends to think when theyâre trying to make a big decision that this is the end-all be-all. That they have to know the answer to the rest of their life right now. And the reality is you could choose to do this thing, and one or both of you could be like, âWell, holy crap, that didnât work.â And then you would make another choice. And if that doesnât work, then you make another choice. Nothing that you are going to choose is it forever.</p>
<p>Charles: And what studies show is that over time, our happiness tends to be shaped much more by those small, secondary choices, the adjustment choices we make, than by the big decision that when you confront it seems so important at the time.</p>
<p>Rachel: Dave always says, âPeople only get upset when theyâre surprised.â So if she thinks, Weâre getting engaged within the first three months because weâre moving to a new city together, and you think, This next 18 months is going to be the real test on whether or not this is it forever, youâre misaligned. And youâre both going to be frustrated.</p>
<p>Charles: Dave, before you left your job or before you moved, did you sit down and say, âOK, this is how roles and responsibilities and how we are together changes?â</p>
<p>Dave: Yeah.</p>
<p>Rachel: Oh, yeah. We had never worked together before, so just one thing that we committed to, more hardcore than ever, was we are going to communicate. If something feels weird, no more keeping it to yourself.</p>
<p>Dave: Radical candor.</p>
<p>Rachel: Radical candor. You have to tell each other. We commit to working things out in real time instead of letting things fester, because the question of taking a back seat to your wifeâs career, your girlfriendâs career? Thereâs no back seat. This is a two-seater car. Thereâs no back seat, because I donât know anybody in a relationship who is successful without the support of their partner.</p>
<p>In any romantic relationship, there are going to be seasons. And maybe this is a season right now where youâre showing out for her because this is her dream and you want to love on her and you want to be in partnership with this woman. And when she gets through school, and she has all that vet money, maybe thatâs the season youâre building your small business. This is what partnership looks like. I donât believe in a leader. I believe that partnership is two people choosing to do life together, and sometimes youâre the captain, sometimes youâre the navigator, sometimes youâre the hype squad. It just looks like different things at different times.</p>

<h3 id="get-out-of-your-own-way-by-dave-hollis-book-review">&ldquo;Get Out of Your Own Way, by Dave Hollis book review&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HXGBYDTKBQI6VK7PAIHQQ2R7VM.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
âNow thatâs a master class in effective passive-aggression. And thank God for that,â Dave writes, strangely triumphant. Passive-aggression can be effective, no doubt. But only in Hollisville will you find somebody whoâll tell you itâs the path to a healthy marriage.</p>
<p>And yet, a whole lot of people want to be in Hollisville. Rachelâs two self-help books, âGirl, Wash Your Faceâ (2018) and âGirl, Stop Apologizingâ (2019), have sold millions of copies, serving as the backbone of a media and lifestyle company that includes podcasts, clothing, journals and motivational conferences, where VIP tickets can go for more than $1,000 a pop. (Those on a budget can watch the Hollises do their best Kelly-and-Ryan gabfest routine on Facebook Live.)</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The daughter of a Pentecostal preacher, Rachel Hollis originally used womenâs church groups as the model for her brand of motivational speaking. Over time, though, her rhetoric has become less churchy and more Oprah you-go-girl â with a more aggressive spin. Thereâs no room for excuses here, Hollis tells us in her books, live appearances and relentless social media posts: Weâre all going to wake up before dawn and punch complacency in the face.</p>
<p>In 2018, Dave left his job as head of global distribution at Disney to serve as CEO of Rachelâs burgeoning empire, becoming more of a fixture at her events. In that light, âGet Out of Your Own Wayâ is mainly an act of brand extension, an attempt to bring men into the fold. Like âGirl, Wash Your Face,â âGet Out of Your Own Wayâ is broken down into chapters meant to debunk the âlies we tell ourselves.â Adapted for guys, this includes: âMy Work Is Who I Am,â âFailure Means Youâre Weak,â âI Need to Parent Like My Parents.â His wisdom on these matters, per the Hollis brand, is almost entirely self-generated: The occasional expert insight comes from other self-help books like âThe 5 Love Languagesâ or business-leader airplane reads.</p>
<p>What Dave Hollis lacks in authority he tries to make up for in attitude, adopting a persona as the grown-up frat boy whoâs been brought down to earth. Mostly down to earth, anyway. Chapters often open with a boast of some sort: He was âa great baseball player growing upâ; heâs negotiated deals that âinvolved the biggest names in brands and entertainmentâ; he was âvaledictorian at my high schoolâ; he was âa nerd growing up.â (Yes, thatâs a boast. In 2020, being a ânerdâ just means you like Marvel Comics movies, and Dave was literally responsible for getting those movies into theaters.) Naturally, he faces reckonings for all those boasts, but his humblings are always about how he found his way to newer, shinier things to boast about.</p>

<p>Itâs in talking about his learning process that things get odd with Dave Hollis. He seems to take a masochistic pleasure in Rachelâs tough-love lectures, sharing an always-be-closing email she sent him demanding that he step up his game: âYou are massively talented â and itâs not going to be enough to get you where you want to be or this company where we want it to go. We grow like warriors as fast as our business does, or weâll never turn it into what we know it can be. I love you.â (This message, he writes, was âmagic.â )</p>
<p>But Daveâs path to enlightenment usually only requires Dave. The Hollises promote a philosophy of hardcore bootstrapping â there is little thatâs wrong with you that canât be fixed by digging deeper into yourself. That includes problem drinking, which Dave learned to manage after another drill-sergeant lecture from Rachel (âStop talking about it and start doing something about it. You are in control of your life.â), a home gym, and buddies who âencourage me to drink the crap out of my sparkling water.â</p>
<p>Hollis acknowledges that help can sometimes be useful. He mentions his coming around to therapy in a reformed-caveman sort of way. (âWho needs therapy? Before I went, I was positive I knew the answer. Crazy people. Weak people. Broken people. . . . Not men.â) And in the sole chapter that reflects some genuine humility â truly, he could have written a whole book about it, a good book â heâs thankful for the support system that guided him and Rachel through their oft-frustrating efforts to adopt a child.</p>

<p>But the Hollis way is to attract a crowd, not create a community. The main path to glory in Hollisville is steroidal self-reliance, rooted in extreme honesty about your shortcomings. Honesty is a virtue of course, but for all the Hollisesâ talk about extreme candor, their vulnerability is almost always a function of image management. Success, Dave writes, demands âbeing conscious at all times of how your actions and your hoped-for reception align to deliver the personal brand you aspire to.â Vulnerability is meaningful only to the extent that it sells. One senses that if vulnerability stopped selling for the Hollises, theyâd soon pivot to selling something else.</p>
<p>Every chapter of âGet Out of Your Own Wayâ closes with a takeaway section headlined âThings That Helped Me.â At first this seems like an act of modesty, an acknowledgment that what worked for him wonât necessarily work for you. But ultimately itâs narcissistic, a way for him to tell stories about his ongoing âgrowthâ and âfulfillmentâ â the mountains he climbed, the revenue targets he hit â and frame it as actionable advice. Success, in Hollisville, isnât becoming a better person whoâs more engaged with the world. Itâs craven careerism. Itâs admiration and money. Itâs running your flaws through a sparkly Instagram filter. Itâs thinking youâre improving when spite dangles off your wifeâs wrist.</p>

Quibi has ordered The Rachel Hollis Show, a daily morning talk show hosted by Hollis, motivational speaker and New York Times best-selling author of Girl, Wash Your Face and Girl, Stop Apologizing, as part of the upcoming short-form video siteâs Daily Essentials programming slate. The series hails from The Hollis Companyâs 3% Chance Productions and Den of Thieves.</p>
<p>The daily talk show is described as âyour one-stop-shop for a daily dose of motivation and joy, designed to make you laugh, make you think and frankly, to motivate the crap out of you.â The Rachel Hollis Show will run once daily, Monday through Friday, only on Quibi.</p>

<p>âWeâre thrilled to be working with Rachel,â said Becky Brooks, Quibiâs Head of Daily Essentials, Lifestyle Development. âThis show will give us an inside look into Rachelâs world along with a platform for viewers, particularly women and moms, to take initial steps in empowering themselves and their futures. Rachel, and her connection with her audience, is one-of-a-kind, and we canât wait to bring her to Quibi.â</p>
<p>The show will be executive produced by Rachel Hollis, Dave Hollis and Cameron Berkman from The Hollis Companyâs 3% Chance Productions and Jesse Ignjatovic, Evan Prager, Jordan Barrow and Jared Morell from Den of Thieves.</p>
