<p>Story: In the Ubhe family, the eldest son thinks he is fit to fight for the title of the village sarpanch after his father’s death. Many agree. But what is politics without a few twists and turns in the plot?</p>
<p>Review: Politics is a dirty game, or so people say. But perhaps politics is just a game of chess where one player outsmarts the other using clever ideas and smart moves. And like chess, the political game isn’t over until one player checkmates the other. Till then, the game can turn around anytime. Dhurala brings this game and the dirty politics to the big screen with a set of big players, each with their sets of strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Dhurala is based in a village around a political family. It opens with the passing of the sarpanch of the village and patriarch of the family, Nivrutti Ubhe. The sarpanch’s passing throws open the seat for re-election with only two players in the fray- Nivrutti’s elder son Dada (Ankush Chaudhari) and his arch-rival Harish Gadhwe (Prasad Oak). Dada is a progressive thinker who wants to work for the development of the village, while Harish is the wounded tiger in the arena, waiting for a turn to strike back. Little do these two know that there’s a bigger picture yet to unfold that will bring in more players in the arena, including Dada’s stepmother Akkabai (Alka Kubal-Athalye), his sister-in-law Monica, his younger brothers Bhaujya (Amey Wagh) and Hanumant (Siddharth Jadhav), and his wife Harshada (Sai Tamhankar). Everyone wants a piece of the cake and this turns the Ubhe household into a battlefield with three contenders pitted against each other.</p>
<p>In the past, the director-writer duo of Sameer Vidwans-Kshitij Patwardhan has given the Marathi audience films worth watching (Double Seat, YZ, Time Please). With Dhurala, they continue the winning streak and give a fitting start to the New Year. The film is well-written and well-executed; it has a gripping story line that ensures there’s no dull moment for the audience. At the same time, it is entertaining with the multiple twists and performances.</p>
<p>Often in a multi-starrer, there are one or two actors that overshadow the others, but not in this one. Here’s every character is well-written and has a pivotal role to play in the political game. Moreover, the actors bring their top-game to the fore. Ankush, as the restrained yet clever Dada, Sai as the balanced Harshada, Sonalee as the ambitious Monica, Prasad as the vengeful Harish, Amey as the neglected dreamer, Alka as the hesitant participant and Siddharth as the brawny Cement Sheth with a heart of gold- together they pack a punch and ace their roles.</p>
<p>The film isn’t devoid of drawbacks. The plot twists get predictable after a point and a 5-10 min patch a while before the climax seems stretched. Compared to the bigger picture though, these are just bumps on an otherwise smooth road. Dhurala, perhaps, sets the tone for a promising 2020 for Marathi cinema.</p>

<h3 id="shri-ram-samarth-movie-review-a-film-with-a-takeaway">&ldquo;Shri Ram Samarth Movie Review: A film with a takeaway&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-71852240/71852240.jpg?94202" alt="img">
Story: On their way to a picnic spot, a group of youngsters meet with an accident. They get rescued by a villager who takes them to a caring woman named Mai Patankar. What follows is a series of storytelling sessions from the life of Samartha Ramdas Swami&hellip;</p>
<p>Review: Santosh Todankar&rsquo;s Shri Ram Samarth aims at delivering an inspiring message through the teachings of Samartha Ramdas. Although the premise of the film banks on good v/s evil, the takeaway is- &lsquo;Do good always and speak the truth&rsquo;. But somehow the movie fails to capture the imagination of the viewers. While the film tries to create a dialogue between the younger generation and Samartha Ramdas, two things make it a tedious watch- the stretched plot and preachy discourse.the</p>
<p>After being cared for by Mai Patankar (Alka Kubal), who is a devotee of Lord Ram and Samartha Ramdas, a group of youngsters have to stay back for two days. In this time, Mai starts narrating them the life story of the the saint. From his childhood, pilgrimage and impact on people, she preaches how his life is an inspiration to live a pious life.</p>
<p>While Shantanu Moghe is convincing as Samartha Ramdas and Alka Kubal&rsquo;s part as Mai remains impactful, the film is only for those who follow Samartha Ramdas&rsquo; teachings and are fascinated with his life.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/73072923.cms" alt="img">
The trailer of the film has very successfully given us a glimpse into each one of the characters in the film. While Ankush Chaudhari plays the major role, Chaudhari’s mother (Alka Kubal). His biggest obstacle is Gadhwe (Prasad Oak). The very popular &lsquo;Mauli&rsquo; star Siddharth Jadhav will be seen sharing the screen with Sonalee Kulkarni after a decade. The film also has important characters played by big names like Amey Wagh and Sai Tamhankar. Umesh Kamat makes a fleeting yet strong appearance in the end. All the characters in the movie have their own prominence and each in their own way contributes to the story of the film. And this certainly is one of the major highlights of the movie.

Ganga has become a household name thanks to the popular reality show ‘Yuva Dancing Queen’. She is co-hosting the show along with Adwait Dadarkar. From being Pranit Hatte to Ganga, her journey was never easy. Ganga recently shared her childhood picture on Instagram and surprised everyone with her picture as Pranit. She also captioned the picture as “This life journey is just amazing..from handsome to beautiful..people say it is a cure but I think I am blessed to be born this way”.The transgender host had to face a lot in her life. Talking about her childhood days, Ganga exclusively spoke to Etimes TV earlier and said, &ldquo;When I was a child, I started getting those girlish vibes and feelings that I want to look like a beautiful girl. I wanted to become a woman so I will never kill or destroy those feelings. It’s a god’s gift for me that I have become Ganga now. It has not happened all of a sudden. Sometimes people get influence by others but my case was different. I was not into the influence of anyone but that feeling was with me since my childhood and I strongly believe that there is a reason behind everything. God has sent the gift to my family. My parents got the gift as a Pranit. They have done an excellent job while growing up Pranit but now it’s my responsibility to take Pranit to the next level as Ganga.”On the work front, Ganga is the first transwoman who is hosting a Marathi TV show.‘Yuva Dancing Queen&rsquo; features popular Marathi actresses like Gayatri , Dhanashree Kadgaonkar, Purva Shinde, Shaila Tike , Neha Khan, Ayli Ghiya, Krutika Gaikwad, Breshna Khan, Girija Prabhu , Deepali Naigaonkar, Shama Deshpande Ankita Bhagat are going to compete for the crown ‘Yuva Dancing Queen’.

<h3 id="bakaal-movie-review-high-action-amateur-treatment">&ldquo;Bakaal Movie Review: High action, amateur treatment&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-71971949/71971949.jpg?47575" alt="img">
Story: Criminal activities have taken over the lives of many people and a group of youngsters take the responsibility to put an end to these crimes.</p>
<p>Review: Marketed as &lsquo;The first Marathi action film&rsquo;, Bakaal is definitely high on action, but calling it a first is stretching it a bit.</p>
<p>The film has a pretty simple story revolving around a group of youngsters whose lives have been affected by Bakaal, a person behind many illegal activities happening around them. Some have lost dear ones to addiction, some have tried to commit suicide and some have been rendered helpless due to Bakaal. However, the youngsters decide to take things under their control and prepare to tackle the wrongdoings in their own way. They prepare under the guidance of an able trainer for the same. But do they manage to take Bakaal down?</p>
<p>To its credit, this film, directed by Sameer Athalye, does have a lot of good action choreography and Chaitanya Mestry, the leading man, performs the stunts and fights convincingly. His action sequences are the highlights of the film, albeit the only ones. Thanks to amateur treatment and over-the-top portrayals, Bakaal fails to keep you hooked. Debutant Jui Bendkhale has a good screen presence but little scope in terms of performance here. Alka Kubal makes an appearance as well, but there&rsquo;s nothing noteworthy there. Unless you are content watching a movie for just a few fight sequences, this one can be avoided.

First song on ‘Marbat’ for upcoming Marathi film ‘Bakaal’ released</p>
<p>Staff Reporter : City’s rich culture seems to be gradually opening up to the outside world. This was apparent from the very first of its kind song ,featuring the famous Marbat Mahotsav of the city, was released at the hands of Guardian Minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule and Dr Girish Gandhi, actor Alka Kubal at Baburao Dhanwate Hall on Monday. The occasion was to time it with the actual Marbat Mahotsav, that will take place in a few days from now.</p>
<p>Bawankule, in his brief speech, congratulated the team of ‘Bakaal’ for selecting a good theme and bring the 135-year-old ancient culture on screen and making it known countrywide. He assured all help to the team. Dr Girish Gandhi explained the importance of the tradition and also congratulated the team for picking on one of the city’s attractive Mahotsav. He also acknowledged the involvement of two Nagpurians Moreshwar Nistane who composed the song and Vinod Deshpande, story writer.</p>
<p>Addressing the media, Samir Athlaye, Director of Marathi Film Bakaal, that includes this song, described the event as top class that has plenty of material to keep the viewers on tenter hooks, with daring stunt scenes being performed by young actor Chaitanya Mistri. He said that the song Gheun Ja Ge Marbat forms the basis of the storyline in which the story writer has shown a commoner’s fight against ills, affecting society.
