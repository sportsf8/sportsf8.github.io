With the two-hour season finale of 911: Lone Star airing Monday, March 9 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET/PT on FOX, fans are wondering if the 911 spinoff is renewed or canceled for a second season. Here‚Äôs what we know so far.

FOX Hasn‚Äôt Decided Yet

A representative from FOX tells Heavy that there is no official word yet. However, we think fans have lots of reasons to be optimistic about a renewal.

First off, its ratings are on par with the ratings its parent show earns. In its third season, 911 has averaged 6.7 million viewers on the night its episodes air and an average of 10.4 million viewers when Live+7 ratings are calculated. Live+7 ratings include DVR numbers over the week after an episode airs.

For 911: Lone Star, it has averaged 6.5 million viewers for its night-of ratings and an average of 7.2 million on its Live+7 ratings. While the show doesn‚Äôt gain as many viewers between the live airings and the DVR viewings, it is still performing pretty well, especially compared to FOX‚Äôs other shows this year. 911: Lone Star is outperforming Outmatched and Prodigal Son and is not that far behind The Masked Singer season three.

Critics And Audiences Enjoy It

I love #911lonestar cast with all my heart I really hope we have a season 2 It's meanq a lot to me ‚Äî üêçüåπ (@Tkdeserveworld) March 9, 2020

The first season of 911: Lone Star has a 73 percent fresh rating at Rotten Tomatoes, with The Hollywood Reporter critic Dan Fienberg calling it ‚Äúa fun/thrilling escape‚Äù and The Ringer‚Äôs Miles Surrey writing, ‚ÄúAs long as Lone Star remembers the enduring appeal of these silly shows, we should be in for another wild ride in the 911 Extended Universe.‚Äù

911 fans are also feeling the spinoff, calling for a second season on Twitter. TV Fanatic made the prediction mid-way through 911: Lone Star‚Äôs first season that it would be back, writing, ‚ÄúThe spinoff is a hit and is pulling in solid DVR ratings, so it will be back for a second season.‚Äù

From 9-1-1 co-creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Tim Minear, the series stars Rob Lowe (‚ÄúThe Grinder,‚Äù ‚ÄúParks and Recreation,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe West Wing‚Äù) as a sophisticated New York cop who, along with his son, re-locates to Austin and must try to balance saving those who are at their most vulnerable with solving the problems in his own life.

In ‚ÄúAwakening,‚Äù the first episode of the two-parter, T.K. (Ronen Rubinstein) will be fighting for his life after last week‚Äôs cliffhanger in which a frightened child accidentally shot him. But it sounds like T.K. pulls through because the episode description for part II says that his father, Owen (Rob Lowe), will help him ‚Äúreconcile the past to help his future.‚Äù This is T.K.‚Äôs second brush with death after OD‚Äôing several years ago, so he will undoubtedly have some issues to work through in that regard.

Additionally, Michelle (Liv Tyler) will find out what happened to her missing sister, Iris (Lyndsy Fonseca). Viewers found out last week that Iris is alive, but Michelle doesn‚Äôt know yet, so expect an emotional reveal on that front.

Finally, the rest of the fire, EMT and police crew will first head to a gender reveal party gone horribly wrong, then into a cave to save a father and son who became trapped during a spelunking expedition.

The two-part 911: Lone Star finale, ‚ÄúAwakening‚Äù and ‚ÄúAustin, We Have a Problem,‚Äù airs Monday, March 9 from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET/PT on FOX.
