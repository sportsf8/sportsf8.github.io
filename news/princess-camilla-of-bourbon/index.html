<p>Prince Albert II of Monaco BBC / Spun Gold TV / Palais Princier</p>
<p>For many, Monaco conjures up images of billionaires, super-yachts and casinos, not to mention its status as a tax-free haven for the super-rich. Yet its ruling family would like that to change, as seen in a new three-part documentary series starting on BBC Two tonight.</p>
<p>Inside Monaco has rare access to the House of Grimaldi, featuring interviews with Prince Albert II and his wife Princess Charlene, as well as offering a behind-the-scenes look at the Formula 1 Grand Prix, plus Monaco&rsquo;s glamorous casinos and hotels, including a new suite inspired by one of its most famous residents, Princess Grace.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Yet behind the fast cars and the playboy setting, Monaco has the oldest population in the world, with the 40,000 residents having an average age of 52. Some of the most famous include Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green (68), Walgreens share holder Stefano Pessina (79) and Sir David and Frederick Barclay, owners of The Telegraph (85).</p>

<p>This is something the principality is keen to change, with the newly launched Monaco Influencer Awards hoping to attract bright young things (with money) to the glamorous Cote d&rsquo;Azur location.</p>
<p>It is the brainchild of Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, a close friend of Prince Albert, who married Prince Charles of Bourbon in a glittering ceremony in Monaco in 1998.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I moved to Monaco about 25 years ago, I can remember there was a lot of — how can I say — elderly people,&rsquo; she says. &lsquo;It would be a disaster to stay a place where only elderly people come and retire. We don’t want that, we want Monaco to be the glamorous place, the diamond place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Of Monaco&rsquo;s famous paparazzi ban, she says that the youth now are more comfortable with taking photographs, &lsquo;Royalty often grows up saying you should not take pictures. We have a different approach to everything that has to have social media. Tonight we are posting everywhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the documentary, Prince Albert opens up about life as a royal, saying: &lsquo;I can’t say that every day is wonderful bliss and enjoyment. It’s not easy for anybody in a position of responsibility. There are some very unpleasant meetings. I try to think what nice things will come after my meetings are over&hellip; having a nice glass of wine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He also talks about his parents. Of his father, Prince Rainier III, he says, &lsquo;We did behave when we knew that he was watching. He had ways of raising his voice that was impressive for a six, seven, eight, nine or ten-year-old. Even at 21.&rsquo; And of his mother, Princess Grace, &lsquo;It’s just incredible that so many years after her passing she still very much has a vivid presence in a lot of people’s minds and hearts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the documentary crew are given a sneak peek at a new £35,000-a-night hotel suite at the Hôtel de Paris which was inspired by Grace Kelly, with the design overseen by Albert himself.</p>

<p>Inside Monaco airs tonight at 9pm on BBC Two

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to feel for Monika Bacardi and Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.</p>
<p>It’s time to socialise and oh, what to wear? Which car to go out in? The Rolls or the Ferrari&hellip; maybe the Mercedes? And do we dine at the Hotel de Paris or stay a little more local? The wine might set us back £27,000. But at least we haven’t got to pay £35,000 a night for a hotel suite.</p>
<p>Welcome to Monaco&hellip; home of the rich, the super rich and the outright stinking rich. A place where a third of residents are millionaires.</p>
<p>And the billionaires club boasts plenty of members too – like savvy businesswoman Camilla, 49 – enjoying life in this low-tax haven.</p>
<p>Italian-born royal Camilla is so wealthy that even the luxuries that most of us can only dream of seem like an inconvenience.</p>
<p>(Image: BBC/Spun Gold TV/Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies) (Image: Getty Images/Canopy)</p>
<p>Shopping at Louis Vuitton, Chanel and Dior? Not for Camilla.</p>
<p>She says: “I have the pleasure of young stylists that loan me or give me nice dresses to wear at important dates or events. Somehow I have been quite spoiled on that front.”</p>
<p>A spot of lunch if she gets peckish? That’s at Monaco Yacht Club where new members need approval from Albert II, the Prince of Monaco.</p>
<p>Camilla and Monika are among the mega-wealthy characters to feature in new BBC2 show Inside Monaco:</p>
<p>Playground of the Super Rich. The programme peers into a world of wealth in this French Riviera paradise.</p>

<p>Camilla moved to Monaco more than 20 years ago after marrying Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro – a member of the Spanish royal family.</p>
<p>They have two daughters – Princess Chiara, 15, and Princess Carolina, 16 – and now split their time between Monaco, Paris and Rome.</p>
<p>Camilla says: “In Monaco, you can go to two or three events every night. There is not one evening where it is boring. It’s impossible.”</p>
<p>She loves Monte Carlo restaurant Cipriani’s, which serves sumptuous Italian meals at up to £95 per head for three courses.</p>
<p>Wine and tips are extra. But still pretty cheap by Monaco standards.</p>

<p>Like many, Camilla is reluctant to go into details of her wealth. She heads the family investments business and runs a charitable foundation too. But despite her connections and formidable business acumen, Camilla likes to spend her free time with her daughters – home-schooled at their luxury apartment.</p>
<p>She explains: “My girls are still at the perfect age to dedicate themselves to their mother – or Mummy, as they call me. We live in a rented apartment which is very simple, but I’ve made it nice. It’s quite modern. It’s fantastic because it has a nice view of the sea – which is most important.”</p>
<p>Camilla may be understating the opulence of the apartment.</p>
<p>For starters, there is an aquarium. Not to mention a private cinema room, a gym, a spa and a star-painted ceiling reminiscent of Hogwarts Hall in Harry Potter. Camilla says: “My favourite thing is the aquarium. It’s very big and it’s also the living room table.</p>
<p>(Image: BBC/Spun Gold TV/Photos@Palais Princier) (Image: Dave Benett/Getty Images for TAG Heuer)</p>
<p>“On top of it, you have candies and decoration. We had octopus for a little time but it wasn’t working very well. Then we had piranhas and now it’s full of big red fishes. We change it up sometimes to have fun.</p>
<p>“The ceiling illustrates our universe and the diverse galaxies. When we had it done, we asked the artist to make our planet shine brighter so we could spot it.</p>
<p>“I would be very sad to ever leave Monaco. You just get out the house and walk across the road and you have the best position in the world. From plastic surgery, to the best cars,</p>
<p>Monaco, around the size of Hyde Park, prides itself on being the glamour capital of the world.</p>
<p>Ex-playboy Prince Albert – who has just recovered from coronavirus – has the final word on all that happens in this nation of 37,000 people.</p>

<p>He flies by private jet – naturally – drives fast cars and has a cellar at his palace containing 15,000 bottles of super-expensive wine.</p>
<p>Gregoire Gomon, the palace butler, says: “Such bottles are the best wines you can find ever. Very rare – ranging in the 30,000 euros.”</p>
<p>Like Camilla, film financier Monika Bacardi has been in Monaco for 20 years. Her late husband was heir to the Bacardi rum fortune and she is also close friends with stars such as British actress Dame Joan Collins.</p>
<p>Monika, 51, says: “Here we have the Hotel de Paris, the yacht club, a shopping centre – Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Celine, Bvlgari, Cartier, Dior – whatever your heart wants.”</p>
<p>(Image: AFP via Getty Images) (Image: BBC/Spun Gold TV)</p>
<p>And Monika knows how to splash the cash. A fleet of cars includes two Rolls-Royces – well, you always need a spare – a Ferrari, Mercedes and a Range Rover.</p>
<p>Unusually for Monaco, Monika lives in a multi-storey house with five floors.</p>
<p>She boasts: “I don’t go to the gym. I rock it up the stairs!”</p>
<p>Property, unsurprisingly, is toe-curlingly expensive, with the average home costing £45,000 per square metre, twice as much as a flat in London’s Mayfair.</p>
<p>Ex-Formula One driver David Coulthard, 49, dipped his toe into the market by investing in the swish Columbus Hotel in Monte Carlo, before selling in 2010.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images) (Image: AFP via Getty Images)</p>
<p>But for visitors, nothing beats the lure of Hotel de Paris, where rooms with a private pool can cost £35,000 per night. One of the biggest signs of wealth here is transport.</p>
<p>On Grand Prix weekend, visitors take helicopters like taxis – up to 800 flights per day. The streets are crammed with Rollers, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, McLarens.</p>
<p>Huge yachts grab attention too and harbour masters struggle to fit them all in at £1,887 a night.</p>
<p>Assistant harbour master Gerald Mazzola says: “For me, they are like crazy children, they want everything and they want more and more and more and more.”</p>
<p>Monaco is a captivating place – if you have the money. And even the captives can’t complain.</p>
<p>Inmates at a small prison – right on the water’s edge with stunning views – are served pasta with entrecôte steak and bruschetta with tomato and Emmental cheese.</p>
<p>There could be worse places to be locked up&hellip;</p>
<p>Inside Monaco is on BBC2 on Monday at 9pm

<h3 id="tv-pick-of-the-week-a-glittering-fantasy-land-dominated-by-depressingly-vulgar-demonstrations-of-wealth">&ldquo;TV pick of the week: &lsquo;A glittering fantasy-land dominated by depressingly vulgar demonstrations of wealth&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.independent.ie/incoming/f4a10/39260086.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/Inside-Monaco.jpg" alt="img">
In 1297, a Genovese robber baron led a gang disguised as Franciscan monks on a daring raid on the Rock of Monaco.</p>
<p>His name was Francisco Grimaldi, and his wily descendants would eventually gain control of the tiny city state and lead it slowly towards extreme wealth, and independence.</p>
<p>These days Monaco is famous as the playground of the super-wealthy: more than 30pc of its 38,000 inhabitants are millionaires, and fat-ass yachts jostle for space in Port Hercules.</p>
<p>Read More</p>
<p>You can visit by train from nearby Nice, swapping the salty Nicoise back-streets for a glittering fantasy-land dominated by depressingly vulgar demonstrations of wealth. It&rsquo;s an odd little place, about half the size of the Phoenix Park but every inch a hugely valuable piece of real estate. This new three-part documentary series will allow one to vicariously travel to the vaunted principality and find out what life is like in one of the world&rsquo;s most exclusive enclaves.</p>
<p>We meet Prince Albert II, the latest in a long line of Grimaldis, and the exceedingly wealthy widow Monika Bacardi, who takes director Michael Waldman and his cameraman on a tour of the city in her chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce. We visit the famous yacht show, and the Monaco Grand Prix, where Waldman has a chat with team owner Eddie Jordan.</p>
<p>As visitors flock in for the Grand Prix weekend, Michael speaks to the harbour masters responsible for guiding yachts worth millions to their moorings, and to Sylvie, a housekeeper to the stars at the iconic Hotel de Paris, who must cater to the every whim of her VIP guests. It&rsquo;s also a busy time for the hotel&rsquo;s parking valets, who are left in charge of some very fancy cars.</p>
<p>Monaco has been extremely adept at protecting its reputation as one of the most glamorous places in the world, but constantly needs to attract more wealth. And here we witness Prince Albert&rsquo;s friend, the wonderfully titled Princess Camilla of Bourbon and the Two Sicilies, as she hosts the Monaco Influencers Awards, which will hopefully lure in some social-media millionaires.</p>

<p>Belgian prince with COVID-19 apologizes after attending party in Spain during lockdown On May 31, Belgium&rsquo;s Prince Joachim — a nephew of King Philippe and the youngest son of Belgium&rsquo;s Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este — apologized after it was revealed that he&rsquo;d been diagnosed with the coronavirus after attending a party in Spain during lockdown. &ldquo;I would like to apologize for travelling and not having respected the quarantine measures. I did not intend to offend or disrespect anyone in these very difficult times and deeply regret my actions and accept the consequences,&rdquo; he said in a statement, as reported by the BBC. Reports explained that the young royal travelled from Belgium to Spain for an internship in late May but instead of quarantining for two weeks as required of travelers under the country&rsquo;s COVID-19 state of emergency guidelines, he went to a party two days later in the city of Córdoba despite lockdown rules banning get-togethers of more than 15 people. The gathering was reportedly attended by between 12 and 27 people. RELATED: Famous people who&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with COVID-19</p>
<p>New Tatler cover story on Duchess Kate sparks rare palace statement — and a legal threat On May 27, Kensington Palace issued a rare statement hitting back at claims made about Duchess Kate in a new Tatler magazine cover story titled &ldquo;Catherine the Great,&rdquo; insisting, &ldquo;This story contains a swathe of inaccuracies &amp; false misrepresentations which were not put to Kensington Palace prior to publication.&rdquo; The magazine&rsquo;s editor swiftly issued a response saying he and the magazine stood by reporter Anna Pasternak and her sources, adding, &ldquo;Kensington Palace knew we were running the &lsquo;Catherine the Great&rsquo; cover months ago and we asked them to work together on it. The fact they are denying they ever knew is categorically false.&rdquo; Then on May 30, the Mail on Sunday reported that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sent Tatler a legal letter threatening legal action and demanding that the story be removed from the internet. So what, exactly, is in the July/August cover story that might have sparked such a response from the royals? There are a few juicy tidbits, including an anecdote about an &ldquo;incident&rdquo; at Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry&rsquo;s 2018 wedding rehearsal, though it&rsquo;s unclear if this is the same one that previous reports have claimed involved Princess Charlotte — and made Kate cry. &ldquo;It was a hot day and apparently there was a row over whether the bridesmaids should wear tights or not. Kate, following protocol, felt that they should. Meghan didn&rsquo;t want them to,&rdquo; recounted a friend of the Cambridges. (Meghan won out.) The Tatler piece also alleges that people around Kate and husband Prince William — who is &ldquo;absolutely incandescent about Megxit,&rdquo; a courtier told Tatler, referring to the Sussexes&rsquo; decision to leave as senior members of the royal family earlier this year — believe &ldquo;Meghan and Harry have been so selfish,&rdquo; which has added to William and Kate&rsquo;s workload. Said another pal of the Cambridges: &ldquo;William and Catherine really wanted to be hands-on parents and the Sussexes have effectively thrown their three children under a bus. There goes their morning school runs as the responsibilities on them now are enormous.&rdquo; Added another source: &ldquo;Kate is furious about the larger workload. Of course she&rsquo;s smiling and dressing appropriately but she doesn&rsquo;t want this. She feels exhausted and trapped. She&rsquo;s working as hard as a top CEO, who has to be wheeled out all the time, without the benefits of boundaries and plenty of holidays.&rdquo; Read it all for yourself here.

<p>On May 27, Spain began an official 10-day period of mourning to honor nearly 27,000 confirmed coronavirus dead. The Spanish royal family stepped out wearing black as they publicly paid their respects to the victims, with King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia — accompanied by daughters Leonor, Princess of Asturias and Infanta Sofia — leading a minute of silence in the garden at the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid. The royal household said in a tweet the same day, as reported by HELLO! magazine, &ldquo;Spain mourns for so many thousands of compatriots that we have lost in this pandemic. To all, together with their families, we owe our remembrance, our mourning and our affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denmark&rsquo;s future king celebrates 52nd birthday On May 26, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark turned 52. The palace marked the occasion with an Instagram post accompanied by a new portrait of the future king. Less than two weeks earlier on May 14, Frederik had another reason to celebrate: He and wife Princess Mary marked their 16-year wedding anniversary.</p>
<p>Spain&rsquo;s royals celebrate two wedding anniversaries Spain&rsquo;s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary on May 22. Felipe was still the prince of Asturias when he exchanged vows with Letizia, a divorced TV news journalist, at the the Santa María la Real de La Almudena Cathedral in Madrid in 2004. But they&rsquo;re not the only Spanish royals with a wedding anniversary this month: Felipe&rsquo;s parents also tied the knot in May…</p>
<p>Another pair of Spanish royals mark wedding anniversary On May 14, King Felipe VI&rsquo;s parents marked 58 years of marriage: Spain&rsquo;s former monarch, Juan Carlos of Spain, married Princess Sophia of Greece (who later became Spain&rsquo;s Queen Sofía) on May 14, 1962, first in a Roman Catholic ceremony at the Cathedral of St. Denis in Athens, then in a Greek Orthodox ceremony at the city&rsquo;s Metropolitan Orthodox Cathedral of the Virgin Mary. Juan Carlos abdicated in favor of his son in 2014.</p>
<p>Belgian heir to the throne to attend military school Belgium&rsquo;s future queen, Princess Elisabeth, is headed to military school. The teen will enter the Royal Military School in central Brussels — her father, King Philippe, also attended — for a year-long course in social and military sciences in order to help prepare her for her future royal duties, Belgium&rsquo;s palace announced on May 20. &ldquo;She joins a long tradition within the royal family,&rdquo; a statement said. Elisabeth, 18, graduates from high school — she attends the United World College of the Atlantic in Wales — at the end of May.</p>
<p>Prince William and Duchess Kate change their name on social media On May 20, media outlets reported that Prince William and Duchess Kate had quietly made a small but significant name change on social media — and eagle-eyed followers who noticed were loving it. Though their Instagram and Twitter handles remain @KensingtonPalace — which is their official residence and where their offices are located — their social media accounts now use the display name The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge instead of Kensington Palace. Still formal? Yes. But for the British royals, it&rsquo;s about as modern and accessible as it gets. Fans characterized the seemingly random move as a win, noting that the new moniker seems &ldquo;more personal&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate,&rdquo; InStyle reported.</p>
<p>The Sussexes celebrate two-year wedding anniversary On May 19, 2018, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry spent their day getting married at St. George&rsquo;s Chapel at Windsor Castle and partying into the night at an evening reception at nearby Frogmore House. On May 19, 2020, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex reportedly spent their day relaxing at their temporary home in the Hollywood Hills — a sprawling Tuscan-style villa they&rsquo;re borrowing from new friend Tyler Perry — as they hunt for a house to purchase. Amid the COVID-19 crisis, they had no grand plans. &ldquo;The day will simply be quality time with one another and as a family&rdquo; with son Archie, 1, and their two dogs, a source close to the couple told Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar royals editor Omid Scobie. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not going to be doing any work and made sure they have no meetings or calls in the diary.&rdquo; The source added, &ldquo;Like everyone else, they are in lockdown at the moment, so they will just be hanging out together at home. But it will still be a lovely day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coronavirus lockdown costs Queen Elizabeth II tens of millions Just like everyone else, the British monarchy will have to tighten its belt in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic. On May 18, MailOnline reported that the Lord Chamberlain warned staffers that Queen Elizabeth II could lose about $22 million due to the lockdown as palaces and other significant royal locations (like Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Scotland&rsquo;s Holyroodhouse, the Royal Mews and Clarence House) remain shut down — that&rsquo;s at least a third of her annual income. (Last year, ticket and souvenir sales brought in more than $85 million.) Staffers are being furloughed, pay is being frozen and recruitment is at a standstill. According to MailOnline, the decrease could also affect a planned $40 million renovation project at Buckingham Palace, among others projects.</p>
<p>The Netherlands&rsquo; queen turns 49 Queen Máxima of the Netherlands celebrated her 49th birthday on May 17. The royal family marked her special day on Instagram with a new photo. The mother of three, who&rsquo;s married to King Willem-Alexander, is the first Argentine-born queen consort in the country&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s Zara Tindall marks a birthday Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s second grandchild, Zara Tindall (née Phillips), turned 39 on May 15. The Olympic silver medal-winning equestrian was born in 1981 to Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips.</p>
<p>An Austrian princess dies at 31 On May 15, the Houston Chronicle published an obituary confirming that Austrian Princess Maria Galitzine — who in recent years went by her married name, Maria Singh — had died at 31. (See photos of her here.) &ldquo;Sadly, I can confirm that Princess Maria Galitzine Singh died on May 4, 2020, from a cardiac aneurysm,&rdquo; a delegate of the Emperor Karl League of Prayer — an organization that maintains the legacy of Emperor Karl I of Austria — told USA Today on May 15. The Luxembourg-born, Russia-raised daughter of Prince and Princess Piotr Galitzine had worked as an interior designer in Brussels and Chicago before putting down roots in Houston where her husband, Rishi Roop Singh, works as a chef. The late royal was a descendant of Emperor Karl I and Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma of the Habsburg dynasty — the last emperor and empress of Austria (pictured here on their wedding day).</p>
<p>Prince Carl Philip of Sweden turns 41 Sweden&rsquo;s Princess Sofia took a page out of Duchess Kate&rsquo;s book and showed off her camera skills to mark a loved one&rsquo;s birthday. To celebrate Prince Carl Philip of Sweden&rsquo;s 41st birthday on May 13, the palace released a photo of the Duke of Värmland that was taken by his wife and shared it on the royal family&rsquo;s official Instagram page. In it, he can be seen sitting on the steps of their home, Djurgården, in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Monegasque royal Pauline Ducruet opens up about fashion design career While quarantining with her mother, Princess Stephanie of Monaco, 26-year-old Pauline Ducruet — who&rsquo;s 16th in line to the Monegasque throne — spoke to Tatler magazine about Alter, the fashion line she founded in 2018. &ldquo;I always dreamed about having my own brand,&rdquo; explained Pauline, who attended Instituto Marangoni, a private Italian school of fashion and design, in Paris and enjoyed internships with Vogue and Louis Vuitton before launching her own label, which debuted its first runway show at Paris Fashion Week in 2019. &ldquo;It was always fashion since I was a kid. I think I&rsquo;ve always had this sensitivity to art, creativity, and self-expression.&rdquo; She told Tatler that her mother — who was, briefly, an &rsquo;80s pop star — is her personal style icon. &ldquo;She always played a huge role in how I see fashion because I grew up seeing her dress up for galas and admiring photos of her in the &rsquo;80s.&rdquo; Pauline also, however, admires her late grandmother, American actress-turned-princess Grace Kelly. &ldquo;My family has a more formal style I&rsquo;d say, but always very chic. I think they influenced me in that way and the rawness of Alter comes from a more streetwear inspiration.&rdquo; New York-based Pauline, whose father is Daniel Ducruet — Stephanie&rsquo;s former bodyguard-turned-husband of a year — revealed that she&rsquo;s been busy designing while isolated with her mom and half-sister, Camille Gottlieb (both are seen flanking her here during Paris Fashion Week in February), in Monaco over the last few months.</p>
<p>Luxembourg welcomes royal baby born amid the coronavirus pandemic Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg and wife Stéphanie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg welcomed their first child, Prince Charles Jean Philippe Joseph Marie Guillaume — who is second in line to the throne behind his father — on May 10. Due to the global COVID-19 health crisis, Guillaume&rsquo;s parents, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, had to meet their new grandson over a video call. &ldquo;A digital meeting, certainly, but charged with emotion!&rdquo; is how they described it. Three days after Charles arrived, his parents left the Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital wearing face masks and bid goodbye to doctors and nurses before heading home with their newborn.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II reportedly stepping back from public duties until at least the fall On May 10, reports revealed that amid the global coronavirus pandemic, Britain&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II will likely not be seen outside the palace gates until the fall, at the earliest — if not longer. At 94, she is one of the most vulnerable as Britain continues to be battered by COVID-19. &ldquo;The queen won&rsquo;t do anything which goes against the advice of people in her [age] category, and she&rsquo;s going to take all the appropriate advice. There are discussions what we could do and couldn&rsquo;t do come October,&rdquo; a palace source told Britain&rsquo;s The Sunday Times, as reported by People magazine. She&rsquo;ll continue with her official duties — she meets with Prime Minister Boris Johnson via phone — but won&rsquo;t likely leave Windsor Castle, where she&rsquo;s isolating with husband Prince Philip, 98, to return to Buckingham Palace in London. Some of the major events she&rsquo;s missing include the Chelsea Flower Show, the Windsor Horse Show, Trooping the Colour (her official birthday parade and celebration), Royal Ascot and, likely, even her annual summer trip to Balmoral, her residence in Scotland. According to The Mirror, aides have put together what they&rsquo;ve dubbed The Royal Task Force to ensure the royal family is front and center as the health crisis continues. Prince William and Duchess Kate have been at the forefront of this, regularly and quite ably doing Zoom calls with charity workers, veterans, frontline health workers, teachers and more (they&rsquo;re seen here outside their country home clapping for health care workers on a BBC Children In Need and Comic Relief special), and the queen&rsquo;s youngest son, Prince Edward, and wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex have been recruited to fill the void left by Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan. &ldquo;There is going to be a lot more interaction between the family members while the crisis is ongoing. Her Majesty has given instructions that, after a turbulent period for the family last year, now is the time to heal and have a united front and get back to the basics of what the monarchy is for — her sole belief is that it goes back to the basics of duty,&rdquo; a source told The Mirror.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s queen marks 75th anniversary of VE Day Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Britain&rsquo;s royals celebrated VE Day — Victory in Europe Day — on May 8 without fanfare, yet their solemn approach still resonated across the nation as it paid tribute to the World War II generation. Queen Elizabeth II delivered a speech that was recorded in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle and broadcast at 9 p.m. – the exact time her father, King George VI, announced the end of WWII in Europe three quarters of a century earlier — during the BBC&rsquo;s VE Day commemorations. The monarch delivered her address — during which she told her subjects, &ldquo;When I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognize and admire&rdquo; — with several significant objects in the background: a photo of her father in his Admiral of the Fleet uniform with RAF Wings; the cap she wore when she served in the Auxiliary Territorial Services during WWII (she&rsquo;s the only female member of the royal family ever to serve in Britain&rsquo;s armed forces as a full-time and active member); and a photograph of the royal family and Prime Minister Winston Churchill on the balcony at Buckingham Palace on VE Day in 1945, Town &amp; Country reported. Keep reading to see how Prince Charles and his wife marked the major milestone…</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla mark 75th VE Day anniversary in Scotland Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, marked VE day while isolating in Scotland. As a lone piper played in the background — adhering to coronavirus social distancing guidelines — the Prince of Wales and his wife paid their respects at the Balmoral War Memorial, where they laid a wreath. Charles also led the country in two minutes of silence and both he and his wife shared excerpts from family members&rsquo; personal journals. As reported by Town &amp; Country, Charles read from grandfather King George VI&rsquo;s diary entry in which the monarch described the events of VE Day 75 years ago while Camilla read an excerpt from father Major Bruce Shand&rsquo;s account of his time in the army during WWII. The Germans held him as a prisoner of war, though he was later able to escape and return to Britain.</p>
<p>Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan are getting the Lifetime movie treatment — again Lifetime is doing it again. On May 7, TVLine confirmed that the cable network is working on its third Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan movie, which is tentatively titled &ldquo;Harry &amp; Meghan: Escaping the Palace.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s set to chronicle how the couple stepped back from royal duties in favor of a more independent life — which the British press dubbed Megxit — and is a followup to previous Lifetime TV movies &ldquo;Harry &amp; Meghan: A Royal Romance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Harry &amp; Meghan: Becoming Royal.&rdquo; According to the official synopsis, the movie will dramatize &ldquo;the couple&rsquo;s controversial conscious uncoupling from the crown, after the birth of their son Archie&rdquo; and detail &ldquo;the struggles of the new parents and unique challenges of being part of the royal family, which ultimately led Harry and Meghan to give up their royal ties to forge a new life on their own terms.&rdquo; Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser, seen here, played the couple in &ldquo;A Royal Romance,&rdquo; while another pair of unknown actors brought the couple to life in the second film — but there&rsquo;s no word yet on casting for the third one.</p>
<p>Archie Mountbatten-Windsor turns 1 Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan&rsquo;s son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, marked a milestone birthday on May 6: He turned 1! To celebrate, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared a nearly 3-minute-long video of Meghan reading &ldquo;Duck! Rabbit!&rdquo; by Amy Krouse Rosenthal and Tom Lichtenheld to Archie — Harry served as the cameraman — for Save the Stories, a partnership between Save the Children and No Kid Hungry that&rsquo;s raising money to get meals to children in need amid the COVID-19 pandemic. (It was started by Jennifer Garner and Amy Adams in March.) A source told People magazine that the Sussexes, who&rsquo;ve been living in Los Angeles since leaving their senior roles as members of Britain&rsquo;s royal family in March, had a happy, family-focused day with Archie, who got to enjoy his first smash cake. &ldquo;Meghan made the cake — strawberries and cream,&rdquo; a source told People. &ldquo;And Harry helped with decorations and blew up balloons.&rdquo; The trio also enjoyed video chats with loved ones. &ldquo;They Zoomed with godparents, friends and family and had a really simple but incredibly joyous day,&rdquo; the source added. Watch Archie react as Meghan reads the book here.</p>
<p>Anticipated new book on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex set for summer release On May 4, it was announced that &ldquo;Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family&rdquo; will be published by Harper Collins-owned Dey Street Books on Aug. 11. The book, which is authored by Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar royal editor Omid Scobie and ELLE royal correspondent Carolyn Durand, promises to go &ldquo;beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan&rsquo;s life together, dispelling the many rumors and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond.&rdquo; The publisher has confirmed the authors were given &ldquo;unique access&rdquo; as they wrote the book with &ldquo;the participation of those closest to the couple.&rdquo; Some reports have even claimed the Duke and Duchess themselves cooperated. As Omid said on his &ldquo;The HeirPod&rdquo; podcast, &ldquo;I would like to think this tells the definitive version of their lives together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princess Charlotte turns 5 Prince William and Duchess Kate&rsquo;s second child, Princess Charlotte, turned 5 on May 2. To mark the occasion, they followed tradition and released a series of photos of their only daughter, which were taken by Kate. &ldquo;The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow,&rdquo; the couple captioned the Instagram slideshow (see all four photos here), which was posted on May 1. &ldquo;The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sweden&rsquo;s royal family welcomes a furry new member Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and her family — husband Prince Daniel and their kids, Princess Estelle and Prince Oscar — welcomed a furry new family member during the coronavirus pandemic: Rio. A photo of their adorable new cavapoo dog was released by the palace on May 2. At the time, Rio been living with them for a week at their home, Haga Palace, outside Stockholm. Keep reading for another pic of the adorable royal pup…</p>
<p>Meet Rio, Sweden&rsquo;s newest royal dog On May 2, Sweden&rsquo;s royal family released another photo of Rio, who joined Crown Princess Victoria and her husband and kids at home a week earlier. Rio is a cavapoo, which is a mix of the Cavalier King Charles spaniel and poodle dog breeds.

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has affected thousands of people across the globe, including royalty. Prince Albert of Monaco, 62, was confirmed to be the first head of state to have tested positive for the virus, while the Prince of Wales, 71, was also confirmed to have coronavirus this week after displaying &ldquo;mild symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Albert addressed rumours that he may have caused Prince Charles&rsquo; positive coronavirus diagnosis after they both contracted COVID-19 just two weeks after they met at a Water Aid event in London. Speaking to RTL radio on Thursday, the Monaco royal spoke about the speculation that one of the royals may have affected the other at the meeting on 10 March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at a roundtable for his foundation, but we never shook hands. I was at the other end of the table, way far away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We nodded hello to one another, so I don&rsquo;t think I can really be accused of contaminating him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Albert continued: &ldquo;There were a lot of other people around at the congress centre and I know he continued his schedule afterwards for a number of days.&rdquo; He added that Prince Charles &ldquo;had a number of other opportunities to catch it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales carried out a high number of engagements that week, including the Prince&rsquo;s Trust Awards and a dinner for the Australian Bushfire Appeal. He is currently self-isolating at his Scottish home, Birkhall, with wife Camilla (whose test came back negative) and aides said that he has been working at his desk.</p>
