<p>A photo of the cake, which was was found on Delany&rsquo;s old Tumblr, began circulating around Twitter on Tuesday following a tweet by food writer Tammie Teclemariam.</p>

<p>The controversy comes in the wake of Bon Appétit editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport&rsquo;s resignation; Rapaport stepped down on Monday after a photo of him in brownface resurfaced on Twitter.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>It has been a week of controversies at Bon Appétit — and it&rsquo;s only Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday, editor-in-chief Adam Rapoport stepped down after a photo of him in brownface resurfaced. A day later, editor Alex Delany has apologized for previously making a cake decorated as the Confederate flag.</p>
<p>A picture of the cake — which was found on Delany&rsquo;s old Tumblr account &ldquo;The Pantalones&rdquo; — began circulating around Twitter on Tuesday morning following a tweet by food writer Tammie Teclemariam.</p>
<p>In the original blog post — which was posted on July 24, 2010 — Delany wrote that he had made the cake because his best friend was moving to South Carolina.</p>
<p>The picture of Delany&rsquo;s Confederate flag cake was posted to his Tumblr in 2010. Tumblr</p>
<p>The Confederate flag, also called &ldquo;The Stars and Bars&rdquo; was the official flag of the Confederate States of America, which fought in the American Civil War to defend the use of slaves. Today, the flag is controversial with many saying it&rsquo;s no longer a mere representation of the American South, but a racist symbol, according to the Anti-Defamation League.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To honor her new home, my friends and I felt the need to express some Southern heritage in cake form,&rdquo; Delany wrote. &ldquo;Such a glorious cake for such a sad occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;About&rdquo; page on the Tumblr account confirmed that it was Delany&rsquo;s blog.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;About&rdquo; page of Delany&rsquo;s blog, which has since been taken down. Tumblr</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Alex. I&rsquo;m the assistant web editor of bonappetit.com,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;I have opinions. Most are foolish. Some are worthy. I like garlic knots, 10 cent dumplings, and prosciutto cotto. I ran this blog for a while. I&rsquo;m back to do it again (maybe).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last post on Delany&rsquo;s blog had been from 2017. It was taken down on Tuesday, shortly after the picture of the cake began circulating on Twitter.</p>
<p>Delany, who is now the drinks editor at Bon Appétit, addressed the image on his personal Instagram account.</p>
<p>Delany apologized for the Confederate flag cake on Tuesday. Alex Delaney/Instagram</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an image of a cake depicting a Confederate flag that was pulled from my Tumblr when I was 17,&rdquo; he wrote on the Instagram story. &ldquo;It goes without saying that this is a despicable symbol that a 17-year-old should understand. It does not reflect the values that I hold now. I condemn whoever uses or glorifies that flag. But I realize this image does reflect the lack of understanding I possessed at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delany called the image &ldquo;shameful,&rdquo; saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not what I am about now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot apologize intensely enough,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I know it doesn&rsquo;t cut it, but I am truly sorry. The significance of the failure is not lost on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delany said he would be donating his next paycheck to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education fund, as well as continuing to &ldquo;donate to the charities and organizations that are fighting for progress as frequently as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delany said he planned to donate his next paycheck to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Alex Delaney/Instagram</p>
<p>On the same day that the photo of Delany&rsquo;s Confederate flag cake resurfaced, a vine in which he is heard using a homophobic slur also began circulating on social media.</p>
<p>In the clip — which was first posted in March 2013 and included the caption &ldquo;How to not offend gay people&rdquo; — Delany looks at the camera and says, &ldquo;You guys wanna see a bunch of f****** lying on top of each other?&rdquo; before showing a pile of sticks.</p>
<p>The vine was posted on Instagram by Eater staff writer Elazar Sontag, who called on Delany to resign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I found my way to food writing, people like @alex_delany were the reason I didn&rsquo;t think I could build a life in restaurants and the food world,&rdquo; Sontag wrote in the caption. &ldquo;They made food into this hyper-masculine, deeply gendered sport that I didn&rsquo;t think I could participate in as a gay kid. The underlying implication was that people like this hated my existence, that they didn&rsquo;t see gay people as equal, or even worth acknowledging. That I would never be welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how much they &lsquo;show up&rsquo; for queer rights now, I know they don&rsquo;t respect me or any other queer people as their equal,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to be reminded that I was right, and that this shameful behavior is always there, right below the surface. Resign @alex_delany. Today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delany was among the many Bon Appétit staffers who spoke out against Rapoport on Monday after Teclemariam shared the photo of him in brownface on Twitter.</p>
<p>The Instagram photo was first posted by Rapoport&rsquo;s wife Simone Shubuck on Halloween 2013.</p>
<p>&ldquo;#TBT me and my papi,&rdquo; Shubuck wrote in the caption, tagging Rapoport&rsquo;s Instagram account. She added the hashtag #boricua, which is a term that Puerto Ricans often use to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Delany wrote on an Instagram story that he was &ldquo;disgusted by the photo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stand with and thank the BIPOC staffers at @bonappetitmag who have been working in a system that has made it harder for them to succeed than it has for me to succeed. I have absolutely benefitted from the system,&rdquo; Delany added.</p>
<p>And Rapoport&rsquo;s photo wasn&rsquo;t the only controversy to hit Bon Appétit on Monday.</p>
<p>Sohla El-Waylly, an assistant food editor at Bon Appétit, alleged that the company only paid white editors for video appearances on the publication&rsquo;s hit YouTube channel.</p>
<p>El-Waylly, who is a chef and restaurateur, revealed that she had been hired at Bon Appétit in 2019 as an assistant editor at a $50,000 salary to &ldquo;assist mostly white editors with significantly less experience than me.&rdquo; El-Waylly said that she had also been pushed to appear in Bon Appétit&rsquo;s popular Test Kitchen videos, but was not paid for them.</p>
<p>A Condé Nast representative told Variety that it was &ldquo;untrue that Bon Appétit&rsquo;s white editors are paid for appearing in videos while people of color are not.&rdquo; A spokesperson told Insider that the company is &ldquo;dedicated to creating a diverse, inclusive and equitable workplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The internet has rallied around El-Waylly, and Delany vowed on Monday that he would no longer appear in any Bon Appétit videos until &ldquo;my BIPOC colleagues receive equal pay and are fairly compensated for their appearances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by change, I do not mean promises,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I mean signed contracts and cash in checking accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout last week, Delany also frequently posted in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and the protests that have been taking place across the US in honor of George Floyd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not just post a black square,&rdquo; he wrote in one post. &ldquo;Show your solidarity by doing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read and become more educated about the systems that oppress Black people in our country. Volunteer to help rebuild your community. Show up to protest, if you are able. Do something. Social media solidarity is not enough. You are not part of a movement if you are standing still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Delany and representatives for Condé Nast did not immediately respond to Insider&rsquo;s requests for comment.

<p>New Delhi, June 10 (IANSlife) With inter-state borders open and quarantine regulations relaxed, a road trip could be on cards. As exploring a destination might not be worth the risk, it&rsquo;s best to check in and enjoy the luxuries a property has to offer.If food is your priority focus your trip around sustainability and environment with Sustainable Gastronomy Day (18th June) right around the corner. These boutique properties from the RARE India collection have adopted sustainability practices in food, preserving the food culture of the region and reviving lost food varieties.Glenburn Tea EstateGlenburn Tea Estate (Darjeeling), has a long legacy of working with the local community, and celebrating their local culture and traditions. They grow as much as they can within the estate and have their own vegetable and herb garden. An abundance of fruit trees and local vegetables are grown within the villages. Feed on Mulberry jam, orange and pomelo marmalade as well as other fruit preserves. The menus comprise of interesting local fare and traditional Indian dishes, to exotic South-East Asian delicacies, making full use of the fresh herbs, and salad leaves they grow in their well-stocked kitchen garden.Tiger Mountain Pokhara LodgeAt Tiger Mountain Pokhara Lodge (Pokhara, Nepal), only local ingredients are used and they make their own spice mixes. Favourites include powerful, flavour chilli and Himalayan pink salt mixes that are served in most Tharu homes - salt, red chilli, seared garlic and ginger are ground together. Timur (Zanthoxylum armatum), Sesame and other spices can also be added to add different nuances of flavour to the dishes. They prefer to source as much as possible as locally as possible - from their own gardens (mainly herbs and salads), from the village: fresh meat, vegetables, buckwheat and millet flour, bran (for baking), foraged items; from Pokhara - favouring local farmers in the vegetable market. Similarly the tea and coffee is all from Nepal, organic and mainly from Guranse Tea Garden in eastern Nepal, Dhankuta district.The Lodge at WahThe chefs at Lodge at Wah (Palampur) are well-versed with creating meals using only locally sourced ingredients, which further feeds into minimization of plastic use. The meals highlight the local dishes, and over time have become guest favourites. Ingredients are produced mostly in their own garden and backyard kitchen garden, which is organic (they are currently growing thyme, rosemary, oregano, cilantro, chillies, lal saag, raddhish, carrots, peas and so much more depending on the season) as well as from the local community where they need additional produce.Jehan Numa RetreatGreen House Bistro has been the newest addition of a cafe to Jehan Numa Retreat (Satpura). It is focused on the concept of &ldquo;farm to fork/Table&rdquo;, and the philosophy of slow food movement. At the Jehan Numa Retreat, they have a substantial amount of land to grow many number of vegetables, fruits and herbs to be used in their menus. The Bistro is built next to a farm, in which they grow cabbage, cauliflower, beetroot, carrots, Tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, Eggplant, Broccoli, kale. Fruits like Banana, Papaya, Pomegranate etc. Also, herbs like sage, thyme, rosemary, kaffir lime, bayleaf etc. Almost 70 percent of their produce comes from the land at the property. They do not use any kind of chemicals or pesticides instead of that they prefer using &lsquo;gobar khad&rsquo; or cow dung compost to keep the soil fertile.Svasara Jungle LodgeThe sustainability practices in food at Svasara Jungle Lodge (Tadoba) include an emphasis on zero-waste. The idea is to cook as per fresh/daily requirements, and avoid storage/potential wastage. The property also adopts grandmothers&rsquo; wisdom around using as many parts of ingredients as possible, e.g. with lemon, the lemon juice is extracted, but the peel is also used for pickles and relishes. Their food waste was further reduced when they adopted the concept of pre-planned weekly menus, which is designed keeping in mind seasonal availability of raw produce. Other practices include growing their own organic herbs, seasonal veggies, and otherwise sourcing the fresh produce from neighbouring farms.Suryagarh, JaisalmerAt Suryagarh (Jaisalmer), over the years they have worked towards backward integration of their food supply chains. They have invested in over 500 acres of their own farmlands, that supplies them with major grains, pulses. 100 percent of this produce is on rain-fed and river-fed agriculture with no pesticides, insecticides or inorganic fertilisers. They have decomposition pits, culture and prepare their own fertilisers and natural pesticides and procure heirloom seeds from local communities. They also do some dairy as well with over 60 Tharparkar cows (native species from Jaisalmer, known for A2 milk. They are free range, and feed on many types of local grasses that they grow). They have created organic gardens at the hotels for fresh seasonal vegetables and herbs.(IANSlife Features can be contacted at <a href="mailto:ianslife@ians.in">ianslife@ians.in</a>)&ndash;IANSIanslife/tb/

<p><img src="https://www.businessinsider.in/photo/76294694/dc-guard-members-test-positive-for-covid-after-protests.jpg" alt="img">
Washington, Jun 10 (AP) Members of the D.C. National Guard have tested positive for COVID-19 in the wake of the mass protests across the nation&rsquo;s capital last week, according to Lt. Col. Brooke Davis, Guard spokeswoman.</p>
<p>She said the Guard will not release the exact total, but U.S. officials said they believe it is not a large number, at least so far.</p>
<p>The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information publicly. The positive tests were first reported by McClatchy.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>While some Guard troops responding to the protests wore protective equipment, most were not wearing masks and it was largely impossible to maintain any social distancing.In a statement, Davis said unit commanders were responsible for ensuring their troops adhered to guidelines calling for Guard members to wear protective equipment and maintain social distancing where practical.</p>
<p>She said personnel were medically screened for the coronavirus prior to their arrival, and will be screened before they leave.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>According to officials, about 5,000 Guard members were in D.C. for the civil unrest, including as many as 1,200 from the D.C. Guard. The remainder came from 11 states: Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah.</p>
<p>According to officials, Guard members returning to their home states may remain on duty status and continue to be paid for two additional weeks so that they can be in quarantine if they were at risk for coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The federal Bureau of Prisons, which dispatched dozens of officers from its riot teams to the streets of Washington, is now offering coronavirus tests for those officers in Washington, an agency spokesman said Tuesday. The agency has also been making arrangements for officers to be tested when they return to the community where they regularly work, if they don&rsquo;t want to be tested in Washington, the spokesman, Justin Long, said. The agency can&rsquo;t compel its employees to be tested. A spokeswoman for the FBI - which has had agents questioning people arrested at protests across the U.S. and also deployed its elite Hostage Rescue Team in Washington - would not answer questions about whether the agents would be tested or whether they were instructed to wear masks while working in the field.The agency would only say it was working with other officials to &ldquo;continue to ensure measures are in place to protect the FBI workforce,&rdquo; but did not provide any specific information.

Comparer une chaîne YouTube à l'équivalent de l&rsquo;univers cinématographique de Marvel peut paraître un peu osé. Pourtant, après des dizaines d&rsquo;heures de confinement passées devant des vidéos, puis à voguer de comptes Instagram en comptes Twitter en blogs Tumblr, on comprend l&rsquo;idée derrière la comparaison de BuzzFeed entre Bon Appétit et l'œuvre de Stan Lee.</p>
<p>Bon Appétit, c&rsquo;est la chaîne YouTube du magazine du même nom qui a transformé ses chef·fes en micro-célébrités, à qui «des gamins de 22 ans en Doc Martens demandent des autographes et des selfies, comme s&rsquo;ils étaient à un festival de musique», décrit le site américain.</p>
<p>Chaque vidéo attire généralement entre un et quatre millions de personnes. Une énorme audience pour le magazine, qui a profité de ce coup de projecteur pour engranger la plus grosse croissance de son histoire (et vendre des t-shirts à 30 dollars [27,6 euros] et un tablier à 150 dollars [138 euros]).</p>
<p>Le concept de vidéos de chef·fes cuisinant devant les caméras n&rsquo;a rien de nouveau, mais cette chaîne lancée en 2016 va dans la direction opposée de bon nombre de vidéos virales ayant trait à la nourriture.</p>
<p>«Elle défie tous les conseils habituels en matière de contenu vidéo, résume The Mary Sue. Les vidéos sont longues, absurdes et parfois les animateurs se trompent dans les recettes. Mais elles sont aussi charmantes, et on ne peut pas s&rsquo;empêcher de regarder.»</p>
<p>On peut y voir, tour à tour, les cuisinièr·es Claire Saffitz, Brad Leone, Carla Lalli Music, Chris Morocco, Molly Baz, Alex Delany, Sohla El-Waylly, Andy Baraghani, Priya Krishna, Gaby Melian, Christina Chaey, Rick Martinez et Amiel Stanek s&rsquo;y relayer pour réaliser des recettes inventées pour le magazine, créer des friandises version gastronomique, faire fermenter différentes choses, cuisiner dos à dos avec des stars ou tenter de reproduire des plats sans avoir le droit de les regarder.</p>
<p>S&rsquo;il est si compliqué de ne pas passer quarante minutes à observer une cheffe pâtissière s&rsquo;arracher les cheveux pendant quatre jours en essayant de confectionner une version gastronomique des Twix, c&rsquo;est parce que ces vidéos «doivent leur charme infini aux personnes et à leurs dynamiques interpersonnelles», suggère la radio WBUR.</p>
<p>Bon Appétit Extended Universe</p>
<p>Une dizaine de chef·fes se relaient pour animer les vidéos (et parfois leurs mini-séries) filmées dans leur test kitchen mais on voit régulièrement passer leurs collègues devant la caméra.</p>
<p>Ces rencontres au sein même des vidéos ont fait naître ce qui est désormais présenté comme leur propre univers cinématographique. Comme dans les films Marvel où Iron Man apparaît dans un film consacré à Spider Man, il n&rsquo;est pas rare de voir Brad Leone débarquer dans une vidéo de Claire Saffitz pour lui donner des conseils ou Sohla El-Waylly venir sauver la situation en gérant le délicat tempérage du chocolat.</p>

<p>«Ce qui rend ce passage à la vidéo amusant pour nous, et je pense que c&rsquo;est pareil pour notre public, c&rsquo;est que nous l&rsquo;avons fait d&rsquo;une manière qui semble normale pour nous et normale dans notre façon de travailler, explique Chris Morocco à Parade. Nous ne parlons pas seulement à une caméra dans un studio. Nous interagissons les uns avec les autres, avec les cameramen, on se défie sur des montées de blancs en neige. Nous ne sortons pas du script parce qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y a pas de script.»</p>
<p>Si la comparaison avec Marvel se tient, d&rsquo;autres médias comme Decider y voient une émission de télé-réalité «conçue à merveille pour nos vies actuelles». Au-delà de leur genre, si toutes ces œuvres ont trouvé leur public, c&rsquo;est parce qu&rsquo;elles ont de bons personnages.</p>
<p>Dans la test kitchen de Bon Appétit, si personne ne semble jouer un rôle, chaque personnage en a un, comme le résume parfaitement Decider: Chris Morocco est la figure paternelle de la cuisine et Carla Lalli Music la figure maternelle. Molly Baz est «la fille vraiment sympa de votre équipe de football du lycée qui a réussi à être amie avec tout le monde», Brad Leone «le mec décontracté et débraillé qui devrait être le roi de la cuisine» et Claire Saffitz «la pâtissière dont les nerfs fatigués scintillent comme des diamants quand elle est sous pression».</p>
<p>«The Office» dans la cuisine</p>
<p>Quand on lui demande de décrire ça à quelqu&rsquo;un qui n&rsquo;aurait jamais vu un épisode, Chris Morocco lance: «The Office dans une cuisine où tous les gens peuvent parler à la caméra quand ils le veulent.» Comme l'écrit BuzzFeed, «Cette description n&rsquo;est jamais aussi parfaite que lorsque vous jetez un coup d'œil aux innombrables blagues et gags qui sont devenus l&rsquo;essence du fandom de Bon Appétit. Les vidéos Bon Appétit n&rsquo;existent pas seulement sur YouTube. Elles sont une source infinie de mèmes, de merchandising, d&rsquo;autres chaînes YouTube dédiées au test de leurs recettes à la compilation des moments les plus drôles et, bien sûr, des comptes de fans.»</p>
<p>On trouve ainsi des comptes à plus de 100.000 abonné·es sur Twitter, et à plus de 300.000 sur Instagram. Sur Tumblr, on rencense des dizaines de blogs et posts avec des dizaines de milliers de reblogs et likes. Il existe même un podcast dont l&rsquo;un des principes est de faire un récap des vidéos publiées.</p>
<p>«Les spectateurs ont l&rsquo;impression de connaître les détails de la vie des chefs, indique l&rsquo;une de ses animatrices au Daily Beast. Cela donne un fandom où les blagues se multiplient, s&rsquo;auto-référencent, et s&rsquo;insèrent dans une culture mème plus large. Même si c&rsquo;est une niche, et toujours un petit fandom, il est en pleine croissance.»</p>
<p>Fandom</p>
<p>Qu&rsquo;un fandom se construise sur un sujet aussi restreint est loin d'être une anomalie. Avec l&rsquo;explosion de l&rsquo;usage d&rsquo;internet et des réseaux sociaux, il n&rsquo;a jamais été aussi facile de trouver quelqu&rsquo;un avec les mêmes centres d&rsquo;intérêt. Comme l&rsquo;analyse d&rsquo;ailleurs le Daily Beast, le fait que ce soit si spécifique (et la probabilité qu&rsquo;un tel fandom ait pu voir le jour) «fait partie de la blague». Tout comme le côté surjoué de l&rsquo;amour porté par certain·es fans.</p>

<p>Si ce genre de fandoms se multiplient, c&rsquo;est aussi parce qu&rsquo;ils permettent de se rendre compte que l&rsquo;on n&rsquo;est pas seul·e à aimer regarder une cheffe américaine essayer d&rsquo;expliquer à une star de cinéma ce qu&rsquo;elle doit cuisiner, et que l&rsquo;on appartient à une communauté qui se définit par des codes particuliers.</p>

<p>Cela induit par ailleurs un sentiment d&rsquo;appartenance à un club restreint. À propos du succès des comptes «no context», le webzine Vulture décrypte ainsi: «Ce mème est un objet trouvé dans un océan pop-culturel, une preuve du goût du collectionneur, et d&rsquo;une audience suffisamment calée pour l&rsquo;apprécier.» Reste que, comme le rappelle l&rsquo;animatrice du podcast Pod Appétit, «les prérequis pour intégrer le club sont assez peu nombreux».</p>
<p>Après avoir regardé quelques vidéos, vous comprendrez assez vite pourquoi cette photo d&rsquo;un homme tenant une feuille où il est écrit «Sauvez Claire» compte 2.700 retweets et pourquoi ce post très enthousiaste à propos d&rsquo;un chien accumule plus de 25.000 likes.</p>

<p>Coachella’s queen and king Vanessa Hudgens and Austin Butler have reportedly broken up, according to Us Weekly. After being together for nearly nine years and becoming Tumblr gods with their Coachella outfits, they’ve called it quits. “Vanessa and Austin are officially broken up, and Vanessa has been telling those close to her about their breakup,” a source told Us Weekly. The Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor hasn’t been seen on Hudgens’s Instagram since October. He was recently cast as Elvis Presley in an upcoming biopic directed by Baz Luhrmann. Meanwhile, Hudgens is spreading joy in Netflix Christmas movies The Princess Switch, which has a sequel coming out later this year, and The Knight Before Christmas. Neither Butler nor Hudgens have confirmed their breakup, though they’ll have to by April, when Coachella comes back around. The couple has attended five Coachellas together (by our count) in the past eight years, including 2019’s. Will they both show up this year? Will they split custody across the two weekends? What other couple will local Twitter obsess over and call #goals? It just won’t be the same.

My Dark Vanessa will be published by William Morrow on March 10. Read an excerpt. Photo: Dina Litovsky</p>
<p>Kate Elizabeth Russell traces the beginning of her obsession with Lolita to an encounter with the musician Jakob Dylan. It was 1997, and the novelist was 13 years old, precocious and bored, living on an isolated lake some 15 miles east of Bangor, Maine. Dylan, then in his late 20s, was coming to town with his band, the Wallflowers, and he wanted to meet Stephen King, the local royalty. Russell’s father happened to be a DJ for King’s radio station, and he arranged a dinner. Russell and her cousin got to tag along. She remembers trembling through the meal, struggling to contain her excitement as she watched the charismatic front man tear apart a bread roll with his hands. Later, she read everything she could find about him. In a Rolling Stone profile, he declared his favorite book was Lolita. She couldn’t check the book out from her local library — every copy had been lost or stolen — but she discovered the text on a rudimentary website and felt a thrill when she realized it was about a sexual relationship between a girl around her own age and a much older man. “I didn’t know that was an option,” she recalled thinking at the time.</p>
<p>One of the strangest aspects of the cultural legacy of Lolita, the story of a man in his late 30s who kidnaps and repeatedly rapes a 12-year-old girl, is the fact that so many people through the decades have read it as a love story. Russell was not an exception. The paperback edition she eventually bought was splashed with a quote from Vanity Fair calling the novel “the only convincing love story of our century.” She would sometimes point to that quote when she got into arguments with friends who dismissed the book as highbrow pornography for pedophiles. Around a year after she read it, she began to work on her own novel about the relationship between a young girl and a much older man. Hers was a love story too, she told me over lunch in Manhattan a few weeks ago. At least, that’s how she saw it back then and for many years after.</p>
<p>The book, My Dark Vanessa, which will be published next month, some 20 years after Russell began writing it, has been the toast of the publishing world since late 2018, when William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins, bought it for seven figures — making it one of the most expensive debut novels of that year. Provocative and absorbing, it has been hailed as “Lolita for the #MeToo era” (Entertainment Weekly), and it shares with Vladimir Nabokov’s tale a disturbing allure. In the opening chapter, set in 2017 amid the rising tide of public revelations about sexual harassment and abuse, the narrator, Vanessa, sees on Facebook that another woman has accused her high-school English teacher, Jacob Strane, of sexual assault. Years earlier, when Vanessa was just 15 and he was 42, she and Strane began a sexual relationship. But Vanessa doesn’t join the chorus of voices demanding his firing. Instead, stoned and lying in bed that night, she calls the teacher and asks him to recount one of their sexual encounters while she masturbates. Like Russell when she first read Lolita, Vanessa allows herself to imagine that this kind of relationship could be love.</p>
<p>I wonder how much victimhood they’d be willing to grant a girl like me.</p>
<p>Over the years, through endless drafts and iterations, Russell mined many details of the story from her life. Like Russell, Vanessa grew up on an isolated lake in Maine; like Russell, Vanessa attended a private high school for two years before withdrawing. Maybe you’re wondering now if the other thing is true too: Did Russell, like Vanessa, have an affair with her high-school teacher? In an author’s note, Russell urges readers against jumping to the conclusion that the novel relates her “secret history.” She knew that some people, like her old M.F.A.-workshop classmates, would assume the book was a work of autofiction — a titillating notion heightened by the editor’s note prefacing review copies, which states that Russell’s story had been “inspired by her own teenage experiences with older men.”</p>
<p>But she didn’t anticipate the trap she would fall into by refusing to be explicit about her personal life. In the weeks leading up to the book’s debut, she would go from seeing her name on almost every list of the most eagerly awaited books of 2020 to finding herself at the center of a scandal, one of several that have shaken the publishing world less than two months into the new year. It unfolded on Twitter, where Russell was accused of stealing her story from another woman’s memoir; some went so far as to demand that she prove she had been abused herself.</p>
<p>Russell denied the accusations of plagiarism but insisted on maintaining the boundary she had drawn around her own experiences. She deleted her Twitter account and waited out the storm at her home in Madison, Wisconsin, doing puzzles with her husband in order to avoid looking at her phone. When I reached her there, she pointed out the eerie similarities between the controversy and her novel. The book (which shifts between the years 2000 and 2017) derives much of its dramatic tension from the adult Vanessa’s unwillingness to open up about what happened to her as a teenager. Russell kept thinking about one section in particular, in which a journalist urges Vanessa to go public with her affair, threatening to publish the story whether or not she agrees to an interview. Vanessa refuses. She remembers a photograph of herself at 17, “looking like a Lolita” as she lifted her skirt and stared directly at the camera. She thinks, I wonder how much victimhood they’d be willing to grant a girl like me.</p>
<p>When I first met Russell, in the middle of January, she had yet to be accused of anything. We were in the backyard of a Georgian restaurant in Greenwich Village, sheltered by a glass canopy from the pounding rain and surrounded by tropical greenery, fake boulders, and out-of-date Christmas decorations. “To go to New York and to have an editor who has an office in a big building is all pretty much purely fantasy,” she said, as she fidgeted with the oversize buttons on her fuzzy pink cardigan, her dark, wavy hair partly obscuring one eye. “I keep reminding myself that it’s literally a dream come true.” Neither of Russell’s parents attended college, and she was broke for most of her 20s and early 30s as she worked on drafts of the novel in college, in M.F.A. workshops, and in a Ph.D. program. She had never been to New York until her publisher invited her here. Now, at 35, sipping an electric-green tarragon soda that looked to her like something Willy Wonka might have concocted, Russell was overwhelmed, she said, and a little nervous. Saddled with the responsibilities that come with the launch of a highly publicized title, she was feeling nostalgic for the anonymity of those years. The pleasure of losing herself in her work had always been a crucial part of her writing process. “I start with an idea, a feeling, and lean into it as hard as I can to the point where I disappear,” she said. “Then it really becomes fiction.”</p>
<p>The idea that shaped My Dark Vanessa had saturated Russell’s adolescence. Long before she encountered Lolita, Russell had been steeped in narratives that glamorized relationships between powerful men and much younger women. Looking back on that era, she recalled the Rolling Stone cover with “teen dream” Britney Spears in her childhood bedroom, a Teletubby snuggled under her arm, her cardigan parted to reveal a silky black bra. On TV, politicians were castigating the president for lying about an affair with a 22-year-old intern, but no one seemed to think of him as an abuser — not even the intern, who maintained for years afterward that she’d been in love and who has only recently said she’s “beginning to entertain the notion that in such a circumstance the idea of consent might well be rendered moot.” Watching it all play out, Russell was riveted. “If you swept away the politics,” she said, “what was left was what I perceived then to be an intense, romantic affair.” One of her favorite stories was The Phantom of the Opera, in which a decrepit old man kidnaps a young woman (her age has ranged between 15 and 20, depending on the version) and drags her to his lair beneath the Palais Garnier. Russell found it thrilling. In seventh grade, after her teacher assigned the students to write a three-page story, she turned in 80 pages of Phantom fanfiction — one of her earliest literary efforts.</p>
<p>As she sees it now, her interest in these relationships was inextricable from her dream of leaving small-town Maine and becoming an artist. “I saw older men as a way to access art and culture and books — things I didn’t necessarily feel like I had access to otherwise,” she said. When I asked if she’d say more about these men, Russell looked away and shook her head. Measured and serious, she’d occasionally allow the conversation to lapse into long silences before answering my questions, her heavy-lidded eyes and high-arched eyebrows granting her an air of inscrutability. She didn’t want to go into details, she said, though she didn’t mind recalling the intoxicating emotions that accompanied those relationships. “I remember feeling really powerful and treasured and put on a pedestal,” she said. “Like someone is risking so much just to talk to me. That was a lot of what made me start writing. That’s what I wanted to put on the page.”</p>
<p>When Russell arrived at the University of Maine at Farmington for college, she had already written some 200 pages of a draft of what would become My Dark Vanessa. At that stage, Russell still thought of it as a love story. Patricia O’Donnell, her creative-writing professor, recalled the aspiring author as remarkably talented, focused, and guarded. “She would leave her peacoat on and buttoned up all the way in class, and she would put her hands in her pockets, and her hair was hiding her face,” she said. “But she was open with me as her professor that she’d had an experience in high school that was very traumatic. She wouldn’t have used that word, but she had been through this fire of an experience, and now she had an ambition. Other students didn’t seem to have that same drive.”</p>
<p>One of her friends in the program, Katie O’Donnell (no relation to the professor), remembered Russell flirting with older men at local bars. “It was always like the college guys were too immature for her,” she said. “She was always chasing something else.” O’Donnell would read Russell’s accounts of these evenings on LiveJournal the next day and marvel at how she had turned them into something like literature. “I’d be writing an entry,” she said, “and just be like spewing out whatever, and see that Kate has created this beautiful scene.” Russell drafted early passages of the novel on the platform, and her friends watched the book develop over countless posts. The author was already gaining a following; at a Spring Fling event where a group of students wrote the names of famous writers on their T-shirts, the name on O’Donnell’s shirt was KATE RUSSELL.</p>
<p>Russell went straight from college into the M.F.A. program at Indiana University. It was a frustrating time. She couldn’t answer the two basic questions every student of fiction was asked: Why tell this story, and why tell it now? She was still trying to frame the narrative as a romance, which people in her workshops always found bewildering. “Why would someone do this?,” she remembered a classmate wondering about Vanessa. “She must be a slut.” People found the protagonist unlikable, even repulsive, and some urged Russell to abandon the project. (Later, in her Ph.D. program, one professor wrote her a note that simply said, “Stop turning this in.”) After some of her workshops, she’d feel so discouraged that she would put the manuscript away and not pick it up again for months. But she could never shake Vanessa. A friend from her M.F.A. program recalled Russell talking about the character as though she were a real person. “I have memories of Vanessa back then the way I have memories of an old lost acquaintance,” the friend recounted. “Someone who comes to mind occasionally, and you feel a tinge of worry — How is she doing?, I wonder. I hope she’s okay.”</p>
<p>After receiving her M.F.A, Russell moved to Portland, Maine, where she worked odd jobs — at the front desk of a hotel, as an assistant to two politicians — and fell into a bad relationship with a man her age. This gloomy stretch of her adulthood furnished much of the inspiration for the sections of My Dark Vanessa that are set in the present. Adrift and stuck in her life and work, she began reading posts on Tumblr about critical trauma theory, which led her to a series of memoirs about traumatic sexual relationships, among them Kathryn Harrison’s The Kiss and Tiger, Tiger, by Margaux Fragoso. It was during this period, as she was delving into accounts of “actual, unequivocal pedophilia,” that it dawned on her: The relationship between Vanessa and Strane could not be a love story. It was abuse, even if her character didn’t want to call it that. When I asked if this epiphany had changed how she viewed her own experiences with older men, she shrugged. “It was a lot harder for Vanessa to deal with this than it was for me. I was just like, Now I finally know how to write this.”</p>
<p>By the time the Me Too movement began, the book was nearly finished. The parts that describe a woman calling out an abuser on social media were already in place. Russell was writing ten hours a day, trying to finish the manuscript in time to present it as her dissertation, and in her brief breaks from work, she would scroll through Twitter. “Holy shit,” she remembered thinking, “this is what I’m writing.” Now she could answer the questions that had stumped her as an M.F.A. student: Why this story, and why now? “Me Too seemed like it came out of nowhere, but I had been paying attention,” she said. “That’s how I ended up at this point where I was writing this plotline and choosing to believe I had something worthwhile to say, even if I was an unknown writer working on this endless book.”</p>
<p>Russell began querying agents in spring 2018. She was rejected more than 60 times before her manuscript landed in the hands of Hillary Jacobson, an agent who had been developing a track record of securing stunning advances. Jacobson could see the book had “that extremely rare and sought-after combination of literary writing with a commercial plot.” She added, “Never in my entire life, with any book or manuscript, had I felt that transported and transformed by a reading experience.” Jessica Williams, the editor who bought it, had a similar reaction. “I have read countless manuscripts exploring Me Too,” she said, “but none of them have affected me like Kate’s.” By the end of the year, Russell had joined an elite group. Each season, the Big Five houses throw the full weight of their buying and marketing power behind a few chosen titles, sending the authors on book tours around the world, featuring them in “buzz panels” at conventions, and fêting them at industry bashes. This swell of attention is what made Russell the subject of a furious Twitter controversy weeks before the novel’s publication.</p>
<p>On January 19, a writer named Wendy C. Ortiz tweeted, “[C]an’t wait until February when a white woman’s book of fiction that sounds very much like Excavation is lauded.” Ortiz is the author of a 2014 memoir, Excavation, about her five-year relationship with her eighth-grade English teacher and the long shadow it cast over her life. Although she hadn’t read My Dark Vanessa, she could see from the marketing materials surrounding its launch that the story had certain thematic similarities to her book. That Ortiz, who is Latinx, refrained from naming the author or the book in her tweet, and never directly accused Russell of plagiarism, didn’t seem to matter. Russell was assailed for copying Ortiz’s work and profiting from a woman of color’s suffering. Several prominent authors stepped into the fray. “I’m sorry that this other book is co-opting your story without acknowledgment,” Roxane Gay wrote in a tweet to Ortiz. “It’s wrong.”</p>
<p>Russell was appalled by the suggestion of plagiarism — she called the accusation “categorically untrue” — but she had read Ortiz’s memoir. In a list of “influences and interests” she’d posted months earlier, she cited it as one of nearly a hundred works (films, essays, books) she had consulted in her research. Wounded, she tweeted that she’d begun working on her book many years ago. “These stories of abuse often have v similar elements,” she pointed out. Then she deleted her Twitter account.</p>
<p>I read Excavation, and Russell didn’t plagiarize it. Beyond the central premise of a woman reevaluating her teenage relationship with a teacher, the two works don’t have much in common. But Ortiz’s tweet was like a match dropped onto a haystack soaked in gasoline. Many people in the book world, including Ortiz, had recently been rallying against American Dirt, a novel about Mexican migrants written by a white woman who, like Russell, had received a seven-figure deal. The author, Jeanine Cummins, had been accused of ripping off the work of her Latinx colleagues and perpetuating racist stereotypes, and writers of color across the country were outraged by what they saw as yet another example of the publishing industry’s long tradition of prizing white authors and disregarding others. In the chaotic way of Twitter discourse, the two stories were quickly conflated — never mind the fact that few commenters had read both My Dark Vanessa and Excavation, or that none could have known whether Russell had based her work on her own life. (Gay later reviewed My Dark Vanessa for Goodreads; she described it as “well written” and called the online conversation “aggravating.”)</p>
<p>The controversy has been good for book sales: Excavation sold out on Amazon. But Ortiz told me she was disturbed by the way it unfolded. “People are taking it as me against Kate,” she said. “But it’s bigger than that.” Every mainstream publisher who’d received her manuscript for Excavation passed on the submission before it found a home with an indie press. This fact, combined with the industry’s embrace of My Dark Vanessa, struck her as evidence of systemic racism. “It is easier for white authors to get in the door because the publishing industry is overwhelmingly white,” she said.</p>
<p>Ortiz is unquestionably right about the implicit bias at work in the publishing industry. But several agents I spoke with pointed out that there are other reasons My Dark Vanessa may have appealed to publishers who turned down Excavation. For one, Russell’s book arrived during the Me Too moment. For another, the two books offer vastly different reading experiences. Excavation is powerful, but it is not suspenseful; its structure is experimental and loose. My Dark Vanessa, meanwhile, possesses that essential feature of nearly all successful commercial fiction — it is compulsively readable, threaded with enough tension to keep a reader entranced until the end. In an essay for Gay’s online magazine, Ortiz noted she had no interest in reading a “fictionalized, sensationalized” version of an experience she had lived. Few editors in New York’s publishing world would likely share those qualms. One agent told me she’d always found it difficult to sell stories about sexual abuse. “Editors are just as squeamish as potential readers, if not more so,” she said. “There are some who will immediately take the book out of the running because they personally are not wishing to deal with that subject.” It helps if the work is fiction, she added. “There’s an extra layer of safety. It’s very hard to engage with someone else’s anguish.” Russell, too, said she required the shield that fiction provided: “I needed that distance to be in control as a writer.”</p>
<p>When these controversies play out on Twitter, they tend to reward clear-cut narratives. Some might have embraced Russell if she’d come out and said, “Yes, I was abused,” but the author had long ago made up her mind never to go there in the promotion of her book. “If I were to say something in this current environment, would it help, or would it make the situation worse?,” she asked over the phone from her home in Madison. “What would I gain as a human being? It’s not anything I need, and I don’t think it’s anything the reader needs.” Even if her book were an account of abuse, she bristled at the idea of summing up her own experiences that way for the public. “If I start categorizing a relationship, if I say, ‘That was abusive,’ that swallows up everything,” she said. “I just don’t want to relinquish everything.”</p>
<p>A few years ago, Russell reread Lolita. This time, she noticed something she’d missed as a teenager: Even as Nabokov puts ecstatic declarations of love in the mouth of his protagonist, he occasionally reveals through the smallest details what he really thinks about his characters, which is that Humbert Humbert is a monster and Lolita a suffering child. Over lunch, Russell brought up the infamous scene in which Humbert first has sex with Lolita and declares it was “she who seduced me.” Afterward, Humbert fantasizes about painting a lavish mural to depict what happened in the hotel room: “There would have been a lake. There would have been an arbor in flame-flower. There would have been nature studies — a tiger pursuing a bird of paradise, a choking snake sheathing whole the flayed trunk of a shoat … There would have been poplars, apples, a suburban Sunday. There would have been a fire opal dissolving within a ripple-ringed pool, a last throb, a last dab of color, stinging red, smarting pink, a sigh, a wincing child.”</p>
<p>“You read the passage,” Russell said, “and it’s just gorgeous prose, gorgeous prose, gorgeous prose, and then the last image is of a wincing child. It’s so easy to skim over. You just see it as beautiful imagery. Who knows if Nabokov was trying to make some social commentary about how we all are complicit and we all ignore this, but certainly that’s the way I read it.”</p>
<p>Nabokov was famously reticent about his authorial intentions — “I do not give a damn for public morals,” he once said — but there were many interviews in which he made his position clear. When a writer for The Paris Review said he found Humbert to be “touching,” Nabokov corrected him: “Humbert Humbert is a vain and cruel wretch who manages to appear ‘touching.’ ” Véra Nabokov, the author’s wife, went further. Lolita “cries every night,” she told an interviewer. “The critics are deaf to her sobs.” Still, we never learn how the child, Dolores Haze, viewed what happened to her. In the end, only Humbert’s perspective is captured on the page.</p>
<p>My Dark Vanessa can be read as a mirror image of Lolita. Both Vanessa and Humbert are unreliable narrators; both use the language of love to mask the trauma lurking beneath the surface of their stories. It’s obvious why Humbert would prefer to describe his rape of Lolita as romantic. Russell considers why Vanessa would entertain the same fantasy. Early in his seduction, Strane gives Vanessa a copy of Lolita. As Russell once did, she buys into the lie that it was Lolita who seduced Humbert. She sees it as the unfurling of a previously unthinkable possibility. “I have power,” Vanessa thinks. “Power to make it happen. Power over him. I was an idiot for not realizing this sooner.” The power she feels is an illusion — a product of the same culture that cast Nabokov’s wincing child in the role of a sexy temptress. “A lot of the messiness in Vanessa’s psyche comes from a culture that celebrates abuse as something from which great art can be made,” Russell said.</p>
<p>Even now, it can be jarring for Russell to revisit My Dark Vanessa and remember that she hasn’t written a love story but a narrative of trauma. Twenty years after she started writing the book, the insidious fantasy still lingers. “When did it go away?,” she wondered. “Oh God. It’s a process.”</p>
