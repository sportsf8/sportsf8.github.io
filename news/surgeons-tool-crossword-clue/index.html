<h3 id="guardian-cryptic-crossword-setter-sends-twitter-into-a-tizz-with-b-to-brexit-hidden-message">&ldquo;Guardian cryptic crossword setter sends Twitter into a tizz with &lsquo;B******* to Brexit&rsquo; hidden message&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/12/17/18403968-0-image-a-2_1568306076657.jpg" alt="img">
A hidden Brexit-related message was found hidden in The Guardian&rsquo;s cryptic crossword today.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed readers spotted &lsquo;B******* to Brexit&rsquo; at the top and bottom lines of the cryptic crossword set by Philistine.</p>
<p>The puzzle is number 27,924 set by Philistine and was called &lsquo;genius&rsquo; by Twitter users.</p>
<p>NHS heart surgeon Samer Nashef, known as Philistine, developed a talent for crosswords while studying at medical school.</p>
<p>The cryptic crossword which was set by Philistine left Twitter users in a tizz over the Brexit-related message (top line and bottom line)</p>
<p>NHS heart surgeon Samer Nashef, known as Philistine, developed a talent for crosswords while studying at medical school</p>
<p>Mr Nashef has worked at Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Associate Editor of The Daily Mirror Kevin Maguire tweeted the picture of the finished crossword and said:&lsquo;B******* TO BREXIT&rsquo; message in the top and bottom lines of today’s Guardian cryptic crossword is genius by setter Philistine.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;My brainy comrade completed it but I’ve left squares blank to avoid ruining the fun completely for other geeks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Twitter users were quick to comment on the hidden message and called the crossword &lsquo;genius&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The campaign slogan was coined following the result of the 2016 referendum.</p>
<p>One users said: &lsquo;Brilliant! Am not willing to forgive Philistine for all headbanging past crosswords.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Who is crossword setter Samer Nashef? Samer Nashef works at the Papworth Hospital in Cambridge which is the UK’s largest specialist heart and lung centre. On a usual week he will operate on Mondays and Tuesdays, while the rest of the week he will be in clinics or working on research. In 1995 he led a group which developed an important safety monitoring tool which predicts the outcomes of heart surgery by analysing risk factors presented by individual patients. The EuroSCORE system also allows surgeons to keep a continuous check on their performance. This in turn drives improvements through the profession. He previously told the Guardian that he found it ‘hard to switch off’ but that one way he does this is through composing the cryptic crosswords which he finds ‘enjoyable and therapeutic’.

<p>Twitter follower James Steel called the cryptic crossword &lsquo;genius&rsquo; while another said it was &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The mysterious Philistine began setting crosswords for The Guardian in 2011.</p>
<p>The cryptic crossword comes after the government Operation Yellowhammer dossier revealed a no-deal Brexit would lead to delays in medicine, and public disorder</p>
<p>This is not the first time Philistine&rsquo;s crossword has included witty answers and puzzling clues.</p>
<p>A crossword in July 2012 featured &lsquo;wedgie&rsquo; as an answer to the clue: &lsquo;Many a playground prank ties knot around Maggie&rsquo;s bottom half.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another had the phrase &lsquo;go commando&rsquo; with the clue: &lsquo;Try soldier and avoid bloomers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word Philistine means: &lsquo;An uneducated or unenlightened person.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One perceived to be indifferent or hostile to art or culture, or whose interests and tastes are commonplace or material.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When asked by The Guardian how the crossword-setter chose his pseudonym he said: &lsquo;I am a Philistine, literally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for The Guardian said: &lsquo;The Guardian has a roster of external puzzle compilers; this crossword was produced by Philistine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Guardian refused to comment on if the use of &lsquo;b******&rsquo; was a suitable word for children who also do the crossword.

60D. If your face is red or you are seeing red, you are in a state of IRE.</p>
<p>61D. Very clever. The “Counterpart of sin” in this puzzle is not wickedness. This is actually a math clue, and the answer is COSine.</p>
<p>Today’s Theme</p>
<p>The four grayed patches of squares in Ms. Chung and Mr. Ni’s grid represent rolling DICE in a progressive pattern as we move from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Image Credit&hellip; The New York Times</p>
<p>What usually messes solvers up at this point is what that particular theme element does to the longer answers. The thing is, the element is consistent throughout the theme, so once you get one, you should be able to get them all. The rolling DICE may change the order of the letters in the gray squares, but the way the theme works stays the same. Hang in there, it will come to you.</p>
<p>So what’s happening here? Well, Ms. Chung and Mr. Ni offer us a set of four fairly common phrases that need the letters DICE to complete them. For example, at the central entry, 36A, the answer to the clue “Reference that arranges words by concept rather than alphabetically” is REVERSE DICTIONARY. But when you fill in the entry that stretches across the grid, your answer will be REVERSECTIONARY, which almost sounds as if it could be a surgical procedure, but it’s not.</p>
<p>We need to jump up a line to capture the DI in DICE that are the last two letters of AUDI at 34A. Think of the entry at 36A as an inchworm, and the EDIC in the gray square is where it hunches up to move forward.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — I had two reactions to this puzzle by Ross Trudeau. The first was, “This is fun, and that’s definitely a hat in the grid,” and the second one was, “Dude! Where’s Mr. Peanut? Or Rich Uncle Pennybags, that guy from Monopoly?”</p>
<p>This is an important point. Sometimes you can enjoy a puzzle so much that you just want there to be … more. There are quite a few examples of people and characters who would qualify to be part of this theme set based on the revealer at 45D, and Mr. Trudeau managed to fit four good ones in. I just couldn’t help but feel as if he could have tucked at least one more really familiar one in with a slightly different grid design.</p>
<p>Either way, this is a nice, smooth Tuesday puzzle, and I doff my 45D to Mr. Trudeau.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>Not a lot of trickiness in the clues, in my opinion, but the following are a few that stood out for me.</p>
<p>15A: Before I got AIRTUBE, I had AIRMASK, AIRPUMP and AIRTANK. Always work those crossings.</p>
<p>18A: I got this from the crossings, but it was tough to track down in research. The entry BLEEDER has not appeared in the New York Times Crossword since 1949, and in the three instances where it did appear, it was clued to people who live with the blood disorder hemophilia. It’s not listed as a baseball term in Merriam-Webster.com and, according to the glossary of terms on Baseballmonkey.com, it is defined as “A weakly hit ground ball that goes for a base hit.” A “blooper,” on the other hand — my first guess — is defined on the same site as “A weakly hit fly ball that drops in for a hit; typically, between an infielder and outfielder.” On the other hand, the second definition in the Oxford English Dictionary seems apt.

TUESDAY PUZZLE — When we last met Jon Olsen, he was making his debut in the New York Times Crossword by smiling at us, but in this puzzle, he’s kind of … well, you’ll see.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>18A: “Bottom coat?” as a clue for BABY POWDER is very clever. I suppose if you can have a top coat of paint you can also have a bottom coat, but in this case we are thinking about the kinds of bottoms that are attached to the backs of our bodies. Diaper cream would also be a good coat for a bottom, but there aren’t enough squares for that.</p>
<p>34A: I would be hard pressed to name a place where I might put both an anvil and a stirrup, unless we are talking about parts of the EAR.</p>
<p>50A: TIL that the Atomic Energy Commission, or A.E.C., was founded in 1946 as the agency in charge of all aspects of nuclear power in the United States.

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/15/world/15asia-promo/15asia8-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
The grim forecast in its 2020 World Economic Outlook is an extraordinary reversal from January, when the I.M.F. predicted moderate growth at 3.3 percent. The revised forecast takes into account disrupted supply chains and sustained standstills in industries like tourism.</p>
<p>“The world has been put in a Great Lockdown,” said Gita Gopinath, the fund’s chief economist. “The magnitude and speed of collapse in activity that has followed is unlike anything experienced in our lifetimes.”</p>
<p>Though it predicted a partial rebound next year, the fund said there was still a chance the outcome could be even worse. This year’s decline in output, the I.M.F. predicts, would be worse than that of the 2008 recession, when the economy contracted by less than 1 percent, but less severe than that of the Great Depression, when output contracted by 10 percent.</p>
<p>In context: In this best-case scenario, the world would lose a cumulative $9 trillion in output over two years — greater than the combined gross domestic products of Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>Markets: The S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 3 percent, after upticks in European and Asian markets, as investors saw signs that outbreaks were peaking and businesses slowly reawakening.

11D: In this puzzle, “Screwdrivers, e.g.” are not TOOLS, they are HARD DRINKS, because they contain vodka and orange juice. Does anyone know how the screwdriver got its name? Legend has it that decades ago, American oil workers in the Persian Gulf discreetly added vodka to their orange juice, because who wouldn’t if you had the chance? Unfortunately, their rigs neglected to pack cocktail spoons, and they had to stir the drink, so (stop reading now if you are easily nauseated) they stirred their libations with their screwdrivers.</p>
<p>29D: I so wanted “Like some terriers” to be HARD HEADED. It turns out that the answer is WIRE-HAIRED, but take it from me: Do not bring a terrier into your home unless you are prepared to live with an animal that thinks faster than you do. And has a rudimentary knowledge of tools and how to use them. And likes to keep busy, no matter what the dog decides that means. I think they are a hoot, but if you are looking for a doorstop with fur, think about rescuing a retired greyhound instead.</p>
<p>33D: Wordplay would like to welcome the Swiss town of GSTAAD back to the New York Times Crossword after a hiatus of 35 years.</p>
<p>47D: Hi, kids! I have a fun project for you. No, it’s not homework. Find an older woman — it could be a relative, a family friend or a teacher, as long as she is over 50 — and just say the name “Donny OSMOND” to her. Observe her as, even all these years later, she closes her eyes, sighs and melts into her chair. There might even be squealing.</p>

<p>Mr. White offers us a set of five common “X in the Y” idioms, such as “Bird in the hand?” and some of the squares in each theme entry contain circles. Those circles, when read from left to right, spell out a type of “X,” and the entire theme entry is a synonym for Y, so that the “X” is in the “Y.”</p>
<p>For example, the answer to 17A’s “Bird in the hand?” is HIRED PERSON. That makes very little sense, but take a closer look at the circles: They spell “HERON.” A HERON is a type of bird, and HIRED PERSON is a synonym for “hand,” as in a ranch hand.</p>
<p>Similarly, at 24A, the answer to the clue “Snake in the grass?” is CATTLE FODDER. The circled letters spell ADDER, a type of snake. “Grass” is CATTLE FODDER.</p>
<p>Need one more example? O.K., but I’m hiding this one behind a link. See if you can get it without my help, but if you’re stuck, click the link to see the answer:
