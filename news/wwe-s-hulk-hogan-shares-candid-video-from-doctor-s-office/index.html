<p>Hogan gave another update on his health (Photo: Jerod Harris/Getty Images)</p>
<p>Hulk Hogan is back at the doctor’s office.</p>
<p>The WWE Hall of Famer recently took to social media to share a candid video of himself on the table, and while he suggested he was in some pain, he didn’t go into detail about why he was there.</p>
<p>Alongside the short clip, he tweeted: ‘Ouch once again brother’</p>
<p>In the video, Hogan – whose real name is Terry Bollea – can be seen lay on his back with a black and white bandanna, and a white face mask with his trademark moustache sticking out of the bottom.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He simply said: ‘Once again, I find myself on the table.’</p>

<p>The Hulkster – who has been training hard to stay in top shape – has been relatively open about his health in recent months.</p>
<p>Ouch once again brother HH pic.twitter.com/Y4gq2TMbr2 — Hulk Hogan (@HulkHogan) June 26, 2020</p>
<p>Back in May, he showed off his surgery scars and insisted he was in good enough shape to take on the entire WWE roster.</p>
<p>He wrote: ’10 surgeries you can hang a MAC truck from my back and I’ll still take the whole WWE roster on brother!!!! #immortal #Clearwater #hogangsbeachshop #wwe’</p>
<p>The previous month, the wrestling legend revealed he had torn his bicep, and he bonded with former United States champion Rusev – who has since left WWE – over the injury.</p>
<p>Sporting a full white beard, he shared a selfie and tweeted: ‘Both of my biceps have been torn at the insertions for 25yrs, today I tore my right bicep where it goes in at my front deltoid, well I guess Rusev and I are long lost brothers!</p>
<p>‘BROTHER, HH damn is burns!!! (sic)’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hollywood star Chris Hemsworth previously gave an update on the upcoming Hulk Hogan biopic.</p>
<p>Although there hasn’t been too much to shout about for the Netflix film – which has Joker filmmaker Todd Phillips and wrestling pioneer Eric Bischoff attached – in a while, work has still been going on.</p>
<p>In a chat with ScreenRant, Chris admitted: ‘Look, I haven’t read a script yet. I know it’s being written now and worked on.</p>
<p>‘I know very little about that. It’s sort of in the process now and I’m just fascinated by that world.’</p>

Hulk Hogan noted on Twitter that he is back in the hospital.</p>
<p>No reason was given for this hospital visit but it may be related to his back issues. Hogan has undergone multiple back surgeries over the years and has noted recently that he’s been moving around better after the last back surgery from several months ago.</p>

The telephone rang at the home of Jimmy Hart, the wrestling manager and musician, in Clearwater, Fla., one day in 1995. Hart was working on some songs with his friend J.J. Maguire before he picked up. Maguire could hear only Hart’s end of the conversation. When Hart hung up, Maguire recalled, he looked like a deer paralyzed by headlights.</p>
<p>“What now? Maguire asked.</p>
<p>“Well,” Hart said, “that was The Hulkster. He said he wanted to come over and talk to us.”</p>
<p>They were not sure why. The man on the way to Hart’s home had been the biggest star in the wrestling business for a decade. Hulk Hogan, the 6-foot-7, 300-pound platinum blond behemoth, was the main attraction when Vince McMahon’s World Wrestling Federation took off in the 1980s. He body-slammed Andre The Giant at Wrestlemania. He sold a generation of young fans on the necessity of saying your prayers, eating your vitamins and ripping your yellow T-shirt in half.

Hulk Hogan has been through a ton of back surgeries and other procedures. He recently found himself on “the table” again, and he didn’t sound too thrilled about it.</p>
<p>The Hulkster uploaded a video of himself wearing a mask while laying down. He said “once again I find myself on the table.” We’re not certain what kind of table he is on, but it is in a medical setting.</p>
<p>There were plans to bring Hulk Hogan in for WrestleMania. Ringside News exclusively reported that they couldn’t make a deal work out.</p>
<p>Hulk Hogan’s last back surgery was supposed to do him wonders. They replaced the hardware in his back and removed some huge screws in the process. Now it appears that he’s back in the doctor’s office.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Hulk Hogan will be pain free very soon with a clean bill of health. At least he was wearing his mask in this video.</p>

Throughout his four-decade career in the spotlight, Hulk Hogan has tried a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>There was a time when he was the most prominent celebrity face in wrestling, but a go-to actor in Hollywood, a television spokesman, a recording artist, and a constant presence on talk shows across the world.</p>
<p>However, one of his most infamous attempts to capitalize on his image is his soirees into the restaurant industry.</p>
<p>Hulk Hogan as a business</p>
<p>Hulk Hogan | Kris Connor/WireImage</p>
<p>Anyone who knows anything about wrestling knows that Hogan was a big deal in the eighties and nineties. His eccentric personality and refusal to break character made him a favorite among wrestling fans. The wrestler knew how to use this to his advantage, too. He parlayed his wrestling success into endless possibilities that ran across the gamut.</p>
<p>From hit movies to a knock-off version of the ever-popular George Foreman grill, Hogan is a jack-of-all-trades, although many of those trades that he tried failed miserably. The Hogan Ultimate Grill was a disaster, few of his movies had box office impact, and his music career went as fast as it came.</p>
<p>Talking about Hogan’s rise in the world of business and entertainment is impossible without showing his failures. These failures may best be summed up by a pair of restaurant endeavors that the wrestler put his name on.</p>
<p>Hulk Hogan’s Pastamania</p>
<p>RELATED: Hulk Hogan’s Messy Divorce Cost Him a Fortune</p>
<p>On Labor Day, 1995, Hogan opened his first restaurant. He didn’t open it in Times Square or a swanky Los Angeles spot. Perhaps, catering to his audience, Hogan opened Pastamania in the Mall of America.</p>
<p>This shopping center is among the biggest in the world, and at the time, malls were still raking in money across the globe.</p>
<p>The menu included Hogan-shaped pasta on top of the more traditional fare, such as alfredo and spaghetti and meatballs. It also offered delivery throughout the mall, and Hogan was there to kick off the endeavor in a star-studded event. After the dust settled, however, Pastamania stood no chance. People weren’t dying to try wrestling-centric pasta, and the business model proved little more than a gimmick.</p>
<p>However, Hogan didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>Hulk Hogan’s beach</p>
<p>Years later, he tried to capitalize on his image to open a different type of restaurant, according to Fox News. In 2012, Hogan was coming off of a divorce and a series of financial decisions that left his pocketbook in dire shape. To combat this, he went all-in on the business side of his brand. The result was Hogan’s beach in Tampa Bay, Florida.</p>
<p>The beach-themed restaurant was looking to combine celebrity restaurants like Jimmy Buffett’s Margaritaville with other gimmick-based restaurants like Hooter’s. Hogan spoke about the opportunity with excitement when the restaurant was getting ready to open.</p>
<p>“It’s a logical extension of the Hogan brand, with my image and likeness,” he told the Tampa Bay Times (per Fox News). “In 36 years, I’ve become so tangible to the public and not just Americans. We have a chance to have an international draw.”</p>
<p>Within years, however, Hogan was embroiled in a scandal, per UPROXX, that involved the wrestler making racist remarks in the middle of a sex tape. While the restaurant floated rebranding without its Hogan branding, it eventually closed its doors for good. The biggest splashes it made were mostly negative, from an event in which a woman stole a shoe to an ill-attended labor day party.</p>
<p>Hogan has had some resurgence since his scandal in recent years, but his days as a marketable brand are over. These two failed restaurants show that celebrities and food don’t always mix. While there are exceptions, many ideas such as Pastamania and Hogan’s Beach are dead in the water before they ever get to float.

<p>All Elite Wrestling boss Tony Khan says Hulk Hogan and ex-wife Linda are banned from attending the promotion’s events in the future.</p>
<p>Khan announced the ban on Tuesday in response to a controversial tweet from Linda about the protests and riots in America following the death of George Floyd.</p>

<p>Khan’s response came after Linda deleted a tweet about the violent protests erupting across America.</p>
<p>“Watching the looting, it’s all afro Americans, not sure how robbing and stealing set the record straight but if they want to be heard they need to be civilised,” she tweeted.</p>

<p>Linda’s comments sparked immediate condemnation, with a number of pro wrestlers voicing their anger.</p>
<p>Prince Nana labelled Linda’s remarks “sickening”, while wrestler and commentator AJ Kirsch wrote: “@LindaHogan, you should just go ahead and delete your entire Twitter account, not just that one tweet. You know the one.”</p>

<p>Khan’s ban on Hulk Hogan is reportedly related to racist remarks he was filmed making in 2015.</p>
<p>Linda and Hulk Hogan divorced in 2007 after the wrestling legend was accused of cheating.</p>
<p>“You have single-handedly ruined our 25-year marriage and our family,” Linda said.</p>
<p>“My trust, my love, my future, our future family with grandchildren, holidays, weddings, our kids’ lives, homes, their ability to trust, our poor animals, friends, neighbours, your career, finances, trademarks, retirement, your legacy, your reputation, your health, even your soul. You lost it all.</p>
<p>“You took me for granted and never appreciated me or our beautiful family … blaming me for your horrendous mistakes.</p>
<p>“Until you can really apologise to me and to our children I will never ever forgive you.”</p>

<p>Tiger Woods is the latest sporting star to call for change to create a “safer, unified society” after the death of Floyd.</p>
<p>Woods said on Monday he has always respected US law enforcement but that their use of force on Floyd clearly crossed a line.</p>
<p>Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed his knee into the 46-year-old African-American man&rsquo;s neck while he was handcuffed and saying that he couldn&rsquo;t breathe.</p>
<p>“I have always had the utmost respect for our law enforcement,” 15-times major champion Woods said in a post on Twitter.</p>
<p>“They train so diligently to understand how, when and where to use force.</p>
<p>“This shocking tragedy clearly crossed that line.”</p>
<p>Numerous prominent athletes, including NBA great Michael Jordan, Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton and Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo, have spoken out in recent days as anti-police brutality and anti-racism marches and rallies boiled over across the country.</p>
<p>Liverpool players took a knee at Premier League training on Monday while Manchester United stars Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba took to social media to voice their stance against racism.</p>
<p>Former five-division world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather has also offered to cover Floyd&rsquo;s funeral costs.</p>
