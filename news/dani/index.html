<p>Dani Dyer broke lockdown and social distancing rules by attending a house party with more than 14 guests to celebrate a friend&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>The Love Island winner, 24, was pictured at the private gathering alongside a group of friends on Thursday – two months after being criticised for flouting government rules by leaving her own home to stay with her parents.</p>
<p>In a photo exclusively obtained by MailOnline, Dani can be seen pouting on a sofa while surrounded by her pals, including birthday girl Maddie Spearing, 24.</p>
<p>Against government rules: Dani Dyer broke lockdown and social distancing rules by attending a house party with more than 14 guests to celebrate a friend&rsquo;s birthday</p>
<p>A source said: &lsquo;Dani went to her friend&rsquo;s birthday party yesterday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s been stuck indoors for weeks and just wanted the chance to see those closest to her again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On reflection, she feels really guilty for going and knows she shouldn&rsquo;t have acted against government rules. She will think twice next time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dani attended the party despite Boris Johnson stating only groups of up to six people from different households are now able to meet outdoors, or in a garden, while continuing to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>Breaking social distancing: The Love Island winner was pictured at the private gathering alongside a group of friends on Thursday, including birthday girl Maddie Spearing (pictured)</p>
<p>&lsquo;She will think twice next time&rsquo;: A source told MailOnline that Dani attended the party after feeling cooped up for weeks but she now feels &lsquo;really guilty&rsquo; for breaking lockdown rules</p>
<p>The reality star was spotted in the background of a friend&rsquo;s Instagram story at the party wearing double denim as she met with birthday girl Maddie alongside at least seven other guests outside.</p>
<p>Photos taken inside show decorative balloons, celebratory cocktails and guests of varying ages, including a baby and several people with grey hair.</p>
<p>In April, Dani was slammed for flouting lockdown rules during the coronavirus outbreak after ignoring the ban on visiting relatives.</p>
<p>She drove from her home where she&rsquo;d been isolating with boyfriend Sam Kimmence, 23, to visit her parents, Danny Dyer, 42, and Joanne Mas, 43, at their nearby property.</p>
<p>Say cheers! Photos taken inside show Dani&rsquo;s friend Maddie enjoying her party with guests of varying ages in attendance, such as a baby and those with grey hair</p>
<p>Dani showed herself to be at her mum&rsquo;s house on April 9th, seven days after she was pictured at her own place.</p>
<p>MailOnline revealed that Dani split from Sammy at the beginning of March before lockdown was enforced.</p>
<p>The couple rekindled their romance in April during the outbreak and has since celebrated their yearlong anniversary together.</p>
<p>Sources told MailOnline in March that the pair&rsquo;s relationship was put under strain after Sammy appeared in court accused of scamming two elderly men out of £34,000 by posing as a financial investor.

<h3 id="dani-speegle-dominates-in-her-titan-games-debut">&ldquo;Dani Speegle Dominates in Her Titan Games Debut&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://morningchalkup.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-01-at-9.26.20-PM-1024x578.png" alt="img">
It didn’t take long for Dani Speegle to make her presence known in her Titan Games debut on primetime television on Monday night. Billed as a “social-media star” she proved she was more than that and showed the world what the CrossFit community already knew, that she’s one of the fittest women on the planet.</p>
<p>Event 1, “Nuts and Bolts:” Speegle would take on NCAA women’s basketball referee Nadi Carey in her best-of-three showdown. Their match-up was the final for the women’s side of the Central Region. The women’s version of the event featured a wall with 1,200 lbs of weight that they had to remove before attempting to pull the wall down, releasing a lever. The first athlete to pull the lever wins.</p>
<p>Right from the get-go, Speegle showed her strength as she had no issue removing every plate from the wall while her competitor struggled. Speegle became the first athlete in the competition to remove every plate and the result was little effort used to pull the wall down. She pulled the lever to claim the victory. Speegle – 1, Carey – 0</p>
<p>Event 2, “Lunar Impact:” Starting on opposite ends of an elevated, crescent-shaped platform, each athlete had to scale a two-story ladder and then run atop the platform to a metal wall located at the middle and push against their opponent on the opposite side of the wall until one is forced off the platform.</p>
<p>Speegle beat Carey up the ladder and made it to the wall first and held the early advantage, coming within a foot of eliminating her. Carey rallied and pushed back at Speegle and turned the tide to her favor. Both athletes came to a standstill at the middle of the platform. Speegle found her second wind and slowly pushed back at Carey before finally pushing her off the structure for the victory and securing a chance to compete on Mount Olympus. Speegle – 2, Carey – 0</p>
<p>Mount Olympus: The final event featured the same structure from last week’s season premiere. Ten obstacles that test each athlete’s strength, speed, stamina and heart in a head-to-head race through the structure. Speegle took on the reigning Central Region Titan Chantae McMillan who won in her two trips to Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>McMillan, a two-time Olympian, held the advantage in both speed and familiarity with the event but Speegle kept even with her through the first three obstacles. McMillan made a costly error in the fourth obstacle, the “Log Lift”, giving Speegle a lead she would not relinquish. She had no issue with any of the remaining obstacles and showed her strength in the “Ball and Chain”, dragging the 250-lb wrecking ball with ease and smashing her way through the “Titan Tomb” with her sledgehammer to secure the key and turn the lock giving her the title of Titan</p>
<p>What’s next: Speegle takes over the mantle as Central Region Champion and now advances to next week’s Regional finals to defend her title once again on Mount Olympus against other Regional competitors before moving onto the final..</p>
<p>In the men’s competition, former NFL great Joe Thomas continued his dominance over all his challengers as he once again defended his Regional Titan title by defeating sports medicine physician Kaleb Redden on Mount Olympus</p>
<p>Redden will be one of the two athletes that CrossFit legend Matt Chan</p>
<p>The Titan Games broadcasts every Monday at 8:00 PM EST on NBC.

<h3 id="paddler-mudit-dani-serves-it-right-on-instagram">&ldquo;Paddler Mudit Dani serves it right on Instagram&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-76203986,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-255357,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg" alt="img">
At a time when physical interactions have become a strict no-no, the virtual world has come to the rescue of many of us, and sportspersons are no different. Many famous names from the sporting community have gone live on various social media platforms, interacting with fellow players, fans, etc. Among them is upcoming table tennis player Mudit Dani , who won bronze medal at the US Open in December last year.From his Mumbai home, Dani has been talking to some of India’s most successful sportspersons, both former and current, on Instagram Live to find inspiration during these difficult times through their stories of struggle and triumph.“I learnt some important things. One of them is focusing on the process and yourself rather than the results because it (your achievement or the lack of it) is the result of what you do in training. And if you can’t do things you want to do in the training, there is no way you can do those things in the match,” the 21-year-old Dani told ET Sport.Dani, who became the sixth highest-ranked Indian after breaking into the top-200 of the world rankings recently, is not the only sportsperson interviewing sports stars on social media though. In fact, he is among the least popular. You have the likes of Rohit Sharma , Ravichandran Ashwin, Jemimah Rodrigues and Smriti Mandhana, and Sunil Chhetri doing similar sessions.But the list of people who have been on Dani’s show — In the Sportlight — is quiet impressive for a 21-year-old who is yet to make a mark at the highest stage. So far, he has had Abhinav Bindra (shooting, 2008 Olympic gold medallist), Leander Paes (tennis, 1996 Olympics bronze medallist and multiple grand slam winner), G Sathiyan (table tennis, 2018 CWG gold medallist, 2018 Asian Games bronze medallist), Manika Batra (table tennis, 2018 CWG gold medallist, 2018 Asian Games bronze medallist), Dipika Pallikal (squash, 2018 CWG gold medallist), Apurvi Chandela (shooting, 2014 CWG gold medallist, 2018 Asian Games bronze medallist), Anirudh Thapa (football, Indian national team, Chennaiyin FC) and Parupalli Kashyap (badminton, 2014 CWG gold medallist) on his show. And he is set to host sports minister Kiren Rijiju on his show next week (Friday, June 12).The idea of starting this interview-based show, he said, came after receiving a lot of questions on his Instagram handle about his routine during the lockdown. Being on the circuit for more than 10 years has helped Dani build a ‘connect’ with many athletes.“I thought if I was able to connect them to many of the people who have been asking me, there will be a better platform for everyone to understand what every athlete is going through right now, what they are doing to improve their game and mental space,” said Dani.The initial plan was to talk to just 6-7 of his close table tennis friends, but then one thing led to another and he ended up having such big names for his show.“So, I reached out to a couple of people and they connected me to a few more people. …then it got really big. I then cut on the TT thing and made it multi-sport where I could reach out to any possible Indian. If Abhinav Bindra and Leader Paes are talking, anyone would want to listen,” he said.Unlike many other sportspersons who are doing similar shows, Dani has no team to help him prepare. His allies are his family members. “I do end up consulting my sister and parents. Sometimes I also ask my friends,” he said, adding that Google comes in handy to source information about his guests.Interestingly, there has been no cricketer on the show so far. Dani is not particularly averse to the idea, but he wants to have only the top names. “If I have an Abhinav Bindra and a Leander Pae, I would need a Rohit Sharma or a Virat Kohli or somebody of that stature,” he said.As of now, Indian hockey player Yuvraj Walmiki and woman footballer Dalima Chhibber are in line to appear on his show. Though he isn’t sure for how long he will be able to continue the show, as the players have started returning to training, Dani has already planned the final.“Sharath (Kamal) is going to be the last episode. I decided that in the beginning only. I wanted to start with TT, so I did my first episode with Sathiyan, and (I am going to) end with Sharath,” he said.Dani has the distinction of being only the third Indian player after Soumyajit Ghosh and Harmeet Desai to break into the top-10 of the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) World Junior Boys’ Circuit standings. He continued his good work even after joining the senior circuit in 2018. Within two years, he has moved from being outside of top-700 to top-200 in the world rankings.But this long break from competition and training because of the suspension of all ITTF events can break his momentum. Is he worried?“There is no reason to think much about it. The situation is what it is and nobody can change it,” he said. “In a way, it’s actually a boon that I left off on a positive note.”While at home, Dani understands he has to keep himself physically and mentally ready so that when the training restarts, he doesn’t have to start from scratch. In consultation with his trainer Yogesh Kanchgar and coach Kamlesh Mehta, he has been working on his fitness every day for around two hours that includes exercises for strength, mobility and stretching. He is also talking regularly with his sports psychologist Mugdha Bavare to mentally prepare himself for the grind.With the help of his coach, he has also managed to source a table from a local club recently. “Obviously, I don’t have anyone to play with, but I am able to serve at least,” he said.

<h3 id="padma-shri-nominee-rajatkumar-dani-is-now-a-world-renowned-researcher">&ldquo;Padma Shri nominee Rajatkumar Dani is now a world-renowned researcher&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-360mgffpjppg1umv96d7vcd9j1-20200601183635.Medi.jpeg" alt="img">
Rajatkumar Dani is now a World-Renowned Researcher of Ancient History and Extraterrestrial. He is a superstar of time and had won the distinguished Awards of India.</p>
<p>He is widely known for his works on Before Big Bang Theory, Connection Of God &amp; Aliens, Time Traveling, galaxy clusters, and Other Unknown Historical Mysteries.</p>
<p>This article provides an insight into the life and works of this Young Researcher from India.</p>
<p>His work is found in the form of a novel that has been written by him himself. It is called &ldquo;Cosmagen: My Journey from a Small Town in Maharashtra to Andromeda Galaxy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The book tells us, We are not only to have life in this universe, but we are also living in this universe, where we don&rsquo;t know how many planets, galaxies, and cosmic things existed.</p>
<p>In this infinite universe, who I am? What is my correspondence in the universe? Our Llfe taught us so many things, some people related their events or collisions with misfortune, Irrationalities and black magic, etc, I share my life events which changes my thoughts.</p>
<p>I am here to share my journey to cosmos and book having minute details of my life as an uncommoner and how my interest fled towards research on Extra-terrestrial and Space. The novel follows the life of one of the scientists who also happens to be an Entrepreneur.</p>
<p>The author used all the information gathered through surveys and interviews with eminent personalities of the times to write this novel. He is a Researcher, but a very poor mathematician. He is just an Intermediate pass person. He tried to do a Bachelor of Science in Physics but he failed several times because of his mathematics.</p>
<p>Now a day he could have been a famous Scientist, but he failed to find any solution to the problem of the dimensions of the Universe Instead, he concentrated on the other dimensions and later on found the mathematics.</p>
<p>His main task was to find a starting point of the universe based on the study of Ancient Science and religions because as per his predictions Mythological books and stories can help us to find the mystery of the universe. We have all written proof in our holy books but we are not able to decode or Understand that message.</p>
<p>He thought about science, about faith, about the man. he thought about how every culture, in every country, in every time, had always shared one thing. We all had the Creator.</p>
<p>We used different names, different faces, and different prayers, but God was the universal constant for man.</p>
<p>God was the symbol we all shared&hellip;the symbol of all the mysteries of life that we could not understand. The ancients had praised God as a symbol of our limitless human potential, but that ancient symbol had been lost over time. Until now.</p>
<p>My friends, I am not saying I know for a fact that there is no God. All I am saying is that if there is a divine force behind the universe, it is laughing hysterically at the religions we&rsquo;ve created in an attempt to define it.</p>
<p>He said That &ldquo;Sometimes, all you have to do is shift your perspective to see someone else&rsquo;s truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This led him to start a research facility at Bhiwapur and later on, this became one of the prime places for his research. His dream was to show that there are such things as hidden objects in the universe. and &ldquo;The truth can be glimpsed only through the eyes of death&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He felt that the world is not ready to accept scientific proof without any prior knowledge of what it is all about. His work produced a lot of evidence in favor of such a theory.</p>
<p>He was interested in studying the Religions and Ancient Science because his curiosity about finding his question&rsquo;s Answers takes him to study Ancient science and religion. He is successful in this task and he said in the quote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible, Quran, Mahabharata, Ramayana, Torah, Injil, and all other mythological books did not arrive by fax from heaven. The Mythological books are the product of man, my dear. Not of God. The Mythological books did not fall magically from the clouds. Man created it as a historical record of tumultuous times, and it has evolved through countless translations, additions, and revisions. History has never had a definitive version of the book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rajatkumar Dani is a very dynamic man. He is an activist in various causes. He is the Founder of The Dani Groups. He is an Entrepreneur too. Rajat doesn&rsquo;t want to earn from passion. He says, If you started to earn by your passion then you destroy your creativity.</p>
<p>This is the mind of a brilliant man, but as we know, nothing stays still in India. It will be interesting to see how the India of today will resemble the India of Rajatkumar Dani.</p>
<p>Nothing is hidden that will not be made known; nothing is secret that will not come to light. - Rajatkumar Dani
