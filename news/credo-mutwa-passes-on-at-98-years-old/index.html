<h1>Credo Mutwa passes on at 98 years old</h1>

Well-known traditional healer Credo Mutwa has passed away at the age of 98, the SABC reports.</p>
<p>The Credo Mutwa foundation has confirmed the passing of the renowned traditional healer.</p>
<p>In a statement, the foundation said Mutwa passed on in the early hours of Wednesday morning at Kuruman Hospital “where he was rushed to yesterday”.</p>
<p>The foundation said Mutwa’s health had been fragile and he had been in and out of the hospital in the past couple of days.</p>
<p>The foundation requested the nation to mourn with Mutwa’s family “and during this time we humbly request that the family be given the space to mourn”.</p>
<p>Political parties the governing African National Congress (ANC), the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the African Transformation Movement (ATM) have sent condolences to the family and friends of the traditional healer.</p>
<p>The ANC said Mutwa’s “contribution to our country and continent remains immeasurable”.</p>
<p>“He devoted most of his energy towards preserving African culture and challenging the tendency to relegate African cultural practices and beliefs to myths and superstitions.</p>
<p>“The once vibrant storyteller and traditional healer is respected for his role in advocating for the use of traditional medicines and discovering the origins of mankind. During his active years as a shaman, Mutwa travelled across the country in search of hidden truths.</p>
<p>“This great South African will be remembered for his predictions of key world events, including the assassination of Chris Hani, the 1976 June 16 uprisings, and other key political developments in the country.</p>
<p>“An African intellectual of note, he was the author of several books. Baba Mutwa’s knowledge and intelligence is unparalleled. One of his books Indaba, My Children, was both a commercial and critical success after selling over 250,000 copies in South Africa alone. In addition, Credo Mutwa also pursued his talents as a painter and sculptor.</p>
<p>“The people of our country will treasure his memory as one of our most distinguished sons who consciously chose to place his spiritual gifts at the disposal of his nation,” the ANC said in a statement.</p>

<p>In early 2020, Mutwa trended on social media after an old video resurfaced of his prediction of a conflict between Iran and the USA. Mutwa predicted that the missile attack in Iraq would only be the beginning of a war that would be “bloodier” than during Saddam Hussein’s time.</p>
<p>The traditional healer trended on social media late last year after another video of his resurfaced in which he claimed that Helen Zille’s article got him and his family attacked in the 70s.</p>
<p>The traditional healer also allegedly foretold of the fall of former president Thabo Mbeki and the 9/11 attacks in the US.</p>

“He was a great spiritual leader. We have lost a critical reservoir of indigenous knowledge.”</p>
<p>This is how Contralesa secretary-general Zolani Mkiva described renowned traditional leader Credo Mutwa, who died on Wednesday morning at the age of 98.</p>
<p>Mkiva said the organisation was saddened by his passing.</p>
<p>Born Vusamazulu Credo Mutwa, the traditional healer was respected countrywide. He is known as an author of books that draw upon African mythology.</p>
<p>His most recent work is a graphic novel called The Tree of Life Trilogy, based on the writings of his most famous book, Indaba, my Children. In 2018 he was honoured with an USIBA award presented by the department of arts &amp; culture for his work in indigenous wisdom. Indaba, My Children was both a commercial and critical success after selling over 250,000 copies in SA alone.</p>
<p>In addition, Mutwa also pursued his talents as a painter and sculptor.

<h3 id="simphiwe-dana-pays-tribute-to-late-spiritual-leader-credo-mutwa-noting-his-influence-on-her-albums-artwork">Simphiwe Dana pays tribute to late spiritual leader, Credo Mutwa, noting his influence on her album’s artwork</h3>
<p><img src="https://justnje.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Simphiwe-Dana-Album-Bamako-939x600.jpg" alt="img">
South African musician, Simphiwe Dana, took to social media to pay tribute to late spiritual leader, Credo Mutwa, and state that most of her artwork was influenced by him.</p>
<p>Simphiwe Dana took to social media to mourn the passing of Credo Mutwa, expressing that the 98-year-old spiritual leader was her muse. She stated, in part, “If you look closely at my artwork, you will see his influence.” This comes as the songstress prepares to release her fifth studio album, Bamako, which was initially scheduled to be released on Friday, 27 March 2020. However, due to the coronavirus outbreak, the release may be delayed.</p>
<p>The star has currently released two singles from the album, namely, Usikhonzile and Uzokhala. Usikhonzile was the first single, released on Friday, 7 February 2020, marking a five-year hiatus from the musician.</p>
<p>Simphiwe’s second and current single, Uzokhala, continues to showcase her range and versatility in creating music. Simphiwe has, in many interviews, stated that when it comes to creating music, she does not have a set formula, but normally starts by writing acapella. Moreover, Simphiwe creates music by writing songs that capture a moment or emotion, rather than creating songs that feed into an idea of what an entire album is meant to sound like.</p>
<p>Bamako, which is the inspiration and place of inception of the album, is the capital of Mali. Moreover, the title of the album highlights the singer’s constant inspiration and influence from West Africa and Mali, which will be evident in the upcoming album.</p>
<p>The singles are available for purchase on Apple Music.</p>
