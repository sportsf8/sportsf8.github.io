<p>Dear Fred and Maria,</p>
<p>I am so sorry to hear that Sophie passed away. She was truly one of my very favorite patients. She was just so kind to us. It always made me happy to know I was going to see Sophie and when she would just pop in She alway brought a smile to my face. I am so sorry for your loss. May she Rest In Peace.</p>
<p>With much love,</p>

Here’s another edition of “Dear Sophie,” the advice column that answers immigration-related questions about working at technology companies.</p>
<p>“Your questions are vital to the spread of knowledge that allows people all over the world to rise above borders and pursue their dreams,” says Sophie Alcorn, a Silicon Valley immigration attorney. “Whether you’re in people ops, a founder or seeking a job in Silicon Valley, I would love to answer your questions in my next column.”</p>

<p>Dear Sophie:</p>
<p>What is going on with recent USCIS furloughs and Trump’s H-1B ban?</p>
<p>I handle recruitment for several tech companies. Is immigration happening? Who can I hire?</p>
<p>—Frustrated in Fremont</p>
<p>Dear Fremont:</p>
<p>Immigration is still possible and I will explain how below. The administration continues to miss the mark with immigration policy. Trump’s U.S. unemployment “solution” of cutting off the stream of global talent to the U.S. is short-sighted. The administration is shooting America in the foot by walling off the promise of post-COVID economic revitalization and job-creation for Americans through the talent of immigrant entrepreneurs, investors and talent.</p>
<p>USCIS just provided a 30-day furlough notice to more than 70% of its employees. Reporters have been reaching out to me every day requesting stories of affected immigrants and HR professionals; please sign up to share your immigration story with journalists.

<p><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/285/437/416df249ccd6c5a8438f1315c58cf6c974-arca-sophie.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Arca and Sophie have circled each other for years, icons of the pop experimentalism that has been led by trans and gender-nonconforming musicians. While Sophie found fulfillment on the edges of pop, working with Charli XCX and Madonna, Arca leaned into the weird(er), as a collaborator-mentee of Björk who recognized the value of a good shock. KiCk i, the first in a series of four Arca projects, finds the Venezuelan producer indulging her fascinations with the diva and coming into her own as a pop star. But on “La Chíqui,” Arca’s long-anticipated first outing with Scottish producer Sophie, her boundary-pushing goal remains.</p>
<p>The track opens right in the middle of the club. “Menéalo,” Arca repeats — “shake it” in Spanish, recalling her command to “shake that pussy, bitch,” from her one-off 2020 mix “@@@@@.” “La Chíqui” concludes a run of pop-adjacent bangers on KiCk i: Shygirl raps over a woozy beat on “Watch,” electro-reggaetón burner “KLK” finds flamenco superstar Rosalía running point, “Rip the Slit” is an earworm of a club-kid anthem. After Arca’s introduction, “La Chíqui” cuts out for a few seconds of the sparse, haunting vocals she favored on her 2017 self-titled album, before everything hits at once. Sophie sings the chorus as Arca continues to chant “menéalo,” while their individual contributions to the production blur. Arca told Apple Music the team-up was “so self-contained and bridging and finding mutual points of collaborating.” It sounds like that: They’re not moving toward each other from their own realms, they’re piling on top of what they both know.</p>
<p>The lyrics become destructive. “Roots pulling up,” Sophie repeats in the chorus. Arca opens her verse, “The schism / It shifts, it rips,” her voice pitched up until she sounds like she’s on a 100 gecs song. Eventually, it sounds like they’ve broken the music itself, as the song short-circuits and fades out. It’s like the dance floor has closed, as the album’s final two tracks, “Machote” and “No Queda Nada,” provide a slower and more melodic comedown.</p>
<p>“There’s magic in making yourself, and so often that magic leaks out in the form of music,” Sasha Geffen, a Vulture contributor, writes at the end of their book, Glitter Up the Dark: How Pop Music Broke the Binary. Arca closes “La Chíqui” by affirming her identity — she’s the titular chíqui, identifying as a trans woman after confidently and publicly transitioning. “Rather than depicting gender dysphoria, I want to explore gender euphoria,” she told Garage of her music. Arca and Sophie’s collaboration, a meeting of two of today’s preeminent pop creators, is a celebration above all else. “La Chíqui” is really about the possibility of creation: what can be made when boundaries get pushed to a breaking point.

<h3 id="big-brother-australias-sophie-the-truth-about-chad--me">&ldquo;Big Brother Australia&rsquo;s Sophie: ‘The truth about Chad &amp; me’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.newidea.com.au/media/89779/pac-hero-24.jpg" alt="img">
Chad and Sophie&rsquo;s on screen romance has had fans talking. Channel Seven</p>
<p>In a sign that there is something real between the duo, the Darwin resident tells New Idea that she and Chad have been speaking every single day since they left the Big Brother house and joined the rest of Australia in lockdown.</p>
<p>She also reveals she’s planning on moving to Chad’s home town of Sydney once the nation’s borders reopen.</p>
<p>“The feelings are definitely genuine. We were [already] playing a game … It’s too hard to play a game and play someone else in it. Well, for us it was. Chad looks like this big man, but he’s really quite soft and gentle on the inside. I loved how he talked about his dog Buddy so much and his mum.”</p>
<p>Sophie shuts down rumours their romance is fake. Channel Seven</p>
<p>Sophie and Chad are both hot favourites to make it to the final three, and she’s confident that their relationship is strong enough to withstand one of them beating out the other.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day we came here to win. If Chad won, I’d be happy for him, and I think he’d be happy for me. We can share the money. What’s mine is yours [laughs].</p>
<p>“I think we have played a very nice, genuine game. I don’t think I deserve to win more than him. We deserve it equally.</p>
<p>Chad is doing it for his dad, who passed away about 10 years ago. He wanted to make his dad proud and honour him because it was his dad’s favourite TV show.</p>
<p>For me, it was my dream; my be-all and end-all. In 2012 I actually applied for Big Brother and made it a few rounds in [the audition process]. I grew up watching it and always thought I’d be perfect for the show, as vain as that sounds.”</p>
<p>The couple are too cute. Channel Seven</p>
<p>Indeed, Sophie has craved the spotlight ever since she was a little girl, telling New Idea, “I’ve always been a show pony and I love being centre of attention.”</p>
<p>In Year 2, she was enrolled in her first gymnastics class after a teacher told her mum that she was having problems with gross motor skills, and suggested the sport might help.</p>
<p>Sophie proved to have a natural ability and soon started competing.</p>
<p>At 18, she had qualified for the 2012 London Olympics team, but was forced to pull out after fracturing her back due to overuse.</p>
<p>“I was an all-rounder, where as most of the other girls were specialists. They’d only train [on] one apparatus but I had to do them all. It was just overloading … I couldn’t do it any more, both physically and mentally.”</p>
<p>Following the end of her gymnastics career, Sophie won Miss Supercar in 2017 and served as an ambassador for the sport.</p>
<p>She’s quick to “set the record straight” that she wasn’t a grid girl, as has been suggested, but says she enjoyed the exposure the gig gave her.</p>
<p>Now, she’s keen to build on the celebrity status that being on Big Brother has given her, and sees herself settling in Sydney with Chad.</p>
<p>“I want to take this and run with this,” she confirms.</p>
<p>“No matter what happens after the finale, I want to use this. I studied media and communications, and would love to use this and help set up a career.”</p>
<p>The latest issue of New Idea is on sale NOW!

<p>Sonia asked Casey if she thought Chad and Sophie&rsquo;s relationship posed a threat to the other housemates.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yeah, but I think it&rsquo;s dangerous in the form of all relationships in the house&hellip; just because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;doing tha thang&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s any different,&rsquo; she said.</p>

<h3 id="blue-ticket-by-sophie-mackintosh-book-review">&ldquo;&lsquo;Blue Ticket,&rsquo; by Sophie Mackintosh book review&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OVNGBNF27MI6VAFZIDWOTJYB3Q.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
“You have been spared,” a doctor tells Calla and the other blue ticket recipients as the single white-ticket girl is escorted into a separate room by an “emissary.” (We learn about the sinister duties of these state functionaries over time.) Another doctor inserts a birth control device in Calla, who knows that the blue ticket means she will never have children. “I was glad,” she tells us. “Don’t underestimate the relief of a decision being taken away from you.”</p>
<p>She feels differently 18 years later. The world of “independence, of pleasure-seeking and fulfillment” her blue ticket promised has mostly involved a lot of drinking and sex, some of it violent. Her most meaningful relationship is with Doctor A, who monitors her physical and emotional condition and writes a lot of prescriptions. Doctors seem to have a great deal of control over the woman they supervise, but Mackintosh keeps the details deliberately vague, intensifying the mood of generalized dread.</p>
<p>That mood also colors Calla’s decision to remove her birth control device. She’s propelled by “a new and dark feeling inside me. A strange, ravaging ghost.” Her urge to have a baby overpowers everything she’s been told her entire life, and it’s not surprising that when she does get pregnant her primary emotion is fear; although she doesn’t know what the consequences will be, they clearly won’t be good. What Calla really wants, the author shows us, isn’t necessarily a baby; it’s an answer. “I was not motherly. It had been judged that it wasn’t for me,” she tells us when she gets the blue ticket. Years later, she wants to know, “What made a mother? What was the thing I was lacking?”</p>
<p>The answer to that question, near the end of Calla’s odyssey, provides the novel’s most brutal moment. And this is a brutal society; Calla has known that since she got her blue ticket, a bottle of water, a compass and a sandwich and was told to go “to the place of your choice.” When an emissary arrives at her door three days after her pregnancy has been discovered, she thinks, “At least they gave me a tent this time.” (In addition, he hands her a map, some dried foods, a knife and an antiquated pistol.) As Calla flees shadowy pursuers, we learn from her memories that the blue ticket entered girls in a struggle for survival; they had to reach their destination alive to claim the ticket’s alleged rewards, and not every girl made it. A brief conversation with the man who fathers Calla’s baby (and then wants nothing to do with her) suggests that boys were pitted against one another too, though there’s also a disturbing hint that they preyed on blue-ticket girls.</p>
<p>Without delving into specifics, Mackintosh creates a hostile environment that deforms all relationships. Calla joins up with several other illegally pregnant women heading for “the border” (apparently there are alternatives to her ticketed nation), but they don’t entirely trust one another, and the novel’s grim denouement shows they had reason not to. The revelation that one of their band, Marisol, had been a doctor before she got pregnant makes it clear that this is not a simple tale of men oppressing women. And the addition to the group of a white-ticket woman who ended her pregnancy underscores a point Mackintosh has made clear all along: “Blue Ticket” is not about whether women should have babies but about what happens to human beings when their ability to choose is denied. When Calla is finally offered a choice, it’s a terrible one, and Mackintosh gives her only the smallest modicum of hope to lessen its bleakness.</p>
<p>AD</p>

<p>Written in cool, clinical prose parceled out in short paragraphs separated by lots of white space, “Blue Ticket” does not aim to stir our emotions, even though it deals with emotionally fraught material. Mackintosh traffics in ambivalence and ambiguity, suitable tools for charting Calla’s hesitant progress toward, if not self-knowledge, at least knowledge of what she is looking for.</p>

La justice turque s&rsquo;est penchée jeudi sur l&rsquo;avenir de l&rsquo;ex-basilique Sainte-Sophie, aujourd&rsquo;hui l&rsquo;un des musées les plus visités d&rsquo;Istanbul, que le président Erdogan souhaite voir revenir au statut de mosquée au risque de susciter des tensions avec plusieurs pays. Le Conseil d'État doit annoncer sa décision sous 15 jours.</p>

<p>Mosquée ou musée ? Le plus haut tribunal de Turquie a étudié, jeudi 2 juillet, sur le statut de l&rsquo;ex-basilique Sainte-Sophie. Le Conseil d'État doit annoncer sa décision sous 15 jours, a rapporté la télévision d'État TRT.</p>
<p>Œuvre architecturale majeure construite au VIe siècle par les Byzantins qui y couronnaient leurs empereurs, Sainte-Sophie est un site classé au patrimoine mondial de l&rsquo;Unesco et l&rsquo;une des principales attractions touristiques d&rsquo;Istanbul.</p>
<p>Convertie en mosquée après la prise de Constantinople par les Ottomans en 1453, elle a été transformée en musée en 1935 par le dirigeant de la jeune République turque, Mustafa Kemal, soucieux de &ldquo;l&rsquo;offrir à l&rsquo;humanité&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Erdogan veut rallier les conservateurs</p>
<p>Signe que l&rsquo;affaire préoccupe à l'étranger, les États-Unis ont appelé mercredi la Turquie à ne pas toucher au statut de Sainte-Sophie.</p>
<p>Mais Recep Tayyip Erdogan, un nostalgique de l&rsquo;Empire ottoman qui cherche aujourd&rsquo;hui à rallier l'électorat conservateur sur fond de crise économique due à la pandémie de nouveau coronavirus, s&rsquo;est plusieurs fois dit pour une reconversion en mosquée. L&rsquo;an dernier, il avait qualifié la transformation de Sainte-Sophie en musée de &ldquo;très grosse erreur&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Depuis l&rsquo;arrivée de Recep Tayyip Erdogan au pouvoir en 2003, les activités liées à l&rsquo;islam se sont multipliées à l&rsquo;intérieur de Sainte-Sophie, avec notamment des séances de lecture du Coran ou des prières collectives sur le parvis du monument.</p>
<p>Puissant symbole</p>
<p>Pour Anthony Skinner, du cabinet de consultants Verisk Maplecroft, reconvertir Sainte-Sophie en mosquée permettrait au président turc de contenter sa base électorale, d&rsquo;irriter Athènes, avec qui les rapports sont tendus, et de renouer avec le passé ottoman. &ldquo;Erdogan ne pouvait pas trouver un symbole aussi puissant que Sainte-Sophie pour atteindre tous ces buts à la fois&rdquo;, résume-t-il.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;an dernier, le Conseil d'État avait déjà autorisé la reconversion en mosquée de la superbe église byzantine de la Chora à Istanbul, une décision perçue par certains comme un ballon d&rsquo;essai avant Sainte-Sophie.</p>
<p>La décision du Conseil d'État jeudi &ldquo;sera vraisemblablement politique (&hellip;), le résultat des délibérations au sein du gouvernement&rdquo;, estime Asli Aydintasbas, chercheuse à l&rsquo;European Council on Foreign Relations. Selon elle, le gouvernement doit peser le pour et le contre, notamment à travers le prisme des relations avec la Grèce, l&rsquo;Europe et l&rsquo;administration américaine de Donald Trump pour qui &ldquo;la religion est un sujet important&rdquo;.</p>
