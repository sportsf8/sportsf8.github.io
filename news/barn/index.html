<p>(CNN) Esteban Granero has often been able to see things differently to other players on the pitch.</p>
<p>Praised for his vision and spatial awareness in midfield, the former Real Madrid star is deploying all the skills he learnt as a footballer to run Olocip, an artificial intelligence company he founded five years ago.</p>
<p>While Olocip normally provides predictive analysis in sport, it has recently been proving key to Spain&rsquo;s attempts to minimize the impact of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>If Granero&rsquo;s analytical mind has made him a joy to watch throughout his career as a metronomic midfielder, it&rsquo;s something the Spaniard believes has helped his unlikely transition from player to AI entrepreneur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key point is anticipation,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This is something that happens on the pitch for a midfielder, to try to anticipate what&rsquo;s happening in the next play is so important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the best at anticipating, they rule the game and artificial intelligence as we know it is about anticipation, trying to make predictions in order to see the future in a very realistic way before it happens, so you can make decisions in a scenario with less uncertainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So anticipation is key for decision-making in clubs in the industry, but also in health problems like this pandemic &ndash; and, of course, inside the pitch when you are a football player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esteban Granero celebrates after winning the Copa del Rey against Barcelona in 2011.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who currently plays for third division side Marbella, has dedicated almost every second of his free time over the last five years to developing his company.</p>
<p>Granero founded Olocip while playing for Real Sociedad to fill what he saw as a void of predictive data analysis in football; data that helps clubs, for example, to more accurately assess how a new signing will perform in the future.</p>
<p>However, since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the company has shifted all of its resources from focusing on football to helping fight the rapidly spreading outbreak.</p>
<p>So highly regarded is the work that Olocip does &ndash; thanks largely to the work of Concha Bielza and Pedro Larranaga, who Granero describes as &ldquo;two of the best artificial intelligence scientists in Europe&rdquo; &ndash; that the Spanish government, as well as local government in each of Spain&rsquo;s autonomous regions, have come to them for guidance.</p>
<p>Dr. Antonio Salmeron, a fellow data scientist and the Head of Mathematics at the University of Almeria, says Olocip&rsquo;s models are valuable as they are not only built using data, but also incorporate knowledge from human experts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remarkably, Olocip emphasizes prescriptive models, that is, they are not only capable of detecting potential problems, but also give indications for their treatment,&rdquo; he told CNN. &ldquo;Which is especially interesting in aspects of sports medicine.</p>
<p>Granero has spent much of the last five years developing Olocip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been following the progress made by Olocip since the beginning of the [coronavirus] crisis and they have adapted their models to predict the evolution of the disease, with good results &ndash; it has an excellent reputation in Spain, having first-rate scientists and data analysts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Olocip&rsquo;s analysis has helped predict how the virus will spread across the country and which areas will be hit hardest, allowing decisions to be made on where to move resources &ldquo;before the system collapses,&rdquo; when to lift lockdown restrictions as well as being better prepared for future pandemics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think our models are the best we can find about the pandemic,&rdquo; Granero tells CNN from lockdown at his home in Marbella. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s already been used by institutions and we have been asked in different countries, not only in Spain, so we are happy to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a problem is so huge, a global problem, and it&rsquo;s affecting old people and people with vulnerabilities, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to do your best in the way you can to try to help, this is nothing heroic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the heroes are in the hospitals treating patients and risking their lives and we are just doing the best we can in order to make this prediction, that is our speciality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Light at the end of the tunnel</p>
<p>After being contacted by a friend who founded the &lsquo;Stop Corona&rsquo; platform, Granero began focusing on the pandemic when Spain declared a state of emergency on March 13.</p>
<p>Though Spain has already passed the peak of its pandemic &ndash; Granero&rsquo;s model says this was on April 4 &ndash; it has been one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Concha and Pedro lead our artificial intelligence team &hellip; their role is very important for me. I cannot think about my company without these two people and I&rsquo;m so proud that we can work together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spain has recorded more than 232,000 confirmed cases, the fourth highest in the world, and 27,888 deaths. However, there is now light at the end of what has been a devastating tunnel.</p>
<p>After seven weeks of the strictest lockdown in Europe, restrictions were eased slightly at the start of the month as Spaniards were finally allowed outside for limited exercise.</p>
<p>Throughout this unprecedented, ever-evolving scenario, Olocip has provided all of its data analysis for free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not always about profit,&rdquo; Granero says. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t raised a penny with [helping] this problem, but we are very proud to have us helped in this way. Our models are available for anybody that needs them or thinks that this can help with the health of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spain was the second country in Europe, after Italy, to be severely impacted by the coronavirus, which Granero says made it more difficult to anticipate solutions.</p>
<p>While the UK and the the US have been among the countries worst affected by the pandemic, Germany and Canada are widely considered to be among those that have handled it best.</p>
<p>Real Madrid celebrate winning La Liga in 2012.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Germany did a good job because they are very realistic with data,&rdquo; Granero says. &ldquo;And so they they took the best decisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canada had this artificial intelligence system in order to predict how big this virus was going to be, so they locked down before the rest and had fewer problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we [Spain] have done very badly. We could have done better, yes, but it was very difficult. So the most important thing is try to do the right things from now, and the best way is trying to hear the specialists and, of course, use technology in the best way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Complex problem&rsquo;</p>
<p>Granero, who won La Liga and the Copa del Rey during his time at Real Madrid, recently joined Marbella after leaving top-flight side Espanyol, lured by the southern club&rsquo;s ambitious project and the opportunity to lead the club into the first division.</p>
<p>Before the coronavirus brought football to a halt in Spain, Marbella was in second place and looking assured of a playoff spot as it went in search of promotion.</p>
<p>Granero believes finishing this season must take priority over starting the next, not due to personal interests with Marbella but to maintain the integrity of the competitions.</p>
<p>Granero joined Marbella this year and is hoping to secure promotion.</p>
<p>La Liga boss Javier Tebas has outlined protocols for elite football in Spain to return behind closed doors in June, though plans were dented recently when five players across Spain&rsquo;s top two divisions tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first first thing we need to have in mind is the health of people, health of spectators, players and referees,&rdquo; Granero says. &ldquo;The solution is not easy, but the competitions are better if they are finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need to find a way to finish the competitions because once something has started, it needs to be finished. So they need to find a way. The other [solutions] are unfair by nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s a very complex problem and they need to wait until health is assured but they need to finish the competition &ndash; behind closed doors is probably the only solution and this is probably something we will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isolation certainly isn&rsquo;t the way Granero would have envisaged his start to life Marbella, but it has at least provided him with more time to focus on his growing company &ndash; which is now perhaps more important than he could have ever imagined it would be.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi tries to tackle Granero during Barcelona&rsquo;s La Liga clash against Espanyol in 2018.</p>
<p>Ever the analyst, Granero is already thinking about how this enforced break can be used to his side&rsquo;s advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we start again with training and with games, we will be living a situation nobody has lived,&rdquo; he ponders. &ldquo;That is four months without playing games and then starting again. So we are trying to see this as an opportunity to make the difference between us and the rest of the teams.&rdquo;

Chihuahua, Chih.- El presidente de la Asociación de Usuarios de Riego del Estado de Chihuahua (Aurech), Salvador Alcantar Ortega se comunicó a El Diario esta mañana para denunciar públicamente que sigue la extracción masiva y desmedida de agua en la presa Luis L. León mejor conocida como &ldquo;El Granero&rdquo;, lo cual empieza a poner en situación crítica y de colapso dicho cuerpo de agua.</p>
<p>Manifestó que la extracción de 22 metros cúbicos por segundo, por parte de la Comisión Nacional del Agua, hace que el nivel del líquido esté en una situación crítica al borde de colapso ecológico.</p>
<p>Denunció que el vaso ya no llega a las compuertas y es extraída en la zona de las turbinas, de donde se envía al cauce con destino al Río Bravo para pagar el Tratado Internacional con Estados Unidos, aún cuando las lluvias no llegan y el plazo de cumplimiento vence hasta el mes de octubre de este año.</p>
<p>Con apoyo de lancheros hicieron mediciones y el fondo de la presa en algunos puntos está a sólo 15 metros de profundidad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Esto es insostenible, alguien tiene que hacer algo, estamos totalmente olvidados del gobierno federal y estatal&rdquo;, expresó.

<h3 id="ronaldos-legendary-status-at-real-madrid-built-on-taking-down-best-ever-barcelona">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ronaldo&rsquo;s legendary status at Real Madrid built on taking down best-ever Barcelona&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;Ronaldo&rsquo;s legendary status at Real Madrid built on taking down best-ever Barcelona&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Portuguese was key to reversing the fortunes of Los Blancos during his first three years at the club, believes former team-mate Esteban Granero</p>
<p>In 2009, had to face up to the fact that Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s had won an unprecedented treble and, in the process, charmed the world with their style of play.</p>
<p>With Lionel Messi breaking countless records, Madrid felt they had to react, and as such they forked out over €250 million (£222m/$358m) in an unprecedented summer window.</p>
<p>In came Kaka from , Karim Benzema from and duo Xabi Alonso and Alvaro Arbeloa. The cherry on the cake was the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo from in a world-record €94m (£80m/$135m) deal.</p>
<p>In total, Los Blancos added nine new faces to their squad, including 21-year-old midfielder Esteban Granero. A graduate of Madrid&rsquo;s academy, Granero returned to Santiago Bernabeu after Madrid exercised a €4.5m buy-back option having previously sold him to .</p>
<p>Having attended his first Madrid match at the age of five, the opportunity to represent his boyhood club was a dream come true for Granero. It was made even more special by the myriad of superstars he got the chance to train alongside, though one man - Ronaldo- was the standout.</p>
<p>The international spearheaded an immediate revival at Madrid, which culminated in them winning the league under Jose Mourinho in 2012.</p>
<p>And Granero believes that those first three seasons played a key role in Ronaldo becoming a legendary figure at the Bernabeu, with only Alfredo Di Stefano and Raul on the same level as the 35-year-old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was always afraid to even think or dream about playing in these kinds of games,&rdquo; Granero tells Goal of his return to Madrid in 2009. &ldquo;Then you blink and you are standing there on the pitch. The referee is ready to go so you are there and you have to perform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always supported Real Madrid and I went to the stadium ever since I was five and I started in the academy when I was nine. You are always in a place where you have to win when you play for them. I played 100 competitive games for them, which was a dream come true.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summer that I arrived at Real Madrid saw Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka, Xabi Alonso and Benzema come in. There were legends already in the team like Raul, Guti and Sergio Ramos. I was in the starting 11 almost every game so it was a dream. You had to be 100 per cent or more to be there in this fantastic team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I arrived at Real Madrid, we were fighting the best Barcelona ever in terms of their football. We fought them and we managed to win the against them and then the league.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the best Barca in history and we managed to win the league against them. We scored a record 121 goals in in 2011-12. It was the best season in my career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Ronaldo he added: &ldquo;Ronaldo had just signed for Real Madrid and I joined a month-and-a-half later. I was training with him and then playing with him. He made a huge impact in his 10 years at the club. His impact in terms of performance and leadership has been huge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only mention two comparable players before him in Raul and Di Stefano, and I think that he is up with them as one of the most important legends we have had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having gradually fallen down the pecking order at Madrid, Granero left his boyhood club for in 2012 before returning to La Liga to join two years later after an underwhelming spell in the Premier League.</p>
<p>It was there he lined up alongside a young Antoine Griezmann, who was beginning to become a household name in ahead of his career-changing move to .</p>
<p>And though international Griezmann is now plying his trade for Madrid&rsquo;s eternal rivals Barcelona, Granero admits that he still wants to see the forward do well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I arrived Griezmann was a very young kid. He was potentially very good,&rdquo; Granero says. &ldquo;You didn’t know he was going to be this good, though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing that you notice is that he loves football above everything else and you can see this. He is so different from when he is outside the pitch than inside the pitch. Outside, he is a joker and he provides a lot of fun for the dressing room. Then, when he is on the pitch, he becomes aggressive like a champion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something that all top players have. You could see it clearly. In my time there, he exploded. He had the ability, he is one of the top players in the world and I am happy to see him having played for big clubs. I always hope he makes good decisions and keeps pushing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now 32, Granero&rsquo;s career has taken two rather unconventional turns. Having left La Liga strugglers by mutual consent in January, he joined third-tier Marbella as they chase promotion to the Segunda Division.</p>
<p>Off the pitch, the former Spain Under-21 international founded his own artificial intelligence football company, Olocip, five years ago. They provide clubs and agencies with the ability to make better decisions, and are busier than ever following the coronavirus crisis as both the economics and public health situations need analysing to help predict the future.</p>
<p>And Granero is keen to further grow his business as CEO, even if some have questioned his decision to drop down two leagues while still having oil in the tank in terms of his playing career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been in this company for five years, so I have been running the company and playing at the same time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To me, football is important but not the only thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my passion and my first memories are playing football. Everything I have done has been focused on being a footballer. I wanted to always do my best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so happy to be at a great team and a great club. I came here with something in mind and not everyone understood my decision. Some consider it a waste that I play for them and this opinion is based on the division.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can have a very important role in leadership here to help us gain promotion from the third division. I didn’t want to spend my last years as an impact player on the bench in an easy retirement path. I wanted to face the biggest challenge of my career, which is to drop down myself to help this club go up. This is my passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a lot of free time as footballers and we can use it in different ways. I decided to launch a company in my free time and it is important for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most important thing that I have learned through all this is how important anticipation is. It is something that happens for a midfield player in the game, to see what happens before it happens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is also important for every decision in clubs, like a big signing. It is important that you can anticipate the performance of this player in a new context in order to make a decision. This is our vision and this is how we have been able to create solutions in terms of predictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the answers the clubs are looking for. They don’t want to know how they performed in the past, but they want to know how they will perform in the future and we need to be able to answer this question. This question can only be answered by artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been working harder than ever on the virus problem so we thought it would be important for society. It has been a huge impact and no one was ready for this kind of problem. To stop in this way is something critical to the industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think for one or two years there will be problems in the budgets for new signings. In this situation, clubs need to make smarter decisions, which is something you can do if you use artificial intelligence to power your process. This is a difficult situation for clubs but we are here to help.&rdquo;

<h3 id="la-empresa-de-granero-trabaja-en-predecir-cuándo-se-podrán-abrir-estadios">&ldquo;La empresa de Granero trabaja en predecir cuándo se podrán abrir estadios&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://est.zetaestaticos.com/diariolagrada/img/noticias/0/034/34155_1.jpg" alt="img">
La empresa del actual futbolista del Marbella y ex del Espanyol Esteban Granero, Olocip, está trabajando en modelos de predicción con inteligencia artificial sobre la evolución de los contagios de la COVID-19, simulando el efecto de abrir los estadios con limitaciones de aforo para detectar cuándo se podría hacer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La nueva situación son los estadios vacíos, nuestra misión a ese respecto es optimizar la solución. Hemos estimado cuáles son los contagiados reales, hemos hecho una proyección de esa evolución del virus en el futuro, y con ese modelo podemos simular nuevas medidas de distanciamiento y ver cómo afectan a la evolución del virus&rdquo;, explicó Granero durante un debate por videoconferencia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Con eso podemos simular cuánto puede afectar a la pandemia abrir los estadios, saber de qué manera limitar el aforo con la mayor seguridad y haciendo que la gente vaya a los estadios lo antes posible&rdquo;, agregó el jugador y empresario.</p>
<p>Granero participó en un debate por videoconferencia sobre innovación en el fútbol organizado por la empresa CASFID con el jugador del Alavés Manu García y el del Southampton Oriol Romeu, en el que habló sobre las actividades que está haciendo su compañía, especializada en tratamiento de datos e inteligencia artificial.</p>
<p>El que fuera futbolista del Real Madrid, la Real Sociedad y el Espanyol, entre otros clubes, explicó que en &ldquo;situaciones de incertidumbre&rdquo; como la que provoca la pandemia de coronavirus, el uso de los datos y la inteligencia artificial les está permitiendo trabajar en varias líneas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tenemos un escenario ideal para generar conocimiento sobre situaciones nuevas, por ejemplo cómo va a afectar los estadios vacíos en el rendimiento de jugadores. Podemos intentar hacer proyecciones con inteligencia artificial para anticiparnos y tener ventaja&rdquo;, detalló.</p>
<p>Preguntado por cuáles serán las tecnologías más importantes que se están aplicando en el mundo del fútbol, Granero señaló los avances tecnológicos en el tratamiento de la salud de los futbolistas, en la predicción y el tratamiento de lesiones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cada vez vamos a tener información más precisa sobre el estado de cada jugador, y la segunda línea es cómo tratamos esa información, cómo generamos conocimiento con todas esas variables para tomar acciones que minimicen el riesgo&rdquo;, sentenció el jugador y empresario tecnológico.
