<p>When will season 5 crash on Netflix?</p>
<p>It was announced earlier this year that season 5 will be the last season of the show. Luckily fans will have 16 episodes in this season, unlike the last season which had only 10 episodes. Also, it is rumoured that the last season will be split into two which means it will be released in two parts.

<p>The last season which is season 4 was released in May 2019. The season aired on Netflix as FOX cancelled the show in 2018.</p>
<p>What will fans get to see in season 5?</p>
<p>The last season ended with a shocking end. Lucifer played by Tom Ellis was returned to hell, parting with his love of life which is Chloe Decker played by Lauren German. Chloe the love of Lucifer made him vulnerable on earth and the longer he lived on earth, the demons would come after him and cause hell on earth</p>
<p>Lucifer’s fifth season can be plotted in many ways. Some performed and crew members have posted some clue on the internet about what is going to happen in season 5.</p>
<p>Maze series starring Lesley Ann-Brandt has confirmed that her role will face many enemies and demons in this season. She posted some pictures of her preparation for filming battle scenes.</p>
<p>Rumours regarding season 6 of the show?</p>
<p>Well, there are rumours that Netflix is planning to renew the show for season 6. Earlier it was announced that season 5 will be the end of the show and there will be no season 6. Looking at fame that Lucifer has got we might hope that Netflix will renew the show for season 6. While it is also being said that season 5 will split into two halves and it’s being expected that second half will be released as season 6. There is no official announcement regarding this so let’s not get our hopes high.
