[Fortnite](https://www.gamespot.com/fortnite/)'s Week 6 challenges of Season 2 are now live, and like last week's batch, these are themed around the Meowscles skin. That means that you'll need to do some cat\-like things to complete a few of the missions, such as **destroying dog houses**. If you're not sure where those can be found, we've put together the map and guide below to help you out.

## Where Are The Dog House Locations?

Dog houses aren't exactly prominent fixtures, so you may have some trouble tracking them down. Fortunately, there are quite a few of them scattered around the map, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find three and complete this challenge. Many can be found by houses in big residential areas like Pleasant Park and Holly Hedges, so you'll definitely want to narrow your search to places like that. To make it easier, we've marked down some areas where you can reliably find dog houses on the map below.

## How To Complete The Challenge

Now that we know where dog houses are, all you need to do is smash three of them and this challenge will be complete. Your best bet will probably be Holly Hedges; there are four dog houses in that area alone, and you only need to destroy three to clear the mission, so you can conceivably complete the challenge in one go.

A few other Week 6 challenges may prove to be tricky, so if you need help completing them, be sure to check out our guides on [where to use a secret passage](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-secret-passage-locations-map-week-6-chall/1100-6475277/) and [where to dance at Lake Canoe, Camp Cod, and Rainbow Rentals](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lake-canoe-camp-cod-rainbow-rentals-locat/1100-6475274/).

He’s a cat! Get it? We’ve already had a challenge where you had to eat fish, because cat’s like to eat fish. And now, in the second week of Mewoscles’ eponymous mischief, he turns his attention to dog houses, striking at the homes of his mortal enemies where they live. He must destroy dog houses for this week of challenges, as well as do a bunch of other stuff before we can get to his loyalty mission and finally choose Ghost or Shadow for the star skin of the season. I’ll be choosing Shadow, naturally, buit not before we finish up these challenges. So read on for a map, guide and location for where to destroy 3 dog houses.

There are a bunch of dog houses around the map, genreally found by homes and in suburban areas. I’m not going to list them all here, because that will be a little to tiring. Instead, we’ll focus on a POI where you can knock this whole challenge out in one go: Holly Hedges. Let’s take a look:
