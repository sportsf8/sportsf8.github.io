<p>Barcelona, now in second place in La Liga with Real Madrid in fantastic form, has a chance to move back into first place for the time being when they host Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday under the lights. Barca has 65 points, the same as Real, but they sit in second due to losing out on the head-to-head tiebreaker with their fierce rival. Just a draw will move them back into the top spot, but the goal here is three points.</p>

<p>Storylines</p>
<p>Barcelona: It&rsquo;s simple &ndash; if Real Madrid wins out, they will be champions. The thing is, with eight games to go, that&rsquo;s so unlikely. Expect Barca to come out sharp as they have in most matches since the break. Friday&rsquo;s 0-0 draw at Sevilla just wasn&rsquo;t their best performance, but you can safely expect them to score at least a couple goals here and get a much-needed win.</p>
<p>Athletic Bilbao: Athletic still has hopes of a Europa League spot despite sitting in 10th place, but a really tough schedule the rest of the way means they probably are going to need an upset either here or against Real Madrid, while sharpening their form in the other matches. To get a point here, they will have to clean things up in defense, limit mistakes by getting the ball out of the back quickly and have a little luck in the final third.</p>
<p>Prediction</p>
<p>Barca puts it away in the second half on a brilliant free kick. Pick: Barca 3, Athletic Bilbao 1

Watch Now: EPL Preview: Everton vs. Liverpool ( 1:02 )</p>
<p>The Merseyside Derby is set for Sunday as Premier League leaders and soon-to-be champions Liverpool visit rival Everton on Matchday 30 with a big opportunity, but Mohamed Salah starts this one on the bench. Liverpool is 22 points clear atop the table and expected to win the league this week, while Everton&rsquo;s European hopes are hanging by a thread. A win on Sunday combined with a loss by Manchester City on Monday would give Liverpool the title.</p>

<p>Storylines</p>
<p>Liverpool: If the Reds win their next two games, they will win the league. That includes Wednesday&rsquo;s match against Crystal Palace. But can they revert to their old form? Before the stoppage this team struggled, losing four of its last six in all competitions including twice to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. They&rsquo;ve had months to regain focus to finish out the season strong, and on Sunday we&rsquo;ll see if the sharpness is there with a healthy squad.</p>
<p>Everton: The Toffees were contending for European places before failing to win any of their last three. Those matches, however, were against Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea. With a favorable upcoming schedule after this one, a Europe League spot isn&rsquo;t out of the question, but they will need to get the defense more compact and quick to clear. Everton enters having conceded in each of its last seven games.</p>
<p>Prediction</p>
<p>The Reds win to move within a victory of winning the league. Pick: Liverpool 3, Everton 0

<p>Two teams with Champions League aspirations meet on Wednesday in the Premier League when fifth-place Manchester United welcomes seventh-place Sheffield United on Matchday 31.

<p>Storylines</p>
<p>Manchester United: That draw at Tottenham was important because it was good point on the road, but more importantly is we got to see how this team looks when both Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba play in the middle. Expect them both to start here as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks for the attacking creativity to increase dramatically. While United had 13 shots and six on frame, they didn&rsquo;t have a lot of great chances and needed a penalty to get a point.</p>
<p>Sheffield United: Has Sheffield hit a wall? A solid defense has led the way, but a poor attack is starting to cause serious problems when it comes to potential European qualification. The club hasn&rsquo;t scored a goal in either of its first two games post break (though they should have scored at Aston Villa). The 3-0 loss to Sheffield United on Sunday was alarming and filled with mistakes, and they have to clean that up here to get a result. Make no mistake &ndash; Sheffield has enough to go to Manchester United to win. They just have to be a whole lot sharper than they have in the last two games.</p>
<p>Prediction</p>
<p>The Red Devils keep applying the pressure on Chelsea with an important victory. Pick: Manchester United 2, Sheffield United 0

<p>Storylines</p>
<p>Liverpool: The club wants to celebrate the title as early as possible. However, the Reds enter this game lacking sharpness. Known for its attacking ability, Liverpool has failed to score in two out of its last three Premier League games. Expect Mohamed Salah to start this one after beginning the Everton clash on the bench.</p>
<p>Crystal Palace: Palace is comfortably in midtable, but a Europa League spot is not out of the question if the club can go on a little run. The team somehow has played more games (30) than it has scored goals (28). Those are numbers you would expect to leave a squad in the relegation zone, but Palace has grinded out result after result. Palace enters on a four-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Liverpool vs. Crystal Palace prediction</p>
<p>Liverpool finds its scoring touch and punishes Palace to move one point away from glory.</p>
<p>Pick: Liverpool 3, Crystal Palace 0
