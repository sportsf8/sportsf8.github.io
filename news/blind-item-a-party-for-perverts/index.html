<p>*Idris Elba hit up Twitter a day after revealing his positive coronavirus diagnosis to give fans an update on his health.</p>
<p>While he maintains he doesn’t have any symptoms, Elba has asthma so he’s worried how it will affect him since the virus targets the pulmonary system, PEOPLE reports.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course I’m worried,” he said on the livestream Q&amp;A. “I’m worried about having asthma and how that could make things complicated very quickly. I’m very worried about what’s happening in the world, if I’m honest. I’ve very worried about how we’re dealing it. Part of speaking publicly about it part of me coping about how the world is dealing with it.”</p>
<p>Elba has previously spoken about having asthma and revealed in a 2018 interview that he went to a school for kids with special needs for two years because of it.</p>
<p>“Asthma was quite a dominating factor in my life early on, and I still carry a pump now,” he told RadioTimes.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that was a weird two years of my life,” he said of the school. “I was asthmatic, but I was fine as long as I wasn’t running around. But here I was at this amazing school that was full of kids with very severe disabilities, and kids who were just straight-up bad. I was chucked in the middle of that.”</p>

<p>On Monday, the acclaimed actor announced on social media that he tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>“This morning I tested positive for Covid 19,” he wrote. “I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. Stay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how I’m doing No panic.”</p>
<p>The following day, the director-general of the World Health Organization has praised Idris for his “brave and powerful” message amid the pandemonium.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus took to Twitter to applaud Elba for speaking about COVID-19, “Take care and stay strong, @idriselba! I admire your brave and powerful message to the world. We’re all in this together. Solidarity will beat the #coronavirus,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In the livestream on Tuesday, Elba, 47, revealed that his wife, Sabrina, 30, is also in quarantine with him and awaiting her test results.</p>
<p>“Sabrina is doing good, she finally today managed to get a test,” he said. “Generally she’s fine. Nervous of course. Worried.”</p>
<p>Idris added, “Just for clarification, Sabrina wanted to be by my side. As much as we talked about her not coming to where I am, she did. She wanted to. I love her even more for it and I would do the same thing for her. Love is all you get, and who am I to turn down my wife’s support? As much as I want her to be safe, we calculated that risk and decided to be together.”</p>
<p>“I love Sabrina for standing by me and being in that video, it was the most important moment for me,” he continued.</p>
