Federal Labor MP Ged Kearney has revealed her father-in-law was the 30th person in Australia to die from coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ms Kearney took to social media to post a tribute to her late father-in-law, Mike, who died in Canberra Hospital on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 82-year-old was the ACT&rsquo;s second coronavirus death.</p>
<p>The Labor MP said her father-in-law had done his best to isolate but became sick suddenly, was admitted to hospital and died seven days later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact I believe he only went outside a couple of times in the whole month to shop,&rdquo; she said on Facebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We actually teased him because he had bought 5kgs of rice and 10 tins of chic peas and 10 cans of tomatoes - for just him and his lovely wife Wendy. Panic buying we said! But of course it was the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on to say that death in the time of COVID-19 is hard as Mike&rsquo;s Canberra family, including his wife, are in isolation and must grieve on their own.</p>
<p>Ms Kearney also thanked Australians for doing the right thing by staying at home during the pandemic but urged people to not become immune to the numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every death is sad and felt deeply by someone. I know most people are finding kindness and helping out at every turn, and I am feeling the caring nature of our community first hand,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you know what you must do to curb the deaths, I don&rsquo;t need to tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please - Just do it, and keep doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People in Australia must stay at least 1.5 metres away from others and gatherings are limited to two people unless you are with your family or household.</p>
<p>If you believe you may have contracted the virus, call your doctor (don’t visit) or contact the national Coronavirus Health Information Hotline on 1800 020 080. If you are struggling to breathe or experiencing a medical emergency, call 000.</p>

ACT records second coronavirus death as MP Ged Kearney reveals family connection</p>
<p>Updated</p>
<p>Federal Labor politician Ged Kearney has revealed her father-in-law was the 30th person to die of coronavirus in Australia — saying she fears that as the death toll climbs, people may become desensitised to the trauma of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Key points: The 82-year-old man is the second person in Canberra whose death is linked to COVID-19</p>
<p>Labor MP Ged Kearney says her father-in-law became ill suddenly and died a week later</p>
<p>There are still no identified cases of community transmission in the ACT</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s death at Canberra Hospital — the second coronavirus death in the ACT — was announced yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But please don&rsquo;t let these figures just become nameless statistics to you,&rdquo; Ms Kearney wrote on a public Facebook post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, that 30th person was Mike, my father-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Kearney said Mike had been doing his best to self-isolate, and she believed he had only left the house twice to do shopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We actually teased him because he had bought 5kgs of rice and 10 tins of chickpeas and 10 cans of tomatoes — for just him and his lovely wife Wendy,&rdquo; Ms Kearney wrote.</p>
<p>She said he suddenly became ill and died seven days later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Now] Wendy, nearly 80, must grieve on her own, in their house alone, away from hugs and kisses and tears and drinks and friends and family,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart breaks for her and her kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t become immune to the statistics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Call to maintain social distancing</p>
<p>Announcing two new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canberra yesterday, ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said Mike&rsquo;s death was proof of the danger posed to vulnerable and elderly people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is especially to protect these vulnerable groups that we all need to take the physical distancing measures we are implementing seriously,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man had some underlying health issues which were complicated by COVID-19 infection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike was the second person in Canberra to die of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Another three cases were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the total number of people in Canberra to have contracted the disease to 96.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On behalf of the ACT Government and our entire community I extend the deepest family to his family and friends,&rdquo; ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said.</p>
<p>Ms Stephen-Smith said people need to continue social distancing, avoiding non-essential outings and practicing good hygiene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all know how to do this now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ms Stephen-Smith noted the Canberra Relief Network was in place to support those who needed help with food or other essential goods.</p>
<p>She said 1,400 food hampers had already been delivered to charities for distribution to those in need.</p>
<p>Still no identified cases of community transmission</p>
<p>Dr Coleman said one of the new cases was under investigation, and that the person had no travel history.</p>
<p>She said the investigation was still in its early stages.</p>
<p>The ACT has not yet identified any instances of community transmission, however, one case has remained unresolved for about a week.</p>
<p>Dr Coleman said ACT Health was awaiting the results of a small number of tests that would identify whether it was a case of community transmission before the end of this week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to reassure the community that we are actively looking for community transmission in the ACT,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>From tomorrow the ACT will expand testing to a random selection of people at testing sites who would otherwise not meet testing criteria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This increased surveillance will help to give us an even better insight,&rdquo; Dr Coleman said.</p>
<p>Of the 96 diagnosed cases in Canberra, 28 have already recovered.</p>
