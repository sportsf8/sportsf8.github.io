<h3 id="cats-likely-sailed-with-the-vikings-genetic-study-shows-cutest-cat-contest">&ldquo;Cats likely sailed with the Vikings, genetic study shows: Cutest Cat contest&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/2NE-nut27OVpDjQvRb9BeKTjSqg=/1280x0/smart/advancelocal-adapter-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width2048/img/best/photo/2017/02/20/x00117-9jpg-5942af02f5fff06e.jpg" alt="img">

<p>It appears cats have been sailing for centuries. New genetic studies show most American cats may have descended from cats bought here by Viking sailors. This is Koozya, who lives aboard the 50-foot wooden sailboat Saint Paul. Her owners, Mike and Irene Pobor, have been sailing the world since 1991. She has to wear a leash on land, which is one of the reasons the Seattle-born cat prefers life at sea. The floating feline also likes the menu - fresh fish. (Scott Shaw, the Plain Dealer)</p>
<p>CLEVELAND, Ohio - How did your cat&rsquo;s ancestors make it to America? A new study by French geneticists show they likely came aboard a Viking ship.</p>
<p>Eva-Maria Geigl, an evolutionary geneticist at the Institut Jacques Monod in Paris, says thousands of years ago, cats were likely hopping continents with farmers, ancient mariners and Viking expeditions.</p>
<p>Geigl&rsquo;s findings are in line with those of the University of California at Davis&rsquo; Veterinary Genetic&rsquo;s Testing Laboratory, the largest U.S. producer of feline DNA testing kits for pet owners. UC-Davis uses 170 test results to determine a cat&rsquo;s ancestry. Their data, posted on their website, says most American felines do have Western European origins.</p>
<p>The generally accepted hypothesis among breeders is the Maine Coon is descended from breeds brought overseas by English sea-farers or 11th-century Norsemen (the Vikings). The connection to the Norsemen is seen in the strong resemblance of the Maine Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat, another breed that is said to have traveled with the Vikings.</p>
<p>Geigl&rsquo;s is the first large-scale study of ancient feline DNA - sequenced the DNA of 209 ancient feline specimens, which lived between 15,000 and the eighteenth century. The specimens were found in archeological sites in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p>Geigl released her findings last fall.</p>
<p>The study, reported in Popular Science Magazine and Science Alert, reveals cats likely experienced two waves of world-wide expansion.</p>
<p>When the team looked at mitochondrial DNA - genetic information passed from the mother only - they found wild cats from the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean shared a similar lineage, suggesting they spread through agricultural communities, attracted by the mice, which ate the grains produced by farmers.</p>
<p>The second wave of expansion has been attributed to ancient sea-farers, who encouraged their presence aboard ship to keep the rodent population in check. Geigl cites cat remains found in a Viking site in northern Germany.</p>
<p>Geigl said she hopes to continue her research in ancient cat DNA to reveal more about domestication, spread and breeding.</p>
<p>If you are curious about your cat&rsquo;s ancestry, test kits run anywhere from $40 to $120 and can be ordered on the UC-Davis website. A random survey of local pet stores showed no local retailers who carried the kits.

<h3 id="why-is-buying-pet-food-so-hard">&ldquo;Why Is Buying Pet Food So Hard?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/R4YgPs_mgLLTHHC5ZUArusG6rn0=/0x304:3869x2319/960x500/media/img/mt/2018/08/RTX33B4Q/original.jpg" alt="img">
It makes a kind of logical sense. Cats eat mice. They are obligate carnivores, so Wild Earth didn’t want to make koji cat food. (In particular, cats need an amino acid called taurine. It comes from meat, but can also be synthesized and added to plant-based kibble.) And mouse cells happen to be some of the best studied thanks to the use of lab mice in science. But lab-grown mouse meat is not a particularly appetizing idea. Pet-food companies advertise their wares as simulacra of human food: chicken and rice medley, purrrfect paella, o’fishally scampi. It’s about appealing to the human as much as the pet.</p>
<p>After Bethencourt boasted of eating his own dog food, I asked if he would eat the mouse meat, and his enthusiasm noticeably cooled. “You know what? Yes,” he said after hesitating. “Once it’s serum-free, I’ll taste it.” (Mammalian cells often require serum derived from fetuses inside slaughtered cows to grow in a lab. Growing cells without it has been a big hurdle for lab-grown meat.) “It doesn’t look particularly appetizing,” he admitted. “It has a kind of runny texture.”</p>
<p>The mouse-meat project has sparked a backlash from vegans, who left a rash of one-star reviews on Wild Earth’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Lab-grown meat—for humans or pets—remains controversial among vegans. Bethencourt has staked out what he says is a pragmatic stance: It’ll reduce the number of animals who have to die for food. For other vegans though, it comes with a more fundamental problem. Matt Johnson, an organizer for the animal-rights group Direct Action Everywhere (whose members made headlines last year by wrapping themselves in fake blood and plastic to protest a Berkeley butcher shop), put it this way: “It still reinforces this notion that animals exist as commodities, that they exist as an object for us to consume.” He feeds his cat vegan food from Ami.</p>
<p>Tony Buffington, a vet at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told me cats and dogs can certainly stay healthy on a vegan diet that contains proper nutrition. (The Association of American Feed Control sets nutrient profiles for cat and dog food.) The nutritional needs of “neutered adult sedentary animals”—to use his words—are not super complicated. But I could tell he still found the idea a bit ridiculous. “There’s an ethical challenge to making others the means to one’s end. To me that’s what people are doing,” he said. “When they’re feeding dogs and cats vegan foods, they’re making dogs and cats abide by their own personal philosophical beliefs.” He also took issue with the term pet parent. “Maybe it’s because I’m a human parent and an animal owner,” he said, “and I’m old.”</p>
<p>He has a point about simply being old. In the past few decades, pets have become ever more cherished and expensive members of the family. Americans collectively spent nearly $70 billion on their pets in 2017, compared to $17 billion in 1994, according to the American Pet Products Association. Pet-food sales have also doubled since 2000, much of that growth in expensive premium brands. Our pets are eating more expensively than ever, and they’re taking up our organic, raw, vegan, and grain-free diets.

<h3 id="ralph-ellisons-slow-burning-art">&ldquo;Ralph Ellison’s Slow-Burning Art&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ddebf87965d040008cbbdec/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/191209_r35557.jpg" alt="img">
There is a literature dedicated to fire—think of Dante, or Dylan Thomas’s “Refusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London”—and there is a literature consumed by fire quite literally. A seller of rare books I know once issued an entire catalogue devoted to books given over to the flames. The history of burnt offerings is long and varied, but among its highlights is William Carlos Williams’s first book, “Poems” (1909), most copies of which were destroyed when the shed they were stored in burned down. (Given that Williams was known to be rather ashamed of his début, one wonders if he had a hand in the conflagration.) There’s also Fire!!, the upstart effort of a younger Harlem Renaissance set that included Wallace Thurman and Zora Neale Hurston, who jokingly called themselves the Niggerati. The single-issue magazine lived up to its name when its unsold stock caught fire soon after publication. Nancy Cunard’s 1934 anthology, “Negro,” was—like many other titles—destroyed by the London Blitz. Still others fell victim to the ritualistic book burnings in Nazi Germany that provided a reminder to Americans of how fragile our freedoms are (though not enough of a reminder to stop white students in Georgia from burning a book by the Cuban-American author Jennine Capó Crucet, earlier this fall). Yet fire has effects that aren’t easily controlled. As my bookseller friend knew, its ravages often leave the remaining copies of a work all the more valuable.</p>
<p>Then there’s Ralph Ellison. In 1967, a fire at his country house destroyed a portion of his second novel in progress—the much anticipated and already belated follow-up to his 1952 début, “Invisible Man.” Ellison’s account of the damage the fire caused only grew in time; as his biographer Arnold Rampersad points out, the blaze came to be depicted as the main reason that Ellison never completed the novel, despite decades of labor and masses of manuscript pages. He measured it once for an interviewer: well over a foot and a half of epic. A relatively cohesive version was assembled from drafts by John F. Callahan, his literary executor, and issued posthumously as “Juneteenth,” in 1999; a decade later, Callahan and Adam Bradley crafted a thousand-page volume of fuller overlapping fragments, published as “Three Days Before the Shooting . . .” Now Callahan and Marc C. Conner have brought out “Selected Letters” (Random House), running almost as long. Bearing in mind the epistolary origins of the novel as a literary invention, one can regard the results—sixty years of correspondence progressing to a narrative—as another Ellisonian magnum opus, one necessarily unfinished.</p>
<p>“Selected Letters” is wisely divided by decade, starting with the nineteen-thirties, and Ellison’s voice is urgent from the start. The volume begins with letters home to Oklahoma, to his mother, Ida Bell, whom Ellison, newly matriculated at the Tuskegee Institute, in 1933, variously begs and bosses around for things he needs. The letters are concerned with money, or, rather, its absence. Young Ellison worries over status, too, not so much asking his mother for help as demanding it: “Send me that money by money order and make it thirty dollars if possible.” He explains, “I travel with the richer gang here and this clothes problem is a pain.” Shoes, a coat, old suits, his class ring: the requests to his mother and stepfather repeat like a scratched record that still itches. “Don’t forget the uniform, it’s important” is a typical postscript.</p>
<p>Throughout the letters from the nineteen-thirties, Ellison shares the nation’s preoccupations: it’s the throes of the Depression, after all, and, like the popular music of the period, he’s nostalgic for better times in a place he doesn’t particularly wish to return to. Still, he writes his younger brother, Herbert, to send his regards to the “Dear Folks” back home: “Tell Dr. Youngblood that if he came here he would be married in a month. Tell him they are beautiful and brown-skinned.” If not quite “Black Is Beautiful”—a phrase that Ellison, who preferred the term “Negro” well into the nineteen-seventies, didn’t use—his homegrown aesthetic and influences are evident early.</p>
<p>While an undergraduate, he studied music as a trumpet player; according to his authorial mythology, he throws his horn over for writing, in which he finds a further music. But Ellison, we learn, also had a stint as a sculptor, an equally resonant metaphor for his later craft. In an April, 1936, letter to Herbert, he writes:</p>
<p>Sculpture is very difficult to photograph and though one piece has been attempted it was unsuccessful. No I am not in the school of music this year. I missed out because of many matters, and have had to take the regular college course. . . . I noticed how much you had improved in your last letter; that’s fine but watch your tenses and endings, don’t write fool when you mean fooling or fooled. All it takes is time and good habits.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1936, Ellison sets out for New York, where he has the good fortune of meeting Langston Hughes in the lobby of the Harlem Y.M.C.A., where both are staying; Hughes, as he would do for many aspiring black writers, gives Ellison advice and connects him with other black practitioners. Soon Ellison is addressing Hughes as “Lang,” and even stays with his adoptive aunt. “I’m following your formula with success, you know, ‘be nice to people and let them pay for meals,’ ” he writes Hughes. “It helps so very much.” He also thanks Hughes for sending him to Richmond Barthé, the African-American sculptor, who “has taken me as his first pupil much to my surprise and joy.” By the later years of the decade, Ellison is finding his way, never shy about his likes and his dislikes. He tells his mother that he prefers Barthé to the better-known sculptor Augusta Savage, “who offered to let me work at her studio, but was too busy to give much instruction.” (If he had joined her, he could have worked alongside Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden, and Charles Alston in the robust artistic community that Savage cultivated at the Y and at the 135th Street Library, across the street, which later became the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.) The letters reveal an artist searching for a form that could carry his vision of black life in all its dimensions.

<h3 id="in-southern-appalachia-searching-for-the-big-bang-of-country-music">&ldquo;In Southern Appalachia, Searching for the ‘Big Bang’ of Country Music&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/25/travel/19Country-Music5/19Country-Music5-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
While the rest of America was roaring to jazz during the ’20s, in a small corner of the South, where back roads snake through early-morning mist and porches are used for melody-making as much as sitting in rocking chairs, another form of music was quietly taking root. In the heart of southern Appalachia, at the convergence of northeast Tennessee and southwest Virginia, a set of early recording sessions, conducted by a New York City record producer over two epoch-making weeks in the summer of 1927, would catapult the careers of the Carter Family from Virginia, the “first family of country music,” and the Mississippi singer and songwriter Jimmie Rodgers, who would become known as “the father of country music.”</p>
<p>The recordings would become an inflection point in the history of what we now refer to as country music. And though musicologists may take issue with the assigning of its origin to any one time or place, the famous Bristol Sessions of 1927 were influential enough to be widely referred to as the “big bang” of country music, a topic that the documentarian Ken Burns is taking a broad look at in an upcoming series on PBS.</p>
<p>In April, I headed east of Nashville to the place where those early sessions were recorded, and where the music they gave birth to are celebrated: the Tri-Cities of Kingsport, Johnson City and Bristol, which is a two-state town straddling the border of Tennessee and Virginia. In 1998, Congress named Bristol the “Birthplace of Country Music.” Sixteen years later, the Virginia side built the 24,000-square-foot Birthplace of Country Music Museum, a sleek Smithsonian Institution affiliate and part of the nonprofit Birthplace of Country Music organization, which, during the third week of September, hosts the Bristol Rhythm &amp; Roots Reunion, one of the largest assemblages of country music, Americana, roots and bluegrass in the United States.

<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/28/11/Bakr-Trump.jpg" alt="img">
During a speech in Chicago to police brass from across the US, Donald Trump attacked the city&rsquo;s police chief who is boycotting the visit from the president, who used his address to law enforcement to blame so-called &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo; cities for violent crime rates.</p>
<p>Mr Trump accused Chicago Police Chief Eddie Johnson of &ldquo;not doing his job&rdquo; in a city that the president has often ridiculed as a &ldquo;war zone&rdquo; for its high murder rate. There have been 425 homicides in Chicago so far this year.</p>
<p>He also said Chief Johnson is putting &ldquo;criminals and illegal aliens before the city of Chicago&rdquo; and that &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo; cities are knowingly releasing jailed immigrants accused of violent crime.</p>

<p>His appeal to law enforcement arrived that morning after he was roundly booed during Game 5 of baseball’s World Series in DC on Sunday, with fans of the Washington Nationals and Houston Astros chanting “Lock him up!” as “Veterans for Impeachment” signs were held aloft by spectators, prompting the president to leave the stadium early.</p>
<p>His unwelcome appearance at the game followed what should have been a triumphant moment for his administration in the announcement of the death of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a US-led raid that saw the terror group leader cornered in a dead-end tunnel in Syria. The president assured the world the terrorist had died “crying and screaming”.</p>
<p>In a Monday press conference, the president&rsquo;s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mick Milley said he doesn&rsquo;t know where Mr Trump got that account of the operation.</p>
<p>The president shared a photo on Twitter of an Army Delta force dog that was critical in the operation, according to Mr Trump. The dog&rsquo;s name is still classified. General Milley said it returned to its military unit.</p>
<p>When leading Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer demanded to know why Congress had not been briefed on the operation in advance at a time when the White House’s approach to foreign policy is already under intense scrutiny, vice president Mike Pence squirmed and struggled to answer the question on Fox News.</p>
<p>Mr Trump later explained that the administration was going to notify Congress but &ldquo;we decided not to do that because Washington leaks like I’ve never seen before. There’s no country in the world that leaks like we do, and Washington is a leaking machine.&rdquo;</p>
