<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Managepay Systems Bhd (MPay) has proposed to undertake a private placement of up to 20% of the total number of its issued shares to raise funds to strengthen its financial technologies, including the development of systems for a licensed digital bank.</p>
<p>Loss-making MPay is a provider of end-to-end electronic payment solutions for banks and financial institutions, merchants and card issuers.</p>
<p>In a filing with Bursa Malaysia on July 30, MPay said the issue price of the private placement would be determined later, based on the volume weighted average market price of MPay shares for the five market days prior to the price-dixing date, with a discount of not more than 10%.</p>
<p>Based on an indicative issue price of RM0.1275 per placement share, the gross proceeds would amount to RM18.12mil.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the proceeds will be used for a financial technology platform, as well as developing and customising systems for a licensed digital bank.</p>
<p>Another 27.4% of the proceeds would be for point-of-sale terminal projects, and another 20.4% for vertical payment solutions which focuses on park-and-pay management systems and a health-tracking application.</p>
<p>MPay also stated that the private placement allowed the company to raise funds without incurring interest expenses, as compared to bank borrowings.</p>
<p>Post-private placement, group managing director and CEO Datuk Chew Chee Seng(pic) – who is the largest shareholder – would see his 25.36% stake dropping to 21.13%.</p>
<p>“This would dilute my own shareholding.</p>
<p>“As such, this is a very strategic move to bring onboard a strong partner to strengthen our technologies and financial position, ” Chew told StarBiz.</p>
<p>He said the company was in talks with a few strategic parties, and aims to complete the private placement within this year.</p>
<p>To recap, on July 27, MPay had announced that it was teaming up with Singapore-based Passion Venture Capital Pte Ltd (PVC) to apply for a licence to operate a digital bank in Malaysia.</p>
<p>MPay said its subsidiary, ManagePay Services Sdn Bhd, had entered into a joint venture (JV) with PVC to set up a company that would be applying for the digital bank from Bank Negara.</p>
<p>MPay will own a 51% stake in the JV company, while the remaining 49% will be held by PVC.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, MPay said PVC is required to deposit or raise funds of close to RM100mil for the JV company within three months from the date of agreement.</p>
<p>MPay’s shares closed two sen higher at 15.5 sen yesterday, with some 59.77 million shares being traded.

<p>The list of stocks with momentum is generated using a proprietary mathematical algorithm highlighting stocks with a build-up in trading volume and price. The algorithm differentiates between stocks that exhibit positive (+ve) momentum and negative (-ve) momentum.</p>
<p>This list is not a buy or sell recommendation. It merely tells you which stocks are seeing higher than normal volume and price movements.</p>
<p>The share price may move up or down from this point. But the “+ve” (suggesting a rising price trend on volume) and “-ve” (suggesting a falling price trend on volume) indicators should give readers a better idea of what the market is buying and when to sell. Note also that momentum generally only persists for a short period of time.</p>
<p>However, each stock has an accompanying fundamental score and valuation score to help readers evaluate the attractiveness of the stocks, if they want to ride the momentum.

KUALA LUMPUR (July 27): ManagePay Systems Bhd (MPay) said it is forming a joint venture (JV) company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary ManagePay Services Sdn Bhd (MPSB) together with Singapore-based Passion Venture Capital Pte Ltd (PVC), to participate in digital banking in Malaysia.</p>
<p>In a bourse filing today, MPay said it has inked an agreement to set up a JV company to procure a digital bank licence from Bank Negara Malaysia to operate a digital bank via the JV. MPSB will hold 51% in the JV company, while PVC will hold the remaining 49%. Investment in the JV company will be fully funded by PVC, said MPay.</p>
<p>PVC is a venture capital fund management firm registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore. &ldquo;PVC invests in start-ups and provides seed money for companies with the potential to grow and tap into the vast global consumer markets,&rdquo; MPay said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;PVC brings the ability to raise the funds required for the digital bank and also a wealth of experience in banking and deep knowledge to enhance banking offerings; therefore, placing the JV company as a formidable forerunner for the digital bank licence application for Malaysia, and subsequently the region of Southeast Asia,&rdquo; MPay said.</p>
<p>As for MPay itself, the group said it is equipped with the infrastructure, processes, and operational know-how required to seamlessly transform into a full-fledged digital bank, particularly to cater to the same micro, small and medium enterprises market.</p>
<p>Shares in MPay closed unchanged at 10 sen today, giving it a total market capitalisation of RM71 million.

Generally speaking long term investing is the way to go. But unfortunately, some companies simply don’t succeed. To wit, the ManagePay Systems Berhad (KLSE:MPAY) share price managed to fall 62% over five long years. That’s not a lot of fun for true believers. And we doubt long term believers are the only worried holders, since the stock price has declined 28% over the last twelve months. On top of that, the share price is down 14% in the last week. This could be related to the recent financial results – you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.</p>
<p>See our latest analysis for ManagePay Systems Berhad</p>
<p>Because ManagePay Systems Berhad made a loss in the last twelve months, we think the market is probably more focussed on revenue and revenue growth, at least for now. When a company doesn’t make profits, we’d generally expect to see good revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one does expect good top-line growth.</p>
<p>In the last half decade, ManagePay Systems Berhad saw its revenue increase by 9.7% per year. That’s a fairly respectable growth rate. The share price, meanwhile, has fallen 17% compounded, over five years. That suggests the market is disappointed with the current growth rate. That could lead to an opportunity if the company is going to become profitable sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).</p>
<p>It’s probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It’s always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on ManagePay Systems Berhad’s earnings, revenue and cash flow.</p>
<p>A Different Perspective</p>
<p>We regret to report that ManagePay Systems Berhad shareholders are down 28% for the year. Unfortunately, that’s worse than the broader market decline of 8.0%. Having said that, it’s inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year’s performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 17% over the last half decade. We realise that Buffett has said investors should ‘buy when there is blood on the streets’, but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It’s always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand ManagePay Systems Berhad better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We’ve spotted 6 warning signs for ManagePay Systems Berhad you should be aware of, and 2 of them are a bit unpleasant.</p>
<p>Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.</p>

(Alliance News) - Mi-Pay Group on Tuesday said its shares were cancelled from trading on the London Stock Exchange effective immediately.</p>
<p>In January, shareholders in the mobile payment and payment fraud management firm voted in favour of resolutions to sell its wholly-owned trading subsidiary Mi-Pay Ltd to Alphacomm BV for GBP792,000 and to cancel its shares from trading.</p>
<p>The sale of Mi-Pay Ltd completed last month.</p>
<p>The firm in January scheduled a meeting for Tuesday to consider resolutions regarding the liquidation of the company. If the resolutions are passed, liquidation is expected to commence immediately.</p>
<p>Mi-Pay said it will return capital to its shareholders via a members&rsquo; voluntary liquidation. It said it expects to have about GBP700,000 cash resources to make total distributions to its shareholders, equivalent to 1.5p a share.</p>

We’re definitely into long term investing, but some companies are simply bad investments over any time frame. We don’t wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. Spare a thought for those who held Mi-Pay Group plc (LON:MPAY) for five whole years – as the share price tanked 78%. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 21%. Furthermore, it’s down 25% in about a quarter. That’s not much fun for holders.</p>
<p>See our latest analysis for Mi-Pay Group</p>
<p>Given that Mi-Pay Group didn’t make a profit in the last twelve months, we’ll focus on revenue growth to form a quick view of its business development. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually expect strong revenue growth. As you can imagine, fast revenue growth, when maintained, often leads to fast profit growth.</p>
<p>In the last half decade, Mi-Pay Group saw its revenue increase by 3.4% per year. That’s far from impressive given all the money it is losing. Nonetheless, it’s fair to say the rapidly declining share price (down 26%, compound, over five years) suggests the market is very disappointed with this level of growth. We’d be pretty cautious about this one, although the sell-off may be too severe. We’d recommend focussing any further research on the likelihood of profitability in the foreseeable future, given the muted revenue growth.</p>

<p>A Different Perspective</p>
<p>Investors in Mi-Pay Group had a tough year, with a total loss of 21%, against a market gain of about 9.2%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn’t as bad as the 26% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We’d need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. You might want to assess this data-rich visualization of its earnings, revenue and cash flow.</p>

<h3 id="we-think-managepay-systems-berhad-klsempay-needs-to-drive-business-growth-carefully">&ldquo;We Think ManagePay Systems Berhad (KLSE:MPAY) Needs To Drive Business Growth Carefully&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.simplywall.st/asset/industry/8031000-choice1-main-header/1585186592389" alt="img">
Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down. For example, although software-as-a-service business Salesforce.com lost money for years while it grew recurring revenue, if you held shares since 2005, you’d have done very well indeed. But while the successes are well known, investors should not ignore the very many unprofitable companies that simply burn through all their cash and collapse.</p>
<p>So, the natural question for ManagePay Systems Berhad (KLSE:MPAY) shareholders is whether they should be concerned by its rate of cash burn. In this article, we define cash burn as its annual (negative) free cash flow, which is the amount of money a company spends each year to fund its growth. First, we’ll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.</p>
<p>Check out our latest analysis for ManagePay Systems Berhad</p>
<p>When Might ManagePay Systems Berhad Run Out Of Money?</p>
<p>A cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. When ManagePay Systems Berhad last reported its balance sheet in December 2019, it had zero debt and cash worth RM10m. In the last year, its cash burn was RM14m. That means it had a cash runway of around 9 months as of December 2019. To be frank, this kind of short runway puts us on edge, as it indicates the company must reduce its cash burn significantly, or else raise cash imminently. Depicted below, you can see how its cash holdings have changed over time.</p>
<p>How Well Is ManagePay Systems Berhad Growing?</p>
<p>On balance, we think it’s mildly positive that ManagePay Systems Berhad trimmed its cash burn by 17% over the last twelve months. And arguably the operating revenue growth of 68% was even more impressive. It seems to be growing nicely. In reality, this article only makes a short study of the company’s growth data. This graph of historic revenue growth shows how ManagePay Systems Berhad is building its business over time.</p>
<p>How Easily Can ManagePay Systems Berhad Raise Cash?</p>
<p>ManagePay Systems Berhad seems to be in a fairly good position, in terms of cash burn, but we still think it’s worthwhile considering how easily it could raise more money if it wanted to. Generally speaking, a listed business can raise new cash through issuing shares or taking on debt. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. By comparing a company’s annual cash burn to its total market capitalisation, we can estimate roughly how many shares it would have to issue in order to run the company for another year (at the same burn rate).</p>
<p>ManagePay Systems Berhad has a market capitalisation of RM50m and burnt through RM14m last year, which is 28% of the company’s market value. That’s fairly notable cash burn, so if the company had to sell shares to cover the cost of another year’s operations, shareholders would suffer some costly dilution.</p>
<p>So, Should We Worry About ManagePay Systems Berhad’s Cash Burn?</p>
<p>Even though its cash runway makes us a little nervous, we are compelled to mention that we thought ManagePay Systems Berhad’s revenue growth was relatively promising. We don’t think its cash burn is particularly problematic, but after considering the range of factors in this article, we do think shareholders should be monitoring how it changes over time. Separately, we looked at different risks affecting the company and spotted 6 warning signs for ManagePay Systems Berhad (of which 3 make us uncomfortable!) you should know about.</p>
