<p>When bone china was developed by English potters during the mid-18th century, it was an attempt to build on the long-standing porcelain tradition invented in China. East Asia’s hard-paste porcelain was at once sturdy and delicate, and known for its striking decorative designs. Ceramicists in Britain struggled to mimic this style of craftsmanship, so their porcelain was softer, until they added bone ash—a mix of animal bone and calcium phosphate.</p>
<p>Though bone china began as an interest in durability, ceramicist Gregg Moore has reimagined the art form with sustainability in mind. His “Grass-Fed Bone China” builds on the farm-to-table ethos of many artisanal restaurants today and incorporates animal bone remnants unused by the kitchen at the Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Tarrytown, New York—an institution whose “nose-to-tail” food philosophy centers on exploring creative ways of eating an entire animal once it leaves the farm. Even after Moore’s pottery is created, it remains within the ecosystem of the restaurant: Blue Hill’s table settings feature the artist’s bowls, plates, and cups.</p>
<p>The connection between crockery and cooking is natural—one is designed to hold the other. But Moore’s ceramics are designed to be a meta-commentary on food waste, as they are made from the very cows that produce the restaurant’s dairy and meat. The unglazed, marrow-white objects are primarily made from animal femurs, which are cleaned and then fired. This “calcination” transforms the bones from living matter into the calcium phosphate that potter Josiah Spode in Staffordshire first worked with several centuries ago. Next, the hard paste is mixed with water in a mill, which becomes a liquid slip, and then it’s molded and modeled into the thin-walled, semi-translucent tableware placed at each setting.</p>
<p>Moore’s Grass-Fed Bone China is unlikely to stain and difficult to break. During the firing process, the ceramicist’s symmetrical forms become organically warped and imperfect, much like the once-living animals that bore them. But beyond the aesthetic qualities of Moore’s porcelain dishes, the cows used in Blue Hill’s food (which comes from the Blue Hill farm in Massachusetts) are grass-fed and free-range, which makes the resulting pottery full of material to study, like the environment the animals lived in.</p>
<p>This tableware is the result of an ongoing, five-year collaboration between Moore and Dan Barber, Blue Hill’s head chef and co-owner. Previously, they worked together on plates that were texturized using pecking animals from the restaurant’s farm.

As the chef and co-owner of the pioneering Hudson Valley farm-to-table restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns, Dan Barber is besieged by artisans trying to collaborate with him. But one day, in the spring of 2015, he heard from a Pennsylvania ceramist named Gregg Moore and instantly knew that this call was different. “He started talking to me in a way that I hadn’t heard anybody who designs anything — especially plateware — talk to me,” Barber says. “Just asking me, not in an accusatory way, ‘If you’re thinking about food and the way it’s grown and raised and everything that goes into the creation of a plate, why are you not thinking about the plate itself?’”</p>
<p>Together, the chef and potter conceived the purest distillation of the farm’s whole-animal philosophy: china made from the bones of its own cows. Barber would raise the cows on pasture, as always, and after slaughtering them for meat, he’d give the bones (mostly femurs, their marrow consumed) to Moore, who would transform them into tableware. The finished china, which comes in three pieces — a plate, a bowl and a water cup — is so light and white that it seems to float. When it became the restaurant’s default table setting earlier this year, guests couldn’t keep their hands off it. “Everyone immediately grabs the plate and touches it, looks at it, turns it around,” says Philippe Gouze, the restaurant’s director of operations. “It’s an instant attraction.”

<h3 id="blue-is-the-warmest-colour-spodes-200th-anniversary">&ldquo;Blue is the warmest colour: Spode&rsquo;s 200th anniversary&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2016/11/spode.jpg" alt="img">
As Spode’s iconic Blue Italian pattern turns 200, Annunciata Walton looks back at its history, how it introduced bone china to the world and how it has recently been saved from the brink of ruin.</p>
<p>What country kitchen exists without the adornment of English bone china? Blue- and-white porcelain, epitomised by Spode’s enduringly popular Blue Italian, which celebrates its bicentenary this year, is a ubiquitous part of our heritage and national psyche. as we eat our toast and marmalade from blue-and-white plates and sip coffee from a bone-china mug, we’re surrounded by crumbling ruins, ethereal flowers, twittering birds and Oriental curlicues. If Staffordshire is the birthplace of our beloved cups and saucers—it is, after all, the international capital of crockery—then Spode is the Stoke-born king.</p>
<p>By the early 18th century, the area around what is now Stoke-on-Trent —a conglomeration of six separate towns (the Potteries), united in 1910 and elevated to the rank of city in 1925—was well known as a pottery centre. This was nothing new—the potters of the 1700s were simply doing as the Romans had done, and the Saxons, too. they’d all cottoned onto the fact that the abundance of coal and clay in the local soil plus the easy access to the River Trent made this an ideal spot for an essential craft.</p>
<p>Although blue-and-white teaware was in vogue, the market was dominated by Chinese imports and potters across Europe were desperate to find a way to produce the same fine, white porcelain themselves.</p>
<p>Step forward the three Josiahs. When Josiah Spode founded his pottery works in 1776, he was following the example of his friend and neighbour Josiah Wedgwood, whose Grecian-inspired Jasperware was already a roaring success. Within a decade, Spode had mastered the industry-defining technique for underglaze transfer and produced the first Willow-patterned crockery.</p>
<p>The Willow motif—now 232 years old and most famously made by Minton’s, whose founder, Thomas Minton, originally designed it for Spode—clearly shows the fashionable influence of Oriental imports. Its cult was enhanced by an accompanying legend, inspiration for the design, about star-crossed Mandarin lovers who escaped across the seas and were turned into doves—this all vaguely makes sense if you put your nose to a Willow-patterned plate and examine it closely.</p>
<p>Soon after Willow’s arrival, Spode and Wedgwood were joined in the Potteries by the Minton’s and Copeland factories and later Burleigh. As Britain’s reputation for obsessive tea-drinking grew, fuelled by trade with the East Indies, pottery’s popularity soared and Spode prepared to break new ground again, turning his attention to porcelain, a much finer material than earthenware or stoneware.</p>
<p>Through experimenting with burnt animal bones, particularly ox bone, Josiah Spode created a unique, calcareous ingredient and, in 1796, introduced ‘bone china’ to the world. this strong and chip-resistant, yet translucent, soft-paste porcelain is the reason that English china is called fine. Today, most British firms, from Wedgwood and Royal Doulton through to Portmeirion and Royal Worcester, still use a variation of Spode’s formula.</p>
<p>After his father’s death, Josiah Spode II took over, partnering with local potter William Copeland to bring Spode triumphantly to the forefront of the early-19th-century Golden age of English ceramics. Soon, he was the proprietor of the largest works in the Potteries and, in 1806, he was appointed Potter to the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>And so it was that, when Blue Italian was launched in 1816, it couldn’t have met with a more eager audience. Its Imari Oriental border of exotic flowers and scrolls gave a nod to the industry’s history, but within dwelt a fairytale as pretty as a picture. The scene is the Italian countryside: a shepherd and his lady tend their flock by a river that meanders lazily past a picturesque ruin, two lovers hold hands on the riverbank and, beyond, the river curves dotingly around a tiny chapel towards a medieval castle on high.</p>
<p>Trees and flowers permeate the landscape, both earth and sky, as if Man and his soft-edged edifices are there merely by Nature’s benevolent wish, and clouds scud overhead, reminding us that blue and white come in so many beautiful hues.</p>
<p>The company was eventually acquired by the Copeland family, who steered it through five generations of Victorian extravagance. Romance prevailed for a time, with whimsical patterns such as Byron Views, but, soon, a fussier, ornamental style became the order of the day, with huge orders for statues, busts, fireplace surrounds, doorknobs, tiles, figurines, spittoons, officers’-mess services, footbaths, vases, plaques and hotel and souvenir wares exported to all corners of the Empire, delighting the likes of Indian princes, European collectors and the American populace.</p>
<p>Indeed, America is as entranced with fine English china as ever—an estimated 30 million Spode Christmas tree pieces, a pattern introduced in 1938, are currently in use in America alone.</p>
<p>The Spode factory went into over- drive; between 1833 and 1900, some 35,000 new patterns were introduced—an average of 10 each week. However, none of these, not for all the gilding, regal Rococo and vibrant curlicues in greens, pinks and blacks, has endured as long as Blue Italian.</p>
<p>By the end of the 19th century, Spode was just one of more than 300 potteries operating in the Staffordshire area. Of course, some were more reputable than others and copycats looking for gullible customers were rife—’Vedgwood’ tea service, anyone?</p>
<p>The porcelain and earthenware craze continued beyond the First World War, with young housewives keeping the factory in business. throughout, Spode stuck to its high standards, using top-quality clay to create a durable, non-crazing product with a covetable silky glaze.</p>
<p>A variety of transfer-printed patterns was also produced at this time, often reissues of designs introduced by the younger Spode; these included Chinese Rose, India tree and ‘Spode’s Italian’ (so called to distinguish it from its imitators).</p>
<p>Most extraordinary of all was the skill that went into creating every single piece. Engravers would spend months at a time perfecting a pattern, meticulously punching holes into a copper plate. A heated cobalt colour was then smeared across the copper and allowed to sink into the indents, before the pattern was imprinted onto a delicate tissue paper, which was then ‘transferred’ (through vigorous rubbing, followed by glazing and firing) onto the china itself. This process had to be repeated to accommodate varying sizes of plate, platters and cups.</p>
<p>It’s a wonder that something as simple as holes in a copper plate can produce such richly layered artistry. Blue Italian epitomises this, but later designs also became classics. The hunt, based on paintings by J. F. Herring, although no longer produced, has endured and the Spode Copelands gave a nod to Art Deco and Modernist styles as well, recruiting sculptor Eric Olsen to design animal figures, often in a matte-green Royal Jade glaze, and comical Toby jugs, as well as more minimalist ceramics.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Spode passed out of the hands of the Copeland family and merged with Royal Worcester. Sadly, traditional techniques began to seem obsolete, outplayed by cheaper, quicker computerised design and lithographic printing. Despite this, Spode clung to its skilled workmanship, even creating some of its most acclaimed series in this period, such as English Cathedrals, Military Regiments, British Birds, Woodland and Sporting Fish, as well as collectible royal-occasion commemorative ware and a reissue of Blue Room, still in production today.</p>
<p>Disaster finally struck when, in 2007, to public outrage, much of Spode’s production was outsourced to the Far East. Most termed the result a poorer quality product that was—let’s call a Spode a Spode—no longer English. A year later, after 230 years of continuous use, Spode’s Stoke works closed and the company went into receivership; it seemed as if the death knell of a centuries-old industry had sounded.</p>
<p>However, like a phoenix from the kiln-fired ashes, Spode has risen. In 2009, it was acquired by the Portmeirion Group and production has returned to the UK, to a site just a couple of hundred yards from the original factory. The hand-engraved designs are now applied using complex digital technology, with each punched hole in a copper plate a fragment of a bigger picture, and Spode continues to delight with reissues and new patterns, such as Delamere Rural and Glen Lodge, which features tartan, pheasants and stags.</p>
<p>Once derelict, the original factory site reopened earlier this year, under local-authority ownership, to house a museum for the extensive Spode collection and workshops for local creative businesses. What’s more, Staffordshire University, which runs a number of ceramics courses, is set to move half its campus close by, hopefully bringing a much-needed influx of young craftspeople back to pottery making.</p>
<p>With the popularity of modern brands such as (Stoke-based) Emma Bridgewater revitalising the industry, not to mention Wedgwood’s classic Beatrix Potter nurseryware and recent collaborations with Vera Wang and Jasper Conran, our venerable Blue Italian has a lot to compete with, but I reckon it can hold its own. after all, it’s been around for 200 years—it’s got nothing to be blue about.</p>

Much like cream before jam – or, god forbid, the other way around – when preparing scones, pouring the milk first when doing a tea round is another perpetual point of division for British people.</p>
<p>But argue no longer: royal butler Grant Harrold has &lsquo;settled&rsquo; the debate once and for all.</p>
<p>Grant reveals how Her Majesty the Queen takes her tea in a new BBC Three comedy segment on British etiquette.</p>
<p>Unlike scones, which is decided primarily by region, tea is a class thing. The royal family, posh as they are, are solidly on the &lsquo;TIF&rsquo; side. That is, tea is poured first. No &lsquo;MIF&rsquo; sorts at Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>Grant explains that since the 18th century, the &lsquo;proper&rsquo; way of brewing the national beverage has been tea before milk.</p>
<p>The tradition was forged when English potter Josiah Spode (born a pauper, he went onto become one of Stoke&rsquo;s foremost potters) decided bone china teacups were the way to go.</p>
<p>The more expensive, high-quality china was favoured because it didn&rsquo;t crack under the intense heat of boiled water. Perfect, then, for tea.</p>
<p>Those who couldn&rsquo;t afford such china had to carry on pouring milk in first so their cheap crockery wouldn&rsquo;t crack. Like so much in Britain, it was a status thing.</p>
<p>Aficionados would probably know all this. Fortnum &amp; Mason (obviously) has plenty of information on the history of tea. But Grant has brought the debate mainstream.</p>

<p>And for good reason, as there&rsquo;s plenty of confusion. Today, a lot of middle class Brits, thinking they&rsquo;re posh, believe pouring milk in first is the done thing.</p>
<p>Here are Grants steps to prepare a royal brew:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pour the tea into the cup from a teapot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add milk to the cup after the tea, never before</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stir back and forth - never use a circular motion and never touch the sides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sip from the cup, do not slurp!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you care so much as to follow these steps, you might also be keen to learn about the Queen&rsquo;s favoured blends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure the Queen enjoys her Assam or her Earl Grey the traditional way, made with tea leaves in a teapot and poured into a fine bone china teacup. She will also use a strainer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is also a myth that members of Royalty use their pinky when drinking, I have never seen that happen once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sticking your pinky finger our – another &lsquo;posh&rsquo; myth.</p>
<p>Grant also covered scones</p>

<p>It was reported last week that the Queen&rsquo;s choice is jam first.</p>
<p>Former Buckingham Palace chef Darren McGrady said jam first is adopted by the royals. However, he actually only talked about garden parties and when in the royal tea tent.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not questioning Darren&rsquo;s knowledge, but Grant, &lsquo;Britain&rsquo;s leading etiquette expert&rsquo;, said that the Queen actually plays the role of diplomat before anything.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;The Royal way to eat a scone is to either cut it with a knife or break it with your hands and put the cream on first and then the jam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If her majesty was visiting Cornwall she would spread the jam on first then the cream, or in Devon, it would be cream first then jam, because that is the way they do it and she is a very diplomatic lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this is available in a new BBC Three six-part series, out today. In the second episode, Grant is duped by comedian Eline Van Der Velden, who takes tea with the Royal Butler while playing her Miss Holland character.</p>
<p>Eline said: &ldquo;The comedy character holds a mirror up to British culture by asking the questions people might think about but are too shy to ask, like ‘if you put milk in first, it means you’re poor?’&rdquo;

<p>The Royal Family is often seen as the pinnacle of British tradition as they appear to uphold high standards of etiquette at all times and embody British values. However, although the ‘Firm’ is expected to behave in a certain way in public, they all have their own preferences when it comes to their dining habits. Philip only drinks black coffee and avoids tea, according to sources, while the Queen and her son both love to indulge in this integral part of British life.</p>
<p>Speaking on BBC Three comedy show Miss Holland in 2018, royal butler Grant Harrold gave some insight into exactly how the Queen likes her tea. According to Hello magazine, he said the monarch “is a fan of Assam and Earl Grey” and prefers to pour her tea in the cup first before she adds the milk. He explained: &ldquo;I am sure the Queen enjoys her Assam or her Earl Grey the traditional way, made with tea leaves in a teapot and poured into a fine bone china teacup. She will also use a strainer. It is a myth that members of royalty use their little finger when drinking, I have never seen that happen once.” Writing in Hello, Chloe Best explained where the habit of using fine china for tea came from: “The tradition began when potter Josiah Spode created bone china teacups.</p>
<p>The Queen, Prince Charles and Prince Philip</p>
<p>The Queen and Philip reportedly have different approaches to tea</p>
<p>“The expensive and high-quality china became increasingly popular as it didn&rsquo;t crack when it was filled with boiling hot tea. However, those who couldn&rsquo;t afford bone china continued to pour milk into their teacup first, meaning the tea or milk first debate quickly became a status issue.” Mr Harrold also revealed the steps to prepare a royal cup of tea: it must be poured from a teapot into the cup, and milk should be added afterwards – never before. The cup should then be stirred back and forth – no circular motion should be used, to avoid creating unnecessary noise. The royals are expected to always sip from the cup and not to slurp. Mr Harrold later told Business Insider in 2018: “If we stir in a circular motion we can create a storm in a tea cup and see the tea coming over the sides which we should never allow.

<p>The Queen is often seen with a cup of tea in her hand</p>
<p>“If the spoon touches the sides it makes a clinging sound and we don’t want that at the afternoon tea table.” However, the hospitality manager at Dumfries House, Evan Samson, claimed earlier this week that Prince Charles likes to add milk before taking out the teabag. Speaking to The Times, he said sugar or organic honey can be added before you pour, but milk should always be added last and then the teabag can be removed. Mr Samson added that the tea must be heated to 100°C for Earl Grey or English breakfast, before being measured with a thermometer. Charles likes his tea to be presented in a particular way too, with the teacup handle “placed to the right, with the teaspoon under the handle”. A spare jug of milk should also be available in case guests want to make their weaker. DON&rsquo;T MISS</p>

<p>The royal household is reportedly supplied with a special brew from Twinings as well, after Queen Victoria authorised it in 1837. Tea is a divisive subject for many Brits – and even Boris Johnson could not escape criticism when he was seen making a cup of tea in the “incorrect” way. The Prime Minister received a torrent of criticism back in November when he was seen leaving the teabag in his cup of tea during an election campaign video. He said the bag “lets it brew and makes it stronger”, but some believe adding milk before the tea has brewed dilutes the flavour. Another subject which can split the nation is the matter of how to eat scones.</p>
