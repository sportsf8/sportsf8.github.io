College Student Wonders: In Hardcore Kenya, Is COVID-19 Lockdown Needed?</p>
<p>As Kenya shuts down to stop the spread of the Coronavirus, one young Kenyan says his country has a lot of other threats to worry about.</p>
<p>STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:</p>
<p>In Kenya, the government has ordered a full lockdown, and those rules will be enforced by security forces if needed. But many people are still walking the streets, and some ask, is this really necessary in a region with so many other threats? NPR&rsquo;s Eyder Peralta reports.</p>
<p>EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: In this time of coronavirus, I meet Samuel Mang&rsquo;era (ph) in an empty hotel bar. He sits way across the table from me. I&rsquo;m thinking, the millions of coronavirus particles released in a sneeze or a cough won&rsquo;t make it all the way here. He unlocks his phone and begins to read his Facebook post.</p>
<p>SAMUEL MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) This is an open letter. Dear coronavirus, welcome to Kenya.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Kenya has so far reported 25 cases of COVID-19. They&rsquo;ve ordered a lockdown and have asked people to stay home indefinitely.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) A few things you should know - here, we don&rsquo;t die of flu. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you fail to succeed. Everything fails in Kenya.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Mang&rsquo;era, a college student who acts and writes, reacted by writing this poem on Facebook. Kenya is not excited to host coronavirus, he writes. The locusts, the biggest infestation in 75 years, got here first.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) We also cannot afford to pay you too much attention because we are really, really broke.</p>
<p>PERALTA: I look at him - he&rsquo;s a slim guy with a wry smile - and tell him while this is funny, it&rsquo;s also really sad. He says that&rsquo;s what he wanted to capture - the humor you have to have to live in this tough a place.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: These things come and go. We just have to accept.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Even without coronavirus, death is everywhere here. The roads are filled with these station wagons that are called Proboxes. In Japan, they were recalled by the manufacturer for being dangerous. But here, Proboxes provide essential transport.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: In Kenya, we survive by Probox. You will get 15 people bundled in the same Probox.</p>
<p>PERALTA: So the same thing that is just killing people in other places - here, it&rsquo;s a way of life.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: It&rsquo;s more of a way of life because we don&rsquo;t have an alternative.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Samuel Mang&rsquo;era turns back to his phone. His open letter to coronavirus is full of bravado. But it is also an admission of deep vulnerability.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) We are more likely to die of a cholera attack than to be killed by you. For us, every day is a run escape from death. We are the walking dead.</p>
<p>PERALTA: As he reads, I overhear the only other customer here talking about the coronavirus. Kenyans live hand to mouth. How will they stay home? How will they survive this lockdown? But death, Mang&rsquo;era reads, it can befall Kenyans any time.</p>
<p>MANG&rsquo;ERA: (Reading) And we are not scared. If it comes, let it come. Why worry over what we can&rsquo;t control? Everything dies, right? Even you, corona, will die.</p>
<p>PERALTA: Even you, corona, will die.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2020/3/23/image-20200323120011502.jpg" alt="img">
Kenya is edging towards a lockdown as the number of coronavirus cases rises to 15.</p>
<p>The government is suspending all international flights from Wednesday and has ordered pubs and restaurants to remain closed.</p>
<p>Kenyans are also being urged to take social distancing seriously.</p>
<p>But that is a problem in the sprawling informal settlements where people have no room to isolate or even access to running water.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&rsquo;s Catherine Soi reports from the capital, Nairobi.

Leaders urge President Uhuru to impose total lockdown</p>
<p>A section of Kenyan politicians have urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to lockdown the country to curb the spread of coronavirus, others have however argued that a lockdown without a proper plan, could be a terrible idea. Former Kiambu Governor William Kabogo said that although a lockdown could be a vital move by the government, the state should first consider the 80 per cent of Kenyans who live from hand to mouth. “My take on the lockdown in the country is that the government should be able to impose a lockdown only if it is able to cater for the 80 per cent because a lockdown is not only necessary it is vital,&rdquo;</p>
<p>SEE ALSO :After Uhuru decision on housing, state must listen to people more</p>
<p>&ldquo;My suggestion is that we recall Members of Parliament so that they can enact a lockdown bill that allows all landlords to waive rent for the next three months,” he said. Kabogo also urged employees to pay their staff. “I am saying that they should be allowed to spend tax at source, desperate times call for desperate measures. Because if you send people on lockdown without a solution, they then will come out of their homes and they will go to homes where they think there is food, and this will end up in chaos,” he added.</p>

<p>Nairobi lawyer Donald Kipkorir has however echoed Kabogo’s sentiments on a lockdown via his twitter account saying Kenyans will starve if the lockdown is enforced. “To lock down Kenya will be the most FOOLISH DECISION &amp; will unravel Kenya. 80 per cent of Kenyans live from day to day &amp; lockdown means that they will either starve to death or eat their healthy neighbours! Countries that have gone on lockdown are RICH. Kenya is Poor &amp; Corrupt,” tweeted Kipkorir.</p>
<p>SEE ALSO :The wars in Uhuru and Raila political parties</p>
<p>on Monday Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho asked Uhuru to declare a total lockdown in the country to stop the spread of the virus. Joho said Kenya should learn from Wuhan, China where shutdown of day-to-day activities proved effective in containing the spread of the pandemic. On Tuesday, Kenya confirmed nine new cases of coronavirus that brought the total cases to twenty-five. So far 428,217 cases have been reported worldwide and 19,101 deaths.</p>
