<p>LeAnn Rimes let it all hang out in her latest Instagram upload on Friday. The country music singer flashed her curves while giving her fans a “quarantine tip” to help them pass the time.</p>
<p>In the sexy snap, LeAnn looked smoking hot as she went completely topless. She used her arms to cover her chest while showcasing her ample cleavage, toned arms and shoulders, and flat tummy.</p>
<p>She sported a pair of ripped up jeans that boasted large holes for her knees to peek out of. The denim clung tightly to her tiny waist and hips.</p>
<p>She was upside down on a white fur blanket that was thrown over a tan chair. She crossed her arms over her bare chest, and had her legs placed over the back of the chair. Her head was angled toward the ground, as she revealed the position made it look like she was in an entirely new place.</p>
<p>LeAnn wore her long blond hair in loose strands. The golden locks fell behind her and touched the floor. Some framed photos leaned against the wall next to her.</p>
<p>She also opted for a full face of makeup in the snap. The glam look appeared to include sculpted brows and a light dusting of eyeshadow, as well as thick lashes and black eyeliner.</p>
<p>She seemed to accentuate her facial features with pink blush on her cheeks and a shimmering highlighter on her nose, chin, and forehead. She looked to complete the application with a pink tint to her lips.</p>
<p>LeAnn’s 452,000-plus followers showed their approval for the racy pic by clicking the like button more than 8,000 times in less than 24 hours after it was published to her feed. Fans also flocked to the comments section to leave over 350 messages.</p>
<p>“I’m going to try this. I’ll try anything at this point,” one follower stated.</p>
<p>“Incredible cover shot for your next Grammy Album! Thanks for sharing!!” another wrote.</p>
<p>“Literally how I watch Netflix,” a third social media user admitted.</p>
<p>“You are breathtakingly beautiful,” a fourth comment read.</p>
<p>The singer doesn’t appear to have any qualms about flaunting her fit figure in her online snaps. She’s often sporting tiny tops, tight pants, and racy dresses for her photos.</p>
<p>As previously reported by The Inquisitr, LeAnn recently got the pulses of her fans racing when she posed in a skimpy crop top and matching pants. To date, that upload has raked in more than 4,800 likes and over 140 comments.

<p><img src="https://2paragraphs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-2plogo512-1-32x32.jpg" alt="img">
LeAnn Rimes is best known as a country singer. After she married actor Eddie Cibrain (ex-husband of former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville), the attractive and talented couple landed their own VH1 reality TV show in 2014, LeAnn &amp; Eddie.</p>
<p>LeAnn reports that she’s looking forward to getting “back on a stage” and performing as seen in the behind-the-scene photo above.</p>
<p>Prior to the cancellation of concerts, LeAnn had been promoting her shows with braless photos of her in seriously plunging necklines with captions like “get your hands on them!” (them being tickets to the show!).</p>
<p>She captioned the braless pic below: “can’t keep my hands to myself.”

Celebrities Help Pets Find Forever Homes with Mars Petcare’s New Adoption Program</p>
<p>By Pet Product News Staff</p>
<p>Colton Underwood and Zooka support Mars Petcare’s Foster to Forever program to encourage pet adoptions and end pet homelessness.</p>
<p>Mars Petcare has launched a new program called Foster to Forever to help encourage pet adoptions and end pet homelessness. A number of celebrities are backing the program to help get the word out, including Katherine Schwarzenegger, Colton Underwood and LeAnn Rimes.</p>
<p>The idea was spurred by the uptick of foster care during the COVID-19 pandemic. While an estimated 40 percent of the country’s shelter population are currently in foster homes, shelters are bracing for a time when these pets may be returned or when other pets are surrendered due to financial hardships, officials noted.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, people are turning to pets as a source of comfort and companionship, and as a result, we’ve seen record numbers of fosters,” said Mark Johnson, president of Mars Petcare North America in Franklin, Tenn. “We’re in awe of the support being shown to pets in need during this global crisis and want to ensure that as many pets as possible find loving, forever homes. That’s why Mars Petcare is providing essential resources like pet food and veterinary visits to families who make their foster pet a permanent member of their family.”</p>
<p>To kick off Foster to Forever, more than 10 pet-loving celebrities virtually welcomed people into their homes in late May through Instagram Live. While live, each celebrity shared an intimate look at life with their pet, including fun and heartfelt stories of some of their favorite activities together.</p>
<p>“Six weeks ago, I decided to foster Zooka,” Underwood said . “That was one of the best decisions I could have made. Zooka quickly became a member of our family, and I just couldn’t see myself bringing her back to the shelter. I’m happy to call myself a ‘foster failure’ and honored to be part of the Mars Petcare Foster to Forever program to encourage others to permanently adopt their foster pet, if they’re able to.”</p>
<p>Mars Petcare also distributed Foster to Forever kits to shelters around the country in some of the areas hit hardest by COVID-19 like Chicago and New Orleans.</p>
<p>In addition, kits will be given to more than 1,000 pet owners who are able to provide a permanent loving home to their foster dog or cat. The kit, according to officials, will include Pedigree wet food for adult dogs or puppies, coupons for free Pedigree dry food and Pedigree Dentastix treats, Temptations cat treats, Royal Canin dry and wet food for adult cats or kittens, a voucher for a free veterinary visit from Banfield Pet Hospital, a Wisdom Panel Essential dog DNA test, discounts for a Whistle GO pet activity tracking device, as well as educational information from Pedigree Foundation and the Better Cities for Pets program.</p>
<p>Banfield Foundation will also provide free veterinary services for up to 1,000 additional shelter pets while they await their forever homes, officials said.</p>
<p>“The Foster to Forever program is the first time Mars has brought together brands across all areas of the Petcare business, including Banfield, Pedigree, Royal Canin, Temptations, Whistle and Wisdom Panel, for one cause,” officials said. “By bringing these brands in the veterinary health, pet nutrition and innovation spaces together, the company is continuing to drive its global purpose of ‘A Better World for Pets’ and helping to support pets and people around the country.”

<h3 id="the-grammys-owe-mariah-carey-a-huge-debt-of-thanks--heres-why">&ldquo;The Grammys Owe Mariah Carey a Huge Debt of Thanks &amp; Here&rsquo;s Why&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/05/mariah-carey-1991-grammys-billboard-1548-1589467239-1024x677.jpg" alt="img">
AWARDS The Grammys Owe Mariah Carey a Huge Debt of Thanks &amp; Here&rsquo;s Why</p>
<p>The winner had to have obvious vocal talent. There could be no doubt this time that they were the real deal.</p>
<p>The Grammys experienced a debacle in 1990 when their best new artist winner, Milli Vanilli, was revealed not to have sung a note on their smash debut album, Girl You Know It&rsquo;s True. In terms of all-time awards show embarrassments, it&rsquo;s just behind the Oscars&rsquo; monumental 2017 screw-up where they handed their top award to the wrong picture.</p>
<p>So as the Grammys looked ahead to their 1991 show, it was imperative that the best new artist winner have obvious vocal talent. There could be no doubt this time that they were the real deal. And it would be ideal if the winner went on to have a long, substantial career.</p>
<p>Several other previous winners had flamed out after winning best new artist. Starland Vocal Band (the 1976 winners) and Debby Boone (who won for 1977) never returned to the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 after their career-launching No. 1 hits, &ldquo;Afternoon Delight&rdquo; and &ldquo;You Light Up My Life,&rdquo; respectively. A Taste of Honey, the 1978 winners, were &ldquo;two-hit-wonders,&rdquo; with two top 40 hits, &ldquo;Boogie Oogie Oogie&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sukiyaki.&rdquo; Even Men at Work, the 1982 winners, who were seen at the time as a credible pop/rock group, had a surprisingly brief run at the top.</p>
<p>So the Grammys really needed a strong winner to make up for the Milli Vanilli debacle and the general sense that this award was the &ldquo;kiss of death,&rdquo; as former Starland Vocal Band member Taffy Danoff memorably put it in a 2002 interview for VH1&rsquo;s 100 Greatest One Hit Wonders.</p>
<p>The Grammys were fortunate that Mariah Carey came along just in time to take the 1991 award. It was obvious that she could sing. In addition, she co-wrote every song on her smash debut album, produced one of the tracks and served as an arranger.</p>
<p>Carey was nominated in each of the Big Four categories – album, record and song of the year plus best new artist &ndash; at the 33rd annual Grammy Awards, held that year at Radio City Music Hall in New York. Moreover, at 20, Carey was the youngest artist to achieve that nominations sweep, surpassing Bobbie Gentry, who was 23 when she was nominated in all four of these categories in early 1968. (Carey held that record until this past year, when Billie Eilish secured all four nominations at 17. Eilish was 18 by the time of the awards.)</p>
<p>In addition to winning for best new artist, Carey won for best pop vocal performance, female for &ldquo;Vision of Love,&rdquo; beating out Whitney Houston, Bette Midler, Sinéad O&rsquo;Connor and Lisa Stansfield.</p>
<p>Carey performed that smash on the Grammy telecast. In a 2017 feature, &ldquo;The 100 Greatest Award Show Performances of All Time,&rdquo; Billboard&rsquo;s Andrew Unterberger ranked her performance at No. 10. &ldquo;Truly, a vision of Mariah; just 20 years old, and already carrying the confidence of an artist who knew she&rsquo;d be dueting with Whitney Houston on even footing by decade&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Grammys couldn&rsquo;t have known that Carey would still be going strong nearly 30 years later; that she would go on to amass 19 No. 1 hits on the Hot 100 – more than any other solo artist in history; that she would become the first artist in the history of the Hot 100 to appear at No. 1 in four different decades; or that she would have the fortitude to survive the ups and downs that are the lot of a performer&rsquo;s life in this business.</p>
<p>Sometimes in life you luck out. When Carey won for best new artist, the Grammys lucked out. Many (though not all) of the subsequent winners have also had enviable careers, which has countered the idea that this award is the &ldquo;kiss of death.&rdquo; Post-Carey best new artist winners include Toni Braxton, Sheryl Crow, LeAnn Rimes, Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, Maroon 5, John Legend, Carrie Underwood, Adele and Sam Smith. There&rsquo;s not a lip-syncher or quick flame-out in the bunch.

Brandi Glanville made sure to wear a mask and gloves when she stepped out for a Los Angeles dog walk this week.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old wore her signature blonde hair in a 1960s updo and showed off her still trim figure in a deep scarlet tank top.</p>
<p>She complemented her fitted top to a pair of elaborately patterned red and white bell bottoms, accessorizing with shades.</p>
<p>Out and about: Brandi Glanville made sure to wear a mask and gloves when she stepped out for a Los Angeles dog walk this week</p>
<p>Brandi recently revealed on her podcast that amid the coronavirus pandemic she sprays her children with bleach and water whenever they enter the house.</p>
<p>She said on Brandi Glanville Unfiltered that &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t buy rubbing alcohol anywhere so I just diluted some bleach and water and everyone gets a little spray-spray.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Brandi co-parents her sons Mason, 16, and Jake, 13, with her hunky ex-husband Eddie Cibrian who left her after having an affair with LeAnn Rimes.</p>
<p>Eddie and LeAnn&rsquo;s romance began while they were in fact both married to other people and they tied the knot with each other in 2011.</p>
<p>Looking fab: The 47-year-old wore her signature blonde hair in a 1960s updo and showed off her still trim figure in a deep scarlet tank top</p>
<p>Sizzling sensation: She complemented her fitted top to a pair of elaborately patterned red and white bell bottoms, accessorizing with shades</p>
<p>Meanwhile Brandi continues to draw headlines for her involvement with the smash hit reality show The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>Brandi used to be a full-time Housewife and although she now only makes guest appearances on the show she has become a central plot point.</p>
<p>Multiple production sources exclusively told DailyMail.com that Denise had a relationship with Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills Denise Richards from the beginning until the middle of last year.</p>
<p>A source said that Denise told Brandi she was in an open marriage with her husband Aaron Phypers, whom she has been married to since 2018.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A little spray-spray&rsquo;: Brandi recently revealed on her podcast that amid the coronavirus pandemic she sprays her children with bleach and water whenever they enter the house</p>
<p>&lsquo;Denise claimed to Brandi that she was in an open marriage, but she wasn&rsquo;t and this has hurt Denise&rsquo;s husband Aaron very much,&rsquo; said an insider, claiming that Brandi &lsquo;&lsquo;is upset that Denise lied to her&rsquo; about the arrangement.</p>
<p>However Denise went on social media and declared herself &lsquo;100% monogamous to my husband,&rsquo; denying that she had an open marriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As far as the Denise stuff, because I was given a cease and desist, I&rsquo;m gonna just not talk about it until I have to,&rsquo; said Brandi recently on the Everything&rsquo;s Iconic podcast.</p>
<p>Seen last July: Brandi co-parents her sons Mason, 16, and Jake, 13, with her hunky ex-husband Eddie Cibrian who left her after having an affair with LeAnn Rimes</p>
<p>&lsquo;We don&rsquo;t have a relationship, unfortunately. I would love to be her friend. All I can tell you is I don&rsquo;t lie,&rsquo; Brandi told podcast host Danny Pellegrino.</p>
<p>Last week Real Housewife Of Beverly Hills Lisa Rinna raised the question of whether Denise would attending the show&rsquo;s upcoming reunion.</p>
<p>Denise previously assured the public she will attend the reunion and said the notion she would skip it came from co-stars who did not consult her about the issue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went swimming with the wrong shark&rsquo;: Last week Brandi shared an Instagram meme that showed herself alongside Denise Richards with the title: &lsquo;Wild Things Of Beverly Hills&rsquo;</p>
<p>However while appearing last Thursday on Watch What Happens Live, hosted by Real Housewives producer Andy Cohen, Lisa vamped that &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last week Brandi shared an Instagram meme that showed herself alongside Denise with the title: &lsquo;Wild Things Of Beverly Hills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Someone sent this to me &amp; with all the she said she said I cannot f***ing wait for the truth to come out&hellip;I went swimming with the wrong shark,&rsquo; Brandi captioned.

Going stir-crazy in quarantine? You’re not alone. Celebrities are cooped up in their homes across the country just like the rest of us. As we collectively navigate this uncharted territory, USA TODAY presents Quarantine Diaries, which give readers a peek into how our favorite stars are spending their time at home.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s diarist is singer LeAnn Rimes, who is shacked up at home with husband Eddie Cibrian amid the coronavirus pandemic. Rimes has been hosting weekly Instagram Live meditation sessions on her Soul of EverLe page and recently released a cover of Darrell Brown and Beth Nielsen Chapman&rsquo;s &ldquo;There Will Be a Better Day&rdquo; as a message of hope to her fans. Here’s what a day in the life of Rimes&rsquo; quarantine looks like. – As told to Anika Reed</p>
<p>6:17 a.m. I wake up to Eddie, my husband, laying sideways on the bed because our 70-pound dog Fleetwood has decided to take over his side. She sleeps on the floor, but for some reason, she has an internal alarm clock where at 5:30 a.m. she jumps up on the bed. God bless her.</p>
<p>6:30 a.m. Eddie and I lay there and snuggled with Fleetwood for a bit. And then we get up and I go downstairs and make coffee. I don’t usually drink coffee, but these times are calling for desperate measures. Some days I feel like I need a jolt of something to wake me up. It&rsquo;s a new thing for me. One of the other things I do first is take all of my supplements. We have a lot of vitamin C and vitamin D in our house right now with everything going around.</p>
<p>7 a.m. I feed Fleetwood and then Eddie and I unload the dishwasher. I made mushroom and poblano tacos the night before, and I think I used every tool in the kitchen. Every time I cook, which has been breakfast, lunch and dinner right now, I make a mess, so our kitchen is always a mess. But I like to think I’m creative.</p>
<p>And then I end up in what Eddie calls my spot, which is the couch. After all of the morning routine stuff, I end up there with this huge mason jar of water I sit down with. I love drinking a little bit of rose water in my water. I research a bunch of recipes on Pinterest for the following week, which I love doing. I find everything on Pinterest, it’s my favorite thing.</p>

<p>8:45 a.m. I work out with my trainer over Zoom. We lift weights and do bodyweight workouts. I have an indoor little trampoline that I love. It’s a great workout, but it also balances my nervous system out if I’m anxious. I’ve also been doing some yoga here and there.</p>
<p>10 a.m. I take myself through my meditation that I&rsquo;m going to teach the following day on Instagram. The one I taught Sunday I’ve been doing as one of my regular daily practices.</p>
<p>11:30 a.m. I drop off a grief care package at our friend’s house. We have friends who just lost their loved one in a tragic way. It’s been rough. Grief has been apart of everyone’s lives right now. We’re all grieving so many things – I don’t even know if we recognize that we’re grieving the loss of a world we no longer know. When you do have a loved one that is passed, that grief becomes very real and a part of your daily life.</p>
<p>12 p.m. FaceTime with friends has been the best thing. I was having a moment when I was angry and sad and I called my friend … and five minutes later I felt better. I highly recommend that for anybody who’s feeling alone. We’re so in need of community at this moment. A lot of us have a hard time reaching out. Hopefully, in times like this, we can allow that guard to fall a little bit.</p>
<p>12:30 p.m. Eddie and I venture out to the grocery store for some food essentials, with the masks and the gloves and the whole thing. I think I might keep that going once this is over with because it’s very incognito. We come home and take everything out of the bags and wash all the groceries. I take a shower, which is a huge feat for me at this moment in time. I actually wash my hair this time, which I probably do every four to five days.</p>
<p>3:30 p.m. I realize I haven&rsquo;t eaten, which is not like me, so I eat my leftover mushroom and poblano tacos. It&rsquo;s a beautiful day so we eat outside. My two stepsons are with us. Luckily we do have a pool, and they were able to play in it. It feels like more of a normal-ish day.</p>
<p>5 p.m. I start prepping dinner, which is skillet lasagna. I couldn’t find pasta at the grocery store, everything is so limited right now, so I’m improvising. I use chickpea penne pasta and it was really, really delicious. We eat dinner at 6:30 p.m. with the kids.</p>
<p>7:30 p.m. We’ve been going to bed so early. Two reasons: I think our bodies are just tired and ready to go to bed early, but the other one, for me, is I really want to stop eating. I try to go upstairs and get in bed because I’ve been snacking on so much after dinner that I’m like, &lsquo;I need to get in bed and away from the food.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Eddie ends up turning on this Western I had never seen before, &ldquo;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.&rdquo; I was really annoyed at first and then I totally got into it. Then I download a book, “Prayers of Honoring” by Pixie Lighthorse. A friend of mine sent me a passage from it on grief that was just so beautiful.</p>

“Mack the Knife” (3rd) is a song about Jack the Ripper, a serial killer who takes lives. “Uptown Funk” (4th) sounds like a depressed area of town, but it is actually about looking good and living an exciting social life. Both are ironic to what we have experienced. The United States was looking pretty good economically before the coronavirus, but the pandemic took that life away, and we want it back.</p>
<p>One of the most applicable song titles is fifth on the list: “How Do I Live,” by LeAnn Rimes.</p>
<p>Aren’t we all asking ourselves this question as we step into summer? What will our lives look like in the coming months? How will we live differently because of what we have gone through?</p>
<p>I often think about my mother, who would wash and re-use bread bags because she had grown up during the Great Depression. Living through that historic event affected how she spent money, conserved food, and viewed the behaviors and choices of her children, who could neither understand nor relate to the significant impact that experience had had on how she lived her life.
