WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — The headline might be a bit strange, but it will make more sense after you have solved Francis Heaney’s mellifluous puzzle. And it helps if you are familiar with the song it celebrates.</p>
<p>Some may see this as a bit of a spoiler, but I’m willing to bet that there are many solvers who are not familiar enough with all of the parts of this theme so that it remains a midweek tug of war.</p>
<p>Besides, I can’t hear you. I’m too busy blasting this powerful, get-up-and-dance song and rocking out to it.</p>
<p>Today’s Theme</p>
<p>The singer BILLIE EILISH, her hit “BAD GUY” and her achievement at the 2020 GRAMMYS — Ms. Eilish won best pop album and album of the year, and her hit “Bad Guy” won for record of the year and song of the year — make up the majority of the theme elements in Mr. Heaney’s puzzle.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — IMPORTANT ADMINISTRIVIAL ALERT: For those who signed up for the A.C.P.T. and are not on social media, the 2020 tournament has been canceled, possibly to be rescheduled later in the year.</p>
<p>All money will be refunded, and please do not forget to cancel any hotel reservations. More to come as I get the information.</p>
<p>A note from Will Shortz:</p>
<p>Dear Friends, With the rapidly increasing concern over the coronavirus pandemic, and the governor of Connecticut now declaring a public health emergency in the state, I’m afraid the ACPT scheduled for March 20-22 must be canceled. I am working with the Stamford Marriott Hotel to see if the event can be rescheduled for later this year. More on this shortly. Meanwhile, all payments for the live tournament on March 20-22 will be refunded. This may take a few days, so please be patient. —Will Shortz</p>
<p>Interesting-looking grid, isn’t it? Erik Agard’s puzzle is a bit larger than usual (this one is 15x16) and, by using mirror symmetry, he has made a grid that looks — to me at least — like it’s grinning and reaching out for a hug.

<h3 id="sarah-palin-marks-end-times-with-masked-singer-performance-of-baby-got-back">&ldquo;Sarah Palin Marks End Times With ‘Masked Singer’ Performance of ‘Baby Got Back’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1067,w_1897,x_438,y_2/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1583980618/SP_nr9tka" alt="img">
While President Trump was preparing to address the nation on a global pandemic, viewers who may have tuned in early on Fox saw a panel of judges attempting to figure out which celebrity just sang Sir Mix-A-Lot’s “Baby Got Back” from behind a giant pink bear head on The Masked Singer.</p>
<p>After saying it would be “hella hard” to figure it out, judge Nicole Scherzinger began by guessing that it might be Christina Applegate. Going off of the clue of “hockey skates” and the fact that the mystery singer is a mom, Jenny McCarthy went with Candace Cameron Bure.</p>
<p>Robin Thicke, meanwhile used a clue of Saturday Night Live to pick Tina Fey. He was getting closer.</p>
<p>“OK, Bear, it’s time to show us who you really are!” host Nick Cannon said, as none other than former Alaska governor and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin revealed herself.</p>
<p>“This is the weirdest thing I’ve ever done, that’s for sure,” Palin said. “But it’s all about fun. It’s unity. This is all good. This is something that our country needs right now, too.”</p>
<p>Then she delivered her rap performance one more time without the mask.</p>
<p>And yes the most surreal moment may have come when the show ended and Fox News anchor Bret Baier appeared on the screen. “This is coverage of President Donald Trump’s primetime address to the nation on the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization today declared a global pandemic,” he said, soberly. “Good evening. I’m Bret Baier in Washington.

<h3 id="what-if-your-abusive-husband-is-a-cop">&ldquo;What if Your Abusive Husband Is a Cop?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d8e5c4f10119c00086294dc/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/191007_r35061.jpg" alt="img">
Jessica Lester’s friends persuaded her to date Matthew Boynton, a boy in the eleventh grade, by saying, “If you don’t like him, you can always break up.” He was the grandson of the sheriff of Spalding County, where they lived, an hour south of Atlanta, and his friends were football players and cheerleaders. Jessica thought that Matthew, who was baby-faced but muscular, looked rich; he wore Ralph Lauren boots and collared shirts from Hollister. Jessica, who was in tenth grade, was less popular. She wore hand-me-downs and liked to take nature photographs. Her parents had abandoned her when she was three, along with her sister and brother, and she grew up on a farm with her mother’s adoptive parents. “I guess she felt like ‘Matthew could have picked anybody, and for some reason he picked me,’ ” her sister, Dusty, said.</p>
<p>Jessica had pale-green eyes, a melodic voice, and blond hair that hung down her back like a slab of wood. In the spring of 2013, when she was sixteen and had dated Matthew for a year, she took her grandparents into the kitchen, closed the door, and told them, apologizing, that she was pregnant. Jessica’s grandparents, who are Baptist, were willing to help her bring up the child, but Jessica decided to settle down with Matthew, her first boyfriend. Her aunt Kathy, who lives on the farm, said, “With Jessica’s family background, there was probably just a feeling of ‘Oh, I’ve finally found someone who loves me.’ ”</p>
<p>Jessica and Matthew moved into a house across the street from the sheriff, Wendell Beam, and his wife. Jessica was the kind of intuitive mother who predicts a baby’s danger—a fall, a spilled drink, a choking hazard—a few seconds before it happens. But she felt isolated. She finished her high-school coursework online, and almost never saw her friends or family. She said that Matthew told her she wasn’t related to them by blood.</p>
<p>For their son’s first Christmas, Matthew took Jessica to her grandparents’ house—the first time she’d seen them in months—but before she opened her presents he told her that they had to leave. When Jessica graduated from high school, her grandparents held a party for her and projected a movie on the side of their barn. Shortly after the movie started, Matthew said that it was time to go. “The rest of us enjoyed her graduation party,” Martha, her grandmother, said.</p>
<p>Matthew’s childhood dream was to work in law enforcement—a career inspired by his grandfather, who had helped bring him up following his parents’ divorce. After high school, he worked as a jailer at the Pike County sheriff’s office before being hired as a patrol officer in Griffin, the largest city in Spalding County. In his personnel file there, a supervisor described him as “fiercely loyal” but “stiff and unwilling to bend.” Another officer described him as “the type who wants to make ten arrests a day if he could.” A senior officer privately advised Matthew, “Lighten up a little bit, man.”</p>
<p>That mentality spilled into his home life. Twice, Matthew called the police on Jessica, for yelling or cursing or poking his chest. According to a police report, Jessica was “very reserved and appeared to be upset.” She said that the officers recommended that she not yell at Matthew.</p>
<p>In December, 2014, Jessica had a brief affair and got pregnant again. Her family wondered if this was her way of escaping the relationship. But Matthew said that he’d raise the child as his own. They decided to get married. Jessica could never quite explain why—there was no proposal, just an understanding that there was too much momentum to break up. Martha worried that Jessica had “lost her feistiness. It was almost like her personality got squished out of her.”</p>
<p>Her aunt Denise, a public-school teacher, said that, at the wedding, “there was just this sadness in her eyes, like, ‘I’m done.’ ” She had the demeanor of a child who had promised herself not to cause trouble or draw attention to her own feelings. Jessica and Matthew left their wedding reception, which her family hosted, after less than an hour. Matthew wore a titanium wedding ring with a blue stripe, to signify that he was in law enforcement.</p>
<p>They rented an apartment in Griffin, in a complex of beige two-story buildings surrounding a swimming pool. But the sheriff still loomed large in their relationship. Matthew asked Beam to phone him in the morning to wake him up. Jessica didn’t have her own credit card or car, so if she needed something from the supermarket she texted Matthew, who either took her to the store himself or asked Beam or his wife to deliver the item. When Matthew drove his patrol car, he would often take the keys to his truck, a Chevrolet Avalanche, so that Jessica couldn’t use it.</p>

<p>Denise was on a science-curriculum committee with Matthew’s stepmother, Amy, a teacher in the same district. A few months after the wedding, Denise and Amy went out for lunch. Denise said that Amy confided that Matthew had once hit her and that their relationship was strained. “She became dead serious—I’d never seen her so serious,” Denise said. “She said we needed to know what kind of kid he was. She said, ‘Do me a favor. I want you to make sure that Jessica is going to be O.K., because he’s going to hurt her.’ ”</p>
<p>In the spring of 2016, less than six months after the wedding, Jessica discovered that Matthew was having an affair with Courtney Callaway, a dispatcher at the Spalding County sheriff’s office, a mile away from the Griffin Police Department.</p>
<p>“If you don’t want to be with me anymore,” Jessica texted him, “I’m not going to stay here and play house.” Matthew, who had begun spending his free days with Callaway, told her, “It’s not gonna work for us. I already know it won’t.”</p>
<p>Jessica’s grandmother made an appointment with a lawyer who could help her file for divorce. In a composition note­­book, Jessica documented the times she assumed Matthew had been with his girlfriend, and she jotted down notes for the lawyer. “Difference between non-­contested &amp; adultery divorce?” she wrote. “Most important to me. Custody (full?).” She and the boys planned to move into her sister Dusty’s house on Friday, April 15th, and the next week she would begin working at a chiropractor’s office. “She had both of the boys packed and ready to go,” Dusty said.</p>
<p>Jessica had to wean her baby before starting the job, so on Thursday night she and Matthew drove to Walmart, to buy formula. At the store, they got into a fight, and when they left Jessica said she didn’t want to get into the car. Matthew called a Griffin police lieutenant for advice. “She’s a grown lady,” the lieutenant told him. “You can’t force her into the truck.” (Matthew refused to comment for this story.)</p>
<p>From her porch, Jessica’s neighbor Megan Browning saw Jessica and Matthew return home. A half hour or so later, Browning was lying in bed when she heard a gunshot. Unnerved, she went out to the porch, where she heard another. Not long afterward, she saw Matthew walk briskly to his truck.

<h3 id="cryptic-crosswords-too-confusing-decipher-them-with-these-seven-common-clue-recipes">&ldquo;Cryptic crosswords too confusing? Decipher them with these seven common clue recipes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/8679900-16x9-large.jpg?v=2" alt="img">
Have you tried your hand at the cryptic crossword, only to find it too cryptic?</p>
<p>Writer and broadcaster David Astle creates crosswords for Fairfax newspapers under the initials DA, which fans say stand for &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Attempt&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Astle said anyone could attempt cryptic crosswords with a little knowledge of how they worked.</p>
<p>Here he gives seven clues, each one an example of a common cryptic crossword recipe.</p>
<p>Sweet stall (5)</p>
<p>The best way to get started on a cryptic crossword, Astle said, was to look for the shortest clue.</p>
<p>If a clue only has two words it is most likely using the double-definition recipe, in which you are given two synonyms of the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stall can be a noun, a booth that you see at a school fair, or it can be a verb when you tarry or lag,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>The clue also calls for a synonym for &ldquo;sweet&rdquo;, so we can deduce that the five-letter solution to this clue is &ldquo;fudge&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Terrain ruined coach (7)</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see a word that means devastation or rearrangement, just like &lsquo;ruined&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s possibly an anagram,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>Rearranging the letters of &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; into a word that means &ldquo;coach&rdquo; gives you the answer &ldquo;trainer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Apply some simple mentoring (9)</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;some&rdquo; indicates that this clue follows the hidden formula, where the answer is hidden in the clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you take out some of &lsquo;simple mentoring&rsquo; you will find the word &lsquo;implement&rsquo; &hellip; a word that means &lsquo;apply&rsquo;,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper sounds ruder (6)</p>
<p>The appearance of the word &ldquo;sounds&rdquo; gives away that this clue is asking for a homophone — a word that sounds like another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any signpost suggesting hearing, you know it&rsquo;s a homophone clue,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>This clue is asking for a synonym of &lsquo;shopkeeper&rsquo; that sounds like a synonym for &lsquo;ruder&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grocer sounds like &lsquo;grosser&rsquo;,&rdquo; Astle said, so our answer is &ldquo;grocer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>David Astle says cryptic crosswords are best attempted with a friend. ( ABC News Breakfast )</p>
<p>Wave cereal bowl (8)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no signpost here, no indicator, and when a clue has no indicator it usually is the charade recipe,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where a word is broken down into little pieces, like a train made up of small carriages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By combining &ldquo;bran&rdquo; (cereal) and &ldquo;dish&rdquo; (bowl) we can construct a word meaning &ldquo;wave&rdquo; — &ldquo;brandish&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Damp fog hides nothing (5)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a weather forecast, but don&rsquo;t be fooled,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cryptic crossword clues try to tell you a story — ignore the story and look at the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;hides&rdquo; is a possible signpost that this is a container clue, where one word is put inside another to create the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a short word for fog? Mist,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What symbol means nothing? 0 (zero).</p>
<p>&ldquo;When mist &lsquo;hides&rsquo; 0, you get &lsquo;moist&rsquo;, meaning damp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boat in waters going west (5)</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;going west&rdquo; indicates that this is a reversal clue.</p>
<p>A synonym of waters is &ldquo;pools&rdquo;, which you can reverse to get &ldquo;sloop&rdquo;, a type of boat.</p>
<p>The signpost for reversal clues change depending on the direction of the answer in the grid.</p>
<p>An across clue might say &ldquo;going west&rdquo; or &ldquo;left&rdquo;, while a down clue could say &ldquo;going up&rdquo; or &ldquo;rising&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="our-favorite-new-yorker-crossword-clues-of-2018">&ldquo;Our Favorite New Yorker Crossword Clues of 2018&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5abd243731a8d50df08d57dd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Crossword-Puzzle-Eustace.jpg" alt="img">
In April, The New Yorker launched its first-ever American-style crossword puzzle. (As David Remnick noted in his introduction of the puzzle, the magazine previously published, for a short time, a British-style cryptic crossword—a “fiendishly difficult” variant on the form.) Since then, our crack team of constructors—Patrick Berry, Kameron Austin Collins, Elizabeth C. Gorski, Natan Last, and Anna Shechtman—has delivered a witty, intelligent, eclectic new puzzle every week.</p>
<p>To celebrate this new institution, the crossword editors have rounded up our favorite clues and answers of the year. From offbeat definitions to fascinating trivia and ingenious feats of wordplay, all of these clues made us laugh or taught us something new (or, often, both).</p>
<p>One more thing: this week, we’re publishing a bonus round of “2018 In Review”-themed crossword puzzles. Check the Puzzles Dept. each morning to test your knowledge of the year in language (Monday), movies (Tuesday), music (Wednesday), politics (Thursday), and literature (Friday). Each puzzle has one highlighted answer; solve all five, then put the highlighted answers together to solve a master clue: “Something new in 2018.” The first ten people to e-mail us the correct answer will win a New Yorker tote bag (you can find the official rules here).</p>
<p>Happy holidays, and may all your puzzles be solved in 2019!</p>
<p>“Schmaltz, literally”</p>
<p>A.: CHICKENFAT</p>
<p>This clue will go down in history as having prompted a change in The New Yorker’s official spelling of “schmaltz.” R.I.P., “schmalz.”</p>
<p>“1985 hit whose music video featured thousands of line drawings”</p>
<p>A.: TAKEONME</p>
<p>RHINO / YouTube</p>
<p>The new-wave band a-ha has appeared in countless crosswords, but this was the first time we’d seen their most famous song in a grid.</p>
<p>“Baby photographer who’s sold more than thirteen million calendars”</p>
<p>A.: ANNEGEDDES</p>
<p>Speaking of answers we’ve never seen in a grid: hats off to Kameron Austin Collins for bringing everyone’s favorite baby photographer into the crossword canon.</p>
<p>“Cab seeker’s aid, perhaps”</p>
<p>A.: WINELIST</p>
<p>This bit of misdirection, from Elizabeth C. Gorski, yielded one of the most gratifying “Aha!” (not the band) moments of the year.</p>
<p>“She teaches the ‘sweet if dangerous fun of self-love’, per Alice Walker”</p>
<p>A.: AUDRELORDE</p>
<p>It was tough to choose a favorite from this delightful grid, by Anna Shechtman, packed with women writers. Another contender: “She writes with ‘computer lyricism’, according to Elizabeth Hardwick” (answer: JOANDIDION).</p>
<p>“Like John Singer Sargent’s ‘Male Nudes Wrestling’ ”</p>
<p>A.: HOMOEROTIC</p>
<p>One thing that crosswords can do is make the subtext text.</p>
<p>“Love going to a few different parties?”</p>
<p>A.: POLYAMORY</p>
<p>Another thing that they can do is highlight the evolution of language. From “BIKESHARE” to “WHITESAVIOR,” Natan Last’s puzzles often feature recent additions to the cultural lexicon.</p>
<p>“Hairless arcade-game character who wears a hair bow”</p>
<p>A.: MSPACMAN</p>
<p>Photograph from Alamy</p>
<p>A mind-blowing observation from Patrick Berry.</p>
<p>“Meet-up for fans of Caesar dressing?”</p>
<p>Just when we thought there was no new way to clue “TOGA PARTY.”</p>
<p>“Prized part of a beef?”</p>
<p>A.: THELASTWORD</p>
<p>Clever, and true.
