<p>Benjamin Keough, the son of actress Lisa Marie Presley and the look-alike grandson of Elvis Presley, has died at 27.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie Presley&rsquo;s manager Roger Widynowski confirmed the death in a statement to USA TODAY: &ldquo;She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley. She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keough&rsquo;s father is singer-songwriter Danny Keough and his sister is singer Riley Keough, 31.</p>
<p>TMZ reports that Keough died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Sunday in Calabasas, California.</p>
<p>Lisa Marie was particularly close to Benjamin, revealing on Twitter in 2012 that on Mother&rsquo;s Day three years prior they bonded over Celtic eternity knot tattoos placed in the same location.</p>
<p>In 2012, Lisa Marie featured Benjamin and his siblings in a music video remaking Elvis’ 1954 hit &ldquo;I Love You Because.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lisa Marie revealed to CMT in October 2012 that backstage at Nashville&rsquo;s Grand Ole Opry, people were struck over Benjamin&rsquo;s resemblance to his famous grandfather Elvis. &ldquo;He was at the Opry and was the quiet storm behind the stage!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everybody turned around and looked when he was over there. Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny. Sometimes I am overwhelmed when I look at him.”</p>
<p>When asked if Benjamin was going to have a music career, she told The Huffington Post in 2013, &ldquo;He’s doing his own thing right now. I’m going to let him decide when he wants to go out and do what he wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lisa Marie posted a family picture on Twitter in 2019, with social media responders commenting on his likeness to Elvis Presley.

Lisa Marie Presley’s son Benjamin Keough has died aged 27 of an apparent suicide.</p>
<p>TMZ reports that the son of Lisa and musician Danny Keough died on Sunday in Calabasas, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And in a statement provided to EW today, a representative for Lisa Marie said she was “beyond devastated” over her only son’s death.</p>
<p>“She is completely heartbroken, inconsolable and beyond devastated but trying to stay strong for her 11-year-old twins and her oldest daughter Riley,” the statement read. “She adored that boy. He was the love of her life.”</p>
<p>Benjamin was a relatively little-known member of a very famous family, with musician mother Lisa Marie, musician father Danny, and his older sister, actress Riley Keough.</p>

<p>He was also the grandson of Elvis Presley - and shared a strong family likeness to his late grandfather, something his mother herself once acknowledged in an interview: “Ben does look so much like Elvis. He was at the Opry and was the quiet storm behind the stage. Everybody turned around and looked when he was over there. Everybody was grabbing him for a photo because it is just uncanny,” she said.</p>
<p>RELATED: Lisa Marie Presley inks massive deal for bombshell book</p>
<p>TMZ reports that Benjamin had wanted to follow in his grandfather’s footsteps, signing a record deal worth $US5 million back in 2009.</p>
<p>Benjamim’s death is a tragic blow for the Presley family, who have endured very public struggles in recent years. In 2018 Lisa Marie claimed her former business manager squandered her entire share of late father Elvis’ $US100 million ($135 million) fortune, whittling it down to just $US14,000 ($19,000). Last year Benjamin’s grandmother Priscilla Presley was forced to sell her Los Angeles mansion to help out her daughter with her mounting debts.</p>
<p>“Priscilla would never have done this if she didn’t believe it was her daughter’s last chance,” a source told Radar of the $US5.5 million sale at the time.</p>
<p>RELATED: Lisa Marie Presley spotted in rare public outing</p>
<p>The most recent photo of Benjamin on his mother’s Instagram account was posted in June of last year: It shows Lisa Marie with her two older children, Benjamin and Riley, alongside her younger twin daughters from her fourth marriage, to guitarist Michael Lockwood.</p>
<p>“Mama lion with cubs,” she captioned the sweet family pic.

<h3 id="lisa-marie-presleys-daughter-riley-keough-reveals-rare-photos-with-dad-danny">&ldquo;Lisa Marie Presley&rsquo;s Daughter Riley Keough Reveals Rare Photos With Dad Danny&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.popculture.com/2020/06/riley-keough-getty-images-20089068-1280x0.jpeg" alt="img">
The Girlfriend Experience star Riley Keough marked Father&rsquo;s Day by sharing a collection of rare and intimate photos of herself with her father, musician Danny Keough. The 31-year-old actress is the daughter of Danny and Lisa Marie Presley, who were married from 1988 to 1994. In her caption, Keough said she was thinking of anyone who had difficult relationships with their fathers, as well as single mothers and fathers who lost their children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy [Father&rsquo;s] day Danny,&rdquo; Keough wrote. Thinking of anyone who has a difficult relationship with their father, who has lost their father or fathers who have lost their children on this day.&rdquo; She added a few heart emojis and chimed in, &ldquo;oh! And the single mothers.&rdquo; Keough&rsquo;s gallery of photos included pictures of herself with Danny, 55, as a child and more recently as an adult. A few baby pictures were also mixed in.</p>
<p>View this post on Instagram A post shared by Riley Keough (@rileykeough) on Jun 21, 2020 at 9:58am PDT</p>
<p>Presley and Danny are also parents to son Benjamin Storm Keough, 27. After the couple divorced, Presley married Michael Jackson, which provided a jarring experience for the young Keough. In a 2017 interview with The Guardian, Keough recalled spending time at Neverland Ranch when she was with her mother and living in a trailer park when she was with Danny.</p>
<p>Despite the disparity, Keough said she enjoyed time with her father. &ldquo;My memories of growing up with him were so colorful and eccentric and fun,&rdquo; Keough said at the time. &ldquo;It was a good vibe, you know? When I was like eight I told him, ‘I want to grow up and be poor like you!’ He was eating a bowl of cereal. I didn&rsquo;t realize how wildly offensive that was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keough, the granddaughter of Elvis Presley, recently marked her 31st birthday with a tasteful nude on Instagram. In 2015, she married stuntman Ben Smith-Petersen, whom she met on the set of Mad Max: Fury Road. She played Capable, one of Immortan Joe&rsquo;s escaped &ldquo;wives.&rdquo; The film has gone on to become one of the most acclaimed action movies. Keough told the New York Times it was &ldquo;one of the wildest, most intense experiences of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actress has a Golden Globe nomination for her role in The Girlfriend Experience Season 1 and has also starred in Logan Lucky, The Lodge, Zola and the upcoming The Devil All The Time. She also signed to star in the title role of Daisy Jones &amp; The Six, an upcoming Amazon miniseries based on the novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid. The novel is about a rock band in the 1970s Los Angeles music scene and why the group broke up. Reese Witherspoon is one of the show&rsquo;s executive producers.

More and more details have been coming out about that second arrest, but now David is officially sharing his side of the story.</p>
<p>Last month, David was arrested twice within the span of a couple of days — once for not showing up for a court date, and once for allegedly assaulting a friend of Jenelle’s.</p>
<p>And sure, things have never been truly good down on the swamp, but they’ve certainly been better than this.</p>

<p>Scary</p>
<p>David has been accused of being violent many, many times — his ex managed to get a restraining order against him for herself and their son after telling a judge he was abusive, and we’ve heard two 911 calls from Jenelle concerning him.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Horrifying</p>
<p>In one of those calls, she said that he’d knocked her down and she thought her collarbone was broken, and in the other she said that she’d locked him out of their home because he was scaring her and he was beating the door down.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>More Accusations</p>
<p>When she left him last fall, she got her own restraining order against him after telling a judge that he’d been abusive and she feared for her life.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>RIP Nugget</p>
<p>His violent history isn’t just made up of allegations, either — we all remember what happened to poor, poor Nugget.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Sure</p>
<p>So when the story came out last month about how he’d allegedly hit Jenelle’s friend with a pistol, it wasn’t exactly hard to believe.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>A Quick Recap</p>
<p>We first heard about the incident when Jenelle reached out to a website to give a statement — in the first version of the story, Jenelle had decided to leave David again and went back to The Land with a couple of friends to get some of her belongings.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Rage</p>
<p>There was some kind of argument about David’s car keys — he apparently believed that Jenelle or one of her friends had taken them — and David ended up hitting one of the friends with a pistol.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>So Upset, Dude</p>
<p>At the time, Jenelle said “I’m shaking and saddened by this, it’s time for me to move on from this relationship and find happiness for my kids and myself elsewhere.” She also claimed she was going to get another restraining order.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Ha</p>
<p>That didn’t happen, of course — we’re not sure exactly when she went back to him, but paparazzi got photos of them together at a dog park a week after his arrest, which means that Jenelle wanted to send a public message that she was standing by her man.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>More Details</p>
<p>While Jenelle was making up with her gross husband, the police report was released, and that’s where we heard that David was accused of hitting Jenelle’s friend with a pistol twice, once on the neck and once on the back, and for telling him “I will blow your f–king brains out.”</p>
<ol start="13">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>OK</p>
<p>We also learned that David had filed assault charges of his own against the friend because he supposedly assaulted him with a coat rack.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Moving Along</p>
<p>He went to court last week over all of this, and it doesn’t seem like too much happened, although it does seem like the charges weren’t dropped and he’ll have to go back for a trial.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Ugh</p>
<p>Seems like a great time to share his side of the story, huh?!</p>
<ol start="16">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Cool Story</p>
<p>According to David, he was looking for his keys when Jenelle showed up with her friends. He asked everyone if they’d seen the keys, then he asked the friends to leave and told them that they’re not welcome in his home.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>And no, that doesn’t really make sense, but this is his story and he’s sticking to it.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s Going Down</p>
<p>So he asked them to leave, one of the guys pushed him, and David said that “I pushed back and he pushed me back, this other guy attacked me with my coat hanger I made out of rail road spikes that was hanging from my wall, he swang it over my head and I tried stopping it, that’s when the spikes went into my hand and hit my wrist and forearm.”</p>
<ol start="19">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Self-Defense</p>
<p>“They could have killed me if one of those nails went into my head if I wouldn’t have blocked it,” he added, “I have the right to protect myself against strangers who attack me in my own home.”</p>
<ol start="20">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>What a Timeline</p>
<p>He was arrested after the incident, but it was for missing the unrelated court date. Police told him then to file a report if he’d been assaulted. He was released, then arrested again for the assault charges. Police told him again to file a report.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Standing Up for Himself</p>
<p>“I filed the report on this guy with the police department and he is also being charged with assault, the difference is I was protecting myself in my own home and it was self-defense,” David explained.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>The Plot Thickens</p>
<p>“Who would let a half-drunk guy wielding railroad spikes at your head get away?” he asked. “They had just come from a bar having drinks so it’s obvious this guy wasn’t in his right mind.”</p>
<ol start="23">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Too Busy</p>
<p>He complained that “Everyone thinks I was the one in the wrong just because I’ve been too busy making sure my family, wife, and kids are good, I don’t care to spread lies to reporters for fame and money.”</p>
<ol start="24">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>So Much Defamation</p>
<p>“I’m a Husband, I’m a father and that’s where my focus is at, I didn’t want to be petty and show the world these pictures or put the blame publicly but these guys have been defaming me and my family and even bringing up my children and that’s not cool.”</p>
<ol start="25">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Poor Dave 🙁</p>
<p>Oh yeah, about “these pictures” — he shared some photos with the site of a cut on his hand and some bruising on his arm, and also a dent in his door that all came from the alleged coat rack attack.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Good Luck</p>
<p>He concluded his statement by saying “I’m going to wait for my day in court and let my injuries, my house, and my self-defense plea do the talking, hopefully, the judge understands my side and my wife, my kids and myself are allowed to move forward.”</p>
<ol start="27">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>So. Much.</p>
<p>So there’s an awful lot to unpack here, right?</p>
<ol start="28">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping Quiet(ish)</p>
<p>Like it’s interesting that he never even mentions the pistol, right? That could definitely be at the advice of his lawyer, but it’s still weird because it’s such an important detail.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>Interesting …</p>
<p>Is his story really that he was just hanging out, looking for his keys when Jenelle pulled up with two guys and after David asked them about the keys, he asked them politely to leave and one of them grabbed a coat rack and tried to hit him with it?</p>
<ol start="30">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>So Tough</p>
<p>And in self-defense, he pulled out a gun, hit the guy twice with it, and told him “I will blow your f–king brains out”?</p>
<ol start="31">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>This Guy</p>
<p>David likes to play the victim after he does something terrible — remember when he actually cried in an interview about killing Nugget and tried to say that he didn’t understand that it was wrong to murder your wife’s dog?

“The ramp&hellip;was very long &amp; steep, had no handrail and, most importantly, was very slippery,” he wrote on Twitter. “The last thing I was going to do is “fall” for the Fake News to have fun with.”
