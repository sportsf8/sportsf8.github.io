<p>Kurt Thomas, the U.S.’ first world champion in gymnastics and an Olympian, died Friday at age 64 after previously suffering a stroke, his family said.</p>
<p>Thomas had a stroke May 24, caused by a tear of the basilar artery in the brain stem.</p>
<p>“I lost my universe, my best friend and my soulmate of 24 years,” his wife, Beckie, said, according to International Gymnast. “Kurt lived his life to the extreme, and I will be forever honored to be his wife.”</p>
<p>Thomas, after competing at the 1976 Olympics, became the first American to win a gold medal at the world championships, taking the floor exercise title in 1978. Thomas had flu-like symptoms and was so dizzy that he considered withdrawing.</p>
<p>Thomas said he was told there was a delay before the medal ceremony because organizers in Strasbourg, France, did not have the “Star-Spangled Banner” handy, given the U.S.’ lack of success in the sport.</p>
<p>“I was singing the national anthem, and at the end of it I closed my eyes, and I dropped my head and I remembered that moment, and I can still remember that moment to this day,” Thomas said in his 2003 International Gymnastics Hall of Fame induction speech. “Jim McKay said something at the end. He goes, ‘And now the question is asked, is all the work and all the deprivation worth it? The answer is yes in this moment.’ And that is one of the greatest moments of my life.”</p>
<p>He earned another six medals at the 1979 World Championships, a U.S. record for medals at a single worlds that Simone Biles tied in 2018. The haul included floor exercise and high bar titles, plus a silver medal in the all-around in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>Thomas also won U.S. all-around titles in 1976, 1977 and 1978 before graduating from Indiana State in 1979.</p>
<p>“He is taking a sport and grafting on new elements to make it an art,” the New York Times reported in 1979. “He is men’s gymnastics’ Baryshnikov.”</p>
<p>After the U.S. boycotted the 1980 Moscow Games, he retired.</p>
<p>“People talk to me all the time, ‘Aren’t you really still bitter about that Olympic thing? You could have been Olympic gold medalist,'” Thomas said in 2003. “I say, ‘Yeah, but you know, I went to the world championships and I won. I went to the Olympics, and I’m an Olympian.”</p>
<p>Thomas came back for a 1992 Olympic bid, becoming the oldest gymnast in history to make the U.S. national team at age 36, but was not chosen for the Barcelona Games. His work in retirement included coaching.</p>
<p>Thomas, who reportedly appeared on The Johnny Carson Show five times, continues to be referred to often during gymnastics broadcasts, given he invented a popular pommel horse skill – the Thomas flair. He also debuted the Thomas salto on floor.</p>
<p>“When [Olympic teammate] Bart [Conner] mentions on TV [commentary], there’s the Thomas flair or there’s the Thomas on floor, those little things are what make my life now,” Thomas said in 2003. “These kinds of things are tremendous.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>Kurt Thomas was a fierce rival, who went on to become a cherished friend. Proud to have been your teammate! Sending hugs to his wife Beckie, his children, Hunter, Kassidy and Kurt as well as the entire gymnastics community, who lost a true pioneer today.

<h3 id="who-belongs-on-the-mount-rushmore-of-montana-sports">&ldquo;Who belongs on the Mount Rushmore of Montana sports?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/977766a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4398x2309+0+83/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd5%2F76%2F0dd7d7c94ca4bc26f1739e9f8caa%2Fmount-rushmore.jpg" alt="img">
Who are the four biggest sports figures in Montana history?</p>
<p>It seems like an impossible task to narrow the list to determine a Mount Rushmore of Montana sports, especially given how wide the criteria can be. Should people like Dennis Erickson or Jud Heathcote be atop the Montana mountain, even though much of their sports résumés were built outside of the Treasure State? Or should legendary high school coaches like Jack Johnson or Jim Street be canonized? What about athletes like Elvis Old Bull, Brock Osweiler or Marc Mariani, who had varying degrees of success among their moments of fame?</p>
<p>The list might look differently in five, 10 or 20 years as athletes like Jess Lockwood, who has already won two PBR world championships, continue their careers. Lockwood is certainly trending toward becoming one of the most-decorated athletes in Montana history, but his legacy hasn&rsquo;t yet withstood the test of time like the candidates outlined below.</p>
<p>We’ve narrowed the list, selecting the male figures we thought were necessary inclusions in the retelling of Montana’s sports history (we’ll vote on female candidates later), but we’re leaving the final four up to you. Read highlights on each male candidate below and click here to cast your vote for the individual you believe undoubtedly belongs on the Mount Rushmore of Montana sports. If you wish to cast a vote for somebody not included in this poll, please email <a href="mailto:sports@ktvh.com">sports@ktvh.com</a>.</p>

<p>Gene Davis &ndash; Missoula&rsquo;s Davis is one of the greatest wrestlers in Montana history. He was the state&rsquo;s first four-time high school state champion and later became a three-time all-American at Oklahoma State, winning an NCAA championship in 1966.

<h3 id="ian-thorpe-i-wish-michael-phelps-was-a-bit-older">&ldquo;Ian Thorpe: I wish Michael Phelps was a bit older&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/luXm0B5Ra9keU7wsPAGqqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTExNzg7aD02NjI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Vi_hU0buwCjTRS6jmC8jGw--~B/aD0zMzE7dz01ODk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/nbcsports.com/96424ba9997f05a806971c5046d7cd16" alt="img">
Ian Thorpe, the world’s best swimmer before Michael Phelps came along, reflected on his rivalry with Phelps, his early retirement and more on a podcast with Australian Olympic teammate and swim coach Brett Hawke published Monday.</p>
<p>Thorpe won his first world title at age 15 in 1998, then earned three gold medals and two silvers as one of the most scrutinized athletes at the Sydney Games in 2000.</p>
<p>His Olympic career ended at age 21 in 2004, when he won another two gold medals, including the “Race of the Century” 200m freestyle final over Dutchman Pieter van den Hoogenband and Phelps. Phelps was 19 at the time.</p>
<p>“I may regret saying this, but I kind of wish Michael Phelps was kind of a little bit older,” Thorpe said on the podcast. “It would have challenged me. I would have had someone else there.”</p>
<p>Phelps revered Thorpe’s ability to perform under pressure as a teenager. Phelps also took motivation from Australian swim coach Don Talbot waving off suggestions that he could challenge Thorpe’s supremacy in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Phelps’ ascension compared to Thorpe showed at the 2003 World Championships. Phelps, among three individual titles, won the 200m individual medley in 1:56.04, taking 1.9 seconds off his own world record at the meet. Thorpe earned silver in an Australian record, but a full two body lengths and 3.62 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Thorpe didn’t swim the 200m IM at the 2004 Olympics, but Phelps ventured into his territory by entering the 200m free and coming away with a hard-earned bronze in an American record.</p>
<p>“I have the utmost respect for Michael, what he was doing in [individual] medley, but then when he started doing it in freestyle as well, that is when I really went, wow, he was extraordinary,” said Thorpe, who called van den Hoogenband his toughest competitor (Thorpe and van den Hoogenband dueled more often than Thorpe and Phelps). “I wish that, you know, our careers overlapped a little bit more than what they did. … It’s like, be careful what you wish for, right?”</p>

<p>Thorpe intended to go for the 2008 Beijing Olympics after a break from swimming, but he never again swam on the major international stage, announcing retirement in 2006.</p>
<p>“There was no privacy around me being able to train,” Thorpe said. “When it came that I was getting papped at training, I was like, if I can’t even have this to myself, I don’t want the other part of it.”</p>
<p>Thorpe also said that he wanted to train through the Olympic cycle and skip the 2007 World Championships in Melbourne, but that “quite a few people” said he needed to race worlds if he had 2008 Olympic intentions.</p>
<p>“I moved on,” Thorpe said. “I made a decision that, yeah, I wouldn’t swim anymore because I wanted to feel like I had my life back.”</p>
<p>Thorpe’s enduring greatness can be measured in the fact that his 400m free personal best from 2002 remains the second-fastest time in history, bettered only in 2009 by .01 by German Paul Biedermann, who was racing in a now-banned super suit.</p>
<p>But Thorpe said it’s the men’s 200m freestyle that has become stagnant. None of the top 11 times in history were recorded in the time since the 2012 Olympics. Thorpe’s best time — from 2001 — would have won each of the last four world championships and the 2016 Olympic title.</p>
<p>“Basically, everyone in the world is swimming the 200m freestyle the wrong way,” he said. “You cannot swim easily for 150 meters, and then go into a sprint. I don’t care who your coach that is telling you that, you’re going to limit what time you can potentially do. At the moment, while the entire field sits across at the same speed, anyone who steps up in this race will win it if they’re within that realm. If you’re in the final at the moment, you can win at the Olympics next year. It’s about putting more speed into the earlier part of it, and it’s about making yourself hurt more. You have to be willing to deal with the pain that is going to exist for the last 50 meters.”</p>

<h3 id="as-black-athletes-we-cannot-perform-our-way-to-equality">&ldquo;“As black athletes, we cannot perform our way to equality”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.athleticsweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chris-Lambert-2003-European-U23-by-Mark-Shearman.jpg" alt="img">
Former sprinter Chris Lambert on how the voices of the crowd need to be heard outside of the athletics stadium when it comes to the struggle for civil rights</p>
<p>At the 1936 Olympic Games, Jesse Owens won four gold medals in the literal beating heart of rising Nazi Germany. His performances towered over the fallacy of the regime’s assertion of racial superiority, and the combination of his victories and sheer contextual magnificence will surely be remembered for as long as there is sport.</p>
<p>The NAACP would have preferred he had not gone at all, arguing that combatting the rhetoric of one racist regime by representing another one would be a hollow victory. After all, Owens still had to seek out “blacks only” restaurants and hotels when travelling with his college team in the US. And as he put it:</p>
<p>“When I came back to my native country, after all the stories about Hitler, I couldn’t ride in the front of the bus. I had to go to the back door. I couldn’t live where I wanted. I wasn’t invited to shake hands with Hitler, but I wasn’t invited to the White House to shake hands with the President, either.”</p>
<p>At the 1968 Olympics, Tommie Smith won gold in the 200m, breaking the world record with his arms out 10m from the finish line (not unlike someone else who would sear that image into our minds 40 years later). Smith and his fellow black compatriot John Carlos stood atop the podium with heads bowed and a single fist raised, sheathed in a black glove, in protest at the continued systemic racism back home in the US.</p>
<p>Smith had originally pressed for a boycott of the Games unless certain conditions were met, but when this failed to gain traction, he and Carlos – the two clear global favourites for the gold medal – decided a display of courage and dignity that has become one of the most famous political sporting protests there has ever been.</p>
<p>“Equality should always only ever be seen as the base standard of how things should be, not something for which its beneficiaries should feel grateful”</p>
<p>When I was 15 I finished second in the English Schools Championships in Sheffield, earning my first international colours. On the train home from Sheffield to London I went to the food car and, after I’d paid for whatever I ordered, the attendant – eyeing my gleaming new England tracksuit up and down – said, “good for you; you don’t always have the best of it do you, your kind?” I know to this day he meant well.</p>
<p>When I was 18 I travelled to Neubrandenburg, a small town in northeast Germany, for an U19 fixture GB vs Germany vs France. I ran the fastest 200m time for an under-20 in the world that year. Walking into town from the hotel with several members of the very diverse team to find some food, the sole black member of the German team came running out of a restaurant waving his arms at us. “Don’t be here! Don’t be here! Very bad area for Nazis. If they see you…” and he made the universally-understood motion of drawing his thumb across his neck. “But you’re here,” I said. “I’m with the team. They’re white,” he said, running back across the street to his Bavarian steakhouse.</p>
<p>While we debated our next course of action, egos clashing with hunger and common sense, someone in our ranks alerted us to a group of men in the steakhouse car park watching us very closely, including one in camouflage fatigues standing sentry in the bushes. We fled, at not inconsiderable speed, chased by men hurling abuse (presumably) from scooters. Back at the dorms we laughed, bravado winning out. We peered through the windows into the dark throughout the night, scanning for threats.</p>
<p>When I was 20 I went to the Universiade in Beijing. After four rounds in punishing late summer dry heat I took bronze in the 100m. On a trip out to pay homage to Tiananmen Square, I found myself in the way of photos being taken by a Chinese family. I apologised and moved, but found myself in the way again. It took one more act of this dance for me to realise that I was the picture. “NBA! NBA!” they said effusively. Well, I was wearing Air Jordan shorts, I thought. I posed with their children.</p>
<p>When I was 22 I broke the championship record at the European U23 Championships in Bydgoszcz, a small town in northern Poland. Some people were going to explore the area after, but I wasn’t going snooping about in Eastern Europe – I knew better by then. Likewise on later travels to Latvia, Estonia, Serbia.</p>
<p>These are just stories. There’s nothing remarkable about them, nothing that will stand tall in the global conscience; but in a way this is the remarkable thing about them. Talk to black athletes and you will hear all sorts of tales of the ignominies and indignities suffered in pursuit of a place to ply their trade, especially in the small towns off the well-trodden path of the premiere events circuit.</p>
<p>Except no one is talking to black athletes about these things.</p>
<p>Once we step off the track, once our job is done in lending our personal glory to that of our nation or sponsor, our value is soon often clearly reduced once again to the perceptions we carry via the colour of our skin. In each of the examples above I was a winner, an exemplar of proficiency in my field, and yet these things mean nothing to some people when compared to the way my skin reacts to the sun.</p>
<p>Jesse Owens was originally not taken by the protest of Smith and Carlos. He said: “The black fist is a meaningless symbol. When you open it, you have nothing but fingers – weak, empty fingers. The only time the black fist has significance is when there’s money inside. There’s where the power lies.”</p>
<p>I disagree with the assertion that the symbol is meaningless, but do I agree that once the fist was opened, it was found that there was no power inside.</p>
<p>As black athletes, we cannot perform our way to equality. Since Jesse Owens became a beacon of black excellence, the prowess of black athletes has been ambassadorial, serving to demand equality of respect around the planet. However, John Carlos turned 75 last week, on June 5, 2020, and on June 6, 2020, I knelt in Parliament Square with head bowed and one fist raised, sheathed in a black glove, still protesting against the treatment of black citizens at home and abroad.</p>
<p>“Too often the progress black athletes make in sport is used to whitewash the discrimination they face”</p>
<p>Athletics is an excellent sport for equality in so many ways. Our sport is as close to a meritocracy as any other profession I know. There are eight lanes on the track – if you are fast enough to have a lane, you get the opportunity to see if you are fast enough to earn the prize. Athletes are paid according to their station, regardless of considerations of ethnicity or gender. In terms of earning on the basis of performance, it is about as fair as a job can get.</p>
<p>Too often the progress black athletes make in sport is used to whitewash the discrimination they face. There stirs in the muddy waters a lingering viewpoint that things cannot be that bad in society if black athletes are able to win medals, travel the world, wear national colours, and cash in on their abilities.</p>
<p>We earn these medals. This is our world. These are our nations. These are our abilities.</p>
<p>The fact that black athletes earn equality of pay and representation is undoubtedly a victory over the times in which Owens and Smith returned home from taking Olympic golds with world records only to struggle to earn, but it should never be seen as a bonus. Equality should always only ever be seen as the base standard of how things should be, not something for which its beneficiaries should feel grateful.</p>
<p>That is how progress is enshrined. Yet we’re still never too far from the feeling of lingering resentment. The scent in the air that although our performances enrich all attached to the sport, we should somehow be grateful for the equality we deserve and earn.</p>
<p>Matt Shirvington, Craig Pickering, Christophe Lemaitre, Matthew Boling. This list of brilliantly talented athletes is sullied by the way the media, and subsequently thousands of shepherded minds, exalt their performance based on the colour of their skin. It is absolutely no fault of these athletes themselves, but giving a man the title of “great white hope” can only serve to notify black athletes that you hope and wish there would be a white man taking home the top prize.</p>
<p>Ours is a sport blessed with a truly internationally accommodating community, enabling people of all states to step out of whatever darknesses exists at home, and stand in the light afforded them by their own dedication and blessings. We should celebrate this. However we should also remember that when these athletes step back out of the light and return home, things are not always what they should be.</p>
<p>Do not let the energy you give to equality in sport be dependent upon an arena of performance. We cannot perform our way to equality. Just as you do your best to welcome the equality of athletes on the track and in the field, remember the job is not done there. Once the dreamy stadium lights go out, we’re all back into the harsh light of reality, and that is where the spotlight really needs to shine and the voices of the crowd really need to be heard.</p>

<h3 id="5-on-your-side-countdown--the-top-10-st-louis-olympians-of-all-time">&ldquo;5 On Your Side Countdown | The top 10 St. Louis Olympians of all-time&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.ksdk.com/assets/KSDK/images/dba91b1f-1f24-43a4-bdd4-354df6ce48a8/dba91b1f-1f24-43a4-bdd4-354df6ce48a8_1140x641.jpg" alt="img">
Our town has produced some of the greatest Olympic athletes in American history. But who makes the top 10? Check out our countdown</p>
<p>ST. LOUIS — We&rsquo;ve been doing some serious all-time ranking at 5 On Your Side while the COVID-19 pandemic has most of the sports world on pause.</p>
<p>This week, sports director Frank Cusumano rolls out his list of the top 10 Olympic athletes from St. Louis.</p>
<p>These are the best of the best. Some of the greatest Olympic athletes in American history have come from our town. But who cracks the top 10?</p>
<p>Do you agree? Let us know.</p>
<p>10: Lori Chalupny and Becky Sauerbrunn</p>
<p>A dual soccer entry to start things off.</p>
<p>Chalupny got her gold medal in Beijing in 2008, and Sauerbrunn won hers in London in 2012.</p>
<p>9: Al Trost</p>
<p>We keep the soccer theme rolling with Al Trost.</p>
<p>Trost was a star at SLU and chose not to turn pro in 1970 so he could play in the 1972 Olympics. He played in eight games and scored two goals.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s in the hall of fame for a reason.</p>
<p>8: Ken Flach</p>
<p>The late Kirkwood native is one of the greatest tennis players to ever come from St. Louis.</p>
<p>He teamed with Robert Seguso as one of the most dominant doubles pairs ever.</p>
<p>He won the gold medal in Seoul in 1988.</p>
<p>7: Jo Jo White</p>
<p>The pride of McKinley and Vashon is the most decorated basketball player to ever come from St. Louis.</p>
<p>He helped the United States to the gold medal in the 1968 Olympics, going undefeated.</p>
<p>6: Dan Carroll</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a member of the National Speed Skating Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Carroll held nearly every American record during his career. He competed in the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympics.</p>
<p>5: Leon and Michael Spinks</p>
<p>A tandem of brothers unlike any other.</p>
<p>The 1976 Olympics in Montreal was their coming out party.</p>
<p>Leon won the gold in the light-heavyweight division. Michael won gold in the middleweight division.</p>
<p>4: Al Joyner</p>
<p>For a while, he was more famous for being Jackie Joyner-Kersee&rsquo;s brother and Florence Griffith-Joyner&rsquo;s husband. But make no mistake, he was a star in his own right.</p>
<p>In 1984 at the Summer Games in Los Angeles he became the first African American in 80 years to win a golf medal in the triple jump.</p>
<p>3: Dawn Harper-Nelson</p>
<p>She won the gold in 2008 in Beijing in the 100 meter hurdles and won the silver in 2012 in London.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s the first American to ever win a gold in the 100 in an Olympics and still medal in the following Olympics.</p>
<p>2: Tom Jager</p>
<p>Hear of him? You should have.</p>
<p>The pride of Collinsville is one of the most decorated swimmers in recent memory.</p>
<p>He won five gold medals in the 4 x 100 meter relays and a silver and bronze in the 50 meter freestyle. Quite the Olympic career.</p>
<p>1: Jackie Joyner-Kersee</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s not just one of the greatest female athletes in American history. She&rsquo;s one of the greatest athletes in American history. Period.</p>
<p>JJK has three golds, two silvers and two bronze medals over a 12-year Olympic career in the heptathlon and long jump.</p>
<p>A legend on the track and in her community.</p>

<h3 id="high-school-athletes-of-the-year-porter-gaud-swimmer-summerville-two-sport-star-honored">&ldquo;High School Athletes of the Year: Porter-Gaud swimmer, Summerville two-sport star honored&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/ef/5ef5adf0-a760-11ea-9cbd-a36147ac10bb/5eda9912babc7.image.png?resize=1116%2C630" alt="img">
Successful athletes have a burning desire to excel, derived from a competitive spirit. Often, that competitive drive comes from a strong family support system, which can include a long line of athletes who serve as motivation from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Porter-Gaud’s Elysse Pardus and Summerville’s Brody Hopkins, The Post and Courier&rsquo;s High School Athletes of the Year for 2019-20, were pushed to excellence from an early age by sports-minded families. That extra push enabled both to be among the best in their respective sports.</p>
<p>Pardus leaves Porter-Gaud as the most dominant swimmer in the history of the South Carolina Independent Schools Association (SCISA), racking up more than 20 individual gold medals in state meet competition and establishing eight state records.</p>
<p>Headed for Auburn University in August, Pardus helped lead Porter-Gaud to five consecutive state championships.</p>
<p>“The team championships are what I am most proud of,” Pardus says. “I mean I enjoy winning my own events, but I know that winning my races is helping the team win. Swimming is a lot of individual competition, but the team stuff matters a lot to me.”</p>
<p>Pardus also has excelled as a year-round swimmer, competing at the highest amateur level. It was a wager with her mother that pushed then 10-year-old Elysse into a more competitive swimming environment.</p>
<p>Jayne Pardus, a former golfer at the University of Kentucky who currently competes professionally, took to the pool against her daughter to prove a point.</p>
<p>“She challenged me to four 50-yard races in the pool, four different strokes, and said if I could beat her in three events, then I could do what I wanted,” explained Pardus, whose father excelled in baseball and hockey. “Well, we ended up each winning two, so I had to agree to try moving up to tougher (swimming) competition. It all worked out great for me. I have always been thankful that she saw the potential in me and wanted me to do special things.”</p>
<p>Younger sister Kaila has another year left at Porter-Gaud, and she, too, has been highly decorated in the pool.</p>
<p>“We swim opposite events, so we’re not actually competing against each other, but we definitely are motivated by how each of us does,” Elysse said. “We have a very healthy, competitive relationship. I want her to win her events, and she wants me to win my events.”</p>
<p>For Hopkins, a 6-4 receiver in football and outfielder/pitcher in baseball, there was never the option to do anything other than sports. His father, Tim, played baseball at Summerville and USC Aiken. He had an aunt on his mother’s side who played basketball at LSU, and several men in her family were high-profile athletes as well.</p>
<p>Older brother T.J. played football and baseball at Summerville before moving on to South Carolina as a baseball star and eventual draft pick of the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
<p>“Sports is really all I’ve known for as long as I can remember,” said Brody, who will play baseball at College of Charleston. “My parents would play softball when I was really little, and I was always there, always around the game. We are a competitive family, and sports really brings us all together.”</p>
<p>Hopkins earned all-state and All-Lowcountry honors last fall in football. He averaged better than 24 yards per reception over the last two seasons and could have opted to play football in college.</p>
<p>“I love football, love the competition and the Friday nights out on the field, but baseball always has been No. 1 with me,” Hopkins said. “I do think about football sometimes, though, wondering how good I could have been if I had just focused on football. It’s all good, though. I’m doing what I want to do.”</p>
<p>In baseball, Hopkins uses his athleticism and length to his advantage in the outfield and on the mound. He also uses the success of his older brother as motivation. He doesn’t want to be as good as his brother - he wants to be better.</p>
<p>“Whatever he did in middle school ball, I wanted to do even better,” he said. “Whatever he did on the varsity, I wanted to do more. I look up to him as my inspiration, but I want to be better than he was. That’s not easy. He’s really good.”</p>
<p>The Post and Courier did not select All-Lowcountry teams for spring sports this year since those seasons were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="paralympics-new-zealand-announce-grant-funds-for-young-athletes">&ldquo;Paralympics New Zealand announce grant funds for young athletes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.insidethegames.biz/media/image/63547/o/PNZ+2.jpg" alt="img">
Paralympics New Zealand (PNZ) has announced it has been granted funds from the Ministry for Sport and Recreation&rsquo;s Discretionary Fund and will now distribute cash to young Para-athletes.</p>
<p>Those between the ages of 12 and 18 with an impairment eligible for Para-sport can apply to receive part of the grant.</p>
<p>Organisations supporting athletes can also apply for the funding, which can help towards providing equipment, subscriptions, access to facilities, coaching, camps and other fees.</p>
<p>It is part of PNZ&rsquo;s campaign of &ldquo;Excellence and Equity through Sport&rdquo; which aims to provide opportunities for disabled sport when it cannot be provided elsewhere.</p>
<p>Chief executive of PNZ, Fiona Allan, said: &ldquo;We are pleased to be working with the Minister for Sport and Recreation to provide an opportunity to grow participation and development of Para-sport in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well documented that disabled people have more barriers to increasing their participation than non-disabled people, financial barriers being one of these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fund will allow individuals and organisations that ordinarily struggle to get funding to utilise financial support that will ensure more young people are able to have positive, rewarding Para-sport experiences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Zealand has had 209 Paralympians represent our country at a Paralympic Games since 1968, with many more young Para-athletes aspiring to do the same as their sporting heroes and build on their success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the National Paralympic Committee for New Zealand it is our goal to increase participation in Para-sport and work with organisations to provide opportunities for Para-athletes throughout New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are pleased to hear the announcement from @SportNZ providing relief for struggling local and regional sport and recreation organisations. We encourage our member organisations who are eligible for the Community Resilience Fund to apply.https://t.co/HgyknKxD1s#SpiritofGold pic.twitter.com/1ZiwtoYN92 — Paralympics New Zealand (@ParalympicsNZ) May 6, 2020</p>
<p>It comes after Sport New Zealand also provided relief for local and regional sport during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Applications for the grant are open now and will close on June 24.</p>
<p>New Zealand enjoyed its best Paralympics at Rio 2016 with nine golds and 21 medals in total.</p>
<p>The medal haul was the country&rsquo;s best since the 1984 New York Paralympics where the nation won 24, including eight golds.</p>
<p>Three of the gold medals in Rio came from the nation&rsquo;s most successful Paralympian, swimmer Sophie Pascoe.
