<p>Space Force It’s Good to Be Back on the Moon Season 1 Episode 9 Editor’s Rating 2 stars * * « Previous Next » Photo: Aaron Epstein/Netflix</p>
<p>It would have been nice if Space Force had built to the climax of this penultimate episode, with its history-making moment for the first black person (and first woman) to set foot on the moon. The writers seem to embrace what a major moment this would be in history, adding only a bit of humor to the joyous moment. Angela Ali saying “It’s good to be black on the moon” instead of “back” is funny enough, and it’s a nice detail that her new BFF Chan is the only one who chuckles, in a way that shows honest affection. And the moment that follows, in which the accidental astronauts jump and dance on the lunar surface, contains actual joy. It’s just too bad the preceding episode and most of this one makes it feel like the series has limped to this climax instead of building to it.</p>
<p>It opens with Space Force introducing the men and women going to the moon, including trained cadets, like Angela, and people who are primarily there to fill suits, like Eddie. The press conference doesn’t please F-Tony, but even he understands how much of the world would pay attention to the first woman on the moon. This is a social media manager’s dream come true. Later in the episode, Ali struggles over what to say to the world, having a fun conversation with Chan about options like, “There goes the neighborhood.” She settles on the solid, “It’s good to be back on the moon.” The United States hasn’t put feet on the moon since 1972. It would be major if it happened again.</p>
<p>So this unexpected group takes off with most of them panicking in their own way. The (relatively) successful launch gives General Naird the adrenaline to ask out Kelly King, and it’s a genuinely nice moment because Steve Carell and Jessica St. Clair have solid chemistry both as a couple and comedically. However, happiness is short-lived, because China makes a power play on the moon, claiming the Sea of Tranquility for their research. That just happens to be where American astronauts are supposed to land in a couple days.</p>
<p>At first, Mallory tries diplomacy with a Chinese scientist who belittles him (comparing his name to a duck) and sends him spinning. The generally level-headed scientist basically wants to now employ Naird’s former suggestion of “bomb” to solve their problem. On a smarter show it would be fun to consider how Mallory and Naird have switched places since episode two, revealing how maybe they have more in common than they first suspected.</p>
<p>The mission is derailed further with the news that Eddie Broser is a convicted criminal. It turns out that F-Tony didn’t really vet anyone and Brad doesn’t seem to understand what the word means. The funniest scene in the episode takes place when Tony interrogates the astronauts halfway to the moon and finds out one has a grandfather who is an Irish terrorist, and another has dressed in blackface. It’s a funny concept that results in a funny scene, but then it’s just dropped for the rest of the episode. (Although could come up in the finale. Probably not.)</p>
<p>Cut to the date between Kelly and Mark at a nice-looking place called the Backwoods Inn. They drove far from base, and Kelly presumes it’s because Mark isn’t allowed to date her, but learns that it’s more because he’s worried how Erin is going to react. She doesn’t take it well. Mark tries to break the news to his daughter gently but then Kelly walks into the kitchen, in classic sitcom style, and Erin freaks out. She rushes to the prison only to learn that not only is mom fine with it, it was her idea … and mom is dating a guard named Louise. Erin spirals out, confronting dad about how he will have even less time for her now. Again, there’s a decent but underdeveloped idea here: Erin isn’t upset about a new mother figure, but she is upset about losing her closest friend in her father. Although there’s irony to her complaint that she only gets 40 seconds with dad when she needs him, given her limited screen time this season.</p>
<p>Back to the control center, where everyone is scrambling over what to do about the Chinese. Naird speaks to a Chinese General, and basically doesn’t get anywhere. He does learn that the Chinese took heavy equipment to the moon. Why? To build a little station that looks like it’s made of light material? They look at the satellite footage again and spot the reason a few hundred miles away: a drilling operation for H3, an unlimited source of energy that could power the country for a year with one cargo hold. They’re trying to hide an illegal drilling operation. Space Force won’t let them.</p>
<p>Ali and her team land right where they were planning to land and Naird tells her to take the moment. Again, it should have more power, but the joyous dance after the snafu is kind of fun. And then the Chinese go and knock over the flag from Apollo 11 in retaliation. POTUS is going to go on a tweetstorm about that.</p>
<p>Launch Codes</p>
<p>• Yes, the Apollo 11 flag is still there.</p>
<p>• Wondering if H3 is a real thing? Apparently it is, although there’s some controversy over if it’s truly a viable energy source.</p>
<p>• The way Tony tried to steer the press conference felt as close to political satire as this show has gotten in how it reflected the way Trump has been speaking to reporters for years, but particularly during the pandemic. Tony’s “What a great answer to a terrible question” and threatening to break a reporter who asks something serious felt very reflective of the current White House’s relationship to the press. Let’s get more of that.</p>
<p>• I really hope that the Kelly/Mark thing isn’t just designed to give Erin drama. Not only does Jessica St. Clair deserve more than that, but she has nice chemistry with Carell and the show could use a new energy like hers at times.</p>
<p>• One episode left! It’s probably going to be about Mark reconciling with his daughter and punishing the Chinese for knocking down the American flag. And maybe space chimps. Who knows?

<h3 id="ride-sally-ride">&ldquo;Ride, Sally Ride&rdquo;</h3>

Editor’s Note: Today was a great day for Americans in space. SpaceX became the first private corporation to launch people in space as Dragon capsule blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center, carrying two NASA astronauts up, up and away from United States soil for the first time in nearly a decade. As it hurtled towards the International Space Center, the day’s hurrahs extended to another space milestone. Today, May 30, 2020 also would have been the 68th birthday of Sally Ride, the first US woman in space. She died of pancreatic cancer at age 61 on July 23, 2012 at her La Jolla, Calif. home She joined NASA in late 1978 and soared into space on the space shuttle Challenger on June 18, 1983.</p>
<p>Sally Ride died at San Diego in 2012. I conducted the first interview with her when I was at the Clear Lake Daily Citizen. (I also interviewed Tom Wolfe when he had just finished “The Right Stuff” at the same time.)</p>
<p>Lou Wortham sent me. He was a former city editor for both the Houston Chronicle and Houston Post who got term limited out into the boondocks, namely Clear Lake City, just outside the Johnson Space Center in western Galveston County, Texas. I was his trusty Sancho Panza, at least one of three reporters, two of whom were young women he didn’t trust and couldn’t stand.</p>
<p>Wortham had a twisted old school journalist’s sense of humor, and proper place. Among my more mundane duties, he made me editor of the society and religion page. Really? Apparently, he did it just because he thought it was so frickin’ funny, he could laugh his as off every day.</p>
<p>Think ‘Front Page’ with Lou sitting at his desk growling in undertones about the Rotary Club president tool of a publisher out to subvert the press for lousy cash money. Lou was tenacious about the news, competitive the way they were back then. He loved beating the other papers every which way he could. Nothing satisfied him more than seeing one of our articles appear a few days later in the Chronicle or Post. We got those suckers again, he would yell with glee.</p>
<p>Somehow, Wortham got wind of the first woman in the astronaut program, arranged an interview and sent me over to the space center. He was impressed she was from Stanford, but wondered how she would fare among the macho space men in the program. He wanted to find out all about her including if she were butch.</p>
<p>Fair enough, over the long, flat road to the space center, a collection of research-looking buildings and huge mega-warehouses. They ushered me into a small book- and report-line office where I met Ms. Ride.</p>
<p>The conversation lasted 20-30 minutes and I would be curious to find a copy of the article. She considered herself a scientist among the air force pilots, but had been motivated from early youth to be an astronaut, she said. When the space program expanded its astronaut base to include six women, she applied and was accepted.</p>
<p>Ride said was just one member of the team. She felt a bit uncomfortable being singled out just because she was a woman, but also wanted to inspire young girls growing up with the example they could do anything, she said.</p>
<p>Ride was ruggedly attractive, a little nervous because it was her first official interview, and interesting enough. Not knowing the future, we were unaware she would be the first US woman in space on the seventh shuttle flight in June 1983. Oh well.</p>
<p>Wortham debriefed me when I returned with the all usual questions. Was she a troll? How smart was she? What da ya think? 30. Cool.</p>
<p>That’s about it for the tale. However, interestingly enough, not soon afterwards, I was dispatched to the scene of a local bookstore where one Tom frickin’ Wolfe was holding court. He had finished “The Right Stuff and was doing a book signing of some other more pedestrian effort, don;t even remember its name.</p>
<p>As always, Wolfe was dapper beyond belief with the trademark white suit, all white everything and some kind of a cocky hat. Of course, he was quite interesting. He also was quite eclectic. The crowd was – shall we say – sparse and we spoke for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The first major topic, as one might suspect, was about the space program and the men who made it. He was fascinated by the top flight attitude, the test pilot mentality of the men, as I recall just here just now for the first time in years. He liked their ladies for being so strong. I asked him a few questions about the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, because the Merry Pranksters once rolled through our part of town.</p>
<p>Major topic #2 was a bit of a surprise, or maybe shouldn’t have been. Wolfe went on in great, and individual, detail about the merits and faults of every Mexican restaurant within a 20-mile radius of Clear Lake City. He really was into that stuff. Really. I can take Mexican food or leave it, but Tom Wolfe thought the Tex-Mex stuff was so amazingly great, awesomeand so forth.</p>
<p>I rendered a few complimentary comments about his attire, which he thought was a bit much for the current midsummer mid-afternoon South Texas milieu. And so it went.</p>
<p>Wolfe died at age 88 on May 14, 2018; but Ride, Sally Ride, rode off in our hearts and minds, prayers and thoughts along with SpaceX to the International Space Center today. More power to her and the dream of mankind finding peace and progress in space despite the challenges on Earth. She is, as Sun Ra liked to say, traveling the spaceways, so to you girl, good speed.

<p><img src="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/wh.gov-share-img_03-1024x538.png" alt="img">
Kennedy Space Center</p>
<p>Cape Canaveral, Florida</p>
<p>5:16 P.M. EDT</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. Please. Please. Big day. This is a big day. And I want to thank our great Vice President for your fearless and tireless commitment to fulfilling America’s destiny in space. Thank you very much, Mike. Great job. Great job. (Applause.)</p>
<p>We’re also grateful to Mike’s wonderful wife, Karen, for being here and for all she does for our country. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Before going further on this exciting day for all America in space, I want to say a few words about the situation in Minnesota. The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger, and grief.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spoke to George’s family and expressed the sorrow of our entire nation for their loss. I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack, and menace. Healing, not hatred; justice, not chaos are the mission at hand. (Applause.)</p>
<p>The police officers involved in this incident have been fired from their jobs. One officer has already been arrested and charged with murder. State and federal authorities are carrying out an investigation to see what further charges may be warranted, including against, sadly, the other three.</p>
<p>In addition, my administration has opened a civil rights investigation, and I have asked the Attorney General and the Justice Department to expedite it.</p>
<p>I understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protesters, and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace.</p>
<p>The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters, and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical left-wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses, and burning down buildings.</p>
<p>The main victims of this horrible, horrible situations are the citizens who live in these once lovely communities. The mobs are devastating the life’s work of good people and destroying their dreams. Right now, America needs creation, not destruction; cooperation, not contempt; security, not anarchy. And there will be no anarchy. Civilization must be cherished, defended, and protected. The voices of law-abiding citizens must be heard, and heard very loudly.</p>
<p>We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities. We must defend the rights of every citizen to live without violence, prejudice, or fear.</p>
<p>We support the overwhelming majority of police officers who are incredible in every way and devoted public servants. They keep our cities safe, protect our communities from gangs and drugs, and risk their own lives for us every day.</p>
<p>No one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect. My administration will stop mob violence and will stop it cold.</p>
<p>It does not serve the interests of justice or any citizen of any race, color, or creed for the government to give into anarchy, abandon police precincts, or allow communities to be burned to the ground. It won’t happen.</p>
<p>Those making excuses or justifications for violence are not helping the downtrodden, but delivering new anguish and new pain.</p>
<p>From day one of my administration, we have made it a top priority to build up distressed communities and revitalize our crumbling inner cities.</p>
<p>We fought hard with Senator Tim Scott and many others to create Opportunity Zones, helping to draw a surge of new investment to the places in our country that need it most. We must all work together as a society to expand opportunity and to create a future of greater dignity and promise for all of our people. We must forge a partnership with community leaders, local law enforcement, and the faith community to restore hope.</p>
<p>Radical-left criminals, thugs, and others all throughout our country and throughout the world will not be allowed to set communities ablaze. We won’t let it happen. It harms those who have the least. And we will be protecting those who have the least.</p>
<p>The leadership of the National Guard and the Department of Justice are now in close communication with state and city officials in Minnesota. And we’re coordinating our efforts with local law enforcement all across our nation.</p>
<p>In America, justice is never achieved at the hands of an angry mob. I will not allow angry mobs to dominate. It won’t happen. It is essential that we protect the crown jewel of American democracy: the rule of law and our independent system of justice. Every citizen in every community has the right to be safe in their workplace, safe in their homes, and safe in our city streets.</p>
<p>This is the sacred right of all Americans that I am totally determined to defend and will defend. My administration will always stand against violence, mayhem, and disorder.</p>
<p>We will stand with the family of George Floyd with the peaceful protesters and with every law-abiding citizen who wants decency, civility, safety, and security.</p>
<p>We are working toward a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down; joining hands, not hurling fists; standing in solidarity, not surrendering to hostility.</p>
<p>Moments ago, as we witnessed the launch of two great American astronauts into space, we were filled with the sense of pride and unity that brings us together as Americans. That same spirit which powered our astronauts to the Moon has also helped lift our country to ever greater heights of justice and opportunity throughout our history.</p>
<p>So today, as we mark a renewed commitment to America’s future in space, a tremendous commitment it is. Let us also commit to a brighter future for all of our citizens right here on Earth.</p>
<p>When Americans are united, there is nothing we cannot do. From day one of my administration, we put America first. (Applause.)</p>
<p>This afternoon, I’m delighted to be with you at Cape Canaveral, in this storied home of American daring, aspiration, and drive.</p>
<p>This is the first big space message in 50 years. Think of that. And it is an honor to be delivering it.</p>
<p>Today, as we gather in this special place to celebrate not only the launch of a new spacecraft but also our nation’s bold and triumphant return to the stars, it’s a special day. Moments ago, the world bore witness to the flight of the first new manned U.S. spacecraft in nearly 40 years since the Space Shuttle launched in 1981 — a long time ago.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to announce that the SpaceX Dragon Capsule has successfully reached low-Earth orbit and that our astronauts are safe and sound. (Applause.)</p>
<p>With this launch, the decades of lost years and little action are officially over. A new age of American ambition has now begun.</p>
<p>Past leaders put the United States at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore. Today, we once again proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world, from right here on American soil. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Those of us who saw the spectacular and unforgettable liftoff this afternoon watched more than an act of history; we watched an act of heroism. Every time our astronauts climb aboard a rocket — which is many, many stories of only engine and fuel — and vault across the sky, they display breathtaking valor.</p>
<p>What Colonel Douglas Hurley and Colonel Robert Behnken did this afternoon was pure American genius and courage. They join the ranks of just seven prior American astronauts who have made the perilous maiden voyage to test a new class of spacecraft.</p>
<p>The names of Hurley and Behnken will stand in the history books alongside those of legends like Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Young. Now these brave and selfless astronauts will continue their mission to advance the cause of human knowledge as they proceed to the International Space Station before returning to Earth. We wish them Godspeed on their journey, and as one proud nation, we salute their fearless service.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you.</p>
<p>I also want to send our nation’s gratitude to the wives of these valiant astronauts, both of whom are astronauts themselves: Karen Nyberg and Megan McArthur. We join them in praying for our heroes’ safe return.</p>
<p>As you know, this spring, our nation has endured the pain and hardship of a global pandemic. As we usher in a new era of manned spaceflight, we are reminded that America is always in the process of transcending great challenges. Our nation is blessed with limitless reserves of talent, tenacity, and resolve. The same spirit of American determination that sends our people into space will conquer this disease on Earth. It should’ve never happened. Nothing — not even gravity itself — can hold Americans down or keep America back.</p>
<p>We are grateful to NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Director of the Kennedy Space Center Bob Cabana for welcoming us this evening. Very special. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Great job. Great job. Come a long way in three and a half years, Jim, haven’t we? Huh? A long way.</p>
<p>To the incredible men and women of NASA, from here at Kennedy Space Center, to the Johnson Space Center in Texas — we love you too — to NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio: Thank you all for working so hard to make this day a reality. We have many other great days almost ready to happen.</p>
<p>Also with us are many members of my Cabinet, including our great new DNI, John Ratcliffe. Thank you, John. Thank you. (Applause.) We have a great friend of mine, a special man, ran a great, great campaign: Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. (Applause.) Thank you, Ron. Thank you, Ron.</p>
<p>Your Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Leader Kevin McCarthy. Kevin, thank you very much. (Applause.) Great job you do, Kevin.</p>
<p>And Representatives Matt Gaetz, John Rutherford, Michael Waltz, Bill Posey, Gus Bilirakis, Daniel Webster, Brian Mast, Elise Stefanik, Bill Flores, Brian Babin, Rodney Davis, Roger Marshall, and Steven Palazzo. Thank you very much, fellas. Thank you. (Applause.) What a great group of people. They’re warriors. They’re really warriors. They helped so much get this done, and so many other things.</p>
<p>With us also is our Air Force Chief of Staff, General David Goldfein. General, thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, General. Thank you. And Chief of Space Operations — the first-ever named — and now a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, because we created the United States Space Force — General Jay Raymond. Thank you very much. Jay. (Applause.) Thank you, Jay. And senior members, also, of our great United States military. It’s never been stronger than it is right now.</p>
<p>Also, Attorney General of Florida, Ashley Moody, and Chief Financial Officer of Florida, Jim Patronis, and many other distinguished guests.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for being here. (Applause.) We appreciate it.</p>
<p>I especially want to congratulate someone who truly embodies the American ethos of big thinking and risk-taking. After achieving success as an Internet entrepreneur, he could have spent his fortune doing anything, including yachting, lots of things. He could do lots of things. But in 2002, he began pouring tens of millions of dollars of his own money into research and development for a new rocket. He’s a little different than a lot of other people. He likes rockets. He assembled a crew of some of the greatest minds and talent in American aerospace.</p>
<p>In the years since, SpaceX has become the first private company to develop and successfully launch its own rocket into orbit, the first to launch and recover its own capsule, and of course, moments ago, Space X became the first private company to put humans into orbit around the Earth.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, congratulations. Congratulations, Elon. (Applause.) Thanks, Elon.</p>
<p>For Elon and 8,000 SpaceX employees, today is the fulfillment of a dream almost two decades in the making. For years on end, they have worked hand-in-hand with NASA, sculpting aluminum, tightening valves, tuning nozzles, testing parachutes, and filling massive tanks with thousands and thousands of pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen.</p>
<p>Today, the groundbreaking partnership between NASA and SpaceX has given our nation the gift of an unmatched power: a state-of-the art spaceship to put our astronauts into orbit at a fraction of the cost of the Space Shuttle. And it’s much better.</p>
<p>From now on, the United States will leverage the fast-growing capabilities of our commercial sector and the finest pieces of real estate on Earth — which you need very badly — to send U.S. astronauts into space.</p>
<p>Under NASA’s Commercial Crew program, we will use rockets and spacecraft designed, built, owned, and launched by private American companies, at a fixed price for the American taxpayer.</p>
<p>Today’s launch makes clear the commercial space industry is the future. The modern world was built by risk-takers and renegades, fierce competitors, skilled craftsmen, captains of industry who pursued opportunities no one else saw and envisioned what no one else could ever think of seeing. The United States will harness the unrivaled creativity and speed of our private sector to stride ever further into the unknown.</p>
<p>This launch also marks an exciting turning point for NASA. This agency will now focus its unmatched ex- — expertise, like nobody has ever seen, and power and integrity to do what NASA does better than anyone else — and it’s not even close: embark on the most difficult, most daring, most audacious missions in the history of humankind.</p>
<p>When I first came into office three and a half years ago, NASA had lost its way, and the excitement, energy, and ambition, as almost everybody in this room knows, was gone. There was grass growing through the cracks of your concrete runways. Not a pretty sight. Not a pretty sight at all.</p>
<p>The last administration presided over the closing of the Space Shuttle and almost all of the giant facility that keeps so many people working, so many brilliant minds going. People were crying. They were devastated. But now it’s the greatest of its kind anywhere in the world and will get greater and greater with years to come. I promise you that. (Applause.)</p>
<p>We have created the envy of the world and will soon be landing on Mars, and will soon have the greatest weapons ever imagined in history. I’ve already seen designs. And even I can’t believe it.</p>
<p>The United States has regained our place of prestige as the world leader. As has often been stated, you can’t be number one on Earth if you are number two in space. (Applause.) And we are not going to be number two anywhere. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Nowhere is this more true than with our military, which we have completely rebuilt. Under my administration, we have invested two and a half trillion dollars in new planes, ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets — anything you can think of. And last year, I signed the law creating the sixth branch of that already very famous United States Armed Forces: the Space Force. (Applause.)</p>
<p>For every citizen who has eagerly waited for America to reignite those engines of will, confidence, and imagination that put a man on the Moon, I stand before you to say: You need wait no longer.</p>
<p>Through NASA’s Artemis program, the United States is preparing for a crewed mission to Mars. Earlier this week, I saw the Orion capsules being worked on in this building. As part of the Artemis Moon-to-Mars program, those capsules will soon return Americans to lunar orbit for the first time in over 50 years — half a century.</p>
<p>By 2024, our astronauts will return to the lunar surface to establish a permanent presence and the launching pad to Mars. (Applause.) And the first woman on the moon will be an American woman. And the first nation to land on Mars will be the United States of America. (Applause.)</p>
<p>Since I signed the order to establish these goals shortly after taking office, we have made rapid gains. A new 22,000- pound capsule is already built. The next generation of space suits are already made. Colossal rockets are now being tested. And the contracts for three separate lunar landers have been awarded and signed, and they are magnificent.</p>
<p>In the years ahead, America will go bigger, bolder, further, faster, and America will go first. America will always be first. (Applause.)</p>
<p>To be certain, we will meet the adversity and hardship along the way. There may even be tragedy, because that is the danger of space. There’s nothing we can do about that. The power that we’re talking about is unrivaled. There’s nothing we can do about problems. But we’ll have very few of them.</p>
<p>We will confront all of those challenges, knowing that the quest for understanding is the oldest and deepest hope in our souls. The innate human desire to explore and innovate is what propels the engines of progress and the march of civilization. We will preserve and persevere, and we will ensure a future of American dominance in space.</p>
<p>To that end, over the last three years, I reestablished the National Space Council. I issued a directive cutting red tape for innovative space companies such as SpaceX. We created the world’s first comprehensive space traffic management system. Last month, I signed an executive order establishing U.S. policy for the recovery and use of space resources and minerals. Administrator Bridenstine announced the Artemis Accords to govern the future of space exploration and development.</p>
<p>Together, we will assert America’s rightful heritage as the greatest space-faring nation on the planet. And already, it’s not even close.</p>
<p>In the half a century since the United States stopped sending astronauts to deep into space — 1972 — no other country has ever done it. The reasons are simple: cost, technological complexity, and tremendous danger.</p>
<p>For instance, I was told that the rocket you just witnessed had to be launched within one second, or it would be impossible for it to hit its target. And I was here two days ago, and I said to Jim: “Jim, it’s okay. Why don’t you wait 5 or 10 minutes?” (Laughter.) And he said, “Sir, we only have a window of one second.” And I walked out of here shaking my head. (Laughter.) Is that true, Jim? Yes, it true.</p>
<p>Space travel is not a feat of engineering alone. It’s also a moral endeavor — a measure of a nation’s vision, its willpower, its place in the world. Exploration is a test of our values and of our faith. America is a nation defined by its commitment to discovery — to solve mysteries, to chart the unknown, to press the limits, to achieve the fullest expression of life’s potential, and to ensure that America is the nation that always leads the way, and especially in space.</p>
<p>This evening, I am more confident than ever before that America stands poised to thrive in this grand undertaking. It’s incredible. We are a nation of pioneers. We are the people who crossed the ocean, carved out a foothold on a vast continent, settled a great wilderness, and then set our eyes upon the stars. This is our history, and this is our destiny.</p>
<p>Now, like our ancestors before us, we are venturing out to explore a new, magnificent frontier. It’s called: space. Our most daring feats, our most epic journeys, our biggest adventures, and our finest days are just beginning. America’s proudest moments are still ahead. We are on the verge of our most exciting years, and next year may be the most exciting of all. You just watch.</p>
<p>So today, as our brave American astronauts shake the Earth and blaze a trail of fire and steel into the heavens, we proclaim for all to hear that we have not yet tested the full strength of the American character, and the world has not yet seen the full glory of the American spirit. For our country, for our children, and for humanity’s march into the stars, the best is yet to come. (Applause.)</p>
<p>It was a great honor for me to deliver this speech. God bless our brave astronauts now soaring through the heavens. God bless the men and women of NASA. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)

<p>An Edinburgh woman was lucky enough to spot the Space X NASA rocket as it soared across the city sky last night.</p>
<p>Katie White, from Silverknows, capture the craft as it headed into orbit on its journey to the International Space Station. The launch in Florida began at exactly 8.22pm UK time, taking around 15-20 minutes before it became visible over the capital.</p>
<p>Although small, Katie&rsquo;s images show the small white craft as it moved eastwards, with clear blue skies creating the perfect conditions to try and spot it rather than Edinburgh&rsquo;s usual heavy cloud.</p>
<p>The rocket passed over Edinburgh at around 8.28pm carrying astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley in the Crew Dragon craft. The flight made history on Saturday after it was the first launch into space from US soil in 9 years.</p>
<p>Katie told Edinburgh Live : &ldquo;The pictures don&rsquo;t do it justice from what we saw flying above us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rocket was also spotted by other onlookers across Scotland, with one woman from Lanarkshire capturing a stunning image of the craft streamlining across the sky.</p>
<p>(Image: The Daily Record)</p>
<p>Heidi Strickland managed to capture what appears to be the Crew Dragon in the skies above her home in Douglas. The photos appear to show trails of smoke coming out the back as the rocket made its ascent into space.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Daily Record, she said: &ldquo;My kids and I were looking out for it since it was launched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We watched it live and heard that the rocket might be visible from Scotland. The kids were so excited when it appeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after lift off, the craft successfully split into two different parts, with the first falling back to Earth and landing perfectly onto NASA&rsquo;s docking ship in the ocean. The second section carrying Behnken and Hurley then carried on into space, and is due to dock at the International Space Station at around 3.29pm this afternoon.</p>
<p>(Image: NASA)</p>
<p>The astronauts will then have to wait a further 2.5 hours in the rocket before the hatches open and they can move into the station after an almost 24 hour journey.</p>
<p>The point of the mission is to test the Crew Dragon craft and check its displays, controls and ability to manouvre. This test will be the final step to allow the project to be certified and accredited by NASA, which will hope to allow more long term and manned missions in the future.

<h3 id="sansa-partners-with-nasa-for-a-deep-space-communications-study">&ldquo;SANSA partners with NASA for a deep space communications study&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://satelliteprome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SANSA.jpg" alt="img">
The study will focus on establishing a ground station in South Africa to support human spaceflight missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond.</p>
<p>The South African National Space Agency (SANSA) has entered into a partnership with US space agency NASA to host a Deep Space Ground Station. The announcement was made at the virtual cabinet meeting held on May 27.</p>
<p>The agreement will see NASA and SANSA collaborate in conducting technical and environmental research on the potential to establish a ground station in South Africa that will support future near-Earth and deep space exploration, including NASA’s planned Artemis mission to send the first woman and the next man to the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p>Commenting on the partnership, Marcus Watkins, Director of the NASA Management Office, said: “Having worked with the South African government on numerous projects in the past, it is fitting to collaborate with SANSA on this study agreement, not only because of the geographical positioning of South Africa but more so the technical capabilities and the consistent quality of work produced by SANSA Space Operations over the years.”</p>
<p>“This agreement will also provide educational opportunities for universities and their students, especially for those interested in space communications and navigation. Depending on the outcomes of the study agreement, long term projects could be implemented soon between SANSA and NASA,” he added.</p>
<p>Valanathan Munsami, the Chief Executive Officer of the SANSA, added: “Continuous research and development are vital in any industry for it to thrive and at the rate and pace the space industry is developing, it’s appropriate for SANSA to partner with NASA on this study agreement.”</p>
<p>Gregory Mann, an International Program Specialist at NASA, remarked: “To do anything important it will take all of us and we welcome South Africa’s participation and contribution. Space is for everyone and we need to work together to solve future issues.”

<h3 id="elmira-nativeretired-nasa-astronaut-eileen-collins-excited-for-spacex-launch-future-of-space-exploration">&ldquo;Elmira native/retired NASA astronaut Eileen Collins excited for SpaceX launch, future of space exploration&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.mytwintiers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2020/04/GettyImages-52758346.jpg?w=1280&amp;h=720&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
(WETM) – Elmira native and retired NASA astronaut Eileen Collins is excited to see finally see the SpaceX rocket launch this weekend after years of the country relying on Russian rockets to transport Americans into space.</p>
<p>“This is a very very critical milestone so I’m excited about it. Some part of me feels like it’s long overdue but you know spaceflight is hard you gotta get it right.”</p>
<p>Collins became the first female pilot of a U.S. space shuttle in February 1995 and in July 1999 became the first woman to command a shuttle mission as the Commander for STS-93 Columbia, one of four space shuttle missions she flew on.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Douglas Hurley, one of the astronauts in the SpaceX launch, is also a native of the Southern Tier. He was born in Endicott and is a native of Apalachin. Additionally, Horseheads High School graduate Sebastian Bauco is an engineer working on SpaceX’s Dragon Capsule propulsion system.</p>
<p>“People around the country join in and, you know, part of the big team that helps out with spaceflight and I think that’s the way it should be,” said Collins. “Everybody should feel like they’re a part of it and, you know, even if you are personally not part of it you can be really proud of our country for finally getting here, making this happen, making spaceflight more routine. More and more people are going to be able to fly in space someday.”</p>
<p>Collins says that NASA is working on building a larger rocket to take astronauts back to the moon and to set up scientific research stations to continue to work on the surface of the moon. She hopes that these launches and the potential return to the moon will set up a trip to Mars during her lifetime.</p>
<p>“Mars is much much further away and sometime, hopefully in my lifetime, we’ll see people from our country walking on Mars.”</p>
<p>Until that time, Collins is excited to see the SpaceX launch scheduled for this weekend and says “it’s about time.”</p>
<p>Collins retired from NASA in 2006 and has received numerous awards, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, French Legion of Honor, NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, Free Spirit Award, and the National Space Trophy.

The STEM Read Podcast - The Space Station Mom and the Stunt Woman (May 31, 2020)</p>
<p>On May 30, 2020, The United States launched a manned spacecraft into low-earth orbit for the first time in nine years. SpaceX is now the first private company to launch NASA astronauts into space from US soil. The astronauts are heading to the International Space Station. And how did this happen? With a whole lot of math. As we celebrate this historic flight that could be the next step in human exploration of the Moon and even Mars, we’re highlighting two women whose love of math took them on unexpected journeys of their own.</p>
<p>Host Gillian King-Cargile (@gkingcargile) and Kristin Brynteson (@kbrynteson) talk with NASA’s Ryan Prouty. Ryan Prouty is now the Assistant Director for Strategy and Vision at NASA&rsquo;s Johnson Space Center. But for the past 23 years, she was a key team member and then leader of NASA’s International Space Station Program.</p>
<p>Then, Gillian talks to S.L. Huang (@sl_huang) whose own love of math took her from MIT to a career as a Hollywood stuntwoman. Huang now shares her love of math through action-packed sci-fi books about math genius and mercenary Cas Russell. The latest in the series is Critical Point from Tor Books.</p>
<p>Enjoy the episode and remember, next time a student whines, “When am I going to use this?” you can answer, “When you’re packing for space or writing a sci-fi novel about math and guns, Timmy!”</p>
<p>Northern Illinois University’s STEM Read is part of the NIU STEAM family of programs that explore science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math. Find more great books, lesson plans, and resources at stemread.com.</p>
