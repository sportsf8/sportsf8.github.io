<p>The 77-year-old star began narrating the marriage story in the captions by noting his 1973 released film &lsquo;Zanjeer&rsquo;, which had Jaya Bachchan as the female lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had decided if Zanjeer would succeed, we would along with a few friends go to London for the first time .. My Father asked who you going with? When I told him who, he said you must marry her before you go .. else you don&rsquo;t go&hellip; So .. I obeyed .. !!,&rdquo; Big B wrote in the caption.</p>
<p>The seasoned actor also shared four photos made in one collage, that saw the Bollywood&rsquo;s lovely couple sitting in the mandap and performing the marriage rituals.</p>
<p>Jaya was dolled up in the red bridal lehenga, while Bachchan was seen wearing an off-white sherwani.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan tied the knot on June 3, 1973. The couple later in their life welcomed two children, daughter Shweta Bachchan Nanda and son Abhishek Bachchan.

Did you know that even after being happily married together for so many years, Jaya Bachchan still pulls Amitabh Bachchan&rsquo;s leg over this one thing?</p>
<p>One of the most adorable and romantic couples of Bollywood Amitabh Bachchan and ’s love story often grabs the eyeballs. The iconic couple of Bollywood has been married for 47 years now and never fail to shell out major relationship goals and has been an epitome of royalty. Amitabh and Jaya were officially introduced by filmmaker Hrishikesh Mukherjee on the sets of their 1971 release Guddi. The movie marked their first collaboration and the couple was thrilled to share the screen space. On the other hand, cupid struck Bachchan while shooting for their 1972 release Ek Nazar and the angry young man lost his heart to the actress.</p>
<p>But did you know that even after being happily married for so many years, Jaya Bachchan still fights with Amitabh Bachchan over this one thing? Couples&rsquo; quarrel is a thing and Big B and Jaya Bachchan are no different! During an episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati season 11, Aasim Chaudhary from Indore sat on the hot seat and won an amount of 12.5 lakhs. In the show, Big B questioned Aasim asking him since when has he been married? Aasim answered, &ldquo;5 to 51/2 years.&rdquo; As soon as he said this, Mr. Bachchan gave him a piece of advice. The megastar told his contestant to never forget his wedding date and mentioned that it is a must for everyone to remember. Sharing experience from his own life, Mr. Bachchan further said that if he forgets his wedding date then Jaya Bachchan starts making fun of him and he gets reprimanded by his wife for it.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan tied the knot on June 3, 1973. Amitabh and Jaya became proud parents to daughter Shweta Bachchan who was born in March 1974. Three years later, Abhishek was born and completed their family. The veteran couple is now grandparents to Abhishek and ’s daughter Aaradhya, and Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Nikhil Nanda’s kids and Agastya Nanda.</p>

We all had a love story that never got completed, and Bollywood is also a land of unrequited love and broken marriages. In the 90s, when social media wasn&rsquo;t invented yet, celebrities used to do press conferences to announce the new milestones in their life. While some celebrities used to hide their love life, some used to celebrate it. And Bollywood&rsquo;s ex-couple, Abhishek Bachchan and Karisma Kapoor&rsquo;s family were from the latter, who had celebrated the high-profile engagement of the ex-duo.

<h3 id="in-pictures-shilpa-shetty-kundra-and-raj-kundras-wedding-celebrations">&ldquo;In pictures: Shilpa Shetty Kundra and Raj Kundra’s wedding celebrations&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.vogue.in/photos/5ef471b49aeed766057e7be9/16:9/w_1920,c_limit/Raj-Kundra-and-Shilpa-Shetty-Kundra.jpg" alt="img">
“Everybody sees Shilpa as a sex symbol, a glamorous queen. I realised how homely she actually was. It was love at first sight. From the moment I saw her, I knew I’d love her to be my life partner,” Raj Kundra once revealed in an interview. Today, the Mumbai-based entrepreneur and actor Shilpa Shetty Kundra have been married for over a decade, and share two children, Viaan and Samisha. But the couple’s walk down the primrose path was studded with several movie-worthy hiccups, including Raj’s ultimatum to Shilpa to marry him.</p>
<p>Up ahead, we are throwing it back to Shilpa and Raj’s love story that began in London and glimpses from inside their star-studded wedding celebrations from November 2009 that you might have missed earlier.</p>
<p>The tale of two cities</p>
<p>Professional pursuits led Shilpa Shetty Kundra to get acquainted with the then-UK-based Raj Kundra. The duo met through a mutual friend for work after Shilpa won the reality show Big Brother in 2007. Raj was helping the actor with the promotions of her perfume label S2 at the time. The couple fell in love eventually, but kept the relationship under wraps. About a year later, Raj popped the question to Shilpa. “When Raj proposed to me, it all felt right. And trust me, I am not a conventional thinker. I was okay with the idea of being in a live-in relationship and having a baby out of wedlock, if my parents had permitted me to do it. But I made some conventional choices for the love of my mother and the respect that I have for the institution of marriage,” the actor disclosed. The actor, however, couldn’t finalise the wedding date. “I remember I was shooting for a film called The Man with Sunny Deol. His dates were constantly getting shuffled. Raj gave me an ultimatum to get married or quit the relationship. I had to choose between The Man and my man,” she confessed in an interview. The pair sealed the deal with a formal engagement in October 2009. The bride-to-be chose a rani pink Manish Malhotra sari for the roka.</p>

<p>The wedding celebrations kicked off with a vibrant mehandi ceremony at Shilpa Shetty Kundra’s friend’s farmhouse in Khandala that saw close friends and family in attendance. The bride chose a pink sleeveless kurta for the occasion, while the groom chose a burnt orange bandhgala. The actor went all out with the henna design, which was done by artist Veena Nagda.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony</p>
<p>On November 22, 2009, the couple tied the knot according to Manglorean customs, in keeping with the bride’s background. For the big day in Mumbai, Shilpa Shetty Kundra turned to her favourite couturier, Tarun Tahiliani, and chose a custom red sari. “She was a modern bride who knew exactly what she wanted. She wanted to dress as a classic Indian bride,” Tarun Tahiliani revealed to us about her thought process. “She wanted to blend the elements of a traditional Maharashtrian and Punjabi bridal ensemble. This led to the studio designing one of its first couture concept saris.” Her custom red creation featured intricate zardozi and aari hand embroidery, accentuated with Swarovski crystals arranged in paisley designs. The star topped off her red sari with equally statement-making jewels: a regal rani haar, a heavy choker and matching earrings, all encrusted with uncut diamonds, along with an uncut diamond belt, matha patti, stacked bangles, and a peacock-shaped arm accessory. The groom complemented in a red brocade sherwani by Shantanu &amp; Nikhil.</p>

<p>The couple enlisted New Delhi-based wedding management company E-Factor Entertainment for the entire line-up. “We did decor, design and complete management for all the events,” disclosed co-founder Manika Garg. “A south Indian temple-styled vedi was custom made for the main ceremony. The setting featured bells suspended from the mandap, sculptures and architectural references borrowed from iconic temples, and was replete with umbrellas and traditional flowers that celebrated Shilpa’s Mangalorean roots,” Garg reveals.</p>

<p>The couple hosted a lavish wedding reception at Grand Hyatt in Mumbai on November 24 for Shilpa Shetty Kundra’s friends from the film fraternity. The actor relied on another outfit by Tarun Tahiliani. This time around she opted for a strapless gold sari gown, and added some colour through her diamond and ruby encrusted jewellery. Raj Kundra chose a black sherwani. The guest list included names like Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Gauri Khan, Hrithik Roshan, Rani Mukerji, Rekha, and many more.</p>

<p>Updated: Jun 11, 2020 13:37 IST</p>
<p>Actor Himanshi Khurana and model Asim Riaz were among the most talked-about pairs in Bigg Boss 13 along with Sidharth Shukla and Shehnaaz Gill. So much so that two have come out with two music videos as well. On Thursday, she posted a picture of herself in wedding bangles and got her fans excited.</p>
<p>Sharing the picture where she is seen wearing red and white wedding bangles (chooda), worn by Punjabi brides, but didn’t write a caption. She demurely looks to the floor, and is wearing a simple high waist jeans and striped shirt. Her fans immediately jumped to conclusion and asked her if she had got married. One user said: “Aapne shadi kara le na i know that (You have got married)” while another ask, “Mam u get married ?” Yet another user asked: Did you and Asim got married.”</p>
<p>Only on Wednesday, Asim and Himanshi released their second music video together called Khyaal Rakhya Kar. In March this year, they had featured in a music video called Kalla Sohna Nai, sung by Neha Kakkar.</p>
<p>From their Bigg Boss days, the pair has been talked about endlessly. In fact, after the reality TV show was over, Himanshi had spoken about her experience as Asim had introduced her to his family members.</p>
<p>She had told reporters that she was standing at the back because she wanted Asim’s family and his mother, who was “very emotional”, to meet him first. She added, “Lekin Asim was looking for me and unhone mera haath pakadke seedha apne parents ke paas le gaye ki ‘See, she is the girl jisse main milwana chahta tha’ (But Asim had been looking for me and he held my hand and took me straight to his parents and told them, ‘See, this is the girl I wanted you to meet’).”</p>

<p>“Main tab bhi bohot shy feel kar rahi thi aur main usko bol rahi thi ‘relax’. Unhone bola, ‘Nahi, main pehli baar apne father se kisi ladki ko milwa raha hoon’ (I was feeling very shy even then and I kept telling him to relax. But he said, ‘No, this is the first time I am introducing a girl to my father’),” she has said.</p>
<p>Asim had also famously proposed to her on the show. In early March, in an interview with Spotboye, Asim’s brother Umar has stated that he is not against the relationship. Umar said, “There was a certain misunderstanding. The media was writing about it.” He also added that “she felt that I and some followers of Asim had turned against her”.</p>

<p>In a conversation with ZoomTV, the Sawaar Lu singer opened up about a hilarious incident that took place on her wedding day, when her husband was caught in a soup. She said, &ldquo;The day Maik was coming to India to do the registration, it was a hilarious episode. Maik came to India without a visa. Since he had a German passport, some fool told him that he doesn&rsquo;t need a visa.&rdquo; Talking about how her then-boyfriend, Maik Richter was thrown out of the country on their wedding day, Monali further said, &ldquo;He was not allowed to enter the country. He was thrown out of India. And I was waiting there in the registration office. Somehow, the Government of India and the Home Ministry helped us a lot. Like a jail kaidi, he (Maik) was locked up at the airport for the entire day. He was sent back.&rdquo; She also mentioned how the government officials were kind and helped them a lot in tackling the issue.</p>

<p>Monali had also spilt beans on how and where Maik had proposed her and had revealed, &ldquo;I met Maik during my trip to Switzerland and we clicked instantly.

<h3 id="all-the-pictures-and-videos-you-missed-from-isha-ambani-and-anand-piramals-celebrity-studded-wedding-celebration">&ldquo;All the pictures and videos you missed from Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal’s celebrity-studded wedding celebration&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.vogue.in/photos/5ee206e1fc4ef2c30ce6eba9/16:9/w_1920,c_limit/Isha%20Ambani%20and%20Anand%20Piramal%20wedding.jpg" alt="img">
In hindsight, Isha Ambani admits that she wouldn’t have imagined her wedding to industrialist Anand Piramal to pan out any other way. “The wedding went off beautifully. Like any other bride, I had my share of bridal jitters but getting married at home made it very special and I had the time of my life celebrating my most memorable moments with all the people I love,” Vogue India&rsquo;s February 2019 cover girl once revealed to us in an interview. Born with a last name that needs no introduction, it follows then that the 28-year-old’s multi-city, multi-event nuptials had it all—a sigh-inducing love story, an unlimited big-day budget, Instagrammable decor, a bridal trousseau to match, and even a performance by Beyoncé.</p>
<p>Up ahead, we are throwing back to December 2018, when the modern-day heiress walked down the aisle at her family residence, Antilia to marry her childhood sweetheart.</p>
<p>Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal’s love story</p>
<p>The two business families’ ties go back to the ’70s. Childhood friends, Isha and Anand, reportedly started dating in 2016. Two years later, the 34-year-old entrepreneur popped the question to Isha during a visit to a temple in Mahabaleshwar in May 2018. Post the proposal, the couple celebrated with an intimate lunch with Nita and Mukesh Ambani, Swati and Ajay Piramal, grandparents Kokilaben Ambani and Purnimaben Dalal, Akash Ambani, Anant Ambani, and Anand Piramal&rsquo;s sister Nandini Piramal, among other close family members.</p>
<p>The roka</p>
<p>To mark the special occasion, the Ambanis hosted a grand proposal party and roka ceremony at Antilia, Mumbai. The guest list included names like Sachin Tendulkar, Shah Rukh Khan, Ranbir Kapoor, Karan Johar, Aamir Khan, Gauri Khan, Ayan Mukerji, to name a few. For her roka ceremony, which was hosted at her parents’ home, Antilia, Isha chose a pale pink lehenga by Sabyasachi. She topped it off with decadent diamond jewellery. The evening also included performances by friends and family including Isha and her mother Nita Ambani’s dance on the Katrina Kaif-starrer song ‘Nachde Ne Saare’ for the celebration.</p>
<p>The engagement in Lake Como, Italy</p>
<p>In September 2018, Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal the couple officially celebrated their engagement overlooking the picturesque Lake Como in Italy. The engagement bash was a lavish day-affair and for the main day, the bride-to-be opted for a rose pink Dolce &amp; Gabbana gown. The entertainment included performances by Indian favourites Shaan and Pritam, as well as award-winning singer songwriter John Legend, who played one of his most popular tracks, ‘All of me’, for the couple and their guests. Spotted to celebrate Isha Ambani’s engagement were Janhvi Kapoor, Sonam Kapoor Ahuja and Anand Ahuja, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas, Anil Kapoor, Manish Malhotra, Karan Johar, Aamir Khan and Kiran Rao, among others.</p>
<p>The wedding planning</p>
<p>December 12, 2018 was finalised as Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal’s wedding date. Even though the pre-wedding celebrations were hosted in Udaipur, Rajasthan, the bride chose her maiden home in Mumbai to get married. According to Isha, her parents, Nita and Mukesh Ambani planned the special occasion end-to-end. “During the wedding my mom was CEO and I was chairperson. She and dad did all the hard work. Thankfully, we ended up liking the same things, so that made it a breeze. I didn&rsquo;t go to a single wedding meeting. I was never someone who dreamt of how my wedding would be, yet it was wonderful in more ways than I can imagine. It was a very emotional affair for everyone in my family. I was emotional too but everyone around me would cry all the time. I only cried at my bidaai because I felt some peer pressure as everyone else was crying, especially my parents,” she revealed.</p>
<p>The wedding invitation</p>
<p>Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal&rsquo;s wedding invitation was an emotional tribute to their grandparents. The floral-themed invite was decorated with a wreath of flowers, where each bloom was specifically chosen to personify qualities and values that their grandmothers embody. It also featured a chant, and the Om symbol around a monogram comprising the couple’s initials. On opening, the card played the Gayatri Mantra, and housed a handwritten note written by the bride-to-be on her and her fiancée’s behalf, where she paid an ode to their grandparents, who the two call their role models.</p>

<p>On the day of the wedding, Antilia was decked decorated with thousands of fresh blooms. In fact, the street leading up to the wedding venue, Mumbai&rsquo;s Altamount Road, was also dotted with streamers of bold yellow and orange marigold flowers. Isha Ambani&rsquo;s wedding began with an in-house baraat, led by brothers Akash Ambani and Anant Ambani, who were spotted atop horses at the entrance of Antilia. Brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani were seen welcoming guests. The Piramals wore colourful turbans and danced into the festivities.</p>
<p>The glowing bride made her way to the mandap in a traditional procession flanked by brothers Akash and Anand under a floral chadar. The pre-wedding rituals also included a playful varmala ceremony between Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal. Singer Lata Mangeshkar’s rendition of the Gayatri Mantra was played during the ongoing marriage rituals to bless the young couple, while Amitabh Bachchan went on to explain its profound meaning to the guests.</p>
<p>The bridal lehenga</p>
<p>Isha Ambani wore a custom lehenga by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla for her big day. The bridal ensemble was a 16-panelled ghagra in two shades of off-white, where each panel was hand-embroidered, and was accentuated with alternating Mughal jaalis combined with floral panels in the finest zardozi, vasli, mukaish and nakshi work. The skirt was complemented with a half-sleeved blouse and a tulle dupatta that had a 20-metre trail. “Red or vermilion, the iconic bridal hue featured in the zardozi borders, lending an auspiciousness to the ensemble,” the designers told us. It wasn’t just the exquisite craftsmanship that made her lehenga special, but Isha’s special tribute to her mother, Nita Ambani that made for the biggest talking-point. She incorporated her mother’s wedding sari as part of her bridal attire, by draping it as a dupatta. The red bandhini sari, draped as the second dupatta, was reinvented by the duo with zardozi borders. “The bond between a mother and daughter, the blessings of that love, an intrinsic part of the bridal lehenga.” The groom complemented his bride in an ivory sherwani.</p>
<p>The celebrity guests</p>
<p>Isha Ambani and Anand Piramal’s nuptials was a star-studded affair to say the least. There to congratulate the couple were some of Bollywood&rsquo;s biggest stars including Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sachin Tendulkar, Salman Khan, Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Priyanka Chopra, Janhvi Kapoor and Rekha, among several others. Other notable personalities from politics, sports and other industries present were Hillary Clinton, the former President of India Pranab Mukherjee, industrialist Ratan Tata, cricketer Virender Sehwag, tabla maestro Zakir Hussain and others.</p>
