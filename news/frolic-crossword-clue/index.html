I even entered a couple of the duplicates without realizing it. For example, 98A, the Alexander Pope quote, called for a specific word or phrase, and I freely admit to not knowing it off the bat. But I figured that the next clue in the list, 101A, “Deeply ingrained habit” had to be NATURE. I solved several more across entries and moved to the downs before returning to that Pope quote, at which point I had enough crosses to put NATURE there too — without even noticing the identical entry just to the right. I also filled in BASE at 116A without thinking too much about it. Only in retrospect did I realize the specificity of its clue, “It’s halfway around a diamond,” had meaning.</p>
<p>I got the gist on my next broad pass through the puzzle when I got to 25 and 26A. I had skipped 25 on the first go around, “One of three properties in Monopoly,” since I couldn’t quickly come up with a category that fit (utility and avenue came to mind, too long). But the next time through I had too many crosses not to get PLACE here, at which point I noticed PLACE, which I’d easily gotten for “Silver” at 26A (the Triple Crown was in recent memory, win-place-show). As soon as I noticed this convergence, the repeated entry scheme popped into focus. We have a history of puzzles with repeated answer words, after all, so I decided that I kind of “got it” at this point.</p>
<p>It took figuring out the very first set of duplicates, at 17 and 18A, to see the other wrinkle, the one that I didn’t see at first. 17A, “Bridge component,” solved pretty easily to HAND. Once I realized that 18A, “Previously owned,” solved to the same entry, I saw that every second duplicate entry was also missing an implied “second.” In other words, BASE at 116A was really second BASE. NATURE at 101A was second NATURE. PLACE at 26A was second PLACE.</p>
<p>Once I knew this, I was able to quickly fill in some gaping holes. For example, 79A made perfect sense — a “Supporting role” is a second BANANA. And 55A, which had mystified me — “What you will always be (but he or she isn’t)? — had to be second PERSON, grammatically.</p>
<p>So, it took me more than a second to figure this one out, and I hereby nominate it as a highly clever multilayered Sunday. Anybody want to second that?</p>
<p>Constructor Notes</p>
<p>Victor: For about five years, I was the puzzle editor for the now-defunct Minnesota Crossword Tournament run by the Friends of the St. Paul Public Library. It was a great gig because I got to work with outstanding constructors and to learn about the challenges of managing a puzzle suite (avoiding overlap between puzzles is much harder than one might think, and my respect for tournament organizers grew substantially after having to do it). Every constructor I worked with was terrific in a different way: C.C. Burnikel and Don Gagliardo, for example, generated amazingly smooth fill, Andrea Carla Michaels brought her distinctive sense of humor to her puzzles, and Andrew Ries and George Barany were willing to make whatever difficulty level I needed from them and always did it well. David was notable in that he always wanted to make the hardest puzzle, bringing a new idea for what we could do and trying to think of different ways to challenge the solvers. He also really got the idea that a puzzle should be about the solvers, not about the constructors. We talked about writing a puzzle off and on for years, but “Take Two” was the first where we actually got together and did it. I hope that people enjoyed solving the puzzle. David: From the moment that I met him, Victor has been one of the most generous and self-effacing people I’ve encountered, always doing his best to deflect praise directed at him onto others. It’s an admirable trait, and you can see it in the way that he manages to tell the story of us meeting as a series of kind things to say about others, from organizers of other tournaments to the constructors at the Friends of the St. Paul Library crossword tournament. But what Victor leaves out is how much of the heavy lifting, both intellectual and logistical, he did as part of the Minnesota tournament — and, of course, in this puzzle. It was a pleasure to work with him on that tournament (he was always pushing to make each puzzle more interesting, fun, and the right kind of challenging for the solver — with a massive amount of work on his part to improve theme and fill and clues in all of the puzzles that he, quite characteristically, doesn’t mention!), and the chance to work together in that same way on today’s puzzle was a similar delight. I hope that at least some of the fun of working together comes through in the resulting puzzle and that it is indeed fun to solve.</p>

<h3 id="renoirs-problem-nudes">&ldquo;Renoir’s Problem Nudes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d55bca36d2c7d00088be7ec/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/190826_r34824.jpg" alt="img">
Who doesn’t have a problem with Pierre-Auguste Renoir? A tremendously engaging show that centers on the painter’s prodigious output of female nudes, “Renoir: The Body, the Senses,” at the Clark Art Institute, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, sparks a sense of crisis. The reputation of the once exalted, still unshakably canonical, Impressionist has fallen on difficult days. Never mind the affront to latter-day educated tastes of a painting style so sugary that it imperils your mind’s incisors; there’s a more burning issue. The art historian Martha Lucy, writing in the show’s gorgeous catalogue, notes that, “in contemporary discourse,” the name Renoir has “come to stand for ‘sexist male artist.’ ” Renoir took such presumptuous, slavering joy in looking at naked women—who in his paintings were always creamy or biscuit white, often with strawberry accents, and ideally blond—that, Lucy goes on to argue, the tactility of the later nudes, with brushstrokes like roving fingers, unsettles any kind of gaze, including the male. I’ll endorse that, for what it’s worth.</p>

<p>Renoir’s women strum no erotic nerves in me. There’s no beholding distance from their monotonously compact, rounded breasts and thunderous thighs, smushed into depthless landscapes and interiors, and thus no imaginable approach to intimacy. Their faces nearly always look, not to put too fine a point on it, dumb—bearing out Renoir’s indifference to the women as individuals with inner lives. They aren’t subjects, only occasions. (His models were often amazed at how little they recognized themselves in pictures that they had posed for.) Peculiarly, Renoir did grant the women wonderfully articulated hands, the body part hardest to render convincingly—good for doing things, perhaps around the house. In his later work, his most prominent models were his servants or other lower-middle-class women.</p>

<p>He’s great, though, according to the standard of art history that values the refreshment of traditions by way of radical departures from them. The brilliant curators of the Clark show, Esther Bell and George T. M. Shackelford, demonstrate Renoir’s pivotal place in French painting of the nude by interpolating apposite works by such predecessors as Boucher, Corot, and, especially, Courbet, whose nudes are like libidinous four-alarm fires; by Renoir’s contemporaries, the sardonic Degas and the conscientious Cézanne; and by members of the next generation, notably Picasso, Matisse, Valadon, and Bonnard. (The show is a romp for connoisseurship, illumining, by abrupt contrasts, the core qualities of the respective artists.) Picasso adored and collected Renoir nudes, the more outrageous the better. I think that he responded to something about Renoir that he also found in the consummate religiosity of El Greco and in the hieratic integrity of African sculpture: downright, forthright art, uncompromised by social niceties and free of apologetic irony—a bit akin to what Kierkegaard wanted from God, the capacity “to will one thing.”</p>

<p>Everything in Renoir that is hard to take and almost impossible to think about, because it makes no concessions to intelligence, affirms his stature as a revolutionary artist. He stood firmly against the past in art and issued a stark challenge to its future. You can’t dethrone him without throwing overboard the fundamental logic of modernism as a sequence of jolting aesthetic breakthroughs, entitled to special rank on the grounds of originality and influence. The more politicized precincts of the present art world are bent on just such a purge, and it’s hard to contest their point by sticking up for Renoir’s only too confident, even embarrassing, panache. But there’s no gainsaying his historic significance.</p>
<p>Class is key to understanding Renoir. He was born in Limoges in 1841, the sixth of seven children of a tailor and a seamstress. The family moved to Paris four years later. He left school at the age of twelve or thirteen to apprentice as a decorator of porcelain, quickly advancing to a mastery of rococo forms and images; that training persists in all his painting, in which he centers the subjects in space that goes vague toward the corners of the canvas. Meanwhile, he haunted the Louvre. Committed to fine art, he entered the École des Beaux-Arts in 1862. His schoolmates included Monet, Sisley, and Bazille. He produced strong works from the start, under the spell of Courbet’s audacious realism and Manet’s celebration of urbane modernity. (His earliest nude in the show, “Boy with Cat,” from 1868, isn’t only rare for him, with its male subject, but startlingly homoerotic.) This was the era when artists started to forsake aristocratic and institutional patronage—bucking the bias of the annual Salon while hungering for inclusion in it—in favor of support from a burgeoning middle class.</p>
<p>In contrast to his better-off peers, who chafed against their starchy upbringing, Renoir was bourgeois by aspiration, not by birth. Unconflicted, he swooned for the fashions and the pastimes of the new order in such touchstone masterpieces as “Dance at the Moulin de la Galette” (1876), which is outside the purview of the Clark show; the swirling crowd of chic merrymakers in dappled summer light has enticed innumerable youths, including me, long ago, into a passion for modern painting. (There’s an anticipation here of Andy Warhol, who jumped from lower-class depths to upper-class heights, eliding the middle altogether.) That social infatuation, plus the artisan roots of a style that bore traces, to the last, of ceramic embellishment, made Renoir an unprecedented artistic type, no more but also no less vulgar than the society that gave him a life and paid him a living. He was a parvenu’s parvenu.</p>
<p>It feels wrong to term Renoir a misogynist, though he was certainly patriarchal. “Misogyny” implies active animus. By all accounts that I’m aware of, including that of his adoring son Jean, the great film director, he got on pleasantly enough with the woman he married, in 1890—Aline Victorine Charigot, a dressmaker, almost twenty years younger, with whom he had already had one child and would have two more—and with models, a mistress, and an illegitimate daughter, born in 1870, whom he secretly supported for the rest of his life and, with a bequest, beyond it. He could be collegial with female artists, notably Berthe Morisot, but he gave no sign of regarding women as other than a species subservient to men. He deemed women who performed professionally “completely ridiculous”; in a letter to a critic, he explained, “In ancient times, women sang and danced for free for the pleasures of being charming and gracious. Today, it’s all for money which takes away the charm.” The airy assumption in that may be worse than misogyny, which at least credits women with power as antagonists. It marks no mere flaw in Renoir’s personality but an essence of it that dovetails with his attitude toward painting. Sex and art figured for him as practically interchangeable rewards for living. An argument is often made that we shouldn’t judge the past by the values of the present, but that’s a hard sell in a case as primordial as Renoir’s.</p>
<p>At the show, part of me felt as though I were writhing on a pin: again and again the carnal tapioca, the vacant gazes, the fatuous frolic. Arriving at a cool Corot nude in a darkling landscape or a crisp Picasso nude combing her hair was like gulping fresh air in a miasma. The prehensile touch with which Renoir molds female masses with color—instead of modelling them with tonal shading—awes the eye, defeating a self-protective impulse to perceive the figures as if they were cels from animated cartoons. The work tends toward silliness but never topples into it. He can really move paint around, and his colors attain complex harmonies even as you may crave sunglasses to mitigate their screeching chromas. He’s like a house guest so annoying that you might consider burning down the house to be rid of him. Let’s not do that. ♦

SATURDAY PUZZLE — Last weekend was the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. You all know I’m a cogitator rather than a speed solver: I’m as impressed as anyone when some of you bust out your sub-10-minute times in the comments on these weekend puzzles, but I don’t often think about my pace. It’s about as relevant to me as a 3-minute mile when I clomp around my neighborhood in jogging shoes looking for changes in the landscape.</p>
<p>This is all to say that I took ages to solve Greg Johnson’s grid today, but encountered very little frustration (mainly regarding those little bits and bobs of romance languages that weren’t in my limited vocabulary.) There were a lot of amusing touches and interesting snippets of information, some of them quite timely, a few of them nostalgic.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>O.K. THEN! There were several “conversational” entries, including one of the spans, that I found manageable with a few crosses as help, and ID BET most of you had the same experience. (Yes? OH GOOD. GREAT JOB!) I did have “horse” for OTTER (after entering STEED elsewhere) and “Midas” for MICAH, which was silly — otherwise things knitted together pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>1A: On finishing this grid it was a little odd to see it book-ended by this term, GHOST GUNS, and a reference to deer hunting, which could have been Christmassy instead (right? TREE STANDS?). There’s a movie in my distant memory that traced one of these weapons as it was trafficked through the United States, and I learned the term at that point but I can’t remember what the film was called.

Alan Connor turns the tables on the torturers. Under the spotlight this time is James Brydon, aka Picaroon</p>
<p>Picaroon has been setting for the Guardian since March 2012.</p>
<p>His first puzzle arrived so fully formed that some solvers thought this must be a new pseudonym for an old hand, but no: Picaroon is James Brydon, who also sets as Lavatch in the Spectator, and with the same nom de guerre in some astonishing Listener puzzles.</p>
<p>When we spoke to the Spectator puzzle editor Tom Johnson last year, he declared himself proud to have “‘discovered’ Lavatch about 10 years ago when he submitted a few unsolicited cryptic puzzles to 1 Across magazine”, adding that “his smooth and elegant clueing style mark him as the doyen of the younger British setters”.</p>
<p>Among my favourites of his clues is from that first Guardian puzzle: “It’s coming to a point where a Liberal is propping up right-winger in charge (7)” for CONICAL.</p>
<p>So let’s meet this setter &hellip;</p>
<p>When/where do you create your puzzles?</p>
<p>I tend to scribble clues everywhere, often surreptitiously when I should be doing something else. Being busy with real life and a small child means taking advantage of whatever spare minutes I can find.</p>
<p>When did you get the crossword bug?</p>
<p>In my early teens. My parents solved the Guardian and Everyman puzzles and that taught me the basics. Araucaria and Bunthorne got me hooked but they gave me an education too.</p>
<p>They didn’t just set riddles: their puzzles were full of fascinating cultural references to things that I would never have found out about in school.</p>
<p>What’s your favourite of your own clues or puzzles?</p>
<p>I tend to remember puzzles longer than clues – especially Listener puzzles – because of the days of maddening seclusion trying to construct them.</p>
<p>I’m still quite partial to a puzzle of mine based on Kurosawa’s Rashomon, where there were 65,536 possible different grid fills that could be generated from the clues.</p>
<p>I also like the visual effect of a circular puzzle which, after cutting, ended up as a lacy snowflake inscribed with “[the] frolic architecture of [the] snow” from Emerson’s poem The Snowstorm.</p>
<p>Since my memory of clues doesn’t extend too far, I’ll just mention a recent clue that I did like:</p>
<p>2d/10ac New ref took latitude, playing advantage for Eden Hazard (4,2,9)</p>
<p>I’ll give the answer below. I remember being so engrossed in that Rashomon puzzle that I had to pop into shop doorways to fill in letters whenever inspiration struck. Where else have you been tempted to take the concept of multiple solutions?</p>
<p>Having wrestled with the folly of it once, I’ve vowed never to try it again.</p>
<p>Wherever the idea might go, it’s probably just a detour on the way to what a crossword ultimately needs to be satisfying: a unique solution.</p>
<p>Right-o. Which other setters do you admire?</p>
<p>At the Guardian, I always enjoy Brendan’s thematic dexterity and Arachne’s mixture of erudition and espièglerie.</p>
<p>I find that my Spectator colleagues Dumpynose and Mr Magoo combine ingenious thematic ideas with stylish clues. Ferret, as a newer arrival on the scene, has produced some dazzling grid constructions and elegant clues.</p>
<p>What makes a successful clue?</p>
<p>Precision. Misdirection. An amusing surface reading. But more than that, some spark of inspiration that’s hard to quantify.</p>
<p>The following, from Paul, has lingered in my mind for years:</p>
<p>20ac If you want ‘thick’, get this: right lot of racists admitted to their ‘problem’? (9)</p>
<p>The concept is brilliant, totally unobvious, and the whole thing is realised, for no apparent reason, in a fantastic pastiche of “yoofspeak”.</p>
<p>And what makes an unsuccessful one?</p>
<p>A nonsensical, “crosswordy” surface reading or lots of first, last, or middle letters.</p>
<p>How did you choose your pseudonyms?</p>
<p>I chose Lavatch, the clown in All’s Well That Ends Well, when I was an undergraduate studying for a paper on Shakespeare and was struck by how much crossword-type wordplay appears in his work (especially in Love’s Labour’s Lost).</p>
<p>I think the name reflects my understanding of clue-writing: half subtle, linguistic play and half buffoonery.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, I like the meaning of Picaroon as a rogue or someone who lives by his wits, and the reference to the rascally heroes of picaresque literature.</p>
<p>How do you imagine a solver of your crosswords?</p>
<p>Perplexed at first, but diverted by the entertaining surfaces and then, as the answers start to fall, emitting contented “ah”s and admiring chuckles until the last answer settles into place with an intellectually satisfying snap.</p>
<p>Well, you did say “imagine”, right?</p>
<p>What’s the future for cryptic crosswords?</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of excellent setters emerging like Rorschach, eXternal and Shark. As far as production goes, technology is allowing incredible grid constructions that would have been impossible until recently.</p>
<p>And as for distribution, the internet should be key. I’d like to see more publications like The Magpie which aims its content purely at crossworders and caters for interests that some of the mainstream publications wouldn’t.</p>
<p>I understand that you’re a solver of French and Serbian puzzles. What are the most interesting differences as compared to English-language cryptics?</p>
<p>For starters, they aren’t cryptic. Good French crosswords have a sort of Rufus-esque, ludic quality, such as “Déjeuner sur l’herbe” to define BROUTER.</p>
<p>Serbian crosswords are just definition and answer (and some tempestuous debates about whether the words used actually exist or whether the compiler has just made them up to fit the spaces).</p>
<p>Grammatically speaking, English is an amazingly flexible language with no genders, adjective agreements or case endings and minimal verb conjugations. This, I think, rather than any supposed “English mentality”, is what makes cryptic clue writing possible and explains why it can’t easily be replicated in most other languages.</p>
<p>And I would bet a large sum that you have read Landscape Painted with Tea in both English and the vernacular. For those of us who can only read it in English, what are we missing?</p>
<p>Great Slavic runs of consonants like in “strpljenje” and “Ävrst”.</p>
<p>Ooh. Now, is setting art or craft?</p>
<p>Both. Basically, it’s a craft, but a great deal of “art” is just mastery of craft and there’s much artistry in the best examples of many banal everyday objects such as crossword puzzles.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how a simple square with words in it has evolved, over the last hundred years, to become much more than just a “game”: the best crosswords can be witty reflections of their authors’ personalities; they communicate political and social messages; they play with complex ideas like Klein bottles, recreate historical events like the Dambusters raids and echo the structures of artistic works by constructing clues in verse. Long may this adventurous spirit endure!</p>
<p>Do you remember the first clue you solved or wrote?</p>
<p>I think that solving “Like Venus de Milo, wouldn’t ’urt a fly (7)” at the age of about 10 was my first success.</p>
<p>My earliest attempts to write clues have been mercifully destroyed and all memories of them systematically repressed.</p>
<p>A pity. How do people respond if and when you tell them you’re a crossword setter?</p>
<p>They often seem genuinely interested and then say something bizarre like “you must have a really good general knowledge”.</p>
<p>Is a propensity to play games with words ever a nuisance to yourself or others?</p>
<p>It’s thoroughly aggravating when you’re trying to read something engrossing and can’t stop spotting potential anagrams or wordplay breakdowns.</p>
<p>And if you weren’t a crossword setter, what would you be?</p>
<p>A little less busy and a lot more bored.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Picaroon for another engrossing encounter. The answers to the clues above are: for the ‘Eden Hazard’ clue (not as recent as when I first spoke to Picaroon), TREE OF KNOWLEDGE; for ‘If you want thick’, CORNFLOUR and, for the Venus de Milo, surely, ARMLESS.

Langur monkeys, which are native to the Indian subcontinent, appear to have been depicted in a fresco in Santorini thousands of years ago</p>
<p>The tails should have been a problem. On a 3,500-year-old fresco in Santorini monkeys frolic, dangling from branches. Despite the exquisite detail, it has taken until now to spot there is something wrong with their tails. They don’t go down, they go up.</p>
<p>And in that small difference, a study has argued, lies a fascinating insight into Bronze Age trade.</p>
<p>Because they are not the tails of monkeys from nearby north Africa. They are not even those of monkeys from Mesopotamia. Instead, you have to travel 3,000 miles to the Indus Valley in Pakistan before you find tails that curve upwards like that.</p>
<p>All of which means, the scientist behind the findings said, that “the Silk Roads were open” almost 1,500 years before they are
