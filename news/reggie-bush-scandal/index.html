<p>Max Kellerman wants Reggie Bush to get his Heisman Trophy back after ending his disassociation with USC. (1:46)</p>
<p>In a world where you can get pretty much anything delivered to your front porch, here&rsquo;s hoping that Reggie Bush answers the door one day soon to find the postal truck has shown up with a Heisman Trophy.</p>
<p>His Heisman Trophy.</p>
<p>Bush sent it back to the Heisman Trophy Trust 10 years ago &ndash; &ldquo;forfeited&rdquo; it, in the curious term used at the time &ndash; after the NCAA put USC on probation for four years largely because Bush and his family took lavish gifts from two sports marketers.</p>
<p>It has been 10 years since USC declared Bush untouchable, something the rest of college football learned when he played tailback. The university &ldquo;disassociated&rdquo; (another curious word) itself from one of its greatest players ever and removed its copy of Bush&rsquo;s Heisman from the lobby of Heritage Hall and sent it back to the trust. This from a school that still displays the Heisman won by O.J. Simpson.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 10 years to the day since the NCAA announcement, USC disassociated itself from its disassociation of Bush. It is a common-sense, compassionate ending for Bush&rsquo;s role in the scandal.</p>
<p>Heisman Trophy Trust executive director Rob Whalen, asked for a reaction to the end of Bush&rsquo;s disassociation and about the possibility of rescinding his forfeiture of the Heisman, said Wednesday morning that the trust &ldquo;has no comment at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of the NCAA punishment exacted a toll on USC. The reduction of 30 scholarships over three years reduced the Trojans&rsquo; depth chart pretty much to whomever walked past Howard Jones Field on a weekday afternoon. The two-year bowl ban withheld two months of practices and two games from a program of young players who needed the work.</p>
<p>We remember Pete Carroll&rsquo;s successor, a young coach named Lane Kiffin, flamed out at USC. We don&rsquo;t remember he coached under conditions that set up the Trojans to struggle. When USC won the Pac-12 in 2017, it ended a nine-year conference championship drought, the program&rsquo;s longest since the 1920s.</p>
<p>In 39 games over three seasons at USC, Reggie Bush rushed for 3,169 yards and 25 touchdowns, and added 1,301 receiving yards and 13 TDs. AP Photo/Kevork Djansezian</p>
<p>Sending Bush away from the program resonated. He caused the program considerable harm. But USC&rsquo;s decision to send back Bush&rsquo;s Heisman to the trust serves as one of many examples in which the university, in an attempt to scrub its reputation clean, accepted the penalties and doubled down on them.</p>
<p>You call us out for who gets access to football practice and who gets sideline passes for games? Fine, we&rsquo;ll restrict access so tightly, the TSA will be impressed.</p>
<p>My memory of going to a Trojans football practice in the fall of 2010 involves filling out more paperwork than I did for my mortgage.</p>
<p>The university fired athletic director Mike Garrett, another former Heisman winner, in July 2010 and replaced him with former Trojans quarterback Pat Haden. He walked in the door and, before the ink on his new business cards had dried, removed Bush&rsquo;s 2005 Heisman from the lobby of Heritage Hall and returned it to the trust. Bush waited until September before deciding to send his back. The announcement that he had done so before the trust made any decision always had the whiff of a plea bargain.</p>
<p>The NCAA has a long history of forcing programs to vacate victories. Lawyers call it &ldquo;fruit of the poisonous tree.&rdquo; But Bush is the only major award winner who ever relinquished a trophy. Everyone knows what he achieved on the field deserves recognition, even if everyone knows he broke the rules.</p>
<p>Give him an asterisk. Say he cheated. But let&rsquo;s not pretend that Bush didn&rsquo;t have one of the greatest seasons in the history of college football. He did, and we all saw it.</p>
<p>Those last four sentences are from a column I wrote 10 years ago today, decrying the possibility that the NCAA and/or USC would remove Bush from the record, the way the Soviets used to purge photographs of officials who got on Stalin&rsquo;s bad side.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush&rsquo;s Heisman-winning season in 2005 still holds up as one of the best college football campaigns in history. He rushed for 1,740 yards and 16 touchdowns that year. Julie Jacobson/AP Photo</p>
<p>A lot has changed in a decade. The NCAA had to be shamed by hungry student-athletes into allowing universities to provide more food. The public is demanding student-athletes share in the wealth that intercollegiate athletics generates, a freight train that the NCAA willfully refused to see coming. In fact, if Equifax did credibility ratings, the NCAA wouldn&rsquo;t qualify to announce that tomorrow is Thursday.</p>
<p>But give the NCAA credit for this: Three years ago, when the NCAA overhauled the infractions process, it announced that no disassociation it ordered could last longer than 10 years. That means, as far as the NCAA is concerned, Bush&rsquo;s time in the wilderness is over. Some wilderness &ndash; he enjoyed a long NFL career, then glided into a seat as an on-air college football analyst for Fox.</p>
<p>Now the decisions belong to USC and the Heisman Trophy Trust. Now the university is ready to welcome Bush back into its family. All of college football, including the committee that oversees American sports&rsquo; most famous trophy, should do the same. Bush sat in timeout for 10 years, and now it&rsquo;s over.

<h3 id="reggie-bush-money-is-going-to-destroy-some-college-athletes-without-guidance">&ldquo;Reggie Bush: Money Is &lsquo;Going to Destroy Some&rsquo; College Athletes Without Guidance&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/869/849/hi-res-53f35ab6b402511e930ddf72d870ff36_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1200&amp;q=75" alt="img">
Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press</p>
<p>Former USC running back Reggie Bush has expressed concern over the NCAA&rsquo;s allowing players to be paid for their name and likeness, cautioning that it could &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; players who do not have the right guidance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guidance is the one thing that young athletes coming through the college system miss on so much,&rdquo; Bush told Playboy&rsquo;s Ryan Gajewski (h/t ESPN). &ldquo;I missed on it. They&rsquo;re about to start paying college athletes. This is something that has never been experienced before, and it&rsquo;s going to destroy some people if their foundation is not in the right place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bush was part of an impermissible benefits scandal at USC that resulted in his forfeiture of the 2005 Heisman Trophy, while the Trojans were stripped of the 2004 national championship. An NCAA investigation found Bush had accepted nearly $300,000 in cash and other benefits from an agent while at USC, forcing the school to end its relationship with one of its greatest players.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old made $63 million during his NFL career, but he told Gajewski he wished he would have had better financial understanding at a young age:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one thing I wish I had early in my career is proper financial knowledge. I hired good agents, and I hired a good team. But I allowed that good team to make decisions for me. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;m going bankrupt, but if I had the proper knowledge back then, some things would be different. People just assume, &lsquo;Well, you got all this money, so you&rsquo;re good.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s actually the opposite. The more money you have, the more danger you&rsquo;re in. Because now you&rsquo;re a freaking open target for a lot of people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty world out there, and it&rsquo;s about to get nastier. You&rsquo;re going to really start to see the true colors of a lot of people, and a lot of businesses too. You&rsquo;re going to see people doing some crazy stuff to make money, because our market is crashing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NCAA announced its support of a plan that would allow athletes to profit off their name and likeness in commercials and other ventures, including endorsement contracts, in April. While the policy is far from a free-for-all—players are not allowed to use the logos or mention the schools they play for—it&rsquo;s a step forward that most believe has come decades too late.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible players like Bush never would have had their accomplishments taken away if such rules were in place during his time at USC.

<p><img src="https://www.sportscasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Reggie-Bush-USC.jpg" alt="img">
Years away from the NFL has given Reggie Bush plenty of perspective. Deep into retirement, the former Saints running back has spent a great deal of time thinking about money.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush isn’t going bankrupt and he has a notable broadcasting job. Still, here’s why Bush admitted he wished he received better financial advice earlier in his life.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush won a Heisman Trophy at USC</p>
<p>RELATED: How Much Money Did Reggie Bush Make in the NFL?</p>
<p>Before the Alabama Crimson Tide and Clemson Tigers ruled college football, it was the USC Trojans who were must-see TV every Saturday.</p>
<p>Not only did the Trojans have star quarterback Matt Leinart, but they had explosive running back Reggie Bush in the backfield. The 6-foot, 203-pound Bush dominated defenses on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Bush ran for 3,169 yards and 25 touchdowns in three seasons at USC. Bush’s 1,740 yards and 18 touchdowns from scrimmage helped him to the 2005 Heisman Trophy title, a prize the NCAA later vacated.</p>
<p>Bush averaged 8.7 yards per carry in 2005 and helped the Trojans to the National Championship Game. He averaged another 12.9 yards on 37 catches.</p>
<p>USC lost to Texas in the 2006 Rose Bowl, which was that year’s title game.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints used the 2nd overall pick on Bush in the 2006 NFL draft. He played in the NFL from 2006-16 and won a Super Bowl with the Saints in February 2010.</p>

<p>RELATED: Reggie Bush Made $1.5 Million During One of the Worst Seasons in NFL History</p>
<p>Despite never reaching the Pro Bowl, Reggie Bush is one of the highest-paid running backs in NFL history. Bush earned $63 million in 11 NFL seasons, a sizable chunk of which came from the Saints.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush trails only Adrian Peterson ($101 million) and Hall of Famer Edgerrin James ($68 million) among running backs’ career earnings, according to Spotrac.</p>
<p>The NFL’s oldest rookie contract rules certainly helped Bush’s bank account. Bush signed a six-year deal worth $62 million, with over $26.5 million guaranteed, after the Saints drafted him.</p>
<p>That only goes for the money Bush earned from teams, though. He entered the NFL with various sponsorships and now works on Fox’s college football coverage.</p>

<p>RELATED: Deuce McAllister’s $70 Million Saints Fortune Shriveled to Just $50,000</p>
<p>There are enough tragic stories of professional athletes earning millions of dollars, then blowing it all away during and after their playing days. Reggie Bush is doing his best to avoid that club.</p>
<p>With that said, Bush’s money has been on his mind lately. He’s still doing well financially — the Fox job helps — but Bush knows he could have retired with more money than he did.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Playboy, Bush acknowledged he would change how he handled his finances.

<p><img src="https://imagez.tmz.com/image/fb/16by9/2019/10/11/fb3ed31701e4416d99d62aa5b32c542c_xl.jpg" alt="img">
Breaking News</p>
<p>Great news for Reggie Bush &hellip; his NCAA-issued ban requiring him to stay away from USC could expire in 2020, this according to USC&rsquo;s interim athletic director, Dave Roberts.</p>
<p>Roberts spelled it out to Ryan Young of TrojanSports.com &hellip; saying a new NCAA rule &ldquo;basically reduced any disassociation to a 10-year disassociation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The COI, which I sit on &ndash; Committee on Infractions &ndash; had recently put through a rule change. It&rsquo;s called an IOP &ndash; internal operating procedure &ndash; which basically reduced any disassociation to a 10-year disassociation, much like what was given to [former Michigan basketball star] Chris Webber,&rdquo; Roberts said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So in June of 2020, the disassociation for Bush will expire and it&rsquo;s going to be up to the university what the university wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The backstory &hellip; back in 2010, the NCAA ordered USC to completely disassociate with Bush over Reggie&rsquo;s improper benefits scandal.</p>
<p>During Bush&rsquo;s college career, Reggie&rsquo;s family received improper benefits from 2 sports marketers who were hoping to sign him. As a result, the NCAA stripped USC of 14 wins, including the 2004 national championship. Bush was also stripped of his 2005 Heisman Trophy.</p>
<p>USC has previously said they want Reggie back on campus &ndash; but they can&rsquo;t disobey the NCAA.</p>
<p>Reggie recently went back to the Coliseum in Los Angeles to cover a USC football game for FS1 and received an ovation from the crowd.</p>
<p>Also, several high-profile USC alum &ndash; including LenDale White &ndash; have called for the end of the Bush ban.</p>

<p>Back in 2016, Willie McGinest told us there was a group of ex-players working to get Bush back on campus.

<p>A new NCAA infractions scandal has hit college football, and it should give USC football even more reason to fight the NCAA’s ban of Reggie Bush.</p>
<p>What a coincidence.</p>
<p>The same week Arash Markazi of the LA Times highlighted the injustice of the NCAA’s ban disassociating Reggie Bush from USC football permanently, another NCAA scandal involving illegal benefits rocked the college football world.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, in the midst of the college basketball bribery trial which shook the hoops world, a former financial advisor and now federal witness dropped a bomb shell: In addition to his college basketball dealings, Martin Blazer claims to have paid thousands of dollars to football players at Alabama, Michigan, Notre Dame, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Penn State and North Carolina, among others apparently.</p>
<p>The infractions were allegedly committed between 2000 and 2014.</p>
<p>“The payments, some of which were in the thousands of dollars, were aimed at convincing the player to remain in college and not enter the NFL draft in the hopes that they would retain him as their financial adviser when they did turn pro,” per John Taylor of NBC Sports.</p>

<p>MORE: Where will USC’s NFL hopefuls be drafted?</p>
<p>What does that have to do with Reggie Bush?</p>
<p>First, there’s the noteworthy timeline, which spanned the full length of not only Bush’s infractions for receiving benefits from a would-be agent but also the NCAA’s drawn out investigation of USC, the levying of penalties against the football program and the completion of said sanctions.</p>
<p>Shocker, Bush was far from the only college football player on the take, then or now. And while the NCAA was pontificating about USC’s great crime of not knowing what house Bush’s parents were living in 150 miles away, many other universities were also not knowing what was taking place right under their noses.</p>

<p>Next, there’s the infractions themselves, which stand in contrast to Bush’s. While Blazer allegedly paid players to entice them to stay in school, Lloyd Lake and company dished out benefits to ensure Bush’s departure for the NFL. (An overly large number of college football fans still wrongly assume USC was punished by the NCAA for committing a recruiting violation when in fact Bush was recruited away from USC.)</p>
<p>Finally, there’s the punishment. Blazer’s testimony doesn’t appear likely to result in penalties of any sort for the schools named. Without specific players cited, the NCAA doesn’t have the power to compel Blazer to give them any more information than is already out there. Besides, the statute of limitations, usually four years, is well passed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than a decade since Bush’s actual infractions and nearly 10 years since sanctioned were imposed, the former Trojan running back is still being barred from returning to USC, with no end to the disassociation in sight.</p>
<p>As Markazi pointed out in his article, which detailed the logistical issues with the ban restricting Bush from USC’s campus given his new position on Fox Sports’ college football pregame show, this is a unique case. Chris Webber was disassociated from Michigan after it was revealed he took $280,000 in illegal benefits from a booster. His ban, however, was capped at 10 years. Bush’s was made indefinite.</p>

<p>USC “has tried on at least three occasions to have the ban removed or lessened,” according to Markazi. “The NCAA has rebuffed each attempt.”</p>
<p>Matt Leinart called what is happening to Bush “a travesty.” And he’s absolutely right.</p>
<p>It’s a travesty that the NCAA won’t just let it go. They don’t need to strike Bush’s infractions from the record, even though it’s clear he was one small drop in a very large pond of rule breakers in the college football world. They don’t need to give USC back scholarships, even though most clear-minded college football observers can agree they over punished the Trojans relative to the crime.</p>
<p>To get this right, all the NCAA needs to do is to treat USC the way it treated Michigan. Set a date for Bush’s disassociation to end. It’s really that simple. And it’s time.</p>
<p>But when has the NCAA ever gotten it right?

<h3 id="what-is-reggie-bush-doing-now">&ldquo;What Is Reggie Bush Doing Now?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sportscasting.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Former-New-Orleans-Saints-Reggie-Bush.jpg" alt="img">
NFL fans remember what it was like to watch Reggie Bush on the field. The popular running back dazzled audiences with his remarkable skills. Though Bush is no longer playing for the NFL, his fans wonder what he’s been up to. Let’s look at the most memorable moments of Bush’s football career and find out what he has been doing since he retired.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush’s football career</p>
<p>Bush began impressing his audience and spectators from a young age, as USA Today Sports explains. After a remarkable experience on his high school team, Bush made the decision to further his skills at the University of Southern California. His reputation reached new levels during his time at USC.</p>
<p>Over the course of the three seasons, the running back received All-America honors and Pac-10 Player of the Year to name a few. In 2006, Bush announced he would enter the NFL Draft. No one was surprised to see Bush selected as a first-round pick.</p>
<p>Bush’s NFL career officially began in New Orleans with the Saints. In 2011, he briefly played for the Miami Dolphins. Then, Bush found himself in Detroit before moving to San Francisco to play for the 49ers. His final move came in 2016 when he played for Buffalo Bills. Fans are well-aware of the football player’s impressive skill set and lengthy career.</p>
<p>Reggie Bush’s net worth and personal life</p>
<p>#ReggieBush and his wife #LilitAvagyan couldn&rsquo;t keep their hands off one another while on a date in LA. More flicks when you click the link in our bio or swipe up in Stories! https://t.co/pfSRjfFnD5 pic.twitter.com/vHh7Sb2W2x — YBF CHIC (@TheYBF) November 21, 2019</p>
<p>When it comes to dating, Bush has had an interesting history. The pro athlete has dated famous celebrities like Kim Kardashian West and WWE Divas Champion Eve Torres. Since then, however, Bush is officially off the market.</p>
<p>Bush began dating Lilit Avagyan in 2011. His relationship with the pro dancer began swimmingly. In 2014, the couple decided to make their love official and got married. Together, the couple has three children.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, many sources comment on how Bush’s wife resembles his ex-girlfriend Kardashian West. Nonetheless, the couple seems very happy together. Bush has come a long way since his career began. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he’s worth around $35 million.</p>
<p>When did Reggie Bush retire and what has he been doing since?</p>

<p>Bush made the decision to retire in 2017, which surprised some fans. But as he said, he gave everyone multiple warnings. When it didn’t seem like Bush would be able to find a team he was excited about for the upcoming season he decided enough was enough.</p>
<p>When elaborating on the decision, Bush told USA Today, “I’m done. I said it. It’s not breaking news … I said it all season, I said, ‘Listen, if I don’t play this year, I’m going to retire.’ Because I’m not going to spend a whole year off, come back, 33 years old, trying to get back in the league. Listen, once you get to a certain age as a running back, they just start to slowly weed you out.”</p>
<p>Bush’s sentiments capture how the athlete felt at the moment. However, many fans wonder what Bush has been up to since he retired. At this point, the former running back has returned to the NCAA as a broadcaster.</p>
<p>Though there was a slight scandal surrounding Bush’s involvement with sports marketers during his time playing college football, everyone seems on board with welcoming Bush back. Keep an eye out to see what else this professional athlete has in store for the future.

<h3 id="interim-ad-says-usc-could-end-its-dissociation-with-reggie-bush-in-2020">&ldquo;Interim AD says USC could end its dissociation with Reggie Bush in 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MxUUQSEV8oXis.YWhiIS.w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDkuNg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2UIgfoJUwG7sTziaAk8Pyw--~B/aD0yNTgzO3c9NDA4MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/acea55c0-eb8f-11e9-bfb3-7bf18d2b3c77" alt="img">

<p>Could USC eventually welcome Reggie Bush back to campus in an official capacity? The school will apparently have the option to do so.</p>
<p>According to interim USC athletic director Dave Roberts, Bush’s dissociation from the school will expire after the 2020 season. USC had to dissociate itself from Bush in 2010 after the NCAA handed down major penalties to the school following a 2006 Yahoo Sports investigation. Yahoo Sports found that Bush had accepted impermissible benefits from marketing agents while he was at USC.</p>
<p>The dissociation with Bush was and has been permanent. But Roberts told Rivals’ TrojanSports.com in an interview on Wednesday that new NCAA rules would allow the school to decide next year if it wanted to tout Bush and his myriad achievements while at the school.</p>
<p>From Trojan Sports:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The COI, which I sit on — Committee on Infractions — had recently put through a rule change. It&rsquo;s called an IOP — internal operating procedure — which basically reduced any disassociation to a 10-year disassociation, much like what was given to [former Michigan basketball star] Chris Webber,&rdquo; Roberts explained. &ldquo;So in June of 2020, the disassociation for Bush will expire and it&rsquo;s going to be up to the university what the university wants to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That’s a decision that will likely be made by whoever is USC’s next permanent athletic director. Roberts is the interim AD after Lynn Swann resigned in September.</p>
<p>Bush was back at Coliseum in September</p>
<p>Bush made his first trip back to the Coliseum in September when USC hosted Utah. Bush was allowed to be at the school’s stadium because he was there for his analyst gig with Fox Sports. Though he helped USC get a 15-yard penalty after he celebrated with players following a Trojan touchdown.</p>

<p>Bush has previously said that he hoped to be able to come back to USC, so it’s likely that he’ll accept any invitation from the school if it happens to come his way next year.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Bush won the 2005 Heisman Trophy after he rushed for 1,740 yards and had 478 receiving yards, though that Heisman is officially listed as vacated because of the penalties. USC also had to vacate wins during Bush’s tenure with the school and also received a bowl ban and scholarship losses after 2010 because of the Bush scandal.</p>
