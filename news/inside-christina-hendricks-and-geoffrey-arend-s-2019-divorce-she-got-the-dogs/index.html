<p>Divorce is never easy, but when celebrity marriages come to an end, the stakes are often quite high. On top of that, the public nature of their lives means that things can get messy in a hurry.</p>
<p>Celebrities are also particularly prone to divorce because of all the pressure on their relationships and their careers. When this happens, there are often complicated matters to decide when it comes to splitting their fortunes and homes.</p>
<p>When Christina Hendricks and Geoffrey Arend split in 2019, there was another important question to answer: who would get the dogs?</p>
<p>Christina Hendricks and Geoffrey Arend were an item for years</p>

<p>Relationships come and go in Hollywood, but it has an extra sting when a long-lasting couple decides to split.</p>
<p>Hendricks and Arend met back in 2007 through one of Hendricks’ Mad Men costars. Just two years later, they were married, and they seemed to be heading for a happily ever after.</p>
<p>According to Digital Spy, Arend gushed about his marriage by saying that “everything that was a small little problem that could have turned into a fight, just sort of disappeared” because of how happy they were together.</p>
<p>Hendricks also went on and on about the strength of their partnership and her joy in the marriage. By 2019, though, things had changed. Just hours after posting a throwback photo of herself and Arend dressed up for Halloween, Hendricks’ “irreconcilable differences” (as stated on court documents) were made public. The pair had apparently split back in April of that year.</p>
<p>The divorce was settled quickly</p>
<p>While some divorces can go on and on for years, that wasn’t the case for Hendricks and Arend. By December of 2019 — just a month after they made their split public — the divorce was final, according to The Blast. This suggests that the pair must have had a fairly straightforward financial agreement.</p>
<p>The court documents revealed that neither party was seeking spousal support, and since they had no children together, there was not a child custody arrangement to hash out.</p>
<p>There was, however, the matter of their dogs. Also according to The Blast, Hendricks even mentioned them when she announced their split to the public: “Today we take our next step together, but on separate paths. We will always be grateful for the love we’ve shared and always work together to raise our two beautiful dogs.”</p>
<p>Both Christina Hendricks and Geoffrey Arend pose with the dogs</p>

<p>It does seem like Hendricks and Arend have made good on their promise to share the joy in raising their gorgeous pups. Hendricks posted a birthday picture of her dog Zou just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>A matter of days later, Arend shared a picture of himself holding the dog on Instagram with the caption “Zou and I want YOU to still go outside every once in awhile, get that sun, take deep breaths, work those muscles, move around, see the sky.”</p>
<p>It seems like both pet parents are getting a chance to see their four-footed friends.</p>
<p>As far as the other ways this pair has moved on, it is not clear if either of them have begun dating again yet. If so, they seem to be keeping it quiet, so it would seem unlikely that any new relationships have made it to the serious stage. Of course, they are still only a few months out from their official divorce and just over a year into their split.</p>
<p>Coming off of such a long relationship, it makes sense that they each might want to take some time before moving on to someone new. At least they have found an amicable way to share their pets as they each work on building their new lives.

<p>ARIES (March 21-April 19): Consider what’s possible. Being prepared will help you offset interference. Distance yourself from anyone who tries to manipulate you. Put your energy into something that will bring concrete results. Improve health, money matters and relationships. 3 stars</p>
<p>TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Good things come to those who wait. However, a gentle shove will help speed up the process today. Reach out to someone you enjoy spending time with, and make plans that you can enjoy together. Let your intuition be your guide. 5 stars</p>
<p>GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Don’t get railroaded into doing or giving away too much of your time or money. Someone’s motives will not be honorable. Do for yourself and reap the rewards. Walk away from people and situations that are emotionally manipulative. 2 stars</p>
<p>CANCER (June 21-July 22): Ask, and you shall receive. A change you make to the way you do things will draw positive attention and compliments. Home improvements can be made, and hosting an event will lead to new friendships and propositions. 4 stars</p>
<p>LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Go over a deal thoroughly before you sign on the dotted line. An acquaintance you make will cause uncertainty regarding your beliefs. Don’t let temptation lead to a mistake you’ll regret. Place your faith in personal growth, not following someone. 3 stars</p>
<p>VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Look at the facts, and make a move. Implement change if you feel you are missing out. Take charge of your happiness instead of lingering over a hopeless situation. Engage in talks, and pursue the path that offers peace of mind. 3 stars</p>
<p>LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Uncertainty regarding overhead and lifestyle will surface if you have outgrown your current situation. Do the legwork, and flesh out your options. Gather the facts and figures to avoid taking on too much. Time spent with someone you love will ease stress. 3 stars</p>
<p>SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): A change can be costly if you let your emotions get involved. Be realistic about what you want and the best way to go about getting your way. Anger will not solve anything, but offering incentives will. 4 stars</p>
<p>SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Avoid emotional meddling and dealing with someone likely to use you for his or her potential gain. Focus on the way you look, how you feel and doing what makes you happy. Be honest, evaluate a partnership and make adjustments. 2 stars</p>
<p>CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): A change you make at home will leave you more wiggle room to start a new project or put your energy toward self-improvement or activities that make you happy. An unexpected financial gain is heading your way. 5 stars</p>
<p>AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Be careful what you say and who you listen to when making a decision. Fix up your surroundings, or create a personal change that makes you feel good about who you are and where you live. Love is on the rise. 3 stars</p>
<p>PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Don’t let uncertainty take over. Hesitation will cause an emotional problem with someone close to you. Discuss options openly to avoid criticism and regret. Experience and practicality will help you avoid making a mistake. Make a decision, and move forward. 3 stars</p>
<p>Birthday Baby: You are emotional, compassionate and persistent. You are knowledgeable and precise.</p>

<p>Good Girls was renewed for a fourth season by NBC on May 15. The ratings of the third season, currently postponed by coronavirus, boosted the show to NBC’s second most popular across all digital platforms, via Deadline.</p>
<p>Written and executively produced by Jenna Bans (The Family), Good Girls premiered February 26, 2018. It featured Christina Hendricks (Mad Men), Retta (Parks and Recreation) and Mae Whitman (Parenthood) as three suburban moms from Michigan. Hendricks, as Beth Marks-Boland, plays alongside Whitman as Annie Marks, Beth’s younger sister, while Retta’s character is Beth’s best friend, Ruby Hill.</p>
<p>All three women have different circumstances leading them to the show’s main conflict: looting a supermarket to help make ends meet, via Deadline. Although he heist was successful, it was only the beginning of their troubles.</p>
<p>Also making the cast list is Reno Wilson (Mike and Molly) as Ruby’s husband, Stanley, Manny Montana (Graceland) as Rio, a criminal-turned-love-interest for Beth, and Matthew Lillard (Scooby Doo) as Dean Boland, Beth’s cheating husband.</p>
<p>A date for filming has not been set yet, but NBC released a socially distanced celebration of the show’s renewal on their network website.</p>
<p>In anticipation to see what these Good Girls will be up to, you can watch the Season 3 trailer from the show’s YouTube channel.

<p>Girls is returning for more bad behaviour from fan favourite women Beth (Christina Hendricks), Ruby (Retta) and Annie (Mae Whitman) since the NBC comedy was renewed for Season 4.</p>
<p>The series wrapped early May 3 with the episode entitled”Synergy,” that was five installations short of the originally intended 16-episode third season. The cast and executive producers learned about the renewal through a Great Girls Happy Hour with NBC Co-Presidents for Scripted programming, Lisa Katz and Tracey Pakosta Together with Universal Television’s President, Pearlena Igbokwe.</p>
<p>Practising social distancing through chat, NBC provides a peek at the moment. One of the cast members included in the chat and series are Lidya Jewett, Manny Montana, Hendricks Whitman Wilson, Isaiah Stannard and Matthew Lillard.</p>
<p>As for what Season 4 has in store, not much was mentioned, but founder and executive producer Jenna Bans told us after the Season 3 finale that the women would”be in another position in Season 4 than they have ever been in.” The series follows.</p>
<p>Bans had teased in a potential Season 4, “there would be much to look forward to because it is completely unexpected, and, really satisfying, in relation to what the fans love about the series. There would still be a few things that the fans really want to see occur, which can be fun, but they would happen in a manner which will be surprising and kind of unpredictable.”</p>
<p>In accordance with Bans, Season 4 could use footage from Season 3’s missing episodes, “but there is always some creative tweaks to be made.” Only time will tell what those tweaks will be but fans can rest assured knowing that responses to the cliffhangers of Season 3 are probably on the way.</p>
<p>It is about three suburban mothers who launder money for a criminal boss. In season three, Beth ( Christina Hendricks ) had to deal with the aftermath of her attempted murder of Kingpin Rio (Manny Montana). The ladies started their own small side project to drive up profits. A new investigator ( Lauren Lapkus ) has taken over from Turner and is close on their heels.</p>
<p>On average, the third season reached 1.8 million viewers and a rating of 0.4. The preliminary season finale, which already took place after eleven episodes broadcast, ran on May 3. The series takes 12th out of 13 in the NBC drama series and is even ahead of The Blacklist.</p>
<p>The extension was celebrated with a small video.
