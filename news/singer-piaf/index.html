<p><img src="https://static.rti.org.tw/assets/thumbnails/2020/05/26/23ef29707575b9463a709eb40ec72fa9.jpg" alt="img">
巴黎最後街頭歌手莉莉利昂逝世，享嵩壽103歲。 (圖:推特)</p>
<p>巴黎最後街頭歌手(street singer)莉莉利昂(Lily Lian)的教子25日說，利昂24日在巴黎一所醫院逝世，享嵩壽103歲。她曾和法國傳奇女歌手愛迪琵雅芙(Edith Piaf)在巴黎街頭賣藝爭鋒。</p>
<p>法新社報導，莉莉利昂代表巴黎中下階層勞工的傳奇故事。法國知名攝影師杜瓦諾(Robert Doisneau)曾二度拍下她手持擴音器賣唱的照片，使得她演唱的身影永留後世。</p>
<p>莉莉利昂以「莉莉巴納姆」(Lily Panam)的暱稱為人所知，「巴納姆」(Paname)是當時巴黎俗稱。她生於1917年第一次世界大戰高峰時；第二次世界大戰前，她和愛迪琵雅芙同期開始在巴黎街頭和咖啡廳賣唱，當時這類歌手如同巴黎的行動點唱機。</p>
<p>然而，隨著收音機和唱機普及，街頭歌手越來越難與之競爭。而莉莉利昂雖有美貌，卻從未成功轉型為室內表演歌手。她被視為是有300年歷史的街頭歌手文化最後一位代表人物，這類歌手在街頭兜售自編的曲譜和歌詞。</p>
<p>莉莉利昂一度是法國作曲家史科托(Vincent Scotto)的靈感繆思。她在1980年代曾出版自傳「莉莉巴納姆：最後街頭歌手的回憶錄」(Lily Panam: Memories of the Last Street Singer，暫譯)，令她再度受到關注。

Watch Jenna Russell and the Leading Ladies of Piaf Give a Virtual Performance</p>
<p>The Olivier winner and Tony nominee plays Edith Piaf in the upcoming bio-musical.</p>
<p>Olivier winner and Tony nominee Jenna Russell, Sally Ann Triplett, and Sara Poyzer gathered virtually to sing “Hymne a L’Amour” from the upcoming bio-musical Piaf. Check it out above.</p>
<p>The musical stars Russell (Sunday in the Park with George, London&rsquo;s Fun Home) as Edith Piaf, the singer who took the world by storm in the mid-20th century with her warbling voice that earned her the nickname “The Sparrow.” Among the performer’s most popular songs are “La Vie en Rose,” “Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien,” and “Milord.”</p>
<p>Playing two of Piaf’s closest confidantes are Triplett (The Last Ship) as Toine and Poyzer (Billy Elliott) as Marlene Deitrich.</p>
<p>The video, conceived by director Adam Penford and musical director Alex Parker, gives audiences a taste of what to expect from the show created by Pam Gems. The production was meant to launch this spring at Nottingham Playhouse as a Leeds Playhouse co-production, but has been delayed to May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We were all disappointed when we had to delay Piaf as we&rsquo;d been planning it for a long time,” said Penford. “Jenna and Sally are old friends who performed together in the late 1980s, and they were particularly looking forward to working together again. That&rsquo;s when I got the idea of using technology to reunite them, alongside fellow cast member Sara Poyzer. Three West End leading ladies singing a Piaf classic, and our talented musical director Alex, made the magic happen.”</p>

<p><img src="https://cloudimages.broadwayworld.com/columnpiccloud/1250-8a6a1652e13a807d6f85761bfa879225.jpg" alt="img">
The stars of Piaf - which should have been performed at Nottingham Playhouse and Leeds Playhouse this spring - have come together for an exclusive performance of Hymne a L&rsquo;Amour. The piece, initiated by Director Adam Penford and Musical Director Alex Parker, gives audiences an exclusive taste of what to expect from the postponed production.</p>
<p>Watch the video below!</p>
<p>The video was created long-distance as Covid-19 and the Atlantic Ocean has kept cast members apart. Performers include the Tony-nominated and Olivier Award-winning actress Jenna Russell (EastEnders, BBC, Sunday in the Park with George, Wyndham&rsquo;s Theatre) who was due to play the title role, her friend Sally Ann Triplett (Last Ship on Broadway, Anything Goes at The National Theatre) who had been announced to play Toine and Sara Poyzer (Billy Elliot in the West End, Mamma Mia in the West End) who had taken the role of Marlene Dietrich.</p>
<p>Nottingham Playhouse and its co-producer Leeds Playhouse have confirmed that, due to the coronavirus outbreak, Piaf will be postponed until May 2021 - with ticket holders being able to keep a hold of their ticket until final dates are released. It is anticipated that the cast will remain as previously announced.</p>
<p>Adam Penford, Artistic Director of Nottingham Playhouse and Director of Piaf, said: &ldquo;We were all disappointed when we had to delay Piaf as we&rsquo;d been planning it for a long time and had put together a really terrific cast. Jenna and Sally are old friends who performed together in the late 1980s and they were particularly looking forward to working together again as Sally is now based in NYC. That&rsquo;s when I got the idea of using technology to reunite them, alongside fellow Piaf cast member, Sara Poyzer. Three West End leading ladies singing a Piaf classic, and our talented Musical Director, Alex, made the magic happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pam Gems&rsquo; Piaf tells the extraordinary life story of the sensational, world-renowned singer Edith Piaf. The international star began singing on the streets of Paris and went on to have hits such as La Vie en Rose and Je Ne Regrette Rien.</p>
<p>This video from the cast of Piaf is just one way that Nottingham Playhouse has &lsquo;gone digital&rsquo; after Coronavirus closed its doors in March 2020. This has included the releasing of singing and dance tutorials, putting its Family Fest online, a new Pen Pal scheme, the re-releasing of archive footage like its Mass Bolero. New episodes of its Podcast Nottingham Playcast have also been released in reaction to the global crisis, featuring nationally and internationally renowned creatives discussing their careers, processes and lockdown experiences.</p>
<p>In a bid to re-open its doors, it has also launched a new fundraising initiative called the Curtain Up appeal. To donate to this, head to: nottinghamplayhouse.co.uk/support/curtain-up-appeal/.</p>

<h3 id="the-ultimate-guide-to-brigitte-bardot-the-18-best-songs-of-bb">&ldquo;The ultimate guide to Brigitte Bardot: The 18 best songs of B.B.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-ultimate-guide-to-Brigitte-Bardot.jpg?fit=800%2C640&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
“They may call me a sinner, but I am at peace with myself.”― Brigitte Bardot</p>
<p>France’s one and only Brigitte Bardot, AKA ‘BB’, has made herself known over the past decades for multiple reasons. Actress, singer, animal rights activist, sex symbol, fashion icon — you name it, BB’s done it.</p>
<p>Her numerous appearances as a pin-up in French films during the 1950s introduced her to the world and turned her into a veritable sex icon and a true symbol of feminine liberation. With her iconic fashion trends and sense of style, her career then took a different turn when she decided to make a go of things in the music world.</p>
<p>Looking back at France’s music scene during the 1960s, pop stars such as France Gall, and a well-known singer who went by the name of Serge Gainsbourg were leading the way before this young, pretty blonde with a voice full of contagious fun and sensuality came along. Brigitte Bardot and Co. brought a rock ’n’ roll touch to traditional French music which had been forged by numerous singer-songwriters, some of whom were Édith Piaf, Charles Trenet and many more.</p>
<p>So, we thought we would take a trip down memory lane — or maybe introduce you?— to one of France’s finest talents, by selecting our top 18 Brigitte Bardot songs. And let us tell you, you’re in for a treat with these sun-kissed classics.</p>
<p>See the list, below.</p>
<p>‘Invitango’</p>
<p>Get your dancing shoes on, you’re invited to dance the tango with one of the hottest women of the 1960s .</p>
<p>Explaining with a literal step-by-step what we can expect from this experience, the vocals and rhythm of ‘Invitango’ subliminally make us dance — and it’s hard to stop.</p>
<p>‘Les amis de la musique’</p>
<p>Bardot’s playful vocals encourage us to twist around the room with this trumpet-led masterpiece flirting with twenties-like melodies.</p>
<p>“Je suis le jazz de 1925” [“I am the jazz of 1925”] she announces — and she most certainly knows how to bring it back to life.</p>
<p>‘Je me donne à qui me plaît’</p>
<p>Bye-bye Roméo and Juliet, hello daring and seductive Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>Illustrating the feminine emancipation of that time, the singer explains how she “gives herself” to whoever she wants. And if you were lucky enough to walk past her at that time, you would certainly be anything but disappointed.</p>
<p>‘À la fin de l’été’</p>
<p>We all know how nostalgic we feel once summer is over.</p>
<p>This heartfelt piece dealing with her beloved beach and lover is the perfect representation of what we might feel once all those sunny summer days come to an end. Her soft voice takes us through this poetic-like song, made up of rhymes and peaceful melodies.</p>
<p>‘Ne me laisse pas l’aimer’</p>
<p>Brigitte Bardot’s backing vocals whispering as though it was her mind speaking out loud “Ne me laisse pas l’aimer ” [“Don’t let me love him”]. However, throughout the lively track, the singer tells us how she has noticed the attraction between this boy and girl.</p>
<p>Although it starts off as a sort of mischievous song, it ends with a bang when Bardot simply says: “Il ne faut plus le revoir ” [“You must never see him again”]. Bang.</p>
<p>‘Contact’</p>
<p>A weird yet fascinating combination of psychedelic and futuristic sounds, signé Serge Gainsbourg.</p>
<p>Taking us into outer space with this intriguing song, BB delivers probably one of her strangest vocal performances to date, with a chorus full of echoes and a melody that would freak everyone out and make them feel uncomfortable, back in the 1960s.</p>
<p>‘Un jour comme un autre’</p>
<p>The gentle strumming of the guitar and the light, delicate trumpet beautifully come together on ‘Un jour comme un autre’.</p>
<p>Yes, this is another heartbreak song, and when listening closely to the lyrics, Bardot does melt our hearts with her sincere lines. “Toi tu étais pour moi / Tout ce que j’espérais / Toi tu étais ma vie et même un peu plus / Tu étais l’amour” [“You were everything to me / Everything I had hoped for / You were my life and even more / You were love”]</p>
<p>‘C’est une bossa nova’</p>
<p>Originally released as the B-side of another one of Bardot’s classics — ‘Nue au soleil ’ — this track isn’t actually a bossa-nova when listening to the melody of it, but BB’s voice is something else.</p>
<p>Her soft whispers are dreamy, and the light feel of this piece is aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>‘Bubble Gum’</p>
<p>Another song written by her then lover Serge Gainsbourg. The enchanting melody of this track adds to the sensuality of the pretty blonde’s voice.</p>
<p>Tailored especially for her, Gainsbourg made sure to accentuate her already strong sex appeal with rather daring yet playfully innocent lyrics.</p>
<p>‘Bonnie and Clyde’</p>
<p>One of the most sensational couples of the 1960s reunited on this four-minute track, identifying themselves with the well-known lovers Bonnie Clark and Clyde Barrow. And we can all guess how that ended.</p>
<p>Gainsbourg and Bardot would go on to strike up a fiercely romantic and intensely fiery love affair. Returning to the song that brought them together, the duo recorded the Bonnie and Clyde compilation album made up of 12 songs and originally released by Fontana Records in 1968.</p>
<p>With the couple topping all newspaper articles and television shows given the media frenzy around their relationship, Bardot invited Gainsbourg on to her Le Bardot Show to perform an unforgettable rendition of ‘Bonnie and Clyde’. Donning the full costume and wielding weapons, the segment remains to this day of their most memorable.</p>
<p>‘Maria Ninguém’</p>
<p>Showcasing a mellifluous Brazilian accent, the singer recorded this song following a trip to Brazil, where she fell in love with her second Saint Tropez — Búzios.</p>
<p>A life-size statue of the French icon was installed on La Praia dos Ossos after her visit, which encouraged her to record her own take on Carlos Lyra’s original song — ‘Maria Ninguém’.</p>
<p>‘Je t’aime moi non plus’</p>
<p>Name a more iconic love song. Originally recorded with Brigitte Bardot in 1967, Serge Gainsbourg never released it due to its sexually explicit nature.</p>
<p>However, when he recorded it again two years later with his new girlfriend — Jane Birkin, the track became one of the biggest hits in the history of French music.</p>
<p>‘L’appareil à sous’</p>
<p>Bardot’s pop played an important part in the 1960s with her new take on traditional French music. She also brought a different twist to other feminine sensations of that time, whether French or American.</p>
<p>On this track, there are some noticeable similarities with the sixties’ girl bands who took rock ’n’ roll to new dimensions. With brilliant harmonies, guitar playing and the singer’s irresistible lilt, it sounds like something straight out of The Ronettes’ Colpix &amp; Buddah years’ compilation, but with the inimitable French touch.</p>
<p>‘Une histoire de plage’</p>
<p>One of our favourite sun-kissed songs by Brigitte Bardot.</p>
<p>Referring yet again to her favourite habitat , surrounded by shells and waves, the singer takes us on another calm guitar and harp-led ballad. A perfect soundtrack for those sunny days ahead.</p>
<p>‘Tu veux ou tu veux pas’</p>
<p>Marcel’s Zanini’s masterpiece with a feminine touch — or should we say a BB touch.</p>
<p>A frivolous and contagiously playful song with sexual connotations, which didn’t stop it from being one of many children’s favourite tracks of 1970, much to their parents’ delight.</p>
<p>‘Harley Davidson’</p>
<p>Gainsbourg strikes again.</p>
<p>With soaring guitars opening the track, the singer-songwriter put his obsession with American culture with one of the most attractive women in the world together, creating this incredibly sexy and symbolic track.</p>
<p>Dressed with only black knee-high boots and a mini-dress, Bardot only needed her Harley Davidson motorbike to feel complete. Phwoar.</p>
<p>‘Moi je joue’</p>
<p>The exuberant energy of this track is rather overwhelming and once again, infectious.</p>
<p>Just about every single man on earth must have dreamt of being in love with Brigitte Bardot in the sixties. And in ‘Moi je joue ’, the artist clearly says she’s playing a game, and she’s winning. Messieurs, you’d better have some patience and determination as Bardot is enjoying herself way too much to take you seriously.</p>
<p>‘La Madrague’</p>
<p>If we could only choose one Brigitte Bardot song, it would definitely be ‘La Madrague’.</p>
<p>Inspired by her favourite place on earth, she has spent most of her life there, and she is still residing there as we speak. Written by Jean-Max Rivière, this song is a sort of tribute to the place, reflecting Bardot’s feelings and her thoughts when she is there. A wonderful, delicate and idiosyncratic song.

<h3 id="spike-lee-releases-new-short-film-in-response-to-the-george-floyd-protests">&ldquo;Spike Lee releases new short film in response to the George Floyd protests&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Spike_Lee_2012.jpg?fit=900%2C655&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Critically acclaimed filmmaker Spike Lee, whose work has relentlessly tackled themes of race relations within the black community, has released a new short film amid the expanding protests surrounding the death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>George Floyd, an African-American man from Minnesota, was murdered by white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin when he knelt on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds during an arrest. Floyd, who was handcuffed and lying face down on the road, was unresponsive for 2 minutes and 53 seconds while the officer continued to hold his knee down on his neck.</p>
<p>Three other arresting officers, Thomas K. Lane, Tou Thao, and J. Alexander Kueng, also held Floyd down for this period. The incident, caught both on local CCTV and by video recordings secured bystanders, showed Floyd repeatedly saying “I can’t breathe” while the officer held his knee on the back of his neck.</p>
<p>The death has sparked mass protests across the United States with all four officers involved being fired the next day. Chauvin, the white officer who held down his knee, has since been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.</p>
<p>Now Spike Lee has addressed the situation with a short film which opens with the words “Will History Stop Repeating Itself” and references the death of Floyd—and Eric Garner—in relation to a scene from his acclaimed 1989 film Do the Right Thing.</p>
<p>In response to the riots, Lee released ‘3 Brothers’, during an appearance on CNN.</p>

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/david-bowie-unseen-hero_kzja2o.jpg?fit=900%2C506&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
David Bowie, across his long and illustrious creative career, has explored a lot of different avenues—a myriad of film and musical performances and most of them brilliant. One of those of performances and, quite possibly one of the most ludicrous we’ve found, is the time he appeared in an advertisement for an ice lolly called ‘Luv’ which, to add to the surreal nature of the scenario, was directed by acclaimed auteur Ridley Scott.</p>
<p>First things first, let’s talk about the lolly. The Lyons Maid venture was created to rival the ‘Fab’ lolly, which, of course, is still available today, and it was an ice lolly covered in chocolate and sprinkles. The product was marketed at young girls and so had the added bonus of being sold with ‘pop cards’ which attached to the packaging and were perfect for collecting.</p>
<p>However, in 1969, David Bowie wasn’t exactly the icon we all know today. His debut LP, David Bowie, flopped in the charts and, at the time of recording this commercial, he was still pursuing roles in film and television alongside his music aspirations.</p>
<p>It appears that director Ridley Scott spotted the potential of Bowie and decided to cast him in the advert to essentially pretend to be the young musician he would later become, as well as rushing up the bus steps with pure, unbridled excitement for this ice cream (around the seven-second mark). In another nugget of random Bowie facts, the young singer even went on to audition for a Kit Kat advert as well.</p>
<p>While many critically acclaimed artists have pursued the more lucrative side of mainstream commercial gina, Bowie could enjoy the added bonus of working alongside Ridley Scott who was driving the artistic character of this ice-lolly advert. Scott, who famously helmed iconic films such as Alien and Blade Runner, would later involve Bowie on the score of his Matt Damon hit The Martian, as well as directing some show-stopping flicks.</p>
<p>But before all that, before the Oscar, before the platinum albums, it was all about one thing: ‘Luv’ ice lollies from Lyons Maid.</p>
<p>Enjoy.
