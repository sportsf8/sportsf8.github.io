Harvey Weinstein’s defence team have asked the judge to take into account his “historic fall from grace” and “unrivalled” vilification, and show leniency when sentencing him on Wednesday even as documents emerge in which his brother says he belongs "in hell". Weinstein, 67, faces up to 29 years in prison if judge James Burke decides to throw the full weight of the law at him. At a minimum he will be sentenced to five years. On the eve of sentencing one of the women who testified against Weinstein, Tarale Wulff, said she hoped that Judge Burke issues a "prison sentence that reflects what he has done to us". She continued: "Whatever sentence he renders, it will never undo what has happened. Those events will continue to haunt me and the other survivors for the rest of our lives. "I hope that the sentence sends a clear message that times have changed and that more women need to speak out for themselves and that men and women need to speak out for others." On Friday Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, the prosecutor, wrote to Mr Burke to ask for the most severe sentence to be handed down, given “his total lack of remorse for the harm he has caused”. Weinstein was found guilty of rape and a criminal sex act on February 24.

Mrs Illuzzi-Orbon wrote that the case had managed to “establish that throughout his entire adult professional life, defendant has displayed a staggering lack of empathy, treating others with disdain and inhumanity.” She continued: “He has consistently advanced his own sordid desires and fixations over the well-being of others. “He has destroyed people’s lives and livelihoods or threatened to do so on whim. “He has exhibited an attitude of superiority and complete lack of compassion for his fellow man.” On Tuesday, on the eve of sentencing, more than 1,000 pages of emails and documents sent by Weinstein were made public in which Weinstein begged for forgiveness and support from friends including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Weinstein told them, in November 2017 – a month after The New York Times published bombshell allegations against him – that he was suicidal. Weinstein’s own brother Bob, with whom he co-founded Miramax, responded: “F–k u Harvey Weinstein. I pray there is a real hell. That’s where u belong. “U deserve a lifetime achievement award for the sheer savagery and immorality and inhumanness, for the acts u have perpetrated,” he wrote, adding that his brother should not reply to the email.
