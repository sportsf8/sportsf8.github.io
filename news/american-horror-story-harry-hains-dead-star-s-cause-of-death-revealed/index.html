The cause of death of actor Harry Hains has been confirmed (Picture: Getty)

The cause of death of American Horror Story star Harry Hains has been revealed as fentanyl intoxication, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner.

Hains died at the age of 27 in January this year.

His mother Jane Badler, star of sci-fi epic V and Australian soap Neighbours, revealed Harry had been battling through mental illness and addiction before he passed away.

Breaking the tragic news on Instagram, she posted: ‘He was 27 and had the world at his feet. But sadly he struggled with mental illness and addiction.

‘A brilliant spark shone bright too short a time… I will miss you, Harry, every day of my life.’

A further post shared on 31 January was a picture from his funeral.

Badler described the service as ‘a truly beautiful send off for extraordinary son’.

She continued: ‘I am so grateful for all the people who came to learn more about Harry .Harry was blessed with beauty , talent and brilliance . He also struggled with a profound sleeping disorder which led to a lifetime dependence on medication.

‘I can see now that my fear is gone how hard he tried and how strong the struggle was. I am so proud of him.

‘Harry fought for those who feel marginalised or different. He left behind a powerful body of work. I look forward to presenting it to the world with his incredible team.’

Hains also appeared in Netflix drama The OA (Picture: Netflix)

Hains, who also appeared in Netflix drama The OA, was also a prolific musician who went under the name ANTIBOY.

Harry identified as gender fluid, explaining to Boys and Girls magazine in a 2019 interview: ‘I know that I am born male but I don’t think I represent what it means to be a man.

‘I believe we should be whatever we want. It gets kind of confusing when we start labelling ourselves so I try to stay away from labels.

‘I grew up in Melbourne and I had a very open and accepting family. Dating someone of either sex didn’t make a difference to me.’
