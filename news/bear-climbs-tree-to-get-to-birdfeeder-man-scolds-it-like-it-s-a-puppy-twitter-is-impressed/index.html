<p>Bear climbs tree to get to birdfeeder, man scolds it like it’s a puppy. Twitter is impressed</p>
<p>it-s-viral</p>
<p>Updated: Jun 18, 2020 15:00 IST</p>
<p>This is a tale of a sneaky bear that climbed up a tree to get some noms from a birdfeeder and a man who scolded the animal like it’s a little puppy. This is a story which, besides being fascinating, may also leave you with tons of giggles.</p>
<p>Shared by reporter Scott Bixby on Twitter, a video of the incident has tickled people’s funny bone and made many go “aww”.</p>
<p>“Any tips for bear-proofing a birdfeeder?” with this simple caption Bixby shared the video.</p>
<p>The video opens with a bear trying to steal… err… eat food from a birdfeeder hanging on a tree. Within a few seconds a voice in the background says, “What are you doing? No. No.” What follows next, till the end of the video, is the man scolding the bear like it’s a doggo. So does the man’s stern approach work on the animal? Take a look at the video below to find out:</p>
<p>Any tips for bear-proofing a birdfeeder? pic.twitter.com/UUlRiwHYTB — Scott Bixby (@scottbix) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>Shared just a few hours ago, the video has already prompted all sorts of comments. With over 2.3 lakh views and close to 6,500 likes, it won’t be wrong to say that the clip has piqued people’s attention.</p>
<p>“I like how you talked to it like it was a dog,” wrote a Twitter user. To which, Bixby replied, “They’re honestly dog-like! Like, his face looked like my dog’s when he gets into the trash.” If you look closely at the bear’s face, you may understand what he is talking about. “Don’t fall off. But down!” expressed another. “This made my day,” wrote a third. “He obeyedddd you!!” joked a third.</p>
<p>Some shared tips to bear-proof the birdfeeder as well.</p>
<p>“Don’t put bird feeders out in summer. Birds have enough food and the feeders are bear magnets no matter how high you string them,” wrote a Twitter user. In an update, he later wrote that’s exactly what he did. “Taking down the birdfeeder for now, per the advice of a lot plenty of people with unexpected ursine knowledge,” he tweeted.</p>
<p>A few also shared GIFs about the whole situation:</p>

<p>A few, however, were not happy about the way he spoke to the bear and didn’t hold back while expressing their reactions.</p>
<p>“Oh my god Scott, it’s not a puppy. You can’t yell at a bear ‘down’,” wrote a Tiwtter user. To which, another individual replied, “What is wrong with him.”</p>
<p>Probably, in an attempt to defend Bixby, one Twitter user wrote, “It worked though.”</p>
<p>What do you think of the video?

Talking to a wild bear like a pet dog would probably not be any expert&rsquo;s recommendation but it certainly worked for one fearless man.</p>
<p>Scott Bixby saw a wild bear eating from a bird feeder in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, and got the bear to back off by repeatedly telling it: &lsquo;Down&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Scott jokingly named the bear Teddy Graham, after the bear-shaped cracker snacks.</p>

<p>A bear climbed a tree to get to a bird feeder in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, but was told to climb down by Scott Bixby</p>
<p>Scott clapped his hands and repeatedly told the bear &lsquo;down&rsquo; which the bear remarkably obeyed</p>
<p>The video starts with a panicked voice asking Scott what to do as Scott walks out onto the deck towards the bear who has climbed a tree to reach a bird feeder hanging up.</p>
<p>The bear seems to casually watch Scott and he tells it to stop munching on the feed.</p>
<p>Remarkably when Scott claps his hands and says &lsquo;down&rsquo; the bear obeys the command and starts to slowly shuffle down the tree.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fall off but down,&rsquo; says Scott.</p>
<p>Any tips for bear-proofing a birdfeeder? pic.twitter.com/UUlRiwHYTB — Scott Bixby (@scottbix) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>The bear decides to give it another go and tries to climb back up to the bird feeder but is eventually convinced to continue its descent.</p>
<p>As the camera pans down it becomes apparent that the deck Scott is standing on is high up in the branches of the trees and the bear has climbed a long way.</p>
<p>Looking down at the bear sliding down the tree trunk Scott says: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s actually super impressive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man filming the interaction says to the bear: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s really far down bud. Be careful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scott and the man filming the incredible interaction were impressed at how high of a tree the bear had managed to climb</p>
<p>Scott posted the video on social media with the caption: &lsquo;Any tips for bear-proofing a birdfeeder?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thousands of people responded joking about Scott talking to a bear like a puppy and suggesting different ways of keeping bears away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One user said: &lsquo;Take it down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fed bear is a dead bear: if bears get used to eating food provided by humans they will become nuisance bears and will end up shot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In some places there are penalties for feeding bears, even by accident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Scott later posted that they had followed this advice and taken the bird feeder down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We love Teddy Graham too much to get him in trouble with the Bear Patrol,&rsquo; he said.

CLOSE Traffic stops while a family of black bears crosses I-40. Asheville Citizen Times</p>
<p>Black bears never really get a good winter&rsquo;s sleep in the Southern Appalachians of Western North Carolina because of our relatively warm winters.</p>
<p>So the bruins have been out of their dens for months now, but are on the prowl for food, as is the natural course of a bear&rsquo;s life, and have been rather active in Pisgah National Forest, according to the Forest Service.</p>
<p>In a June 19 news release, the Forest Service warned visitors to North Mills River, Bent Creek Experimental Forest near Asheville, as well as the Black Balsam and surrounding areas in the Pisgah Ranger District, to be on the look-out for black bears.</p>
<p>In the Grandfather Ranger District, bears have also been active at Table Rock and the Old Fort Picnic Area.</p>

<p>Black bears look for food that campers and trail users bring on their trips. While black bear attacks on people are rare, such attacks have resulted in human fatalities.</p>
<p>RELATED: Sneak peek at Asheville Urban/Suburban Bear Study results</p>
<p>To avoid bear attacks, experts recommend the following:</p>
<p>Keep your dog on a leash in areas where bears are reported.</p>
<p>If you notice a bear nearby, pack up your food and trash immediately and vacate the area as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If a bear approaches, move away slowly; do not run. Get into a vehicle or a secure building.</p>
<p>If necessary, attempt to scare the animal away with loud shouts, by banging pans together, or throwing rocks and sticks at it.</p>
<p>If you are attacked by a black bear, try to fight back using any object available. Act aggressively and intimidate the bear by yelling and waving your arms. Playing dead is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Visitors are encouraged to prevent bear interactions by practicing these additional safety tips:</p>
<p>Do not store food in tents.</p>
<p>Properly store food and scented items, like toothpaste, by using a bear-proof container, or leaving them in your vehicle. Many toiletries that seem to have little to no odor can still attract bears.</p>
<p>Clean up food or garbage around fire rings, grills, or other areas of your campsite.</p>
<p>Do not leave food unattended.</p>
<p>Never run away from a bear. Back away slowly and make lots of noise.</p>
<p>The large number of bear sightings and encounters in the past few years has led to required use of bear-proof canisters in the Shining Rock and Black Balsam areas. Backcountry users must use commercially-made canisters constructed of solid, non-pliable material manufactured for the specific purpose of resisting entry by bears.</p>
<p>RELATED: Haywood County couple recount terrifying encounter with black bear</p>
<p>Justin McVey, mountain region wildlife biologist for the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission, spends the better part of his spring chasing bear calls.</p>
<p>He said North Carolina has a healthy black bear populations, with roughly 7,000-9,000 in the WNC mountains, and another 11,000-13,000 on the coast, for a total of some 18,000-21,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems like bears have been really active this year, starting a little sooner than normal,&rdquo; McVey said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had lots of calls of bears being around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it&rsquo;s hard to say if the increased bear activity is due to lack of natural food sources or the increase in available, human-supplied food sources.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It very well could be this time of the year where the berries haven&rsquo;t really popped out by yet, and so the bears are hungry. But it also very well could be just bears that over time have been conditioned to rely on sources of food provided by people, whether that&rsquo;s garbage or bird seed or intentional feeding,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>People should only call the wildlife commission about bears they encounter in their yards, McVey said, or if a bear is injured or orphaned or is causing harm, and should follow the Bearwise.org principles for both residential and outdoor setting.</p>

<h3 id="new-yorkers-encouraged-to-reduce-bears-access-to-attractants-such-as-food-garbage">&ldquo;New Yorkers encouraged to reduce bears’ access to attractants such as food, garbage&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.observertoday.com/images/2017/01/31094407/fb.jpg" alt="img">
The state Department of Environmental Conservation is encouraging New Yorkers to reduce the potential for conflicts with bears in communities across the state.</p>
<p>“We have recently begun to see a rise in reported sightings of black bears in suburban and urban areas,” said Basil Seggos, state DEC commissioner. “While seeing a bear is an exciting experience for many New Yorkers, bears that are inadvertently fed by humans exhibit unnatural behaviors and can become a nuisance. DEC encourages homeowners, property managers, and outdoor enthusiasts to follow guidance to reduce bears’ access to attractants like garbage, birdseed, and pet food to discourage nuisance bears.”</p>
<p>In June, black bear movement increases as the breeding season begins and yearling (one-year-old) bears disperse to find their own space. Inevitably some of these bears, particularly yearlings, wander through places these animals would not normally inhabit, like suburban or urban neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Bears have an acute sense of smell and may attempt to consume anything they perceive as edible, including improperly stored garbage, birdseed, livestock, pet food, and barbecue grill grease traps. Once a bear has discovered a food source, it may return or seek similar foods at neighboring properties, learning bad behavior that can damage human property and may lead to the death of the bear.</p>
<p>Bears that frequent developed areas are more likely to be hit by vehicles, illegally killed by people who perceive them as a threat, or euthanized for dangerous behavior. New Yorkers can live responsibly with bears by taking down bird feeders, storing garbage containers and pet/livestock feed securely indoors, cleaning grill grease traps, and asking neighbors to do the same. A bear passing through a developed area in search of suitable natural habitat may investigate human food sources, but if it cannot obtain anything to eat, it will continue on its way.</p>
<p>If a bear is seen in an unexpected location, residents should simply be aware of the bear’s presence and observe the bear without attempting to interact with it.</p>
<p>If left alone and given the opportunity, nearly all bears that wander into urban and suburban areas will leave as quickly and quietly as they appear, without serious conflict or need for physical removal.</p>
<p>Do not feed bears intentionally.</p>
<p>Feeding bears intentionally is illegal and a ticketable offense.</p>
<p>Bears that obtain food from humans will continue to seek food from humans and become nuisance bears, which can pose a threat to humans.</p>
<p>Around dwellings, the public is encouraged to:</p>
<p>¯ Remove all bird feeders;</p>
<p>¯ Keep garbage, grills, pet food, and bird seed inside a solid, secure structure such as a house, shed, or garage;</p>
<p>¯ If grills cannot be secured, clean grills, move them away from houses, and remove grease traps after each use;</p>
<p>¯ Put garbage on the curb the morning of collection, not the night before, and use bear-resistant trash containers; and</p>
<p>¯ Close garage doors and ground-floor windows/doors at night.</p>
<p>Campgrounds visitors should follow the following guidance to reduce potential bear conflicts:</p>
<p>¯ Keep campsites as clean as possible;</p>
<p>¯ Clean up after all meals immediately. Keep grills, pots, pans, cooking utensils, and wash basins clean when not in use;</p>
<p>¯ Leave coolers and food inside car trunks or truck cabs;</p>
<p>¯ Store food and coolers in food lockers when available;</p>
<p>¯ Never keep food, coolers, or scented items in tents when camping. Store toiletries securely with coolers and food;</p>
<p>¯ Do not put grease, garbage, plastic diapers, cans, bottles, or other refuse in the fireplace; and</p>
<p>¯ Dispose of garbage in the campground’s dumpsters every evening.</p>
<p>Visitors to the backcountry are encouraged to:</p>
<p>¯ Pack a minimal amount of food. Use lightweight and dehydrated foods. Plan all meals to avoid leftovers;</p>
<p>¯ Use bear-resistant food canisters, which are required in the Eastern High Peaks Wilderness of the Adirondack Park;</p>
<p>¯ Cook and eat before dark and cook away from campsites;</p>
<p>¯ Avoid spills and drippings while cooking and do not pour grease into fire pits; and</p>
<p>¯ Never leave food unattended.</p>
<p>Those who encounter a bear should:</p>
<p>¯ Don’t panic. Most bears are as afraid of people as people are of bears;</p>
<p>¯ Never approach, surround, or corner a bear;</p>
<p>¯ Back away slowly–do not run;</p>
<p>¯ Do not throw backpacks or food at bears. If bears are rewarded with food, they will continue to seek food from people; and\</p>
<p>¯ If feeling threatened by a bear, raise your arms over your head to look bigger and yell loudly at the bear while slowly backing away.</p>
<p>When to report a nuisance bear:</p>
<p>¯ When a nuisance bear presents an immediate danger to public safety, call 911;</p>
<p>¯ If a bear is damaging property or is reluctant to leave the area, but the situation is not an emergency, call the regional wildlife office during business hours, or call the DEC Law Enforcement Dispatch Center at 1-844-DEC-ECOs (1-844-332-3267); and</p>
<p>If bear cubs are known to be orphaned in the spring or summer (before July), call DEC. After that time, cubs generally survive on their own.

<p>A photo captured over the weekend by a Calgary family has experts excited about what could be the first spotting ever of a grizzly with a white head but regular brown colouring on its body.</p>
<p>The photo was captured while the family was driving back home from the Banff National Park area Sunday, when they spotted the unique bear along with an adult grizzly and another normally-coloured cub.</p>
<p>“As we drove by I said to my husband, ‘That cub has a white head,’” Julia Turner Butterwick said. “I had just kind of snapped the picture quickly, and when I zoomed in on the photo I realized he had a fully white head and a brown body.</p>
<p>“That’s got to be really unusual. Tweet This</p>
<p>“We saw lots of other bears on our drive (Sunday). We saw about four black bears and three grizzly bears,” she said.</p>

<p>“It was a very active day, but I have never seen anything like this. That little guy is pretty special.”</p>

<p>Several bear experts confirmed to Global News the cub was a grizzly, but they had never seen or even heard of one with similar colourings.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like it. Nor have I seen a picture of one,” Jeff Gailus, a conservation writer and grizzly bear expert, said.</p>
<p>Wildlife expert and zoologist Paul Pauquet agreed it was an “exceptionally unique” spotting.</p>
<p>“[This is] possibly never previously observed and recorded. Tweet This</p>
<p>“I have seen and photographed grizzly bears with light blond (but not white) heads and darker coloured bodies,” Pauquet said.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“Of course, this new sighting is of increased interest given recent sightings of a white grizzly bear in Banff. The obvious question is whether these two bears are related,” he said.</p>

<p>That other completely white grizzly bear, known as Nakota by locals, has also made headlines recently as experts caution the public interest in that rare bear.</p>
<p>A rare white grizzly is shown in Banff National Park in this 2020 handout photo. A wildlife photographer is worried about a rare white grizzly in the mountain parks after watching people get too close to it and seeing it run across the highway. The bear, which has been nicknamed Nakota by locals, was first revealed publicly after it was spotted in Banff National Park in late April. Parks Canada says it’s not an albino, but a natural colour phase variation that makes the three-and-a-half year old bear white. THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO – Parks Canada 2020, Sonia Nichol.</p>
<p>Pauquet said that the little cub with the white head was likely caused by an atypical recessive gene, but that gene would have to be present in both parents to show up in a cub.</p>
<p>“In theory, the gene could be present but not exhibited in the parent bears and sibling or other relatives,” he said, adding that he wonders if the white colouring that has shown up in at least two Banff-area grizzlys now means the bears in that area are becoming more isolated from other populations.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“The likelihood of the gene being expressed would be enhanced in isolated or contained population of bears, such as an island population, because opportunities are increased of a bear mating with a related bear that also carries the gene,” he said.</p>
<p>Gailus said that he believes the half-and-half cub is even more extraordinary than the more well-known three-year-old all-white bear.</p>
<p>“Unless it (the cub) got into a can of white paint, it’s obviously a very rare colour phase, perhaps even rarer than the all-white grizzly present in Banff.</p>
<p>“To have two such sightings in the same spring is nothing short of a miracle,” Gailus said. Tweet This</p>
<p>Global News is not identifying the exact area where the partially white cub was spotted.</p>
<p>Turner Butterwick said she also reported the sighting to Parks Canada.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Parks Canada confirmed to Global News it was aware of the unique bear and has been monitoring the family.</p>
<p>“The young of year grizzly cub, its sibling and mother are known to Parks Canada and have been spending their time between Banff and Kootenay national parks,” an emailed statement said.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“These grizzlies are believed to be about six months old and this will be their first year in the wild with their mother.” Tweet This</p>
<p>The agency said that it has marked the mother bear as female grizzly 143, and that bear also has a sibling in the Lake Louise area, female grizzly 142.</p>
<p>Female grizzly 143 does not have a radio collar, which is typically used for research purposes or if an animal frequents highly populated areas, which she has historically not done.</p>
<p>While Parks Canada did not have additional photos of the cub, it said it is believed to have an unusual “blond head and chest.”</p>
<p>1:37 Large area of Kananaskis Country closed after bear ‘made contact with hiker’ Large area of Kananaskis Country closed after bear ‘made contact with hiker’</p>
<p>When spotting wildlife near roadways, Parks Canada recommends people do not leave their vehicles or interact at all with the animals.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“When visitors see wildlife on other roads, stop only where legal and safe to do, stay in your vehicle and give the animal space. Bears and other wildlife that become comfortable around people and roadsides are at greater risk of being struck by a vehicle,” it said.</p>
<p>Feeding animals in national parks is also illegal, with fines up to $25,000.

<h3 id="how-millionaires-invest-during-a-bear-market">&ldquo;How Millionaires Invest During a Bear Market&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Adopting a millionaire mindset can help you avoid emotional decision-making as you wait out stock market bumps.</p>
<p>A bear market &ndash; signified by a 20% or more drop in stock prices &ndash; can be easier to weather when you&rsquo;re properly diversified and in it for the long haul. Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.A, BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is a prime example of how to invest like a millionaire (or in his case, billionaire) during all market seasons, periods of recession or times of increased volatility. Buffett has compounded capital at more than 20% annually for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oftentimes, investors can be questioning their investment strategy or their planning,&rdquo; says Monica Sipes, partner and senior wealth advisor at Exencial Wealth Advisors in Frisco, Texas. &ldquo;They understand that the math works in their favor in a bear market, but it can be emotionally testing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Read: How to Invest in a Bear Market as a Beginner.]</p>
<p>Developing some coping mechanisms that mimic how millionaires invest in a bear market can help you maintain stability and consistency in your investing strategy.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best tips to growing wealth like a millionaire:</p>
<p>&ndash; Resist the urge to run.</p>
<p>&ndash; Think big, act small.</p>
<p>&ndash; Automate your investments.</p>
<p>&ndash; Know what you own.</p>
<p>&ndash; Limit your losses.</p>
<p>&ndash; Keep bear markets in perspective.</p>
<p>Resist the Urge to Run</p>
<p>At the first sign of a bear market, you may be tempted to begin selling off stocks to minimize losses. As it happens, that approach is counterintuitive to the millionaire mindset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investors need to be able to hold on to their investments during an economic downturn or bear market,&rdquo; says Marc Doss, regional chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank in San Diego. &ldquo;Some investors sell during a downturn and don&rsquo;t participate in the recovery phase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doss says one of the keys to avoiding a forced sell-off is having liquid cash you can rely on when the economic outlook is uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investors can use their cash instead of tapping into their long-term investments during a bear market,&rdquo; he adds.</p>
<p>Think Big, Act Small</p>
<p>During a bear market, investing like a millionaire means staying focused on your objectives while being strategic with your actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millionaire investors think forward five or 10 years from now,&rdquo; says Clark Kendall, CEO of Kendall Capital in Rockville, Maryland.</p>
<p>That includes considering what the economy and markets will look like, how consumers will be spending money and what the interest rate forecast may hold. They then use that dollars-and-cents thinking to shape the actions they take in the short term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They manage risk by making a series of small decisions and know that any decision can be a wrong decision,&rdquo; Kendall says. &ldquo;But a series of well-thought-out small decisions will typically outperform just one make-or-break large decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many millionaire investors rely on a slow-and-steady approach to portfolio building, says Ryan Shuchman, partner at Cornerstone Financial Services in Southfield, Michigan. &ldquo;Few and far between are those with substantial assets that came from the &lsquo;big wins&rsquo; in the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lesson here, Shuchman says, is to avoid making &ldquo;all-in&rdquo; buy or sell moves since the odds of this strategy paying off tend to be low.</p>
<p>Automate Your Investments</p>
<p>Automating your investments can do two things for you.</p>
<p>First, it ensures that you&rsquo;re taking advantage of the power of dollar-cost averaging and compounding interest consistently over time. Second, it can help you avoid the pitfalls of trying to time the market.</p>
<p>The amount of time an individual spends in the market is more important than timing in the market, says Tim Quillin, a chartered financial analyst and partner at Aptus Financial in Little Rock, Arkansas.</p>
<p>[Sign up for stock news with our Invested newsletter.]</p>
<p>When investors take their money out of the market, they have to be right twice: when they sell their stocks and when they start investing in the market again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The saddest investing missteps we see are when people try to outsmart the market, typically by selling stocks during periods of uncertainty like late 2008 or early 2009, or even December 2018,&rdquo; Quillin says.</p>
<p>Know What You Own</p>
<p>Knowing what you own is good advice for investing like a millionaire in any type of market. The concept of understanding what you bought and why you bought it is a principle that can be attributed to Gerald Loeb, founding partner of brokerage firm E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
