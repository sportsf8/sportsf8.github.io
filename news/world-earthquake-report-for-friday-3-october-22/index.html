<p>Earthquake News and Global Seismic Reports</p>
<p>World Earthquake Report for Friday, 30 October 2020</p>
<p>Sat, 31 Oct 2020, 00:20 00:20 AM | BY: EARTHQUAKEMONITOR 00:20 AM | BY: EARTHQUAKEMONITOR</p>
<p>Worldwide earthquakes above magnitude 3 during the past 24 hours on 31 Oct 2020</p>
<p>Total seismic energy estimate: 8.3 x 1014 joules (230 gigawatt hours, equivalent to 2 x 105 tons of TNT or 12.4 atomic bombs!) 8.3 x 10joules (230 gigawatt hours, equivalent to 2 x 10tons of TNT or 12.4 atomic bombs!) learn more</p>
<p>10 largest earthquakes in the world (past 24 hours):</p>
<p>Earthquakes reported felt:</p>
<p>More than 140 aftershocks have been recorded in the area so far, including two of magnitudes 5+; many more are expected to occur in the coming days, weeks, even months from now.</p>
<p>Stronger aftershocks can be particularly dangerous for already damaged buildings.</p>
<p>According to preliminary information, at least 12 people died during the quake in Turkey and two on the Greek island of Samos, closest to the quake. More than 400 injured were confirmed as well.</p>
<p>The numbers are likely to rise as search and rescue operations continue to look for victims under the debris of collapsed buildings.</p>
<p>A magnitude 4.2 earthquake was reported only 6 minutes ago by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC), considered one of the key international agencies that monitor seismic activity worldwide. The earthquake occurred at a very shallow depth of 2 km beneath the epicenter in the morning on Friday 30 October 2020 at 11.48 am local time. The magnitude, exact epicenter location and depth of the quake are likely to be revised within the next few hours as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report.</p>
<p>Our monitoring service at VolcanoDiscovery identified a second report from the Kandilli Oservatory and Earthquake Research Institute in Istanbul (KOERI-RETMC) which listed the quake at magnitude 4.0.</p>
<p>Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake was probably felt by many people in the area of the epicenter. It should not have caused significant damage, other than objects falling from shelves, broken windows etc.</p>
<p>Towns or cities near the epicenter where the quake might have been felt, based on preliminary calculations, include Bingöl (pop. 80,600) at a distance of 10 km with light shaking, Genç (pop. 22,500) at a distance of 26 km with weak shaking, Karakoçan (pop. 29,700) at a distance of 37 km with weak shaking, and Muş (pop. 82,500) at a distance of 93 km with very weak shaking.</p>
<p>The German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam (GFZ) reported a magnitude 5.6 quake in the Solomon Islands near the town of Auki only 11 minutes ago. The earthquake shook late at night on Friday 30 October 2020 at 10.10 pm local time at a shallow depth of 10 km. The magnitude, exact epicenter location and depth of the quake are likely to be revised within the next few hours as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report.</p>
<p>A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) agency, which listed it as a magnitude 5.5 earthquake.</p>
<p>Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage.</p>
<p>Towns or cities near the epicenter that are likely to be affected include Auki (pop. 6,800) at a distance of 39 km with moderate ground shaking, Tulagi (pop. 1,800) at a distance of 106 km with light shaking, Honiara (pop. 56,300) at a distance of 142 km with light shaking, and Buala (pop. 2,700) at a distance of 174 km with weak shaking.</p>
<p>This story will be updated soon by VolcanoDiscovery. If you’re in the area, please send us your experience through our reporting mechanism. This will help us provide more first-hand updates to anyone around the globe who wants to know more about this quake.</p>
<p>A shallow magnitude 5.5 earthquake was reported around noon near the village of Yuyapichis, Peru. According to the German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam (GFZ), the quake hit on Friday 30 October 2020 at 1.24 pm local time at a shallow depth of 10 km. Shallow earthquakes are felt more strongly than deeper ones as they are closer to the surface. The magnitude, exact epicenter location and depth of the quake are likely to be revised within the next few hours as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report.</p>
<p>A second report was later issued by the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) agency, which listed it as a magnitude 5.2 earthquake.</p>
<p>Based on the preliminary seismic data, the quake should have been widely felt by almost everyone in the area of the epicenter. It might have caused light to moderate damage.</p>
<p>Towns or cities near the epicenter that are likely to be affected include Yuyapichis (pop. 700) at a distance of 50 km with light shaking, Codo del Pozuzo (pop. 900) at a distance of 62 km with light shaking, Huánuco (pop. 148,000) at a distance of 129 km with light shaking, and Pucallpa (pop. 310,800) at a distance of 196 km with weak shaking.</p>
<p>This story will be updated soon by VolcanoDiscovery. If you’re in the area, please send us your experience through our reporting mechanism. This will help us provide more first-hand updates to anyone around the globe who wants to know more about this quake.</p>
<p>An earthquake of magnitude 4.1 occurred only 8 minutes ago 95 km southwest of Champerico, Guatemala, the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies (INETER) reported. The quake hit at an intermediate depth of 95 km beneath the epicenter early morning on Friday 30 October 2020 at 4.36 am local time. The magnitude, exact epicenter location and depth of the quake are likely to be revised within the next few hours as seismologists review data and refine their calculations, or as other agencies issue their report.</p>
<p>Towns or cities near the epicenter where the quake might have been felt, based on preliminary calculations, include Champerico (pop. 7,800) at a distance of 95 km with very weak shaking.</p>

An earthquake of up to 7.0 magnitude hit Izmir province in the west of Turkey, near the Aegean sea, leaving at least 12 people dead, 419 injured and several buildings destroyed.</p>
<p>Images on social media showed water rushing through the streets of Izmir from an apparent sea surge.</p>
<p>During live remarks, Murat Kuru, the Turkish minister of environment and urbanization, said the quake had hit Izmir&rsquo;s Bayrakli district, where a number of people were trapped under the rubble.</p>
<p>Turkey&rsquo;s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency (Afad) put the magnitude of the earthquake at 6.6, while the US Geological Survey said it was 7.0.</p>
<p>The quake struck at around 2.50pm (1150 GMT) and was felt along Turkey&rsquo;s Aegean coast and the northwestern Marmara region, media said.</p>
<p>The epicentre of the earthquake was reported as 17km outside of the town of Seferihisar, in the Aegean sea.</p>
<p>Residents of the Greek island of Samos, which has a population of about 45,000, were urged to stay away from coastal areas, Eftyhmios Lekkas, head of Greece&rsquo;s organisation for anti-seismic planning, told Greece&rsquo;s Skai TV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very big earthquake, it&rsquo;s difficult to have a bigger one,&rdquo; said Lekkas. High tidal wave warnings were in place in Samos.</p>
<p>Izmir mayor Tunc Soyer said there were at least 20 buildings completely collapsed in the province.</p>
<p>The tremors were felt in the north, near Kocaeli and even Istanbul.</p>
<p>Footage broadcast on Haberturk TV showed some buildings completely collapsed, while a dust cloud billowed through the air.</p>
<p>Wow a mini tsunami occurred in Izmir’s Seferhisar after a 6.6 magnitude earthquake pic.twitter.com/uRNz0PrXeZ — Ragıp Soylu (@ragipsoylu) October 30, 2020</p>
<p>A Middle East Eye correspondent in Izmir said: &ldquo;The buildings shook for around 15 seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people ran out on to the streets and could be seen phoning their families once the shaking had ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people are still waiting outside in the streets and parks rather than returning to their homes for fear of aftershocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several ambulances can be heard criss-crossing through the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in a tweet that his government had been using every resource at its disposal to help citizens, as emergency services began to work to save people from the rubble.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are a common occurence in Turkey; nearly 17,000 people died in a quake in the western city of Izmit in 1999.
