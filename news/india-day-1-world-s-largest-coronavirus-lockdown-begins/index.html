Manual laborers have no work, farmers cannot tend fields, online retailers and pharmacists have been harassed by overzealous police officers. Countless people have been running out of cash.</p>
<p>“The kind of devastation that is going to be faced by the bottom 50 percent of the workers in the informal sector is unimaginable,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economist and professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi.</p>
<p>In some places, police officers have staked out roads and highways, stopping motorists and demanding to know why they were outside. Several states have closed their borders, forcing cargo trucks to simply park by the roadside.</p>
<p>Flipkart, the country’s largest online retailer, found it so difficult to move people and goods that it suspended delivery of everything except food.</p>
<p>Grocery stores were allowed to remain open, and in the cities, crowds swarmed and emptied the shelves. At an upscale market in New Delhi, one man stuffed his Mercedes with groceries on Wednesday afternoon, jumped behind the wheel and zoomed off — wearing blue rubber dishwashing gloves and a snorkeling mask.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The vast majority of India&rsquo;s 1.3bn population have been told to stay at home</p>
<p>India is at a critical stage in its fight against coronavirus as fears of community transmissions rise. During its lockdown frontline workers are still going out every day to win what one doctor described as &ldquo;a war India can&rsquo;t afford to lose&rdquo;. The BBC&rsquo;s Vikas Pandey reports.</p>
<p>Experts have warned that India still has time to contain what otherwise could be a catastrophic outbreak, putting millions of lives at risk.</p>
<p>Many fear that the country&rsquo;s healthcare system may not be able to cope with a massive outbreak. Around 130 million people will head to hospitals even if 10% of India&rsquo;s population is infected, according to conservative estimates.</p>
<p>And the country only has 0.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people, one of the lowest ratios in the world, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p>
<p>So, India is pinning its hope of containing the outbreak on social distancing and a complete lockdown of major cities and towns. And the success is down to the efforts of unknown but selfless workers.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cases have increased sharply in India in recent days</p>
<p>Many workers, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, police, pilots, railway workers and rubbish collectors, are braving grave odds every day.</p>
<p>And medical staff are at the forefront of these efforts.</p>
<p>Dr Taarini Johri, a medical officer at a government-run hospital in the western city of Ahmedabad, said the medical sector &ldquo;was not prepared to deal with the crisis&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctors and nurses working in the coronavirus wards have good safety equipment. But doctors who are screening patients don&rsquo;t have the same despite the fact that we are at most risk,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A lot of doctors are at risk. We desperately need more safety gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priya Srivastava, a doctor at a hospital in the northern city of Lucknow, said &ldquo;the time to act is now&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image caption Dr Srivastava says India could be facing a scenario unlike any it&rsquo;s seen before</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to build makeshift hospitals quickly. If community transmission aggravates, we will have to be ready for it - it will be unlike any scenario we have seen before or we are trained for,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>She added that the flu season is making matters worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is so much panic. People are reaching hospitals with minor coughs and colds, thinking they are infected with Covid-19. So, we need to keep hammering the right message about how to identify coronavirus symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr VK Batra, who has been practising medicine in Delhi for more than three decades, says doctors are &ldquo;doing everything we can&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just one key message for people - stay at home. Just do this for a few weeks and we may have a fighting chance to control the outbreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image caption Dr Batra says all doctors, nurses and paramedics should get protective equipment</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of us have to stay away from our families for days so we can continue to see patients. That&rsquo;s stressful, but we don&rsquo;t have any other option. We are fighting an enemy we didn&rsquo;t expect to fight or even see coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not getting personal protection equipment as quickly as we should,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are the frontline soldiers and you can&rsquo;t win a war without them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>India has now allowed private labs to conduct coronavirus tests, and some lab technicians are being trained. Amardeep Chaudhary is one of them.</p>
<p>Image caption &ldquo;I am ready to do my bit to fight the virus,&rdquo; Amardeep says</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am used to going to people&rsquo;s homes to collect samples. We take care to protect ourselves. But coronavirus is something different. I am scared for sure, but I won&rsquo;t give up,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>While doctors are fighting the battle inside hospitals, it&rsquo;s the police who have to enforce the lockdown outside.</p>
<p>Rahul Srivastava, a senior officer in Uttar Pradesh, says the first two days were extremely tough. &ldquo;People are not used to staying indoors. They would just not understand the importance of the lockdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In most areas he says police are following the policy of &ldquo;explaining, persuading and requesting people to stay indoors&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image caption There have been widespread reports of the rules being flouted and panic buying</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are stricter when people get adamant about going out. It&rsquo;s a tough job and doubly challenging as we have to keep people safe and also ensure the safety of our own personnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be on the streets 24/7 to ensure the lockdown is enforced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then there are key workers almost hidden in plain-sight: security guards and refuse collectors.</p>
<p>Sonu Kumar, who collects rubbish in a Delhi suburb, says his first instinct after the lockdown was to rush to his village but his boss made &ldquo;me realise the importance of our job&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image caption Spare a thought for Sonu Kumar and other rubbish collectors</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hygiene is key in fighting the virus. But we are scared - people not covering their rubbish bins. We see used tissues, masks and gloves in their open bins. We are using protective gear but it still scares us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of our safety. Please seal it. We are doing this for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vijay Dubey works as a security guard in Noida near Delhi and has had &ldquo;a hard time dealing with people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand when people want to go out to buy medicines and food. But it makes no sense when they say they are bored and want to go for a drive.</p>
<p>Image caption Security guards are expected to carry on during the lockdown and help enforce it</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are educated and yet they don&rsquo;t understand. We are risking our own safety by being out - the least people can do is to just stay at home.&quot;.</p>
<p>India has shut down trains and flights. But pilots and railway staff have been doing their jobs until now.</p>
<p>National carrier Air India flew several rescue flights to evacuate Indians from Europe and Iran. But some crew believe their safety was sometimes compromised, staff from the airline told the BBC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before flights were suspended on all international routes, pilots and crew returning from foreign countries were only given four days rest before being asked to fly on a domestic route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was extremely risky for us and for the passengers. I just hope none of us picked up any infection during layovers in Europe and the US,&rdquo; one said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mind serving in the time of national crisis - all we asked was that the 14-day quarantine period should be followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the airline denied the allegations, saying it had &ldquo;followed all protocols&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Then there have disturbing allegations of discrimination by some members of the public against cabin crew and railway staff who are suspected of carrying infection.</p>
<p>One flight attendant said the neighbours &ldquo;refused to talk to my mother when I was away&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption People panicked after Narendra Modi said nobody should leave their homes, and did not mention the status of essential supplies</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even the neighbourhood grocers refused to give us the essentials,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Some Indian Railways staff had similar stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We interact with least 100-150 people every day but we were not given any protective gear or sanitisers,&rdquo; one employee, who did not wish to be identified, told the BBC. &ldquo;We kept working because so many passengers wanted to reach their villages before the lockdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now our neighbours suspect we may have picked up the coronavirus infection. All we need is unity and humanity to win this war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otherwise, we will lose and we can&rsquo;t afford that,&rdquo; she said.

Quarantined In India: No Soap, Dirty Toilets, Not Enough Coronavirus Tests</p>

<p>Not enough toilets – and the ones there are often dirty. Beds crammed together. The only way to shower is with water from a bucket that everyone has to share. No soap or hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>People who&rsquo;ve been quarantined in India for suspected exposure to coronavirus say conditions inside government facilities are unsanitary and unsafe — ripe to foment an outbreak rather than prevent one. Indians are posting photos and videos on social media of dirty sheets, broken toilets and trash littering crowded quarantine centers.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says the arc of the global pandemic may depend on what huge, densely-populated countries like India do next.</p>
<p>The second-most populous country behind China, India has reported more than 550 coronavirus cases and ten deaths, as of Wednesday night local time — in a population of 1.3 billion. That&rsquo;s a relatively low infection rate per capita. But the fear is that if the virus spreads through slums – where some 600 million Indians lack regular access to clean water – many millions could die.</p>
<p>toggle caption Raj K Raj/Hindustan Times via Getty Images</p>
<p>So in the early hours of Wednesday morning, India imposed the world&rsquo;s largest anti-coronavirus lockdown. For the next 21 days, no one across the country is allowed to leave their home except to go to buy food or medicine or to see a doctor. In a televised address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this is what&rsquo;s needed to &ldquo;save every Indian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>toggle caption Anupam Nath/AP</p>
<p>Most of the country&rsquo;s coronavirus cases are believed to be people who traveled abroad or had contact with someone who did. So in addition to the lockdown, the Indian government is also sending anyone it suspects of having the virus — particularly incoming travelers — into mandatory 14-day quarantine. The Health Ministry says there are some 60,000 beds for quarantine at facilities it&rsquo;s set up at university campuses and military barracks across the country.</p>
<p>But people inside say the conditions are dismal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are beds without anything to separate them. The men&rsquo;s bathroom is in pretty bad shape with no hot water. Sometimes there is no handwash [soap], and we&rsquo;ve run out of hand sanitizer,&rdquo; Aaliyah Khan, 28, told NPR by phone from inside one such facility set up on a college campus in Gurgaon, outside India&rsquo;s capital. &ldquo;In the showers, there is only one bucket, and we have to share it with other passengers. So it&rsquo;s not the best facility to avoid contamination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Khan was taken to the facility after landing Saturday at New Delhi&rsquo;s airport, with her husband. The couple was married March 6 in India and went on a honeymoon in the United States. As coronavirus spread, they cut short their trip and headed home.</p>
<p>On arrival in India, they found a chaotic scene in the airport: serpentine queues to get through immigration and airport security, passengers heckling and jostling to get ahead in the line, and no social distancing. The couple say they waited nearly 24 hours — after a 14-hour flight from New York — to leave the airport.</p>
<p>Officials screening incoming passengers asked Khan and her husband, Behzad Fatmi, how they were feeling. They admitted to having headaches and sore throats — but said it was likely from their long flight and the ordeal at the airport. To their surprise, officials cleared Fatmi to go home but said Khan would have to go into a government quarantine facility for 14 days.</p>
<p>Neither husband or wife has been tested for the virus. The Indian government is grappling with a shortage of testing kits. Amid criticism about the low number of Indians being tested, it recently asked private companies to start manufacturing kits. But supplies remain low.</p>
<p>Fatmi says he tried to explain to Indian officials that he had been with his wife the entire time and their risk of exposure to coronavirus was likely identical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been together! We traveled to New York and Los Angeles — so many places. So if she has something — god forbid — then I also have it. So please also take me to the quarantine facility,'&rdquo; Fatmi, 28, recalls. &ldquo;But they said, &lsquo;No, we will not do that.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>toggle caption Rupak De Chowdhuri/Reuters</p>
<p>Upon reaching the college campus, Khan says passengers were taken into a co-ed dormitory with rows of 30 to 40 beds arranged about three feet apart. There are no curtains or screens for privacy, she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a Muslim, I&rsquo;m not supposed to be in such a place,&rdquo; Khan says. &ldquo;We are all in one hall, old and young, male and female.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She says she and her fellow female &ldquo;inmates,&rdquo; as she calls them, have to share three toilets — which are often covered with excrement and littered with used sanitary napkins. On the first day, she says, they weren&rsquo;t given enough food and water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us are distressed, tired, sick of this situation,&rdquo; Khan says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so high-risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another tweet for the same. We are more than 40 people with only 3 washrooms and 5 large bed rooms. They want us to stay sanitised and this is what they give us. Guys this is a A MAJOR CONCERN. this way India cannot contain coronavirus only will get more cases. @PMOIndia @WHO pic.twitter.com/5q1wcr0xKX — Navya Dua (@NavyaDua) March 16, 2020</p>
<p>Such unsanitary conditions in quarantine facilities are &ldquo;totally unacceptable,&rdquo; Sujatha Rao, a former secretary with the Indian ministry of health and family welfare, told NPR in an email. This indicates that government officials at the lowest level, where quarantine is being carried out, do not sufficiently understand the importance of these measures, Rao says.</p>
<p>Despite police security, some Indians have been fleeing quarantine facilities. Unhygienic isolation units might also discourage people from reporting their symptoms, says Khan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are paying the price for being honest,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Authorities at Indian airports have been putting a stamp with indelible ink on the hands of passengers who&rsquo;ve been asked to home quarantine. The stamp reads &ldquo;proud to protect&rdquo; with the name of the city and the date until which the individual has been instructed to stay at home. Police have been checking up with phone calls and surprise visits on those asked to self-quarantine. In some states, authorities are using cellphone data and GPS for contact tracing. That has raised privacy concerns.</p>

<p>Khan says that after their initial distress, she and her fellow quarantine mates are slowly starting to accept the situation they&rsquo;re in. She&rsquo;s become close with an elderly woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman doesn&rsquo;t have a phone, so her daughters call me and I hand my phone to her,&rdquo; Khan explains.</p>
<p>They exchange stories about their families, as they live in limbo, awaiting a coronavirus test.
