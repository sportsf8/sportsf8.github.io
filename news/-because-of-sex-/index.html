<p>The Supreme Court currently has a reliable five-member conservative majority on many issues — like business regulation, campaign finance, voting rights and the death penalty. On several of these issues, the court has issued sweeping decisions that throw out earlier precedents.</p>
<p>On other issues, however, the court does not lean so far to the right. The list includes immigration, antitrust and the census, all subjects on which at least one conservative justice has joined the court’s liberal members to issue liberal or moderate rulings.</p>
<p>After Justice Anthony Kennedy retired in 2018, it wasn’t clear which category L.G.B.T.Q. rights would fall into. Kennedy had written landmark opinions on gay rights, including the 2015 legalization of same-sex marriage. And when Brett Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy in 2018, many civil-rights advocates were anxious.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s big Supreme Court decision — holding that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protected gay and transgender workers from workplace discrimination — seems to answer the uncertainty: Even post-Kennedy, the court still leans left on L.G.B.T.Q. rights.

Webster says that the term bragging rights is “a good reason to talk with pride about something you have done.”</p>
<p>As a young boy onward it seemed that life on the farm was based always on competing for that defined right. It didn’t matter if it was who was the strongest to who could skip a flat stone across a space of water and causing the most skips. If you did the most you then had the right to brag if so desired. I feel safe in saying this went on from daylight until dusk.</p>
<p>I feel it was due to a farmer’s life mostly. Most all a farmer does is manual labor of some sort and of a skill most always was needed to move the job along quicker. From weeding tobacco beds to tossing bales of hay. The jobs were greatly needed but let’s face it the jobs took up a lot of hours. Hours that became boring and mundane in nature. That was unless the task was turned into a competition in some way or form. For example look at setting tobacco. You set on the transplanter with a bunch of plants to go into the ground. All the person really had to do was take a plant put it in the finger that put it into the ground then grab another plant. Over and over until the day ended or the patch was completely set. Think about it. Boring! But if a person counted how many plants went through their hands in a minute, well the one who put the most plants in the ground was the fastest. Wouldn’t the two on the setter come out even? Not if you get in too big of a hurry and missed your turn. This could and did go on all day and the best got to boast.</p>
<p>This could be for a group such as a hay crew to see how many bales of hay they could move from the field into the hay mow. When talking to other guys from other crews the numbers were matched and a winner would be declared in most cases. Sometimes convincing the other person you were faster didn’t happen and it stayed a tie. From the start of the day on we would match each other as to how much, how long, or how fast.</p>
<p>This would also spill over to a farmer and his crops or produce from their gardens. How many bushel to the acre of corn, or pounds of tobacco per acre. I have seen huge tomatoes on the front porch at a farmer’s house or a very large potato so any visitor could see the monster you had grown in your garden. It also allowed anyone who thought they could out do it to bring it on. For at least until the next growing season the top producer had earned the right to tell of his ability to outgrow all others. Not all would brag but I have seen quite a few that if someone brought up how well you had done they would just smile real big and nod their heads to confirm it.</p>
<p>But of all the contests for the bragging rights around here it was who could cut tobacco the fastest. Cutting tobacco was a talent that not all could excel at. It seemed in each neighborhood there would be one or two that could and would put the stalks of tobacco on the sticks so quickly and accurately and show little or no effort that they earned a lot of praise from all the rest.</p>
<p>I feel I have cut with some of these men in the same patch. I didn’t say I was cutting beside them. I want to name some I have witnessed but am afraid I would miss someone.</p>
<p>The story I will relay is of a man before my time and can only tell what I was told. In I think the 40’s there was a young man named Mel Ott from around Felicity that they said was the fastest. One day a retired man said I don’t believe you to be the fastest and I am betting you 50 dollars that you can’t drop your own sticks and cut 1,000 sticks of tobacco in an eight hour day. Mel said I will take your bet but I’m being paid by the stick, so no matter what the outcome I still want to be paid what I earn by the stick. The man said it’s a bet. So the next day many folks other than the other cutters and the man who bet showed up and watched Mel. He didn’t cut 1,000 sticks but instead he cut over 1,250 sticks approximately as I’ve been told. Now a thousand sticks in a day is the measuring stick for a very good cutter and what Mel did was a land mark for a new standard. I believe this to be true as the bet was carried out on my dad’s farm and he is the one who told me this. Dad wasn’t a man to bet but he loved a great contest. He said besides, he got more tobacco cut that day than he had all fall. From that time forward Mel Ott held the bragging rights if he wanted to brag but I never heard him boast. However if ask he would smile and nod his head yes.</p>
<p>For a million bragging rights and to make a day move faster and with some added interest it served their purpose then and I assume they still do. I have tried many times to win at a challenge of the best and can say sometimes I did. Also it is safe to say many times I didn’t but almost every time I enjoyed the chance to take on the challenge. When it came to lifting I could win most times. I could even lift the front end of a Volkswagen and carry it in a half circle and never lost that challenge. But remember that strength doesn’t take the need for talent or skills. Just big muscles to lift. But it helped the day pass a little easier and made it more interesting.</p>

TUESDAY PUZZLE — The constructor Lee Taylor made her New York Times debut with a Sunday puzzle in 2015, and after two Sundays and a Monday puzzle, she is back with a Tuesday grid that asks more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>16A. I had BRAVO before BOOYA, but the crossings saved me.</p>
<p>19A. In Japan, maybe. It’s considered polite to SLURP one’s soup in some Asian cultures as a sign that the meal is being enjoyed. In the United States, it would be considered a social faux pas.</p>
<p>46A. When I was a surly teenager, my mother offered to take me to the record shop (Hi, kids! Ask your grandparents) to buy a new album (like an MP3, but tangible, flat and adorned with really cool artwork). Unbeknown to her — I left this part out when I told her I was going to hang out there — the neighborhood record shop was also a HEAD SHOP, and it sold the kind of paraphernalia in the clue: things to help you partake of drugs, things to wear to show your support for drugs, you name it.</p>
<p>I tried to keep my mother on the side of the store where music was sold, but at one point, I became absorbed in the Led Zeppelin section. Eventually, I heard her call me over to the glass counter where they were displaying marijuana pipes of all shapes and sizes. “Look at these lovely bubble pipes!” she exclaimed, loudly enough for all to hear. “I should buy one for your baby sister.” The guy behind the counter did his best to suppress a snicker.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — It’s so fun when someone roars into the crossworld out of nowhere with an inspired puzzle like this! According to Will Shortz’s print introduction, Royce Ferguson is an American living in London, who got the idea for this puzzle while in Switzerland, “a nation known for its 47-Acrosses.” Mr. Ferguson notes that he solves both his weekend puzzles on paper on Saturday because of the International New York Times publishing schedule, so he’s a binger and a paper solver.</p>
<p>I definitely think seeing this grid on paper gives a solver a leg up, but this was a tenacious challenge for me, anyway, one of those delightful Sundays where I get the theme early, feel smug for a minute, then creep away repeatedly to cogitate. If you’re still working on it, don’t skip down to the constructor notes, but also don’t miss them because Mr. Ferguson provides some back story and a detail that would be very easy to miss and makes the construction all the more impressive.</p>
<p>Today’s Theme</p>
<p>Unless you’re solving in Across Lite (in which case you’ve got a notepad telling you to imagine what I’m about to point out), you can see eight “ells” in the grid today, each being three squares bent 90 degrees to make a corner, emphasized by similarly right-angled directional arrows pointing up, down and to the right (none going left, thank goodness). Each of these arrows connects two entries — one horizontal/across and one vertical/down, as that 90-degree angle would suggest — using the same three-letter string of letters. For each pair of entries that are connected, one is clued straightforwardly, and answerable on its own. The other entry is a perfectly good word, in each case, but in order to actually answer the clue that it goes with you need to connect it to the stand-alone entry, using the three-letter string.</p>
<p>In addition, the three letters that you are to use, which are the same for all eight theme entries, make a common little word (that wonderfully clarifies the puzzle’s concept). That word is itself an entry, parked right in the center of the puzzle at 58D. And, there is a two-part revealer at 47- and 86-Across that makes things even clearer and brighter (although I’m fine to confess that this was one of the very last entries I got in this grid!).

<h3 id="the-price-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic">&ldquo;The Price of the Coronavirus Pandemic&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e8fd9f55749570008a1b2c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/200420_r36238.jpg" alt="img">
The investor who calls himself the Australian headed out for a walk on his farm in the Alps of New South Wales, three hundred miles south of Sydney. This was a morning in late March. He’d been holed up there for a month with his wife and three kids, plus two portable oxygen units and a store of hydroxychloroquine. “But my intention is not to get it,” he said, of COVID-19. “I don’t plan to see anyone until October.” He was talking on a cell phone. You could hear the caw of crows in the background, and the luffing of the wind. “I only see four other people in the valley. If I need to kill them, I will.” One assumed, from the way he laughed, that this was a joke.</p>
<p>The Australian, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used, is a voluble redhead just shy of fifty. “Billions dude looks like me,” he wrote, in a WhatsApp message accompanied by a pair of photos. He did indeed resemble Damian Lewis, the actor who plays a hedge-fund magnate in the Showtime series “Billions.” “He stole my look.” Reared in Sydney, the Australian moved to New York in 1994, when he turned twenty-two, to trade commodities at Goldman Sachs. At JPMorgan, he and a couple of his countrymen—known as the Aussie mafia—earned the firm hundreds of millions in profits during the early months of the financial crisis, in 2008. In 2015, he moved to Singapore. Proximity to China, a bearish disposition, and an interest in the history of virulent diseases led him to pay special attention to the effects that recent outbreaks had had on financial markets. SARS, H1N1, Ebola. Last October, he listened to an audiobook by the Hardcore History podcaster, Dan Carlin, called “The End Is Always Near.” “So I had pandemics and plagues in my head,” the Australian said. “In December, I started seeing the first articles about this wet-market thing going on in China, and then in early January there was a lot on Twitter about the shit in Wuhan.” He was in Switzerland on a ski holiday with his family, and he bought all the surgical masks and gloves he could find. On the flight back to Australia, he and his wife wore some, to the bewilderment of other passengers.</p>
<p>He quickly put some money to work. He bought a big stake in Alpha Pro Tech, one of the few North American manufacturers of N95 surgical masks, with the expectation that when the virus made it across the Pacific the company would get government contracts to produce more. The stock was trading at about three dollars and fifty cents a share, and so, for cents on the dollar, he bought options to purchase the shares at a future date for ten dollars: he was betting that it would go up much more than that. By the end of February, the stock was trading at twenty-five dollars a share. He shorted oil and, as a proxy for oil, the Canadian dollar. (That is, he bet against both.) Finally, he shorted U.S. equities.</p>
<p>“You don’t know anyone who has made as much money out of this as I have,” he said over the phone. No argument here. He wouldn’t specify an amount, but reckoned that he was up almost two thousand per cent on the year.</p>
<p>Emboldened by vindication, the Australian, walking through the countryside, laid out his prognosis for the United States and the world. America needed to “rip off the Band-Aid,” he said. The federal government should close the borders, shut off all international commerce, declare martial law, deploy the military to build field hospitals and isolation wards, and arrest or even fire on anyone who didn’t abide by a stay-in-place protocol. (“In 1918, in San Francisco, a cop shot someone in broad daylight for being outside without a face mask, and the cop was celebrated for it!”) Or perhaps the government should reward each citizen who strictly observed the quarantine with fifty thousand dollars. “The virus would burn out after four weeks,” he said. The U.S. had all the food and water and fuel it would need to survive months, if not years, of total isolation from the world. “If you don’t trade with China, they’re screwed,” he said. “You’d win this war. Let the rest of the world burn.” The problem, he said, was that, perhaps more now than ever, Americans lack what he called “social cohesion,” and thus the collective will, to commit to such a path. “Plus, you have guns. Lots of guns. And all the base materials for your drugs, like ninety-seven per cent, come from China.” He predicted that any less stringent measures—the slow removal of the Band-Aid that we are experiencing now—would result in social unrest bordering on civil war, and the decimation of our medical ranks. “So suddenly everyone who’s seen ‘House’ would be a doctor,” he said. Politically, the Australian considered himself well right of center, yet he thought it ridiculous that the United States doesn’t have nationalized health care. He predicted the cancellation of the Presidential election, or Donald Trump’s resignation, or the creation of an emergency leadership council, to which, throughout the conversation, he nominated Generals Mattis and Petraeus, Bill Gates, and Gary Cohn, for whom the Australian had worked at Goldman Sachs. “You could have either four weeks of pain and a future boom or years of this rolling bullshit and a depression. But people are just selfish. They’re not thinking. They’re morons.”</p>
<p>It was one such moron, an old friend of mine, who had introduced me to the Australian. They’d overlapped at Goldman Sachs. I’d been eavesdropping for a week on the friend’s WhatsApp conversation with dozens of his acquaintances and colleagues (he called them the Fokkers, for an acronym involving his name), all of them men, most of them expensively educated financial professionals, some of them very rich, a few with connections in high places. The general disposition of the participants, with exceptions, was the opposite of the Australian’s. Between memes, they expressed the belief, with a conviction that occasionally tipped into stridency or mockery, that the media, the modellers, and the markets were overreacting to the threat of the coronavirus—that it was little more than another flu, and that effectively shutting down the economy to prevent, or at least slow, the spread of the virus would turn out to be far more harmful, in the long run, than the virus itself. “The biggest own goal in memory,” one Fokker wrote.</p>
<p>“Suicide due to innumeracy,” another noted.</p>
<p>They constituted a sample of the-cure-is-worse-than-the-disease segment of the population, and, on the day of my conversation with the Australian, President Trump appeared to be steering hard their way. Defying the dire prognostications and pleadings of the medical establishment, Trump threw out there that businesses would soon reopen and that economic activity might kick in again by Easter. (Oh, well.) In the next few days, it was perhaps this prospect, as well as the unprecedentedly large two-trillion-dollar stimulus package passed in the Senate, that caused the stock market to rally, after one of the most precipitate collapses in its history. (As a general rule, despite the assertions of the financial media, it is difficult to say with any certainty which relevant facts or sentiments may make the market indices go up or down on any given day.) On March 26th, when the Labor Department reported that a record 3.3 million Americans had filed jobless claims the previous week—as if every man, woman, and child in Philadelphia and Phoenix suddenly joined the breadline—both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S. &amp; P. 500 shot up more than six per cent. The crosswinds were fierce.

Burglars often leave some evidence at the scene after pulling off a successful heist. But one burglar, who broke into a grocery shop in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu’s Cuddalore district only to come upon an empty cash chest, left behind a handwritten note with a lesson on risk and reward for the shop owner.</p>
<p>According to the police, the burglar gained entry into the shop in the Mandarakuppam locality by removing the tiles on the roof of the premises on Thursday. He then proceeded to look for the cash chest, but to his dismay, found that it was empty.</p>
<p>Frustrated by the experience, he ransacked the shop and wrote a note in Tamil on a piece of paper that he took from the shop. In it, he asked the owner, “Is it justified on your part to keep the cash chest empty when I had come to steal risking my life?” He went on to add : “To express my disappointment I have performed this ‘monkey’ act [the ransacking].”</p>
<p>The elderly shop owner Jayaraj discovered the attempted burglary, the ransacking, and the note, when he came to the shop in the morning.</p>
<p>He was amused by the note on the cash chest, but lost no time in filing a complaint with the Mandarakuppam Police.</p>
<p>The incident left the police baffled as thieves, if they leave behind clues, do so unwittingly.</p>
<p>Handwritten clue</p>
<p>“This is the first time we have come across such a case in our jurisdiction,” said a police officer in Cuddalore, referring to the burglar’s handwritten note on the cash chest.</p>
<p>The handwriting could eventually help the police conclusively prove the involvement of the culprit as and when he is traced.</p>
<p>In the past, there have been instances in Tamil Nadu of burglars, after breaking into homes, having cooked a meal or watching television, dozing off, and then leaving without any hurry at the break of dawn.
