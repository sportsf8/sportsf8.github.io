Gov. Tom Wolf, in what seemed like an effort to change a dialogue with businesses that has been mostly about forced closures in recent days, announced the availability Wednesday of $60 million in state zero- or low-interest loans for firms with 100 or fewer employees to help them recover from economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic and the state’s resulting restrictions on commerce.</p>
<p>Wolf said the new COVID-19 Working Capital Assistance Program, is a down payment on his pledge to do what he can from Harrisburg to help those businesses recover.</p>
<p>“I vowed to save Pennsylvanians’ lives, and then save their livelihoods,” Wolf said.</p>
<p>Under the new program being run through the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority, loans of up to $100,000 per qualifying firm would be available to provide working capital to any business who applies through a certified economic development agency.</p>
<p>The money could be used, based on common definitions of working capital, to cover cash-flow needs for bills owed, wages or taxes due. It can not, according to the program guidelines, be used for physical renovations or investment in new machinery or equipment.</p>
<p>There are no job retention or creation requirements.</p>
<p>“So far, much of the burden of responsibility (for stopping the spread of coronavirus) has been borne by business owners,” Wolf said at a mid-day press conference. “We’ve had to close bars, restaurants and stores because the virus quickly and easily spreads in crowds. The employees of these businesses have lost their income, and many business owners are wondering if they’re going to be able to survive.”</p>
<p>Loan amounts would be pegged to shortfalls from COVID-19 impacts, including forced closures. Applicants will also have to document how they plan to use the loan proceeds to finance business operations.</p>
<p>The federal government may be on the cusp of offering a more lucrative assistance program in its economic rescue program.</p>
<p>One component of that $2 trillion plan is federally guaranteed loans for small businesses that pledge not to lay off their workers. The loans would be made available during an emergency period ending June 30, and would be forgiven if the employer continued to pay workers for the duration of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Business owners will have to mine the details of both programs as they become available to see which is the best fit.</p>
<p>Wolf called the state program a step in the right direction, and then folded it into a renewed call for all Pennsylvanians to heed his administration’s constant admonitions to stay home as much as possible to stop the spread of the highly contagious virus.</p>
<p>“It’s going to help provide a little peace of mind to hundreds of small business owners and their employees, but I’m not going to pretend that it’s enough to cover the devastation that COVID19 is bringing to our Commonwealth, so I will continue to develop ways to assist Pennsylvania’s business community as well as our workforce,” Wolf said.</p>
<p>“But I also need every Pennsylvanian to step up and do their part. The best way we can preserve our economic future is by minimizing the spread of COVID 19 right now.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania now has confirmed 1,127 cases of the coronavirus, with 276 new cases reported, the state Department of Health said earlier Wednesday. The virus has now been found in 44 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties. The new figures also mark the largest one-day increase to date.</p>
<p>There have been 11 deaths.</p>
<p>Wolf earlier Wednesday expanded standing stay-at-home orders to Lehigh and Northampton counties Wednesday. Ten counties in total with a combined population of more than 6 million - about half the state’s total - are now under stay-at-home orders, including the Philadelphia region and the Pittsburgh area. The order also includes Monroe and Erie counties.</p>
<p>Wolf has drawn heavy fire in recent days - but also praise in some quarters - for his call last week for all “non-life sustaining businesses” to close across the state. Wolf gave police agencies the authority to begin enforcing the order as of 8 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>Closures that have already occurred led to a single-week record last week in new filings for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Business owners interested in the new program should contact the state Department of Community and Economic Development or their local Certified Economic Development Organizations for application information.

<h3 id="mexican-wolf-numbers-in-the-southwest-growing-but-have-a-long-way-to-go">Mexican Wolf Numbers In The Southwest Growing, But Have A Long Way To Go</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/sites/default/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/npt.png" alt="img">
Mexican wolf numbers have increased, but there&rsquo;s a long way to go to get them off the endangered species list/USFWS</p>
<p>The Mexican wolf population in the Southwest rose by nearly 25 percent in 2019, bringing the wild population to 163 individuals in Arizona and New Mexico, including some in the general vicinity of Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.</p>
<p>Smaller cousins of North American gray wolves, Mexican wolves long have been endangered. The predators historically ranged &ldquo;throughout mountainous regions from central Mexico, through southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and southwestern Texas,&rdquo; according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. &ldquo;More recent information obtained from examining historical wolf specimens however, suggests that Mexican wolves may have roamed farther north. The Mexican wolf was common throughout its core range through the mid-1800s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within that range fall Saguaro National Park, Big Bend National Park, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and Gila Cliff Dwellings, while Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is thought to be on the fringe of the range. The Mexican wolf is said to prefer mountain woodlands, such as those found in the Rincon District of Saguaro and the high country of Big Bend and Guadalupe Mountains national parks.</p>
<p>Gila Cliff Dwellings in New Mexico is surrounding by the mountainous and heavily forested Gila National Forest, and lies within the rugged Gila Wilderness, the nation&rsquo;s first wilderness area.</p>
<p>According to the 2019 survey conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the 163 wolves were divided into 42 packs of two or more animals.</p>
<p>Mexican wolves are roaming the Gila National Forest Near Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument in New Mexico. The red star marks the approximate location of the national monument. The hexigons mark were wolves were spotted in early March 2020.</p>
<p>“While it is encouraging to see an increase in wolves, there is still work to be done to establish a self-sustaining Mexican gray wolf population,&rdquo; said Bryan Bird, Southwest program director for Defenders of Wildlife. &ldquo;Recovery efforts face challenges including limited genetic diversity and high rates of illegal killing, but ensuring that wolves and people can coexist is an essential part of long-term success. The Mexican gray wolf is an integral part of Southwestern ecosystems and we must do everything we can to ensure the species is given the protections they need to survive.”</p>
<p>According to Defenders, the Mexican gray wolf is one of the most endangered mammals in North America, with a single population occupying the Blue Range of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. This population is beset by numerous threats, including widespread illegal killing as well as inbreeding caused by inadequate releases of more genetically diverse wolves from a captive population, the conservation group said.</p>
<p>The best available science indicates that recovery of the Mexican gray wolf requires at least three connected populations totaling approximately 750 individuals, a carefully managed reintroduction effort that prioritizes improving the genetic health of the animals and the establishment of at least two additional population centers in the Southern Rockies and in the Grand Canyon regions, said Defenders.

<p>Laugh it off: Tammy Hembrow couldn&rsquo;t control her laughter during a workout on Thursday, when she was interrupted by her four-year-old son, Wolf</p>

<p>Tammy flaunted her toned figure in a white activewear crop top and grey shorts.</p>
<p>Her home workout comes after the Australian government advised residents to only leave the house when necessary amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I just got screamed at all the time. I literally used to cry after work,&rsquo; Tammy said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Speaking of her fast food job, she said: &lsquo;Grill&rsquo;d was pretty bad as well, making burgers, but I got free burgers out of that and they were delicious.&rsquo;
