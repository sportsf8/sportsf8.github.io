<h3 id="as-mlb-agreement-draws-closer-heres-what-it-could-look-like">&ldquo;As MLB agreement draws closer, here&rsquo;s what it could look like&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://content.sny.tv/assets/images/1/5/2/313456152/cuts/750x422/cut.jpg" alt="img">
Andy Martino, SNY.tv | Twitter |</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with where we expect this negotiation to end: Major League Baseball and the Players Association will reach an agreement to play roughly 70-80 games, and players will accept a small percentage pay cut.</p>
<p>Additionally, the league will offer further financial incentives like removing the qualifying offer and the competitive balance tax this winter, in order to help kick-start free agency during an offseason of financial hardship. The union will offer deferred salaries.</p>
<p>The final agreement won&rsquo;t look exactly like that, of course. But the qualifying offer and CBT are two options for compromise, according to people briefed on talks.</p>
<p>For weeks, the sides have dug in on whether they in fact agreed to the pro-rata structure in March. It became clear in recent days that the union was firm on that stance. Commissioner Rob Manfred and the owners could plan to bridge a significant gap in negotiations by returning to pro-rata salaries as a starting point for upcoming talks.</p>
<p>MLB&rsquo;s likely proposal of roughly 50 games will not fly with players, who proposed 114 games. A middle ground on games, a small percentage pay cut, and other concessions on both sides should lead to some baseball in July.

With most major cities in the United States protesting police brutality and racial injustice in recent days after the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, Mets first baseman Pete Alonso spoke about the situation on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the past couple of days, I&rsquo;ve struggled to wrap my mind around what&rsquo;s happening,&rdquo; Alonso wrote on Instagram. &ldquo;I have a voice and I will not remain silent. My heart has been broken over the murder of George Floyd. I will never know what it feels like to be discriminated against because (of) the color of my skin. To anyone who faces this type of discrimination, I will fight for you and be an ally. I will always stand with you. There needs to be justice and change made for the better of humanity. Let words be our sword and unity be our armor. Take care of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Floyd died following his arrest in Minnesota after police officer Derek Chauvin &ndash; who was later arrested and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter &ndash; had his knee on a prone Floyd&rsquo;s neck for roughly nine minutes while Floyd repeatedly said &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After protests began in and around Minneapolis following the death of Floyd, other protests have taken place in New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit, and elsewhere.

<h3 id="terry-collins-revisits-decision-to-leave-matt-harvey-in-game-5-of-world-series">&ldquo;Terry Collins revisits decision to leave Matt Harvey in Game 5 of World Series&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://content.sny.tv/assets/images/1/1/6/159812116/cuts/USATSI_8892078_s5p96btg_wtqx7kv1.jpg" alt="img">
Regardless of what many said after the fact, pretty much everyone watching Game 5 of the 2015 World Series wanted Matt Harvey to come back out for the ninth inning with the Mets leading, 2-0.</p>
<p>From the fans at Citi Field to the fans at home to the media in the press box, the belief was that Harvey should be given a chance to finish what he started.</p>
<p>When Harvey came running back to the mound after talking Terry Collins out of replacing him, the crowd roared. But things fell apart from there.</p>
<p>Collins, speaking Tuesday on Baseball Night in New York: Living Room Edition, recalled his thought process that night and what he feels now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid for them to stand up and stick up for themselves,&rdquo; Collins said about Harvey&rsquo;s plea to stay in for the ninth inning. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;you know what, go out and finish this thing.&rsquo; Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look back on it and I thought afterwards that even though it might have cost us a chance to continue moving on in the World Series, I still think today it was the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his appearance on BNNY, Collins also talked about his decision to let Johan Santana stay in to complete his no-hitter, which you can watch above.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — I am so glad that we are all in Cruciverbala, where the presence of a Big Red Button is an indication of a major sight gag and there are no geopolitical implications. I assume that we are all looking at said red button, which I am told is present in electronic versions. If you are solving online, Will Shortz’s print introduction is helpful. To quote him, quoting today’s constructor, Natan Last: “I wrote a computer program to help me find words that [ ] once you [ ].”</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>18A: This is a debut clue for a rarely-used entry (that had previously been defined as “paired” or “double”). I am dubious that this guy is a household name. I habitually listen to his music when I do household chores (something Pavlovian I cannot explain involving beats dropping while I fold clothes), so I figured out DIPLO fast, but when I looked up some videos where he actually appeared on camera, I realized I was mixing him up with Skrillex. There were plenty of names in this puzzle but the crosses were kind, I think. TAMORA Pierce and Hermione GRANGER might have been the other toughies, and some were just fun, like EBERT.</p>
<p>40A: This element wangles its way into the puzzle every once in a while — point for everyone who knew it from the actual clue and not from some vague chemistry recollection. This is a stalwart transitional metal known for its stabilizing properties, despite its crazy name, YTTRIUM. It was named after the town in Sweden where it was originally discovered.</p>
<p>50A: If you did not know your YTTRIUM facts and asked your iPhone, this answer might have just presented itself. My personal SIRI, at least, did not know her element 39 even though it is a part of her physical host.
