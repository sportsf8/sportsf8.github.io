<p>Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) will be one of more than three dozen lawmakers who cast historic votes Wednesday by proxy voting, officially designating different House members to cast colleagues’ votes on their behalf.</p>
<p>Most of those lawmakers, expected to be Democrats, are using the new proxy rule because the coronavirus pandemic has made them fearful of traveling from afar to Washington, a pandemic hot spot, or because traveling from their remote home to the Capitol has become very difficult because airlines have cut back on flight options.</p>
<p>Not DeSaulnier.</p>
<p>His use of the new rule comes from having just overcome a life-or-death battle with pneumonia that began after the 68-year-old veteran marathoner fell while running on the Mall. DeSaulnier broke some ribs and hurt his spleen, but his age and a weakened immune system from battles with cancer and pneumonia made his situation perilous.</p>
<p>He spent five weeks in an intensive care unit, including four on a ventilator, and at one point was given a 10 percent chance of survival as he battled some covid-19-like symptoms that have led to nearly 100,000 deaths in the United States. He wasn’t suffering from the virus, but it was just as devastating, and one morning his family expected to get the worst call possible.</p>
<p>“The next day, my sons, expecting a phone call from the hospital saying I had passed away in the night, instead get a phone call that I was a little bit better,” DeSaulnier said on Facebook, which was then reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. “Every day I got better. There were lots of challenges, (but) eventually my eyes opened.”</p>
<p>This week marks his first one back at work, taking up work on committee assignments — all of which will be done over video conferencing, also part of the new rules change.</p>
<p>Under the proxy rules, DeSaulnier is one of at least 15 Californians who will vote through another lawmaker. As of Tuesday afternoon, 39 Democrats had submitted letters to congressional officials explaining their absence and who will vote on their behalf. DeSaulnier will direct Rep. Doris O. Matsui (D-Calif.) how he would vote on legislation this week, and she will cast that vote on his behalf.</p>
<p>“I am so grateful every day for every breath, every day,” he said.

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/ERElENMWAAAjRF0.jpeg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=960&amp;h=540&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
A LUCKY punter has won €1 million in the Lotto Plus 1 draw tonight - but there were no winners of the €3.6million top prize.</p>
<p>In the main lottery, the numbers pulled were 7, 14, 20, 23, 27, 46 and the bonus was 25.</p>
<p>1 The numbers have been drawn in tonight&rsquo;s Irish Lotto as a jackpot worth nearly €3.6 million was up for grabs Credit: @NationalLottery</p>
<p>In the Lotto Plus One, where €1 million is the top prize on offer, tonight’s numbers were 10, 14, 19, 21, 37, 38 and the bonus was 1.</p>
<p>And in the Lotto Plus 2, where €250,000 could be won, the numbers drawn were 18, 20, 24, 31, 34, 39 and the bonus was 11.</p>
<p>One lucky punter managed to scoop €1 million prize in the Lotto Plus 1 draw.</p>
<p>The Irish National Lottery took to Twitter to congratulate the winner.</p>
<p>They said in a Tweet: &ldquo;We have a winner!!! Congratulations to an online player who has won the €1 MILLION top prize on tonight’s Lotto Plus 1 draw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although no one won the main Lotto jackpot, in total, over 73,000 players won prizes.</p>
<p>EUR A WINNER</p>
<p>A winning EuroMillions ticket worth €500,000 was sold in a Meath shop, Lotto bosses have revealed.</p>
<p>The lucky slip was purchased at Day Today News in the Johnstown Shopping Centre in Navan.</p>
<p>Padraig Lonergan, who co-owns the Day Today News with Philip Keegan, said: “It’s the first time we have sold a major National Lottery prize winning ticket in our 15 years of business so we can’t wait to spread the news to our customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of our trade is from the local area and more so since the current health restrictions, so I’d guess it is a Navan local.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However I’ve no idea who it could be but whoever the winner is, I hope the €500,000 brings them a lot of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The winning EuroMillions Plus numbers for last night’s draw were: 03, 08, 09, 19 and 49.</p>
<p>NEW MILLIONAIRE</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ireland&rsquo;s newest millionaire will have to wait to claim their fortune as the Covid-19 pandemic continues.</p>
<p>The Kerry winner of a mega €9.7 million made contact with Lotto bosses last week.</p>
<p>The player won big on the Saturday night draw after buying their golden ticket at Daly’s Supervalu store in Killarney, Co Kerry.</p>
<p>The €9,772,175 million prize is Kerry’s largest ever Lotto jackpot win.</p>
<p>A National Lottery spokesperson said: &ldquo;We can confirm that we have been contacted this afternoon by the lucky ticketholder and arrangements are currently being made for the claim to be made once restrictions are lifted due to the on-going public health emergency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lotto players in Dublin are being asked to check their National Lottery accounts and emails as two different players from the capital won the Lotto Plus 2 top prize of €250,000 and the Lotto Match 5 + Bonus prize of €37,258 in last Wednesday’s draw.</p>
<p>A National Lottery spokesperson advised that the winners will have already been notified by email.</p>
<p>They said: &ldquo;These two lucky winners from last night’s Lotto draw have already been alerted that they have won their respective prizes of €250,000 and €37,258 and what a nice email to receive!</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we are appealing to all of our online players who live in Dublin to check their emails to see if they are the lucky winners.&rdquo;

LEXINGTON, Ky. — For nearly four decades, John Calipari has seemed like a willing villain, a smug and slicked-back agitator of the college basketball establishment. The guy who in his mid-20s as an assistant at Kansas and Pittsburgh became such a recruiting nuisance to veteran coaches that almost unbelievable stories began to emerge. Did he really tell a prospect that St. John’s coach Lou Carnesecca was dying of cancer? Calipari and several other key figures in that tall tale have called it complete fiction, but when you get slapped with a bad-guy label that early in your career, it can be tough to shake.</p>
<p>Calipari didn’t even try. As a 29-year old head coach at lowly Massachusetts in the late ’80s, desperate for attention, he immediately picked fights with the kings of New England basketball: Boston College coach Jim O’Brien and Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun. Then he burrowed so deep under John Chaney’s skin that the legendary Temple coach&hellip;

<p>Irish football fans have taken aim at a Twitter account which claimed Fabio Cannavaro put in the &lsquo;greatest defensive performance of all time&rsquo; against Germany at the 2006 World Cup.</p>
<p>The former Juventus and Real Madrid star helped the Azzurri keep a clean sheet as they ran out 2-0 winners at the semi-final stage.</p>
<p>An unofficial World Cup account tweeted: &ldquo;Fabio Cannavaro against Germany - 2006 World Cup. The greatest defensive performance of all time on the biggest stage in world football. 5ft9 and still dominated players in aerial duels like it&rsquo;s nothing. Beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But many people disagreed, saying Paul McGrath&rsquo;s performance against Italy 12 years earlier was better.</p>
<p>One person commented: &ldquo;Not a patch on Paul McGrath v Italy 94. Give over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another said: &ldquo;Paul McGrath versus Italy, USA 94 was the greatest defensive display.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Someone else responded: &ldquo;Have you not seen Paul McGrath vs Italy in 94 World Cup!!!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One other fan said: &ldquo;Paul McGrath vs Italy USA 94. He had the whole Italian team in his back pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the response to the post that it caused Paul McGrath to trend on Twitter in Ireland for a time.
