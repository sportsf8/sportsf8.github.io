<p>‘Here Comes the Sun’, the iconic song most synonymous with guitarist George Harrison, featured on The Beatles 1969 album Abbey Road and is remembered as one of the band’s biggest hits.</p>
<p>Harrison, who wrote the song in early 1969 while staying at the country house of his friend Eric Clapton, was enduring a difficult period of his life when he created the track having recently quit The Beatles and had been arrested for marijuana possession.</p>
<p>“‘Here Comes the Sun’ was written at the time when Apple was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen: ‘Sign this’ and ‘sign that’,” Harrison later wrote in his autobiography. “Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever, by the time spring comes you really deserve it. So one day I decided I was going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton’s house.”</p>
<p>He added: “The relief of not having to go see all those dopey accountants was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric’s acoustic guitars and wrote ‘Here Comes the Sun’.”</p>
<p>It was during that same period of isolation at Clapton’s house that Harrison had a profound effect on the musician, inspiring to be laid back in his approach to songwriting. Speaking about the creation of ‘Here Comes the Sun’ as part of Martin Scorsese’s documentary George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Clapton explained that he, personally, would never contemplate taking his guitar outside to write music “this is what George brought to the situation”.</p>
<p>Clapton added: “He was just a magical guy and he would show up, get out of the car with his guitar and come in and start playing… I just watched this thing come to life. I felt very proud that it was my garden that was inspiring it.”</p>
<p>With lyrics touching on the themes of relief having taken respite around the somewhat depressing administrative aspects of Beatles life, Harrison headed off to Sardinia in June of that year to complete the words for the song. Here, we explore some of the handwritten, original lyrics he penned during that time.

PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – We start the day with few clouds, mostly sunny and temperatures in the mid to upper 50s. Temperatures in the valley will be near average (80°) today and Saturday. That would make it our first 80° day for this month of July. Remember May and June when we had a few 90s sprinkled in there? Nothing like that showing up in the 7-day forecast. On average, PDX has been running ~3.5° below normal.</p>
<p>The weekend continues with mostly sunny skies and temps in the upper 70s to 80 Saturday. For Saturday afternoon/evening gusty winds and low relative humidity leads to a Fire Weather Watch for south-central Oregon. Read details about this Watch here.</p>
<p>Sunday morning an ever so slight chance for a light sprinkle that won’t amount to more than a trace, then it’s partly cloudy for the day.</p>

Yup, it’s the annual whinge about what heat does to most of us, this time livened up by a headline that includes two Beatles’ song titles. (Yes, I did have to scroll through their discography to find the deeply submerged second — a George Harrison number off “Yellow Submarine!”)</p>
<p>Presume anyone with MS who lives in a hot climate has to bathe in air-conditioned surroundings to survive. Ironically, that adds to the atmosphere’s heat, but let’s not get bogged (also disappearing) down in present-day physical geography!</p>
<p>Even living in London, I’ve had to accept that there will increasingly be days that knock me out.</p>
<p>So when the weatherperson joyously imparted that the next day was going to be hotter than the Caribbean (32 degrees Celsius, or 89.6 degrees Fahrenheit), I thought, as ever, that I’d get through it. Phew, no wonder! It was only now, when I converted it into old money (we went decimal in 1971 and lost shillings), that I realized how hot it truly was!</p>
<p>Actually, I survived that day. It was the next day when all the surrounding ground and house had soaked up all that radiation and dumped it into my wilting body. It was a tad unfair to be treating a vegan like a summer turkey on a slow roast!</p>
<p>I sat in a huddle with fans turned up to 11 to little effect. I should have taken the advice of the equally annual newspaper column that recommends freezing large bottles of water and sticking them in front of the fans. It’s bound to happen again this summer. Note to self: This time, be ready.</p>
<p>Make sure there are a couple of 2-liter lemonade bottles (just drink some first so that there is no bursting) and a bottle of Pimm’s handy. With the correct timing I could have a lovely summer cocktail! There may be no Wimbledon but we must struggle on regardless. After all, I am British!</p>
<p>Thinking about it, there must be a surfeit of cheap strawberries on the market. That is, if the British are willing to pick ’em!</p>
<p>I was in such a state that I had to pull a “sickie” (see below for meaning) from this august organ. I’m one of the MS Forum moderators on this site and that was certainly beyond me!</p>
<p>For all you non-U.K. readers, a “sickie” is something you make up to get off work and go have a good time. A hot summer’s day is a prime example. Though obviously not for someone with MS.</p>
<p>My idea of a good time would be to hang out in a butcher’s fridge. Now that I’m a vegan I’ve rather been hung by my own petard (which is a bomb, by the way). Anyway, if the butcher found out he’d tell me to sling my (butcher’s) hook!</p>

<h3 id="the-moment-dhani-harrison-and-george-martin-discover-lost-solo-on-the-beatles-here-comes-the-sun">&ldquo;The moment Dhani Harrison and George Martin discover lost solo on The Beatles ‘Here Comes The Sun’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/George-Harrison-Let-It-Be.jpg?fit=927%2C560&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
When The Beatles disbanded 50 years ago in 1970, there was an almost instantaneous collation of their work. The world was well aware of the influence they had possessed during their time together and the notion that any item they had touched, smelled or even come close to was now a financially valuable was gathering pace.</p>
<p>Given the demand, it makes it all the more extraordinary that anything could have ever gone noticed. However, in the below footage George Harrison’s son, Dhani, alongside famed Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles, discover one of the guitarist’s lost solos on The Beatles’ classic ‘Here Comes The Sun’.</p>
<p>There isn’t much we don’t know about The Beatles. The most famous band in the whole world have had their history pawed over countless times and it appears no stone was left unturned. But, somewhat recently, as part of Martin Scorsese’s 2011 documentary George Harrison: Living In The Material World, we had a reminder that we should never stop looking.</p>
<p>In what arrived as a bonus extra scene on the DVD release of the documentary, a section which captured Harrison’s son and an expert guitarist himself, sees Dhani attending a studio session with George and Giles Martin. During the session, the trio are playing around with George Harrison’s most famous Beatles song ‘Here Comes The Sun’.</p>
<p>The track was composed as a moment of light relief from the intensity of the Fab Four’s working as George and his friend, Eric Clapton, mosied around the latter’s garden and causally strummed out one of the greatest songs of all time. “‘Here Comes The Sun’ was written at the time when Apple was getting like school, where we had to go and be businessmen: ‘Sign this’ and ‘Sign that’,” remembered Harrison in The Beatles Anthology.</p>
<p>“Anyway, it seems as if winter in England goes on forever; by the time spring comes you really deserve it,” he added. “So one day I decided I was going to sag off Apple and I went over to Eric Clapton’s house. The relief of not having to go and see all those dopey accountants was wonderful, and I walked around the garden with one of Eric’s acoustic guitars and wrote ‘Here Comes The Sun’.”</p>
<p>Largely regarded as one of Harrison’s finest works, the guitarist, it would seem, did make one concession on the song’s composition and that was the ditching of his “lost” solo. As you can see in the footage below, the solo was a surprise to all involved and seems a genuine moment of discovery.</p>
<p>The trio fiddle around in the studio, raising Harrison’s voice to the fore, then the illustrious backing band and then suddenly, a bolt from the blue, as Harrison’s undoubted tonal guitar sound comes roaring out of the speakers. “It’s totally different to anything I’ve ever heard,” remarks Dhani.</p>
<p>It may only be a short clip but the value in watching Dhani and George Martin seemingly discovering a piece of work from their father and friend respectively is truly a joy to behold.

Borussia Dortmund announced their latest signing on Monday morning, but eagle-eyed social media users may have spotted a few hints in the days beforehand.</p>
<p>The Bundesliga club welcomed Englishman Jude Bellingham, 17, with a player-covered rendition of the Beatles’ Hey Jude in a deal reported to be worth more than £20million to Birmingham.</p>
<p>The post received tens of thousands of likes on Twitter, but it wasn’t the first time the club had alluded to Bellingham’s arrival.</p>
<p>On July 17 the club’s English-speaking Twitter account shared a picture of defender Dan-Axel Zagadou with the caption “Yesterday”.</p>
<p>That same day a Marco Reus quote was shared with the caption “A day in the life”.</p>

<p>And on Saturday a picture was posted of the sun over Signal Iduna Park, the club’s home ground, along with the caption “Here comes the sun”.</p>

<p>All three refer to songs from the Beatles’ heyday, and while the cunning clues went over the heads of many fans, not all were deceived.</p>
<p>“I see what you’re doing… I know another classic by the beatles” one fan replied.
