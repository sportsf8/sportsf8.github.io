To the unfamiliar, Roblox may look like a Minecraft clone crossed with Lego, but the truth is there’s a lot more to it than that.

For one, Roblox actually launched in 2006, three years before Minecraft’s first public test version and five years before its full release. The game is immensely popular with younger players and offers in-game creation features that eclipse even the creative building aspects of Minecraft. While it may not have quite the cultural impact as Minecraft, Roblox also boasts around as many players as Minecraft, or even more by some counts.

How many active players are in Roblox?

Roblox’s developer, the Roblox Corporation, has regularly released updated player counts for the past few years, and the numbers show that active players have grown rapidly since around 2016. One important factor in that growth is likely the Xbox One. Roblox came to Microsoft’s platform in late 2015, introducing the game to a whole new audience. In late 2016, 10 years after Roblox’s launch, Roblox Corporation announced that the game had 30 million monthly active users.

By March 2018, that number grew to 50 million users, continuing to expand to 70 million monthly players by September of the same year. In April 2019, Roblox had 90 million active players, and just a few months later, in August 2019, Roblox Corporation announced that Roblox had hit a landmark of 100 million monthly active players.

At that point, Roblox players outnumbered Minecraft players. Most recently, an announcement of new investors in Roblox revealed that the game has surpassed 115 million monthly active users as of February 2020. For comparison, the latest available player count for Minecraft came back in September 2019, showing 112 monthly players. Of course, both games have far more registered users than that, but those numbers reflect how many people actually play the game regularly.

What exactly is Roblox?

The easiest point of comparison for new Roblox players may be Minecraft, but the two games actually have some very important differences. While both are open-world creation games, Roblox has a much more robust toolkit that gives users more freedom to shape the world.

Roblox players can actually use in-game tools to create their own new game modes. It’s seen by many users with an interest in game development as a way of learning the necessary skills, particularly among the child and teen audience that makes up most of its players.

The game has a robust marketplace where players can share or sell assets that they create in-game. Roblox CEO David Baszucki describes the game as “a safe and civil place where people come together to create, learn, and have fun.”
