<p>Convicted sex offender and millionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein is at the center of Netflix&rsquo;s Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich. The documentary, which focuses on Epstein&rsquo;s life, death, and crimes, features some of the victims of his sex trafficking, allowing them to tell their side on what happened many years ago. It also introduces some of the other people in Epstein&rsquo;s life who have been tied to his crimes, and one of them is his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell paraded around at parties with Epstein for years before breaking ties with him and then fully pulling away from the public eye in recent years. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about the late Epstein&rsquo;s close friend.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Epstein Life and Crimes Timeline More</p>
<p>Who Is Ghislaine Maxwell?</p>
<p>Maxwell is a British socialite and daughter of media tycoon Robert Maxwell. She moved to the US after her famous father died in 1991 and met Epstein around the same time. They reportedly dated for a few years, but later became just being friends. In fact, in a 2003 Vanity Fair profile on Epstein, Maxwell is referred to as Epstein&rsquo;s best friend, and according to the story, &ldquo;He tells people that when a relationship is over the girlfriend &lsquo;moves up, not down, to friendship status.&rdquo; It was Maxwell, according to CNN, who introduced Epstein to many high-profile people in his social circle.</p>
<p>Was Ghislaine Maxwell Involved in Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s Crimes?</p>
<p>Several of Epstein&rsquo;s accusers have also accused Maxwell of being involved. One accuser, Virginia Giuffre, claimed that Maxwell acted as a madame to coordinate sexual relations with Prince Andrew and Epstein. Giuffre reported that in 2001, she had sex - while underage - with Prince Andrew at Maxwell&rsquo;s residence in London, a claim that Maxwell has denied.</p>
<p>CNN reported that more of Epstein&rsquo;s accusers have said Maxwell took part in the sexual abuse by facilitating the encounters over the years. Some said that she was the one who found the underage victims involved in Epstein&rsquo;s sex-trafficking ring and connected them with high-profile people in Epstein&rsquo;s circle.</p>
<p>Was Ghislaine Maxwell Prosecuted For Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s Crimes?</p>
<p>Though accusers have brought allegations against Maxwell in connection to Epstein, she has not yet faced charges. After distancing herself from Epstein about a decade ago, she largely fell out of the public eye. ABC News reported earlier this year that her accusers were struggling to bring charges against her because she couldn&rsquo;t be tracked down. However, according to the story, &ldquo;Maxwell, represented by attorneys from a Colorado law firm, is currently contesting the disclosure of previously sealed documents in a now-settled defamation lawsuit brought against her in federal court in New York by Giuffre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell finally resurfaced in March to bring her own charges against Epstein&rsquo;s estate, alleging that he &ldquo;had promised to pay her legal fees for any claims from the dozens of women who say she helped him recruit them to give him massages when they were teenagers,&rdquo; according to The New York Times. In her lawsuit, Maxwell claims she has incurred legal fees for being incorrectly tied to Epstein&rsquo;s sex-trafficking ring. She maintains she was not involved in any way, but it&rsquo;s unclear if her accusers will be able to bring their own charges against her now.</p>
<p>Where Is Ghislaine Maxwell Now?</p>
<p>Maxwell has fallen almost completely off the grid over the past few years. She began distancing herself from Epstein around 2008, when he served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution. She stopped going to social functions completely a few years later, and until early this year, when she showed up to file the lawsuit against Epstein&rsquo;s estate, she had almost completely disappeared.

Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich uncovers the stories of survivors who were allegedly abused and sex trafficked by financier Jeffrey Epstein and his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. The Netflix docuseries also features the testimony of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein to high-profile men, including Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz.</p>
<p>In a recent tweet, Guiffre called out supermodel Naomi Campbell, claiming she was Maxwell’s “BFF,” and that she saw her with Epstein on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre reveals her story in ‘Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich’</p>
<p>Netflix’s documentary series, Filthy Rich, examines the numerous cases of alleged sexual abuse Jeffrey Epstein got away with for decades. Through four episodes, survivors tell their stories of their encounters with Epstein, and how he targeted them as vulnerable minors.</p>
<p>On the docuseries, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, now 36, details how Epstein’s supposed girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell found her working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort when she was 16. She says that Maxwell saw her reading a book about massage therapy and offered her a job as Epstein’s traveling masseuse.</p>
<p>Soon after Giuffre arrived at Epstein’s West Palm Beach home, she says Maxwell and Epstein sexually abused her. She says the couple used her insecurities and vulnerabilities to groom her. And she claims they manipulated her into being trafficked by them for years.</p>

<p>She is at the center of the Prince Andrew Scandal</p>
<p>In Filthy Rich, Giuffre claims that she flew to London with Maxwell and Epstein in 2001 when she was 17. She says that at Maxwell’s townhouse, she was introduced to Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>After a night of partying, Giuffre says they returned to Maxwell’s home. After Epstein snapped a photo of her with Prince Andrew, she says Maxwell demanded she provide sexual favors for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VRSVirginia/status/1262512899626393600">https://twitter.com/VRSVirginia/status/1262512899626393600</a></p>
<p>“Ghislaine tells me, ‘You’re going to have to do for him what you do for Jeffrey,'” Giuffre says in Episode 4 of the Netflix doc. “Right after that photo was taken, I was sexually abused by Prince Andrew for the first time.”</p>
<p>Maxwell has denied any involvement in Epstein’s alleged misconduct. And Prince Andrew continues to deny any wrongdoing and has said he doesn’t remember ever meeting Giuffre.</p>
<p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre claims Naomi Campbell was good friends with Campbell</p>
<p>On Twitter, Giuffre has been vocal about pointing out those she feels are connected to Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring. She specifically called out former supermodel Naomi Campbell, alleging she must have known what was happening because of her close friendship with Maxwell.</p>
<p>“She was Maxwell’s BFF,” Giuffre wrote in a tweet along with a picture of her, Maxwell, and Campbell. “There is no way in hell that she didn’t know what was happening in front of her own eyes. They were all aware of Epstein &amp; Maxwell’s op- didn’t go at any length to hide it either. That’s me @ 17- sad.”</p>
<p>In another tweet, Giuffre claimed she encountered Campbell on multiple occasions. “You saw me at your parties, you saw me in Epstein’s homes, you saw me on the plane, you saw me get my haircut, you saw me on the streets, you watched me be abused,” Giuffre tweeted next to a series of pictures with Campbell and Prince Andrew. “You saw me!”</p>
<p>You saw me at your parties, you saw me in Epstein’s homes, you saw me on the plane, you saw me get my haircut, you saw me on the streets, you watched me be abused. You saw me! #Awareness #Justice #GhislaineMaxwell #JeffreyEpstein #NaomiCampbell #PrinceAndrew pic.twitter.com/5TNWvG1eAA — Virginia Giuffre (@VRSVirginia) January 16, 2020</p>
<p>However, Campbell denies knowing about any of Epstein’s alleged abuse. In an August 2019 video on her Youtube page, the model says Epstein was just one of the “hundreds of thousands of people” that she’s taken a picture with.</p>
<p>“What he’s done is indefensible,” Campbell says in the video. “When I heard what he had done, it sickened me to my stomach, just like everybody else, because I’ve had my fair share of sexual predators, and thank God I had good people around who protected me from this. Right now, I stand with the victims. They’re scarred for life.”

A new Netflix docu-series explores the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Jeffrey was a convicted sex offender who died in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges.</p>
<p>Jeffrey was never married, though he had many relationships over the years.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein is a convicted sex offender and New York-financier who died in jail awaiting sex trafficking charges, and his alleged crimes are the focus of a new Netflix docu-series Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich. Told primarily through the first-person perspective of his many accusers, the docu-series will undoubtedly instill outrage in anyone who watches, and bring up even more questions about Jeffrey&rsquo;s mysterious personal and professional dealings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure,&rdquo; one of Jeffrey&rsquo;s associates told New York Magazine in 2002. &ldquo;He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness. The whole thing is weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also surrounded himself with beautiful, young women. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known Jeff for fifteen years,&rdquo; Donald Trump told New York Magazine in 2002. &ldquo;Terrific guy. He&rsquo;s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the years, Jeffrey had many girlfriends, but ultimately never married. Here&rsquo;s what to know about his romantic relationships.</p>
<p>Jeffrey was open to marriage.</p>
<p>Sources revealed Jeffrey said in 2014 that if he ever married, it would be to Celina Dubin, who was 19 years old at the time, according to New York Post. However, Celina and Jeffrey weren&rsquo;t actually dating or in a romantic relationship. She was also the daughter of Jeffrey&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend Eva Andersson Dubin. Jeffrey and Dubin dated for 11 years starting in 1980, according to The Daily Mail.</p>

<p>Jeffrey never married, but one ex-girlfriend remained by his side for decades.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell was the daughter of Robert Maxwell, a British media mogul. She moved to New York City in 1991 and dated Jeffrey in the early &rsquo;90s. They maintained a mysterious relationship afterward.</p>
<p>Over the years, she helped manage his multiple homes and coordinate his social relationships, the New York Times reported. “Ghislaine floated in and out of the house with the keys, and even though Jeffrey told me they didn’t have a sexual relationship, she’d drop under her breath that she was sleeping in his bed from time to time,” one of Jeffrey&rsquo;s ex-girlfriends told Vanity Fair.</p>

<p>“Ghislaine was in love with Jeffrey the way she was in love with her father,&rdquo; another source told the publication. She always thought if she just did one more thing for him, to please him, he would marry her.”</p>

<p>Jeffrey reportedly preferred baby-faced blondes.</p>
<p>He kept a photo of Morgan Fairchild, a 1980s soap opera actress, in his Upper East Side home, according to Vanity Fair. She was reportedly his ideal type.</p>
<p>“There were women who were not underage, but usually in their younger 20s, who became part of what we’re calling Epstein’s sex-trafficking orbit—they’d either be trafficked or lent out, describe it as you will, to other people,” David Boies, attorney for some of Jeffrey’s accusers, told the publication. “Then there were young professional women of comparable age whom Epstein sort of dated, and then he might or might not recommend them to other people.”</p>
<p>And, he often had multiple girlfriends.</p>
<p>Jeffrey&rsquo;s ex-girlfriends revealed his polyamorous ways. &ldquo;It was a whole spiel about polyamory, and it made me really insecure—I wasn’t a girl who had high self-esteem or self-worth at that time,&rdquo; one of his ex-girlfriends told Vanity Fair. &ldquo;I didn’t think I could do an open relationship, and I also thought if I said I wouldn’t do it, he would still go out with me, but he didn’t.”</p>
<p>Jeffrey brought an unnamed guest to an event at The Statue Of Liberty at Liberty Island on September 7, 2005. Patrick McMullan Getty Images</p>
<p>But most of them prefer to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Many women who dated Jeffrey have kept their names secret, but they&rsquo;ve opened up to media about their relationships. “He was so insecure—he had that outer-borough thing of always needing a model on his arm,” one of his ex-girlfriends, a Sports Illustrated model, told Vanity Fair. “He was emotionally infantile, stunted, without an inner world.”</p>
<p>Jeffrey often appeared at events with companions identified as &ldquo;mystery woman&rdquo; or &ldquo;guest.&rdquo; &ldquo;He always wanted to give the impression that he was an international man of mystery—‘I control everyone and everything, I collect people, I own people, I can damage people,’” another ex-girlfriend told Vanity Fair.</p>

Prince Andrew has been urged to speak to US police, after Jeffrey Epstein’s former butler revealed allegations the Duke attended naked pool parties when staying with the disgraced billionaire.</p>
<p>Juan Alessi started working as Epstein’s butler in 1991, and was still employed by him when he was first arrested in 2006 on underage sex charges.</p>
<p>A confidentiality agreement kept him quiet – until now.</p>
<p>Mr Alessi said one of his tasks was setting up massage tables in the “House of Sin”, and claimed Andrew had daily massages during a stay at the Palm Beach property, in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>The former butler said he never saw the Prince “with girls”.</p>
<p>But he has strongly urged the Duke to co-operate with investigators.</p>
<p>“He should. Maybe he has something to hide. I don’t know. I don’t know what happened beyond that,” Mr Alessi told The Mirror.</p>
<p>Mr Alessi has also mentioned the Prince in sworn statements to the police in past investigations into his former boss.</p>
<p>In a statement made in 2005, he says Andrew spent weeks at the property, and stayed in the main guest room.</p>
<p>He said he met the prince twice, and that he was a “complete gentleman”.</p>
<p>“He was the only person who ever left my wife and I a tip when he left. It was ($140). It was so nice. Epstein did not allow anybody to tip us,” Mr Alessi, 70, said.</p>
<p>While Mr Alessi confirmed he set up massage tables for the royal, he said he never saw him having a massage – as such touching was all done behind closed doors.</p>
<p>“… everything was upstairs behind closed doors. I never saw him kissing anybody or patting anybody,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Alessi said he also never saw Prince Andrew taking part in any sexual activities, like the claims made by two women against him.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew has always denied these allegations.</p>
<p>While he said there were naked pool parties while Andrew was visiting, he insisted they put clothes on before entering the house.</p>
<p>“He was a nice guy. I never see him with girls. I never see him with Virginia. I never saw him naked or actually having the massage,” Mr Alessi said.</p>
<p>Epstein took his own life in prison in August while waiting trial on underage sex trafficking charges.</p>
<p>‘Do the right thing’</p>
<p>Mr Alessi said he was compelled to speak out – even after 10 years of silence – to end his own internal “nightmare”.</p>
<p>He said he once confronted Epstein, telling him: “Jeffrey, you have to take it easy on these girls. One of them is going to get you in trouble.”</p>
<p>“He just replied ‘They only want money’,” Mr Alessi said, and added how he used to have to withdraw wads of cash from the ATM, which Epstein would then give to the girls – on the proviso they stayed quiet.</p>
<p>Epstein’s then-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell used to drag Mr Alessi out of the house, and make him drive her around the city trawling for girls, the ex-butler claimed.</p>
<p>“Whole days she spent recruiting girls. I was driving. I wish I had known what for. I would stop at a massage parlour,” he recalled.</p>
<p>“She would go in, take business cards. One time she had me drive to Donald Trump’s home Mar-a-Lago looking for girls, and that is when she found Virginia (Giuffre).”</p>
<p>Last week, another former staffer said he saw the Prince in a pool – not at the Florida property but on Epstein’s private island – “grinding” against Ms Giuffre, who has claimed she was ordered to have sex with Prince Andrew after being trafficked to the UK by Epstein.</p>
<p>“I hope Prince Andrew, as a father himself, does the right thing too,” Mr Alessi said.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew has denied any relationship or sexual contact with Ms Giuffre, saying he never met her.</p>
<p>He has reportedly refused to comply with FBI investigations into Epstein.</p>
<p>The Duke stepped down from royal duties in November, following a TV interview about his friendship with Epstein.</p>

<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2020-05-29-at-12-40-03-pm-1590770490.png?crop=0.982xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Filthy Rich is a four-part documentary series detailing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s purported crimes, from the perspective of his victims.</p>
<p>Epstein owned a private island, Little St. James, located in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about Little St. James, where Epstein was accused of sex trafficking.</p>
<p>In 1998, wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein purchased a 75-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands for $ 7.95 million, according to the New York Times. The island, called Little St. James, would become the site of some of his most notorious crimes—and Filthy Rich, a new documentary series on Netflix, catalogues many of them.</p>
<p>The four-part series, which quickly rose to the streaming service&rsquo;s Top 10 chart, features chilling testimony from numerous survivors of Epstein&rsquo;s sexual assault—many of whom endured a trip to Little St. James, along with Epstein and his ex-girlfriend (and alleged Madam) Ghislane Maxwell.</p>
<p>After he was arrested and charged with sex trafficking of girls and young women by federal prosecutors in July 2019, Epstein, 66, reportedly took his own life in his Manhattan jail cell the following month. Since his death, Epstein&rsquo;s island has become a tourist attraction for Caribbean travelers hoping to catch a glimpse of his lavish structures.</p>
<p>Though Epstein had properties in Florida, New York, New Mexico, and Paris, an entire episode of Filthy Rich is devoted to Epstein&rsquo;s activity on the island of Little St. James, located two miles off the coast of St. Thomas. &ldquo;Being on an island, by himself–I guess he could do whatever he wanted,&rdquo; Gordon Ackley, a St. Thomas resident, said in the documentary.</p>
<p>Locals had telling nicknames for Little Saint James: “Orgy Island,” “Pedophile Island,” and “Island of Sin.&rdquo; But, Epstein preferred to call his primary residence &ldquo;Little Saint Jeff,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s where he reigned. Returning to the scene of of the crime, Filthy Rich reveals the truth behind those nickname. Here&rsquo;s what we learned about Little St. James—and what we know of its future.</p>

<p>Little St. James is located in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Epstein&rsquo;s island is in the Caribbean Sea between St. Thomas and St. John, the two largest of the Virgin Islands. Little St. James is situated to the east of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Per the New York Times, Epstein accessed the approximately 75-acre island by flying into St. Thomas International Airport and chartering a helicopter. Little St. James is also accessible from St. Thomas by a 15-minute boat ride. While nearby, Little St. James is not visible from most vistas on St. Thomas, per a 2019 article in the L.A. Times.</p>
<p>He paid $7.95 million for the island, but its price has risen steeply since then.</p>
<p>In 1998, Epstein purchased Little St. James for $7.95 million. Unsealed court documents from 2019 estimate the island&rsquo;s value at $63,874,223.</p>
<p>The same court documents also confirm that Epstein was not really a billionaire. The total assets listed, including cash, investments, and real estate holdings, amounted to a (still sizable) $559,120,954.</p>
<p>Epstein spent millions developing the island.</p>
<p>The third episode of Filthy Rich exposes how significantly Epstein developed the island since its purchase. Luxury resort designer Edward Tuttle designed the colonnaded villa-style &ldquo;main house,&rdquo; where guests stayed while visiting Little St. James. Epstein&rsquo;s personal residence was a stone-walled cabana with a turquoise ceiling, per Filthy Rich—one of many cabanas.</p>
<p>Before he went to prison in 2008, Epstein began another round of renovations on Little St. James. A 2008 New York Times report detailed Epstein&rsquo;s architectural vision for the island: He was constructing a library to house 90,000 volumes, a Japanese bathhouse, and a movie theater.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s with the temple on Epstein&rsquo;s island?</p>
<p>Also on the island is a mysterious building with blue-and-white stripes and a gold domed ceiling, which fell off during a 2017 hurricane. The building, dubbed &ldquo;the temple,&rdquo; spurred many conspiracy theories, which are detailed in a Business Insider article.</p>

<p>But seriously, what&rsquo;s up with this weird temple thing on Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s private island? pic.twitter.com/njxfg2HahN — jon gabriel (@exjon) July 9, 2019</p>
<p>To understand the true purpose of the structure, the Business Insider reporter interviewed Patrick Baron, a piano tuner who had visited the two-floored building twice. Baron recalled seeing a black grand piano, bookshelves, a dark wood desk, and a portrait of Epstein or the Pope (he wasn&rsquo;t sure which). He classified the structure as a &ldquo;study&rdquo;—or even a lair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went in there knowing absolutely nothing about [Epstein], except that he was wealthy,&rdquo; Baron told Business Insider. &ldquo;And after doing the job and talking to some of my other clients on St. Thomas, and they filled me in on the scandal, my perception of that room changed from a study to a lair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Epstein regularly brought young women to the island, often underage.</p>
<p>While working on Little St. James as an IT contractor from 1999 to 2006, Steven Scully noted a pattern among Epstein&rsquo;s visitors: &ldquo;The guests always included young girls,&rdquo; he said in Filthy Rich. According to Scully, the young girls often socialized with other people on the island—&ldquo;important people&rdquo;—who were not Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Per The Guardian, a 2020 lawsuit filed by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands cites evidence of a computerized database of girls who visited the island, some as young as 11.</p>
<p>Featuring harrowing interviews, Filthy Rich exposes the terror and isolation many of these young women felt while on Little St. James. &ldquo;From the first day I was on the island, the abuse started,&rdquo; Sarah Ransome, who accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her, multiple times, said. &ldquo;I was trapped from the very first day.&rdquo; Ransome was so desperate to leave she attempted to swim shark-infested waters, the New York Post reported, but was thwarted by the island&rsquo;s intricate surveillance system, and had her passport confiscated, according to the Guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was trapped from the very first day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the documentary, Epstein&rsquo;s behavior was a well-kept secret. &ldquo;Jeffrey Epstein was a guy who concealed his deviance very well. But he didn&rsquo;t conceal it that well,&rdquo; Scully said.</p>
<p>On her first day, Ransome recalls landing at the airport in St. Thomas, and being greeted by people who treated Epstein like a &ldquo;celebrity.&rdquo; Looking back, she believes they were aware of what was occurring on the island. &ldquo;I think that they knew,&rdquo; Ransome said in the documentary.</p>
<p>“It was kind of accepted,” Sasha Bouis, who used to run a floating restaurant anchored near Great St. James, told the New York Times. “There was just this creepy old billionaire living out there.”</p>
<p>The island had a star-studded guest list that allegedly included Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew is among the individuals named in Filthy Rich as having visited Little St. James—as are President Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz, Epstein&rsquo;s lawyer. &ldquo;Not all the men took part. I have seen people that came for a lunch or a dinner, and didn&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the survivors, clarified in the documentary.</p>
<p>However, Scully had a distinct memory of seeing Prince Andrew with a guest in 2004. &ldquo;He was at the pool. He was with, at that time, an unknown girl—to me. She was young. She didn&rsquo;t have any top on. They were engaged in foreplay,&rdquo; Scully said.</p>

<p>Prince Andrew has denied having any inappropriate contact with young women associated with Epstein, again and again. However, in 2019, the Queen&rsquo;s son voluntarily stepped back from his royal duties after being linked to Epstein.</p>
<p>Now, Epstein&rsquo;s private island is a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>After Epstein died in 2019, curious tourists were compelled to get close glimpses of the island that had been his primary residence. “No one used to pay attention to it,” Jon Stewart, the owner of a charter boat company told The L.A. Times. Whereas now, “there’s a ton more tourists.”</p>
<p>One such tourist, speaking to Fox News in 2019, gave her perspective. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s effed up but I want to see where Satan lived,&rdquo; Soledad Simmons, visiting St. Thomas from Puerto Rico, said. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not the only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s effed up but I want to see where Satan lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another interview with Fox News, Stewart detailed the catamarans–carrying up to 80 passengers—that travel the coasts of Little St. James. Stewart said he had been taking tourists to the tiny island for years because of the excellent snorkeling opportunities.</p>
<p>Most tourists are limited to what they can spot from the boat. However, in 2019, Luke Rudkowski and Jeff Berwick trespassed onto the empty island and posted the video to their YouTube channel, We Are Change. “The most interesting things I found were these little satanic gargoyles with horns on their heads that were all over the property,” Rudkowski said, calling them “very creepy.”</p>

<p>Epstein bought another island in 2016.</p>
<p>In 2016, Epstein bought the island Great St. James for $17.5 million, per the New York Times. Per TODAY, Epstein was developing the island up until his arrest in 2019.</p>

<p>The U.S. Virgin Islands filed a lawsuit to seize Epstein&rsquo;s islands.</p>
<p>Little St. James and Great St. James may be Epstein&rsquo;s islands, no more. According to The Guardian, a lawsuit filed by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands in January of 2020 aims to seize both islands, and shut down Epstein&rsquo;s shell companies created in the region.</p>
<p>“Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Little Saint James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here,” Attorney General Denise George told the New York Times.</p>

<h3 id="the-trailer-for-netflixs-new-jeffrey-epstein-doc-doesnt-bode-well-for-ghislaine-maxwell">&ldquo;The Trailer for Netflix’s New Jeffrey Epstein Doc Doesn’t Bode Well for Ghislaine Maxwell&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn2.lamag.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/08/GettyImages-1154615743.jpg" alt="img">
’The monsters are still out there,’ one victim says</p>
<p>Netflix dropped the first trailer for its upcoming four-part documentary on deceased millionaire sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein on Wednesday, and judging by the footage, the filmmakers took a special interest in Epstein’s longtime associate and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>Throughout the preview of Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich, photos of Maxwell—who has not been seen in public since Epstein’s jailhouse suicide in August 2019—are shown as women are heard saying, “He’s dead, but he did not act alone,” “None of them have been held accountable,” and, “Take them down. Take everybody down.”</p>
<p>To that end, the documentary promises to explore the 2008 sex trafficking case for which Epstein served only 13 months in prison when he faced a life sentence after somehow scoring a secret plea agreement with prosecutors.</p>
<p>Also featured in the trailer are pictures of Epstein’s “Pedophile Island,” as well as photos of Epstein posing with the likes of Donald Trump and Alan Dershowitz as a woman says, “Start digging into his life, pulling out this spider web of people.”</p>
<p>Nine of Epstein’s accusers appear in the trailer. “There are enough survivors who refuse to give up,” one says.</p>
<p>“The monsters are still out there,” says another survivor. “You took our freedom, now we’re gonna take yours.”</p>
<p>Directed by Lisa Bryant and executive produced by Peter Landesman, Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich premieres May 27.</p>

<h3 id="court-agrees-to-delay-testimony-of-jeffrey-epstein-confidant-ghislaine-maxwell-in-civil-suit">&ldquo;Court agrees to delay testimony of Jeffrey Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell in civil suit&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/maxwell-epistein-gty-aa-200522_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg" alt="img">
Court agrees to delay testimony of Jeffrey Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell in civil suit Maxwell, 58, has not been seen in public in several months.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has been granted at least a temporary reprieve from having to respond to questions in a civil lawsuit that alleges she committed sexual battery against a teenage girl, a federal magistrate judge ruled on Friday.</p>
<p>Maxwell, who has been accused in several lawsuits of facilitating or participating in Epstein&rsquo;s abuse of girls and young women, sought the delay because of an ongoing federal criminal investigation into Epstein&rsquo;s alleged co-conspirators and because a victims&rsquo; compensation fund proposed by Epstein&rsquo;s estate is said to be nearing final approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m permitting her not to respond to [written questions] and not to have her deposition,&rdquo; Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman said in her ruling from the bench. &ldquo;Not forever, but at least long enough to let us know whether the claims process is likely to go forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman made her ruling in a lawsuit filed against Maxwell and Epstein&rsquo;s estate last November by Annie Farmer. Farmer alleges that she was recruited and groomed by Epstein and Maxwell in 1996, and that Maxwell sexually assaulted her at Epstein&rsquo;s New Mexico ranch when Farmer was 16.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie was extremely distressed and afraid. She was a child in a massive ranch in New Mexico, away from her family in Arizona, and isolated from any source of help. She was alone with Epstein and Maxwell,&rdquo; Farmer&rsquo;s complaint says.</p>
<p>An attorney for Farmer argued against the delay, noting the uncertainty surrounding the potential length of the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no indication of any time frame with respect to &hellip; how long that investigation could go on,&rdquo; said Sigrid McCawley, the attorney for Farmer and four other victims suing Epstein&rsquo;s estate. &ldquo;And to not be able to get discovery and ask Miss Maxwell questions &hellip; that puts us in handcuffs with respect to being able to establish our claims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Responding to those concerns, Freeman said she had &ldquo;no desire to have this drag out&rdquo; and asked to be updated in mid-June on the status of the investigation and the victims&rsquo; claims program.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 58, has not been seen in public in several months and her whereabouts are unknown. She has denied Farmer&rsquo;s claims and the allegations that she facilitated Epstein&rsquo;s alleged crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She absolutely denies that she participated in this or any other sexual abuse or trafficking or assault, and no court, judge or jury has ever determined that she has,&rdquo; wrote Maxwell&rsquo;s attorney Laura Menninger in a letter to the court this week.</p>
<p>Menninger also claimed that the litigation was taking a financial toll on Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike the estate, she is not a multi-millionaire and must self-fund her defense,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>In March, Maxwell filed her own lawsuit against the late financier&rsquo;s estate seeking reimbursement of her legal fees and personal security costs. She claims that Epstein had repeatedly made &ldquo;clear and unambiguous&rdquo; promises to always support her financially, according to her complaint.</p>
<p>Epstein died by suicide in jail last August, according to the New York City medical examiner, one month after his arrest on child sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Epstein pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>In court filings in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Farmer has indicated a willingness to take part in the voluntary claims program if it moves forward. Nearly 70 other alleged victims have also expressed an interest in participating in the program, which could resolve dozens of claims against the estate without litigation.</p>

<p>But the program&rsquo;s approval has been held up for months after Denise George, the attorney general for the Virgin Islands, filed criminal liens against Epstein&rsquo;s estate, effectively freezing all the assets of the $634 million estate worldwide. George has objected to some terms of the restitution plan, which she argued did not comply with the laws of the Virgin Islands or fully protect the rights of Epstein&rsquo;s victims.</p>
<p>In the court hearing Friday &ndash; which was conducted by telephone due to the COVID-19 pandemic &ndash; estate attorney Bennett Moskowitz said that the major issues have been resolved with the attorney general, and that he expects the program to be approved within a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a few less contentious matters to iron out. But it is our firm expectation that by sometime next week, that resolution in principle will be formalized,&rdquo; Moskowitz said.</p>
<p>In a statement to ABC News Friday, George concurred that the parties are &ldquo;near agreement upon the terms of the fund,&rdquo; which she said would be &ldquo;a substantial improvement&rdquo; from the original proposal from the estate. She said she remains opposed, however, to the estate&rsquo;s requirement that victims &ldquo;sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them.&rdquo; The estate has recently amended the release in an effort to address the attorney general&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the interest of allowing the program to move forward, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has been working further with estate counsel and the victims&rsquo; attorneys on an agreement in principle, which is still being drafted,&rdquo; George said in the statement.</p>
<p>During the court hearing on Friday, Moskowitz also contended that some of the victims&rsquo; attorneys were unnecessarily driving up the costs of litigation by demanding the estate search for and turn over documents that aren&rsquo;t relevant to their cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every dollar we&rsquo;re spending in the meantime is money that will never be available for that program,&rdquo; Moskowitz said.</p>

<p>McCawley had contended in court filings earlier this month that the estate had failed to produce even a single document in response to their discovery requests, and she had sought court intervention to require the estate to search for documents covering the entire time frame of Epstein&rsquo;s alleged abuse of young women and girls. The victims are seeking photographs, video and audio recordings from Epstein&rsquo;s airplanes and homes, financial records and communications with his alleged co-conspirators, employees and government officials that span a period of nearly two decades.</p>
<p>In court Friday, McCawley acknowledged that the estate had begun to produce some documents this week relating to her clients, but argued that other relevant evidence was improperly being withheld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our position is that, with respect to our client&rsquo;s claims in each of the cases, information relating to Epstein&rsquo;s abuse of other victims is highly relevant,&rdquo; McCawley said. &ldquo;The pattern of how he lured girls and then abused them is relevant to our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attorneys for the estate have countered that the victims&rsquo; demands are disproportionate to the needs of the cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everything related to any allegedly bad thing Mr. Epstein ever did is relevant in each action, well, then it could take me six months or a year to finish looking for every piece of paper at every property Mr. Epstein owned,&rdquo; Moskowitz said Friday.
