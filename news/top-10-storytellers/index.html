<p>Beginning today, Netflix users who search the name “George Floyd” on the streaming service will be served up a collection of shows and movies centered on racial injustice. But subscribers won’t need the search function to find that content: Netflix is promoting the collection, titled Black Lives Matter, to all of its users in the U.S. with a pop-up recommendation urging viewers to browse the titles.</p>
<p>The collection takes its name from the same movement and rallying cry at the center of ongoing international protests against police brutality and racial injustice. The curated list of programming highlights nonfiction and fiction shows and movies about Black experiences. Some of the titles in Netflix’s Black Lives Matter collection include the documentary 13th and miniseries When They See Us, both award-winning projects from director Ava DuVernay, along with movies like Moonlight and Mudbound, and series including Marvel’s Luke Cage.</p>
<p>In all, Netflix has selected more than 40 titles in an effort to amplify Black storytellers and highlight its bench of TV shows and movies reflecting Black experiences. The effort comes a time when national interest in racial injustice has spiked due to the wave of worldwide protests against police violence and racism—and Netflix isn’t the only streamer looking to surface Black stories for its users.</p>
<p>“We believe that one of the ways Netflix can have a direct positive impact is through our stories,” a Netflix spokesperson said. “The Black Lives Matter collection speaks to racial injustice and the Black experience in America, and we hope that highlighting these titles can help increase empathy and understanding.”</p>
<p>Netflix will recommend its Black Lives Matter collection to those searching Floyd’s name in response to recent search trends on Netflix and on Google Trends, the spokesperson said. Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man killed by police in May when an officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, has spurred a movement for police accountability and justice for Black Americans killed at the hands of law enforcement.</p>
<p>In addition to Floyd’s name, viewers who search for the names of other victims of police and racist violence, including Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and Tony McDade, will also be directed to Netflix’s Black Lives Matter collection. Arbery was a 25-year-old African American man gunned down by white residents while he was jogging in Georgia in February. Taylor was a 26-year-old African American woman shot and killed by police in March. McDade was a 38-year-old African American trans man who was shot and killed by police in May.</p>
<p>At Netflix, the rollout of the collection has been a long time in the making, part of larger category called Black Stories, which reflects a broader array of themes, tones and stories, a spokesperson told Adweek. The streaming service aimed to get the Black Lives Matter collection ready in advance of the upcoming Netflix original film Da 5 Bloods, a war drama from director and producer Spike Lee slated for a June 12 release.</p>
<p>The company made some adjustments in response to recent events and a new interest among some viewers in watching programming reflecting Black experiences. Notably, the Black Lives Matter collection does not include The Help, a 2011 drama that takes place during the Civil Rights Movement that made it to the top of Netflix’s Top 10 list over the weekend despite criticism the film has faced for its depiction of Black experiences.</p>
<p>Actress Bryce Dallas Howard, who appeared in the film, urged her fans not to view it in a recent Instagram post and to instead watch other films and series. “The Help is a fictional story told through the perspective of a white character and was created by predominantly white storytellers,” she wrote. “We can all go further.”

<h3 id="meet-10-storytellersand-one-teamtaking-a-fresh-approach-to-content">&ldquo;Meet 10 Storytellers—and One Team—Taking a Fresh Approach to Content&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/C100-media-page-2020-600x315.jpg" alt="img">
Let’s face it: There’s a lot of great content out there. So much to hear, watch and read. If you’re in media, how do you make your content stand out? These 11 innovators are showing how.</p>
<p>Dave Jorgenson</p>
<p>TikTok creator and video producer, The Washington Post</p>
<p>What he does: Jorgenson’s role is nestled among the worlds of journalism, promotion and cheerleading. He shows readers and TikTok users “what makes The Post great” through viral videos that mix an accessible Dad-jokes sense of humor and newsroom visuals with popular TikTok trends, challenges and sounds. He thinks of himself as the paper’s “tour guide.”</p>
<p>Numbers guy: Jorgenson’s got half a million followers on TikTok, and his videos have garnered 23 million likes. So while he may not be breaking news on the popular platform, he’s serving the paper’s mission to build a new, much younger audience.</p>
<p>Silver-lining playbook: At a time of great turmoil, Jorgenson is nevertheless determined to highlight moments of happiness and levity. “I’m very aware of my naïveté in wanting to find the positive in people and things,” he says, “and I’m intentionally clasping to that, despite the world’s best efforts.” —Scott Nover</p>
<p>David Haskell</p>
<p>editor in chief, New York</p>
<p>A year to remember: Haskell has only been at the helm of New York magazine for a year, and it “corresponded with an astonishing, unprecedented flood of news: impeachment, [Jeffrey] Epstein, a presidential primary, a pandemic, an economic collapse.” On top of that, the magazine, which includes verticals The Cut, Grub Street and Vulture, was bought by Vox Media in September. “You learn to surf the wave,” says Haskell. “I have been enormously impressed and proud to see how resilient and flexible our magazine can be.”</p>
<p>The long of it: “Long-form journalism is, for New York magazine, one of the hallmarks of our journalism and one of the biggest reasons our readers love us,” Haskell says. “I’d be publishing lots of it in any environment, because it is the building block of the magazine I know I want to make. But fortunately, it also makes a strong business case for itself, as our digital subscription business becomes an increasingly important business line for the company.”</p>
<p>Feat of clay: Haskell also owns a whiskey distillery and dabbles in ceramics. “They are both creative projects, one collaborative and the other solitary, one more commercial and one more artistic,” he says. “Editing a magazine is all of those things, and sometimes it helps to unlock a problem or brainstorm a project if I’m chatting with the distillery staff or I’ve got clay in my hand.” —S.N.</p>
<p>Bon Appétit Test Kitchen Team</p>
<p>Condé Nast</p>
<p>EDITOR’S NOTE: Since Adweek interviewed the Bon Appétit team, including editor in chief Adam Rapoport, and published this story, the Condé Nast-owned magazine has been at the center of a controversy involving allegations of unfair practices by Rapoport—who was also shown to be wearing brownface in a 16-year-old photo. Rapoport resigned from his position on June 8.</p>
<p>Kitchen confidential: Working from home during the pandemic, the Test Kitchen Team is out of its natural environment—the culinary Shangri-La at Condé Nast HQ stocked with seemingly limitless ingredients, supplies and kitchenware. But they’re maintaining a certain taste level nonetheless. “We plan more, shop less and, ultimately, cook better meals,” says Adam Rapoport, editor in chief of Bon Appétit. “We are far more resourceful and creative than we were three months ago.”</p>
<p>Finding inspiration: “I am not creative when I’m happy, so these bleak times have actually caused me to turn it up a level,” says assistant food editor Sohla El-Waylly. “My advice to anyone who’s struggling is just get started on something. Once my hands start moving, my brain usually catches up and we end up there together.”

<h3 id="we-are-one-a-global-film-festival-reaches-over-1m-viewers">&ldquo;‘We Are One: A Global Film Festival’ Reaches over 1M Viewers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://theslanted.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Akiko-Ooku-Tremble-All-You-Want.jpg" alt="img">
Tribeca Enterprises and YouTube wrapped the first-ever We Are One: A Global Film Festival this past weekend. The 10-day digital film festival featured select filmmakers and storytellers and promoted films that have the power to create change. The celebration reached an estimated 1.6M unique visitors during the duration of the festival, which ran from May 29th through June 7th, with the top 10 country views coming from Japan, India, US, UK, Germany, France, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and Australia.</p>
<p>From a poll taken on the YouTube community tab, 77% of respondents reported they had never been to a film festival in real life, and this event gave everyone a chance to see films that might not have been made available to them. Fan favorites from the festival included a musical performance by Arashi, RIFF’s Crazy World, and Eeb Allay Ooo!.</p>
<p>The festival featured over 100 films co-curated by 21 prolific festivals and hailing from 35 different countries, as well as talks, VR content, and musical performances. It was created to not only provide entertainment but to also offer relief in the form of supporting organizations responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>A few of the call-outs from the event includes the online premiere of “Ricky Powell: The Individualist,” a documentary about legendary street photographer Powell featuring interviews with Natasha Lyonne and LL Cool J; a two-part documentary series on the experiences of women of color running for office, “And She Could Be Next;” as well as the online premiere of “Eeb Allay Ooo!,” a unique satire about professional “monkey repellers” out of Mumbai.</p>
<p>The 360 VR selections featured the Emmy-nominated documentary “Traveling While Black” from Academy Award-winning filmmaker Roger Ross Williams, and “Alteration,” a sci-fi narrative starring Bill Skarsgard, as well as additional titles featuring John Legend, Oprah Winfrey, and Lupita Nyong’o.</p>
<p>A large number of specially-curated talks were also featured during the event, both brand new and archived from past festivals. Featured panelists include Francis Ford Coppola with Steven Soderbergh, Song Kang-ho and Bong Joon-ho, Guillermo del Toro, Jackie Chan and Tessa Thompson with Jane Campion. One of the final talks in the series came from David Cronenberg about his film “Crash,” a highly controversial title made nearly 25-years ago and selected by actor Viggo Mortensen for a special screening at the Toronto Film Festival.</p>
<p>In solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, We Are One: A Global Film Festival wrapped the 10-day festival run with “Copwatch,” the true story of We Copwatch, an organization that films police activity as a non-violent form of protest and deterrent to police brutality. There was also a live DJ performance by multi-faceted, Grammy award-winning musical artist Questlove.</p>
<p>“It’s important to support artists,” said Tribeca Enterprises CEO Jane Rosenthal. “Artists always reflect what’s going on in our society. They bring us together through poetry as well as storytelling, and festivals help bring this to life in the best way possible. They reflect our culture and where would society be without knowing our individual cultures….that’s why at the end of the day we are one.”</p>

<h3 id="in-ca-disneyland-sets-reopening-date-coachella-and-stagecoach-called-off-for-2020">&ldquo;In CA: Disneyland sets reopening date; Coachella and Stagecoach called off for 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a1f7de915c49f765490e714c89c69a8557c00d33/c=0-285-5472-3371/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/06/25/1403745927004-Tim-Kellogg.jpg?width=3200&amp;height=1805&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s Arlene with news to know this Wednesday.</p>
<p>But first, the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and its country music counterpart Stagecoach, which had been postponed to October, are canceled for 2020.</p>
<p>In California brings you top stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.</p>
<p>L.A. police panel rules on Costco shooting; cop unions lack diversity; more carotid hold bans</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Police Commission found that an off-duty police officer acted outside of department policy when he shot a 32-year-old disabled man to death and injured his parents at a Costco in Corona last year.</p>
<p>Police in many cities are whiter than the populations they serve. When it comes to the leadership of law enforcement&rsquo;s powerful unions, they&rsquo;re even whiter.</p>
<p>The head of the Los Angeles police union is white, as are those who lead unions in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., New Orleans and Houston. And California’s statewide Fraternal Order of Police appears to have all white-leadership (and a black chaplain).</p>
<p>“It is to the detriment of policing, period, that our community is not represented at police union tables,” Sonia Pruitt, chairwoman of the National Black Police Association, an advocacy group for black cops, told The Marshall Project. “If they had leaders who said, ‘Listen, what happened to George Floyd was absolutely terrible,’ officers around the country would follow.”</p>
<p>The Simi Valley Police Department and the Riverside County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department join a growing list of agencies that will stop using a controversial neck restraint called a carotid hold. The restraint restricts blood flow to the brain, sometimes causing the person to pass out. For years, it has been part of the use-of-force manual for police departments throughout the county and state.</p>
<p>Riverside County took its action a day after a failed attempt by an elected official to launch a review of the department&rsquo;s policies.</p>
<p>Calling it dangerous, California Assemblymember Mike A. Gipson, D-Carson, has proposed legislation to eliminate its use. Last Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state to stop training officers to use the hold.</p>
<p>Starbucks plans closures, Disneyland announces reopenings and gym life</p>
<p>Starbucks is closing up to 400 of its stores but opening hundreds of others that make it easier to grab and go.</p>
<p>Disneyland and California Adventure will begin a phased reopening on July 17. Similar to Yosemite National Park, you&rsquo;ll need to make an advance reservation.</p>
<p>To wear or not to wear a mask at the gym is the debate. Some just won&rsquo;t go.</p>
<p>COVID-19&rsquo;s implications at the border</p>
<p>The Trump administration expelled 2,175 unaccompanied minors between March 21 and June 2, citing the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection declined to release a breakdown of their ages.</p>
<p>On a related note, the ACLU on Wednesday filed a suit challenging the Trump administration&rsquo;s decision to block many migrants from entering the country — including those requesting asylum — in the name of public health.</p>
<p>San Diego police department, buoyed by huge raises, increases budget</p>
<p>Despite pleas by some residents to cut funding during a 10-hour meeting, San Diego city leaders boosted police spending by $27 million for the fiscal year that starts July 1.</p>
<p>That brings the total spending to $566 million, budget documents show.</p>
<p>The systemic, generational issues that need to be addressed won&rsquo;t be solved in a single budget, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer told USA TODAY in a statement. &ldquo;We’re going to keep funding our police department but it won’t be business as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week, Faulconer banned the use of the carotid restraint by police officers, and he said he supports a ballot measure to increase independent oversight of the agency.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s rising police costs can in part be attributed to double-digit pay raises in recent years. Higher salaries in turn lead to higher pension payments — employee compensation is not surprisingly a department&rsquo;s biggest cost.</p>
<p>In 2018, officers were given raises totaling 25.6% by the time the last increase kicked in on Jan 1, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Officers with 20 or more years got 30.6%. Officers also get extra pay for working night shifts, having a degree, longevity pay and other factors.</p>
<p>And unlike many departments that are part of the California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System (CalPERS), San Diego officers still have &ldquo;3 at 55&rdquo; which means they can retire after 30 years of work and receive 90% of their highest compensation.</p>
<p>CalPERS member agencies, which includes most cities in the state, reduced that formula as part of modest statewide pension reforms that went into effect in 2013.</p>
<p>The median salary (excluding benefits) for a full-time officer in 2018 (the most recent year available) was $110,000, according to the state controller&rsquo;s database on public pay. Once the raises for non-veteran officers kicked in, that would climb to $138,160.</p>

<p>What never giving up looks like</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling like the news is pretty heavy right now, maybe you&rsquo;d find comfort and inspiration in a live storytelling event on Thursday themed, &ldquo;Resiliency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The USA TODAY Network&rsquo;s Storytellers Project will stream the show, part of its virtual season, at 5 p.m. PT. It&rsquo;ll be on the project&rsquo;s Facebook page and YouTube channel (where you can also dive into past shows).</p>
<p>The series, called “LIVE, In Your House,&rdquo; debuted April 2, when the COVID-19 pandemic canceled dozens of the project&rsquo;s planned storytelling events.</p>
<p>The “Resiliency” show will feature one of the Storytellers Project’s youngest tellers, 14-year-old Jack Florez of Phoenix, who will share a story about his life with cerebral palsy. He says the message in his story is simple.</p>

<h3 id="opera-companies-establish-workshop-to-diversify-the-art-form">&ldquo;Opera companies establish workshop to diversify the art form&rdquo;</h3>

Scenes from productions by MassOpera (left) and OperaHub. The companies have joined forces to change the landscape of opera. COURTESY PHOTOS</p>
<p>MassOpera and OperaHub have partnered to launch a reimagined New Opera Workshop (NOW) program that will find, foster and produce a contemporary opera led by diverse voices. Their goal is to change the landscape of opera and to establish a contemporary opera canon. A call for submissions is open now through July 15, with creatives of all kinds, with or without opera experience, encouraged to apply.</p>
<p>NOW was born from a desire to push opera forward. “We love the musical aesthetics … but we are tired of putting on stories that don’t reflect our values or our experiences,” says Christie Gibson, OperaHub’s general director. “We want to see a lot more people writing in a space that is contemporary.”</p>
<p>On the web Learn more and apply at: massopera.org</p>
<p>This means bringing in more diverse voices in terms of race, gender, economic background and other life experiences. Opera as a medium has stood the test of time for its power and grandeur, but in order to evolve, all the damsels can’t be in distress and all the storytellers can’t be white.</p>
<p>MassOpera has participated in a number of development programs for operas, but this is the first time the group is producing a show from inception to premiere. Cassandra Lovering, producing artistic director for MassOpera, says the way the opera is made is crucial to the process.</p>
<p>“Often times the creation process is very top-down,” says Lovering. “[This program] is about empowering artists and creating space for a process that’s specific to each creator that we’re collaborating with, meeting them where they are and then supporting them in the way that will really grow the piece to its fullest potential.”</p>
<p>The NOW program will work with one opera creator (or set of creators) chosen from the open call submissions. The finalists will be announced in August and the project or projects chosen for production will be announced in January 2021. From there, the production will go through a series of workshops and semi-staged performances to hone the work before the premiere. Currently the timeline is set for the process to take up most of 2021.</p>
<p>“An opera might have beautiful music, music that could bring you to tears. But then it’s partnered with a story that does not stand the test of time,“ says Lovering. “Because the music is in many ways inseparable from the story, it’s more important than ever now to ensure that they are reflecting who we are now. If opera is really going to live on for hundreds more years, it needs to change.”
