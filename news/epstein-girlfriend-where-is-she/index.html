<p>Netflix’s explosive four-part docuseries, “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich,” debuted this week on the streaming giant and chronicles the sex trafficking crimes of the high-profile financier – whose social circles included the likes of Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Harvey Weinstein, among others.</p>
<p>Through harrowing sit-down interviews with his accusers, interrogation footage of Epstein himself, and legal summaries from his lawyers and law enforcement officials, “Filthy Rich” graphically details Epstein’s lengthy “pyramid sex trafficking scheme” in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands and questions how the mysterious billionaire was able to evade a harsher prison sentence despite mountains of evidence from his victims and law enforcement investigators.</p>
<p>Here’s an update on where some of the alleged co-conspirators and key figures are now:</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein</p>
<p>The billionaire pedophile at the center of Netflix’s docuseries, committed suicide by hanging in a New York City jail cell in August of 2019 where he was being held without bail on sex-trafficking charges. Epstein was arrested on July 6, 2019 and pleaded not guilty to dozens of charges of sex trafficking for luring underage girls as young as 14 from 2002 to 2005.</p>
<p>His controversial death: Prison guards at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan weren’t monitoring Epstein’s jail cell at the time of his death – he was found unresponsive with a bed sheet tied around his neck – and the two security cameras outside his cell malfunctioned that night, leading some to speculate that Epstein was murdered. The F.B.I. and U.S. Department of Justice’s Inspector General are both investigating the circumstances of Epstein’s death and his lone sibling, Mark Epstein, hired forensic experts to dispute the theory that he died by hanging, as documented in the final episode of “Filthy Rich.”</p>
<p>Where’s the money? In one of his final acts, Epstein signed away his remaining $577 million fortune two days before his suicide and placed it in a Virginia Islands Trust Found, which makes it nearly impossible for his victims to seek restitution. Epstein had multi-million-dollar properties in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands, as well as several private jets.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell</p>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and right-hand woman, accused by his victims as being the ringleader of his global sex trafficking crimes, has denied any wrongdoing and is currently being investigated by the F.B.I. She hasn’t been seen in public since August of 2019 when she was photographed at an In N’ Out in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>A civil suit filed by one of Epstein’s accusers, Annie Farmer, is currently on hold because the federal investigation into his co-conspirators, which includes Maxwell, is still ongoing. Maxwell, herself, has filed a suit against Epstein’s estate in hopes of recouping legal fees tied to his arrest.</p>
<p>Maxwell has since sold her two homes and her environmental nonprofit organization, The TerraMar Project, was shuttered in 2019.</p>
<p>Royal Controversy: The British socialite is said to have procured dozens of the underage girls and is even accused of engaging in sex acts with many of the girls. Virginia Roberts, one of Epstein’s accusers, said Maxwell hosted one of Prince Andrew’s alleged sexual encounters with the then-17 year old at her London townhome after a night out partying. She also was photographed with the Duke of York, who had his arm around Roberts’ waist in the picture.</p>
<p>Alex Acosta</p>
<p>The former Labor Secretary resigned from Donald Trump’s administration in 2019 over his handling of the Epstein sex crimes when he was U.S. attorney in southern Florida.</p>
<p>Acosta, who refused to be interviewed for the Netflix series, was US attorney in Miami where he oversaw a secret non-prosecution agreement for Epstein in 2008, despite evidence that he sexually assaulted at least 400 teenage girls that normally would’ve meant a life sentence behind bars. Instead, Epstein was prisoned for 13 months, which allowed him to leave 12 hours a day, six days a week for “work” causing Palm Beach police chief Michael Reiter, who tried to put him behind bars, to personally apologize to Epstein’s victims and their families.</p>
<p>During his resignation press conference, Acosta said, “We believe that we proceeded appropriately” and “we did what we did because we wanted to see Epstein go to jail.”</p>
<p>Acosta has kept a relatively low profile and remains jobless since leaving the White House. He was succeeded by current Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia.</p>
<p>Les Wexner</p>
<p>The billionaire who founded L Brands, a global retail empire that includes Victoria’s Secret and Bed Bath and Beyond, stepped down as CEO and chairman of the company in 2020 and sold his majority stake in VIctoria’s Secret for $525 million.</p>
<p>Following Epstein’s indictment in 2019, Wexner accused his former financial adviser of stealing $46 million from his company.</p>
<p>“We discovered that he had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family,” the 82 year-old said at the time. “This was, frankly, a tremendous shock, even though it clearly pales in comparison to the unthinkable allegations against him now.”</p>
<p>One of Epstein’s accusers, Maria Farmer, said she was sexually assaulted by Epstein at Wexner’s 336-acre Ohio estate in the late 1990s, and told The Washington Post that Wexner should be held “responsible.”</p>
<p>“Les loves me, he’ll let me do anything,” she recalled Epstein telling her about the retail mogul.</p>
<p>Wexner is said to be the primary reason Epstein gained such enormous wealth.The New York Times reported that in 1991 Wexner signed a three-page power of attorney “that enabled Mr. Epstein to hire people, sign checks, buy and sell properties and borrow money – all on Mr. Wexner’s behalf.”</p>
<p>Their two-decade relationship reportedly went beyond just business ties, too, with attorneys in Netflix’s “Filthy RIch” asking Epstein during an interrogation if they were also lovers, which Epstein denied. His business partners on Wall Street said in the doc that Epstein would brag about their relationship and how he controlled the mogul’s mind and emotions.</p>
<p>Wexner’s wife Abigail, who is on the board of trustees at Ohio State University where the Wexners are major donors (the school’s hospital is named after them), has also been accused by Farmer of being complicit of Epstein’s alleged assault on the teenager at their Ohio mansion in 1996.</p>
<p>Wexner is still chairman emeritus of L Brands. Abigail Wexner remains on the board of trustees at Ohio State.</p>
<p>The billionaire couple have denied knowing about the criminal encounters between Epstein and the underage girls and are currently not under investigation.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew:</p>
<p>The Duke of York is one of the many high-profile figures accused of sexual assault in the series alongside Harvey Weinstein and Alan Dershowitz (Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s private jet “Lolita Express” 26 times according to flight manifests but there were no reports of sexual assault).</p>
<p>Prince Andrew, according to Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts, assaulted her on multiple occasions. Another Epstein employee corroborated a story about Roberts and Prince Andrew naked together at Epstein’s “Orgy Island” estate in the Virgin Islands. Roberts also has a photograph of herself with Prince Andrew, his arm wrapped around her waist , that was allegedly taken after a night partying at London club when Roberts was just 17 years-old at Ghislaine Maxwell’s London townhome (Maxwell is also pictured), but Prince Andrew would later say he has “no recollection of meeting this lady whatsoever.” That night, according to Prince Andrew, he was at a “Pizza Express in Woking” with his daughter.</p>
<p>The Duke has also been asked why he decided to stay with Epstein at his New York mansion in 2010 following his 13-month stint at a Florida prison.</p>
<p>“Right, I have always … ever since this has happened and since this has become, as it were, public knowledge that I was there, I’ve questioned myself as to why did I go and what was I doing and was it the right thing to do? Now, I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together. I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken’s way of doing it. I had to go and see him and talk to him.”</p>
<p>Following Epstein’s death in 2019, Prince Andrew issued a statement saying “at no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behavior,” adding, “His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr. Epstein’s lifestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behavior.”</p>
<p>The U.S. continues to investigates Epstein’s alleged co-conspirators, including Prince Andrew, but in March, prosecutors in New York said that contrary to the Duke’s public offer to contribute to the investigation, he has “completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options.”

<h3 id="filthy-rich-all-the-details-on-jeffrey-epsteins-former-girlfriend-ghislaine-maxwell">&ldquo;Filthy Rich: All the Details on Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s Former Girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4VYpAsWrc5_SBykagW_VkGDVbJk/0x901:5386x3729/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2020/05/27/742/n/1922283/8a2ebe755ece9a0a5a86b4.38110497_.jpg" alt="img">
Convicted sex offender and millionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein is at the center of Netflix&rsquo;s Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich. The documentary, which focuses on Epstein&rsquo;s life, death, and crimes, features some of the victims of his sex trafficking, allowing them to tell their side on what happened many years ago. It also introduces some of the other people in Epstein&rsquo;s life who have been tied to his crimes, and one of them is his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell paraded around at parties with Epstein for years before breaking ties with him and then fully pulling away from the public eye in recent years. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about the late Epstein&rsquo;s close friend.</p>
<p>Who Is Ghislaine Maxwell?</p>
<p>Maxwell is a British socialite and daughter of media tycoon Robert Maxwell. She moved to the US after her famous father died in 1991 and met Epstein around the same time. They reportedly dated for a few years, but later became just being friends. In fact, in a 2003 Vanity Fair profile on Epstein, Maxwell is referred to as Epstein&rsquo;s best friend, and according to the story, &ldquo;He tells people that when a relationship is over the girlfriend &lsquo;moves up, not down, to friendship status.&rdquo; It was Maxwell, according to CNN, who introduced Epstein to many high-profile people in his social circle.</p>
<p>Was Ghislaine Maxwell Involved in Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s Crimes?</p>
<p>Several of Epstein&rsquo;s accusers have also accused Maxwell of being involved. One accuser, Virginia Giuffre, claimed that Maxwell acted as a madame to coordinate sexual relations with Prince Andrew and Epstein. Giuffre reported that in 2001, she had sex — while underage — with Prince Andrew at Maxwell&rsquo;s residence in London, a claim that Maxwell has denied.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>CNN reported that more of Epstein&rsquo;s accusers have said Maxwell took part in the sexual abuse by facilitating the encounters over the years. Some said that she was the one who found the underage victims involved in Epstein&rsquo;s sex-trafficking ring and connected them with high-profile people in Epstein&rsquo;s circle.</p>
<p>Was Ghislaine Maxwell Prosecuted For Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s Crimes?</p>
<p>Though accusers have brought allegations against Maxwell in connection to Epstein, she has not yet faced charges. After distancing herself from Epstein about a decade ago, she largely fell out of the public eye. ABC News reported earlier this year that her accusers were struggling to bring charges against her because she couldn&rsquo;t be tracked down. However, according to the story, &ldquo;Maxwell, represented by attorneys from a Colorado law firm, is currently contesting the disclosure of previously sealed documents in a now-settled defamation lawsuit brought against her in federal court in New York by Giuffre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maxwell finally resurfaced in March to bring her own charges against Epstein&rsquo;s estate, alleging that he &ldquo;had promised to pay her legal fees for any claims from the dozens of women who say she helped him recruit them to give him massages when they were teenagers,&rdquo; according to The New York Times. In her lawsuit, Maxwell claims she has incurred legal fees for being incorrectly tied to Epstein&rsquo;s sex-trafficking ring. She maintains she was not involved in any way, but it&rsquo;s unclear if her accusers will be able to bring their own charges against her now.</p>
<p>Where Is Ghislaine Maxwell Now?</p>
<p>Maxwell has fallen almost completely off the grid over the past few years. She began distancing herself from Epstein around 2008, when he served time for soliciting a minor for prostitution. She stopped going to social functions completely a few years later, and until early this year, when she showed up to file the lawsuit against Epstein&rsquo;s estate, she had almost completely disappeared.

Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich uncovers the stories of survivors who were allegedly abused and sex trafficked by financier Jeffrey Epstein and his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. The Netflix docuseries also features the testimony of Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Epstein to high-profile men, including Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz.</p>
<p>In a recent tweet, Guiffre called out supermodel Naomi Campbell, claiming she was Maxwell’s “BFF,” and that she saw her with Epstein on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre reveals her story in ‘Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich’</p>
<p>Netflix’s documentary series, Filthy Rich, examines the numerous cases of alleged sexual abuse Jeffrey Epstein got away with for decades. Through four episodes, survivors tell their stories of their encounters with Epstein, and how he targeted them as vulnerable minors.</p>
<p>On the docuseries, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, now 36, details how Epstein’s supposed girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell found her working as a locker room attendant at Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort when she was 16. She says that Maxwell saw her reading a book about massage therapy and offered her a job as Epstein’s traveling masseuse.</p>
<p>Soon after Giuffre arrived at Epstein’s West Palm Beach home, she says Maxwell and Epstein sexually abused her. She says the couple used her insecurities and vulnerabilities to groom her. And she claims they manipulated her into being trafficked by them for years.</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich’: Where is Ghislaine Maxwell Now?</p>
<p>She is at the center of the Prince Andrew Scandal</p>
<p>In Filthy Rich, Giuffre claims that she flew to London with Maxwell and Epstein in 2001 when she was 17. She says that at Maxwell’s townhouse, she was introduced to Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>After a night of partying, Giuffre says they returned to Maxwell’s home. After Epstein snapped a photo of her with Prince Andrew, she says Maxwell demanded she provide sexual favors for him.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/VRSVirginia/status/1262512899626393600">https://twitter.com/VRSVirginia/status/1262512899626393600</a></p>
<p>“Ghislaine tells me, ‘You’re going to have to do for him what you do for Jeffrey,'” Giuffre says in Episode 4 of the Netflix doc. “Right after that photo was taken, I was sexually abused by Prince Andrew for the first time.”</p>
<p>Maxwell has denied any involvement in Epstein’s alleged misconduct. And Prince Andrew continues to deny any wrongdoing and has said he doesn’t remember ever meeting Giuffre.</p>
<p>Virginia Roberts Giuffre claims Naomi Campbell was good friends with Campbell</p>
<p>On Twitter, Giuffre has been vocal about pointing out those she feels are connected to Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring. She specifically called out former supermodel Naomi Campbell, alleging she must have known what was happening because of her close friendship with Maxwell.</p>
<p>“She was Maxwell’s BFF,” Giuffre wrote in a tweet along with a picture of her, Maxwell, and Campbell. “There is no way in hell that she didn’t know what was happening in front of her own eyes. They were all aware of Epstein &amp; Maxwell’s op- didn’t go at any length to hide it either. That’s me @ 17- sad.”</p>
<p>In another tweet, Giuffre claimed she encountered Campbell on multiple occasions. “You saw me at your parties, you saw me in Epstein’s homes, you saw me on the plane, you saw me get my haircut, you saw me on the streets, you watched me be abused,” Giuffre tweeted next to a series of pictures with Campbell and Prince Andrew. “You saw me!”</p>

<p>However, Campbell denies knowing about any of Epstein’s alleged abuse. In an August 2019 video on her Youtube page, the model says Epstein was just one of the “hundreds of thousands of people” that she’s taken a picture with.</p>
<p>“What he’s done is indefensible,” Campbell says in the video. “When I heard what he had done, it sickened me to my stomach, just like everybody else, because I’ve had my fair share of sexual predators, and thank God I had good people around who protected me from this. Right now, I stand with the victims. They’re scarred for life.”

Filthy Rich is a four-part documentary series detailing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s purported crimes, from the perspective of his victims.</p>
<p>Epstein owned a private island, Little St. James, located in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about Little St. James, where Epstein was accused of sex trafficking.</p>
<p>In 1998, wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein purchased a 75-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands for $ 7.95 million, according to the New York Times. The island, called Little St. James, would become the site of some of his most notorious crimes—and Filthy Rich, a new documentary series on Netflix, catalogues many of them.</p>
<p>The four-part series, which quickly rose to the streaming service&rsquo;s Top 10 chart, features chilling testimony from numerous survivors of Epstein&rsquo;s sexual assault—many of whom endured a trip to Little St. James, along with Epstein and his ex-girlfriend (and alleged Madam) Ghislane Maxwell.</p>
<p>After he was arrested and charged with sex trafficking of girls and young women by federal prosecutors in July 2019, Epstein, 66, reportedly took his own life in his Manhattan jail cell the following month. Since his death, Epstein&rsquo;s island has become a tourist attraction for Caribbean travelers hoping to catch a glimpse of his lavish structures.</p>
<p>Though Epstein had properties in Florida, New York, New Mexico, and Paris, an entire episode of Filthy Rich is devoted to Epstein&rsquo;s activity on the island of Little St. James, located two miles off the coast of St. Thomas. &ldquo;Being on an island, by himself–I guess he could do whatever he wanted,&rdquo; Gordon Ackley, a St. Thomas resident, said in the documentary.</p>
<p>Locals had telling nicknames for Little Saint James: “Orgy Island,” “Pedophile Island,” and “Island of Sin.&rdquo; But, Epstein preferred to call his primary residence &ldquo;Little Saint Jeff,&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s where he reigned. Returning to the scene of of the crime, Filthy Rich reveals the truth behind those nickname. Here&rsquo;s what we learned about Little St. James—and what we know of its future.</p>

<p>Little St. James is located in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Epstein&rsquo;s island is in the Caribbean Sea between St. Thomas and St. John, the two largest of the Virgin Islands. Little St. James is situated to the east of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Per the New York Times, Epstein accessed the approximately 75-acre island by flying into St. Thomas International Airport and chartering a helicopter. Little St. James is also accessible from St. Thomas by a 15-minute boat ride. While nearby, Little St. James is not visible from most vistas on St. Thomas, per a 2019 article in the L.A. Times.</p>
<p>He paid $7.95 million for the island, but its price has risen steeply since then.</p>
<p>In 1998, Epstein purchased Little St. James for $7.95 million. Unsealed court documents from 2019 estimate the island&rsquo;s value at $63,874,223.</p>
<p>The same court documents also confirm that Epstein was not really a billionaire. The total assets listed, including cash, investments, and real estate holdings, amounted to a (still sizable) $559,120,954.</p>
<p>Epstein spent millions developing the island.</p>
<p>The third episode of Filthy Rich exposes how significantly Epstein developed the island since its purchase. Luxury resort designer Edward Tuttle designed the colonnaded villa-style &ldquo;main house,&rdquo; where guests stayed while visiting Little St. James. Epstein&rsquo;s personal residence was a stone-walled cabana with a turquoise ceiling, per Filthy Rich—one of many cabanas.</p>
<p>Before he went to prison in 2008, Epstein began another round of renovations on Little St. James. A 2008 New York Times report detailed Epstein&rsquo;s architectural vision for the island: He was constructing a library to house 90,000 volumes, a Japanese bathhouse, and a movie theater.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s with the temple on Epstein&rsquo;s island?</p>
<p>Also on the island is a mysterious building with blue-and-white stripes and a gold domed ceiling, which fell off during a 2017 hurricane. The building, dubbed &ldquo;the temple,&rdquo; spurred many conspiracy theories, which are detailed in a Business Insider article.</p>

<p>But seriously, what&rsquo;s up with this weird temple thing on Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s private island? pic.twitter.com/njxfg2HahN — jon gabriel (@exjon) July 9, 2019</p>
<p>To understand the true purpose of the structure, the Business Insider reporter interviewed Patrick Baron, a piano tuner who had visited the two-floored building twice. Baron recalled seeing a black grand piano, bookshelves, a dark wood desk, and a portrait of Epstein or the Pope (he wasn&rsquo;t sure which). He classified the structure as a &ldquo;study&rdquo;—or even a lair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went in there knowing absolutely nothing about [Epstein], except that he was wealthy,&rdquo; Baron told Business Insider. &ldquo;And after doing the job and talking to some of my other clients on St. Thomas, and they filled me in on the scandal, my perception of that room changed from a study to a lair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Epstein regularly brought young women to the island, often underage.</p>
<p>While working on Little St. James as an IT contractor from 1999 to 2006, Steven Scully noted a pattern among Epstein&rsquo;s visitors: &ldquo;The guests always included young girls,&rdquo; he said in Filthy Rich. According to Scully, the young girls often socialized with other people on the island—&ldquo;important people&rdquo;—who were not Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>Per The Guardian, a 2020 lawsuit filed by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands cites evidence of a computerized database of girls who visited the island, some as young as 11.</p>
<p>Featuring harrowing interviews, Filthy Rich exposes the terror and isolation many of these young women felt while on Little St. James. &ldquo;From the first day I was on the island, the abuse started,&rdquo; Sarah Ransome, who accused Epstein of sexually assaulting her, multiple times, said. &ldquo;I was trapped from the very first day.&rdquo; Ransome was so desperate to leave she attempted to swim shark-infested waters, the New York Post reported, but was thwarted by the island&rsquo;s intricate surveillance system, and had her passport confiscated, according to the Guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was trapped from the very first day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the documentary, Epstein&rsquo;s behavior was a well-kept secret. &ldquo;Jeffrey Epstein was a guy who concealed his deviance very well. But he didn&rsquo;t conceal it that well,&rdquo; Scully said.</p>
<p>On her first day, Ransome recalls landing at the airport in St. Thomas, and being greeted by people who treated Epstein like a &ldquo;celebrity.&rdquo; Looking back, she believes they were aware of what was occurring on the island. &ldquo;I think that they knew,&rdquo; Ransome said in the documentary.</p>
<p>“It was kind of accepted,” Sasha Bouis, who used to run a floating restaurant anchored near Great St. James, told the New York Times. “There was just this creepy old billionaire living out there.”</p>
<p>The island had a star-studded guest list that allegedly included Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew is among the individuals named in Filthy Rich as having visited Little St. James—as are President Bill Clinton and Alan Dershowitz, Epstein&rsquo;s lawyer. &ldquo;Not all the men took part. I have seen people that came for a lunch or a dinner, and didn&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one of the survivors, clarified in the documentary.</p>
<p>However, Scully had a distinct memory of seeing Prince Andrew with a guest in 2004. &ldquo;He was at the pool. He was with, at that time, an unknown girl—to me. She was young. She didn&rsquo;t have any top on. They were engaged in foreplay,&rdquo; Scully said.</p>

<p>Prince Andrew has denied having any inappropriate contact with young women associated with Epstein, again and again. However, in 2019, the Queen&rsquo;s son voluntarily stepped back from his royal duties after being linked to Epstein.</p>
<p>Now, Epstein&rsquo;s private island is a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>After Epstein died in 2019, curious tourists were compelled to get close glimpses of the island that had been his primary residence. “No one used to pay attention to it,” Jon Stewart, the owner of a charter boat company told The L.A. Times. Whereas now, “there’s a ton more tourists.”</p>
<p>One such tourist, speaking to Fox News in 2019, gave her perspective. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s effed up but I want to see where Satan lived,&rdquo; Soledad Simmons, visiting St. Thomas from Puerto Rico, said. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m not the only one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s effed up but I want to see where Satan lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another interview with Fox News, Stewart detailed the catamarans–carrying up to 80 passengers—that travel the coasts of Little St. James. Stewart said he had been taking tourists to the tiny island for years because of the excellent snorkeling opportunities.</p>
<p>Most tourists are limited to what they can spot from the boat. However, in 2019, Luke Rudkowski and Jeff Berwick trespassed onto the empty island and posted the video to their YouTube channel, We Are Change. “The most interesting things I found were these little satanic gargoyles with horns on their heads that were all over the property,” Rudkowski said, calling them “very creepy.”</p>

<p>Epstein bought another island in 2016.</p>
<p>In 2016, Epstein bought the island Great St. James for $17.5 million, per the New York Times. Per TODAY, Epstein was developing the island up until his arrest in 2019.</p>

<p>The U.S. Virgin Islands filed a lawsuit to seize Epstein&rsquo;s islands.</p>
<p>Little St. James and Great St. James may be Epstein&rsquo;s islands, no more. According to The Guardian, a lawsuit filed by the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands in January of 2020 aims to seize both islands, and shut down Epstein&rsquo;s shell companies created in the region.</p>
<p>“Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Little Saint James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here,” Attorney General Denise George told the New York Times.</p>

<h3 id="court-agrees-to-delay-testimony-of-jeffrey-epstein-confidant-ghislaine-maxwell-in-civil-suit">&ldquo;Court agrees to delay testimony of Jeffrey Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell in civil suit&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/maxwell-epistein-gty-aa-200522_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg" alt="img">
Court agrees to delay testimony of Jeffrey Epstein confidant Ghislaine Maxwell in civil suit Maxwell, 58, has not been seen in public in several months.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has been granted at least a temporary reprieve from having to respond to questions in a civil lawsuit that alleges she committed sexual battery against a teenage girl, a federal magistrate judge ruled on Friday.</p>
<p>Maxwell, who has been accused in several lawsuits of facilitating or participating in Epstein&rsquo;s abuse of girls and young women, sought the delay because of an ongoing federal criminal investigation into Epstein&rsquo;s alleged co-conspirators and because a victims&rsquo; compensation fund proposed by Epstein&rsquo;s estate is said to be nearing final approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m permitting her not to respond to [written questions] and not to have her deposition,&rdquo; Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman said in her ruling from the bench. &ldquo;Not forever, but at least long enough to let us know whether the claims process is likely to go forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman made her ruling in a lawsuit filed against Maxwell and Epstein&rsquo;s estate last November by Annie Farmer. Farmer alleges that she was recruited and groomed by Epstein and Maxwell in 1996, and that Maxwell sexually assaulted her at Epstein&rsquo;s New Mexico ranch when Farmer was 16.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie was extremely distressed and afraid. She was a child in a massive ranch in New Mexico, away from her family in Arizona, and isolated from any source of help. She was alone with Epstein and Maxwell,&rdquo; Farmer&rsquo;s complaint says.</p>
<p>An attorney for Farmer argued against the delay, noting the uncertainty surrounding the potential length of the criminal investigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no indication of any time frame with respect to &hellip; how long that investigation could go on,&rdquo; said Sigrid McCawley, the attorney for Farmer and four other victims suing Epstein&rsquo;s estate. &ldquo;And to not be able to get discovery and ask Miss Maxwell questions &hellip; that puts us in handcuffs with respect to being able to establish our claims.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Responding to those concerns, Freeman said she had &ldquo;no desire to have this drag out&rdquo; and asked to be updated in mid-June on the status of the investigation and the victims&rsquo; claims program.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 58, has not been seen in public in several months and her whereabouts are unknown. She has denied Farmer&rsquo;s claims and the allegations that she facilitated Epstein&rsquo;s alleged crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She absolutely denies that she participated in this or any other sexual abuse or trafficking or assault, and no court, judge or jury has ever determined that she has,&rdquo; wrote Maxwell&rsquo;s attorney Laura Menninger in a letter to the court this week.</p>
<p>Menninger also claimed that the litigation was taking a financial toll on Maxwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike the estate, she is not a multi-millionaire and must self-fund her defense,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>In March, Maxwell filed her own lawsuit against the late financier&rsquo;s estate seeking reimbursement of her legal fees and personal security costs. She claims that Epstein had repeatedly made &ldquo;clear and unambiguous&rdquo; promises to always support her financially, according to her complaint.</p>
<p>Epstein died by suicide in jail last August, according to the New York City medical examiner, one month after his arrest on child sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Epstein pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>
<p>In court filings in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Farmer has indicated a willingness to take part in the voluntary claims program if it moves forward. Nearly 70 other alleged victims have also expressed an interest in participating in the program, which could resolve dozens of claims against the estate without litigation.</p>

<p>But the program&rsquo;s approval has been held up for months after Denise George, the attorney general for the Virgin Islands, filed criminal liens against Epstein&rsquo;s estate, effectively freezing all the assets of the $634 million estate worldwide. George has objected to some terms of the restitution plan, which she argued did not comply with the laws of the Virgin Islands or fully protect the rights of Epstein&rsquo;s victims.</p>
<p>In the court hearing Friday &ndash; which was conducted by telephone due to the COVID-19 pandemic &ndash; estate attorney Bennett Moskowitz said that the major issues have been resolved with the attorney general, and that he expects the program to be approved within a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a few less contentious matters to iron out. But it is our firm expectation that by sometime next week, that resolution in principle will be formalized,&rdquo; Moskowitz said.</p>
<p>In a statement to ABC News Friday, George concurred that the parties are &ldquo;near agreement upon the terms of the fund,&rdquo; which she said would be &ldquo;a substantial improvement&rdquo; from the original proposal from the estate. She said she remains opposed, however, to the estate&rsquo;s requirement that victims &ldquo;sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them.&rdquo; The estate has recently amended the release in an effort to address the attorney general&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the interest of allowing the program to move forward, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has been working further with estate counsel and the victims&rsquo; attorneys on an agreement in principle, which is still being drafted,&rdquo; George said in the statement.</p>
<p>During the court hearing on Friday, Moskowitz also contended that some of the victims&rsquo; attorneys were unnecessarily driving up the costs of litigation by demanding the estate search for and turn over documents that aren&rsquo;t relevant to their cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every dollar we&rsquo;re spending in the meantime is money that will never be available for that program,&rdquo; Moskowitz said.</p>

<p>McCawley had contended in court filings earlier this month that the estate had failed to produce even a single document in response to their discovery requests, and she had sought court intervention to require the estate to search for documents covering the entire time frame of Epstein&rsquo;s alleged abuse of young women and girls. The victims are seeking photographs, video and audio recordings from Epstein&rsquo;s airplanes and homes, financial records and communications with his alleged co-conspirators, employees and government officials that span a period of nearly two decades.</p>
<p>In court Friday, McCawley acknowledged that the estate had begun to produce some documents this week relating to her clients, but argued that other relevant evidence was improperly being withheld.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our position is that, with respect to our client&rsquo;s claims in each of the cases, information relating to Epstein&rsquo;s abuse of other victims is highly relevant,&rdquo; McCawley said. &ldquo;The pattern of how he lured girls and then abused them is relevant to our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attorneys for the estate have countered that the victims&rsquo; demands are disproportionate to the needs of the cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everything related to any allegedly bad thing Mr. Epstein ever did is relevant in each action, well, then it could take me six months or a year to finish looking for every piece of paper at every property Mr. Epstein owned,&rdquo; Moskowitz said Friday.

<h3 id="inside-the-netflix-docuseries-jeffrey-epstein-filthy-rich">&ldquo;Inside the Netflix Docuseries &lsquo;Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jeffrey-epstein-documentary-netflix.jpg?quality=85&amp;w=1200&amp;h=628&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
Netflix’s latest true crime documentary, Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich, examines how a wealthy and well-connected financier got away with crimes of sexual abuse and sex trafficking for decades. But just as crucially, it provides a space for his survivors to share their own stories.</p>
<p>The four-part series, based on James Patterson’s 2016 book Filthy Rich, features several interviews with survivors and traces a web of powerful people accused of enabling Epstein’s illegal conduct. (Patterson collaborated on producing the series, along with RadicalMedia).</p>
<p>The series documents how accusations of sexual abuse followed Epstein for years before law enforcement took action. Although rumors and allegations swirled, it wasn’t until he was arrested in July 2019 on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges that his crimes became more widely known. The arrest was based on allegations that he had paid young girls, some of whom were underage, for sex and used them to recruit others dating back to 2002, according to a criminal indictment unsealed in Manhattan federal court last year.</p>
<p>Prior to his arrest, Epstein had received increased scrutiny over a plea deal he struck in 2008 to avoid federal prosecution when he was accused of sexually abusing underage girls, after the Miami Herald published an investigative report into the deal in 2018. Under the terms of the plea deal, Epstein served just 13 months in prison and was permitted to leave custody to work in a private office for six days a week.</p>
<p>Lisa Bryant, the director of Filthy Rich, tells TIME that her anger grew as she learned more details about the extent of Epstein’s abuse.</p>
<p>“[He was] this rich guy who was charismatic and just got away with things,” she says. “We really wanted to lay out, step by step, his life and pattern of playing the system. And he did it very well until the very end.”</p>
<p>Production on the documentary series had been underway for nearly nine months before Epstein’s arrest in July 2019. “Everything changed overnight,” Bryant says. “After he was arrested, everyone knew about it so we had to shift a little to covering breaking news. Things were happening so quickly.”</p>
<p>Then, in August 2019, Epstein died in an apparent suicide while in a federal jail in Manhattan. For Bryant and the survivors she’d gotten to know over the process of making the series, Epstein’s sudden death was a blow. “I was mad. These women deserved to see him go to trial,” she says. “I don’t think they’ll ever get the closure that they truly deserve. He didn’t have to ever really answer for his crimes.”</p>
<p>‘It went from something real to something perverted’</p>

<p>Filthy Rich is anchored by the survivors of Epstein’s abuse, now grown women living all over the world. Across their many stories, they recall being recruited or recruiting other girls to go to Epstein’s properties in Palm Beach and New York City or to his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands to have sex with Epstein, often under the guise that they were being hired to give him massages.</p>
<p>Many of the women who are seen speaking out in the series also came forward to talk about their experiences with various other news outlets, in lawsuits or in their own personal quests for justice. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, one survivor of Epstein’s abuse, is among the first women to share her story in the series. Giuffre has previously spoken out about her allegations against Epstein, including that he sex-trafficked her and made her have sex with the U.K.’s Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, in numerous lawsuits and news stories. (Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied her allegations.) An aspiring massage therapist, Giuffre met Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, who has been accused of helping him recruit and groom girls for abuse, at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago in 1999, where she was working at the time.</p>
<p>Giuffre recalls that Maxwell urged her to meet Epstein, saying he was looking for a masseuse. At his home in Palm Beach, Giuffre says she massaged Epstein with Maxwell as she told them about her life before they both made her have sex with him. (Maxwell has repeatedly denied any allegations of sexual abuse made against her, including in statements to the production team).</p>
<p>“I felt like it was okay to tell them about my past. And then he turned over,” Giuffre says in the series. “Still to this day, I don’t know how it went from something real to something perverted like that so quickly.”</p>
<p>Another woman, Sarah Ransome, shares that Epstein sexually trafficked her in 2006 when she was around 22. After becoming acquainted with Epstein, Ransome went on a trip with him and a group of people to his private island, where she was continuously sexually abused.</p>
<p>“From the very first day that I arrived on the island the abuse started,” she says. In one instance, Ransome was asked to lie down on a massage table where Epstein raped her, she says. “It was like lying on a surgeon’s table and someone doing things to you that you have no control over. You’re powerless. I was trapped.”</p>
<p>‘A feeling like there was no way out’</p>
<p>As the series unfolds, it traces how Epstein’s exploits were part of a larger sex trafficking ring that involved several co-conspirators who either brushed aside or actively enabled the abuse. Giuffre says in the documentary that Epstein forced her to have sex with his friends, including Prince Andrew, when she was 17. Last year, Prince Andrew said he would retreat from royal public duties amid the controversy over his friendship with Epstein.</p>
<p>Filthy Rich points to the many other notable figures known for associating with Epstein, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and former head of Victoria Secret’s parent company Les Wexner. Trump said in 2019 that he hadn’t spoken to Epstein for “15 years”; Clinton in 2019 denied knowing anything about Epstein’s criminal behavior. A spokesperson for Wexner told TIME in 2019 that he severed ties with Epstein more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>At the center of the series is the question of how so many people within Epstein’s circle, knowing rampant abuse was going on at his multiple properties, allowed it to go on for so long. The series shows that by regularly offering young women to his friends for sex, Epstein built a world on blackmail and threats to keep powerful people quiet. The women being trafficked for sex also became trapped, believing they needed Epstein to provide for their basic needs.</p>
<p>“They depended on him for housing, for medicine,” Bryant says. “They were fearful for their lives. There was a feeling like there was no way out.”</p>
<p>‘We need each other to get through this’</p>

<p>A few cultural shifts made many of the women abused by Epstein feel more comfortable speaking out, according to Jon Doran, an executive producer at Radical Media and a producer on the series. The effects of the #MeToo movement and the lasting impact of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony about being sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings emboldened some women to come forward, Doran says. (Kavanagh has denied the accusations of sexual misconduct lodged against him.) Epstein’s arrest in 2019 was “monumental” in making his victims feel heard, according to Doran.</p>
<p>The arrest also brought attention to the failures in the criminal justice system that had shielded Epstein from punishment for years. Some of the focus went to former U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, who oversaw Epstein’s 2008 plea deal while serving as U.S. Attorney in South Florida. Amid mounting criticism for the way he handled the case, Acosta resigned from his post in July 2019, days after he defended his role in the plea deal.</p>
<p>To Doran, moments like these served to highlight systemic issues that persist even after Epstein’s death.</p>
<p>“This story is far from over. There are other critical enablers that are not accounted for fully yet,” he says. “Wealth and power, it comes with responsibility. And how humans manage that responsibility, that’s exactly what we’re looking at.”</p>
<p>Epstein’s shocking death left his survivors with few answers and no chance to finally face him in court, as many of them share in the series. But they no longer have to live in fear of his far-reaching power—and by finding each other, the women say they have found strength. Maria Farmer, a survivor and an artist whose creativity was hampered for years by the trauma from Epstein’s abuse, says in the series that she began painting again because she was “tired of being afraid.” One artwork, a riff on Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights, documented what she experienced with Epstein and his circle.</p>
<p>Lately, however, Farmer’s art has turned toward the other survivors. She’s been making portraits of the other women who also spoke out and plans to have each of them holding paper dolls, which represent the girls who have never come forward.</p>
<p>“It empowers me to provide them with strength,” Farmer says. “We need each other to get through this.”</p>

<h3 id="epstein-bombshell-court-document-names-names-in-sex-trafficking-scandal">&ldquo;EPSTEIN BOMBSHELL: Court document names names in sex-trafficking scandal&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/epse8-e1577982826202.jpg" alt="img">
Court documents filed by one of pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s young accusers lists more than 70 people with alleged knowledge of the billionaire’s underage sex-trafficking ring.</p>
<p>Among the names listed by Virginia Roberts are Prince Andrew, former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, celebrity stylist Frederic Fekkai, and one-time U.S. Senate majority leader George Mitchell.</p>
<p>“(These people) had knowledge of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual trafficking conduct and interaction with underage minors,” the document alleges, according to the U.K. Sun.</p>
<p>The luminaries listed were part of a list of potential witnesses Roberts offered in her 2016 defamation case against Maxwell. The British socialite and daughter of disgraced publishing baron Robert Maxwell had called Roberts a liar.</p>
<p>According to the documents, every name on the list has previously denied knowledge of Epstein’s antics and predilections for underage girls.</p>
<p>And Roberts’ documents are quick to say that not all of the individuals listed were engaged in any illegal activity or were part of a massive cover-up. Nor does the document say when the individuals became aware of Epstein’s vile deeds.</p>
<p>For her part, Roberts has claimed she was sexually assaulted by Epstein, Maxwell and Prince Andrew. Maxwell and Andrew have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Here are some of the people named in the U.K. Sun’s story:</p>
<p>GHISLAINE MAXWELL</p>
<p>Roberts claims that Maxwell sexually abused her by forcing her to engage in threesomes with herself and Epstein.</p>
<p>JEAN-LUC BRUNEL</p>
<p>French modelling mogul who multiple women (including Roberts) have alleged trafficked them to Epstein.</p>
<p>RON BURKLE</p>
<p>Venture capitalist billionaire Burkle is close friends with Sarah, Duchess of York, and Bill and Hillary Clinton</p>
<p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ</p>
<p>Famed lawyer and Harvard professor represented Epstein in the past. Roberts claims she was trafficked to Dershowitz. He has denied her claims.</p>
<p>EVA AND GLEN DUBIN</p>
<p>Epstein’s ex-girlfriend and her doctor hubby. Roberts has alleged she was trafficked to the couple by Epstein and Maxwell.</p>
<p>PRINCE ANDREW</p>
<p>Roberts claims she had sex with the Duke of York three times, the first being when she was sent to London when she was 17. Andrew denies any wrong-doing.</p>
<p>FREDERIC FEKKAI</p>
<p>Fekkai was allegedly the stylist of choice for Epstein’s sex slaves. Fekkai has never been accused of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>SARAH KELLEN</p>
<p>Roberts and other women say Kellen — who wiggled out of Florida sex charges as part of Epstein’s deal — was allegedly the sex-trafficking ring’s traffic cop. Many victims say Kellen scheduled Epstein’s sex appointments and “facilitated” the abuse.</p>
<p>GEORGE MITCHELL</p>
<p>The former senator from Maine and Senate majority leader from 1989 to 1995. Roberts claims she was trafficked to the senator, an allegation that he denies.</p>
<p>BILL RICHARDSON</p>
<p>The former governor of New Mexico, home to Epstein’s ranch. Roberts alleged in a 2016 deposition she was trafficked to the politician.</p>
