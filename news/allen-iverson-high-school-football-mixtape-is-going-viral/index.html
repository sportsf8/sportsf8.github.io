<p>Allen Iverson is one of the all-time great basketball players. But as a young high school football player, he had tremendous potential, too.</p>
<p>This Sunday marks The Answer‚Äôs 45th birthday, and clips of Iverson‚Äôs incredible football skills have been making the rounds on social media. At Bethel High School in Virginia, Iverson played quarterback, running back, defensive back, and kick returner.</p>
<p>Based on the clips below, he did a pretty good job playing all four of those positions. He demonstrates incredible elusiveness when the pocket collapses, trucks defenders when running the ball, stick-hits opposing offensive players when he‚Äôs on defense and brings the ball back a good distance on returns.</p>
<p>As a junior at Bethel, Iverson led both the football team and the basketball team to Virginia state championships. He even earned High School Player of the Year honors in both sports.</p>
<p>Allen Iverson turns 45 today and a reminder that he would have unstoppable in Madden. üé•: @timelesssports_ pic.twitter.com/Oxtte7Xp4i ‚Äî Field Yates (@FieldYates) June 7, 2020</p>
<p>Iverson wound up sticking with basketball though and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>He became a star at Georgetown, the No. 1 overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1996 NBA Draft and then an 11-time All-Star in the NBA. Iverson was inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.</p>
<p>By the looks of things, Iverson made the right choice with his sport.</p>
<p>Still, it‚Äôs fun to think about what could have been for Iverson on the gridiron. Legendary Florida State coach Bobby Bowden reportedly thinks of A.I. as the ‚Äúone that got away.‚Äù</p>
<p>I vividly remember former FSU coach Bobby Bowden telling me that Iverson was &ldquo;the one that got away.&rdquo; At that time he had Peter Warrick and Anquan Boldin was coming. But when asked Bowden said Iverson was the best high school athlete he ever saw. https://t.co/E7R2HPAbVw ‚Äî Omar Kelly (@OmarKelly) June 7, 2020</p>
<p>How good would Allen Iverson have been if he had decided to pursue football as his main sport?

<h3 id="philadelphia-76ers-should-mac-mcclung-be-on-elton-brands-radar">&ldquo;Philadelphia 76ers: Should Mac McClung be on Elton Brand‚Äôs radar?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fsection215.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F1199127147.jpeg" alt="img">

<p>After two successful seasons at Georgetown, Mac McClung has declared for the 2020 NBA Draft, but should the Philadelphia 76ers be interested?</p>
<p>Mac McClung is one of the more unique prospects in the 2020 NBA Draft.</p>
<p>A viral superstar dating all the way back to his AAU days, McClung was verified on Instagram before he took the SATs and has amassed more cumulative YouTube views than 10 year NBA veterans thanks to his high-flying feats, free-flowing style, and dozens of instantly memorable basketball mixtapes.</p>
<p>Check this one out if you‚Äôre unfamiliar, it‚Äôs pretty striking.</p>
<p>In the basketball days of yore, McClung could have parlayed his standing on the national stage into a draftable grade based on potential jersey sales alone, but in this soon-to-be-over-era of minimum age restrictions to be draftable, that proved to no longer be the case.</p>
<p>A 3-star recruit out of Gate City, Virginia, McClung was not in particularly high demand coming out of high school. Despite surpassing Allen Iverson to become the all-time leading scorer in Virginia high school basketball history, McClung received exactly two offers to play college ball, and ultimately opted to learn under Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing at Georgetown over a one-way ticket to New Brunswick, New Jersey to attend Rutgers.</p>
<p>And after two seasons in, ironically, the house that AI built, McClung has entered his name into consideration for the 2020 NBA Draft.</p>

<p>Now to be clear, McClung can ultimately return to school for his junior season at Georgetown no harm, no foul, but what if he decides to stay in? Should the Philadelphia 76ers be interested in his services?</p>
<p>I guess that depends on what the team is looking for in the draft.</p>
<p>On one hand, McClung offers a relatively impressive set of skills that the Sixers don‚Äôt have on their active roster. McClung is fast, athletic, and a certified skywalker. If paired up with a lightning-quick point guard like Ben Simmons, McClung could bring new life to the 76ers‚Äô two-man full-court offense in a way the team hasn‚Äôt really had since rising to playoff prominence in 2017.</p>
<p>Paired up with 7-foot-tall senior center Omer Yurtseven, McClung averaged 14.2 points a game over his two seasons in our nation‚Äôs capital, including an impressive 15.7 points on 13.2 field goals a game as a sophomore.</p>
<p>Depending on how things ‚Äòshake‚Äô out with the Sixers‚Äô search for a fifth starter whenever the season eventually picks back up, Brett Brown may be on the lookout for a new bench guard going into the 2020-21 season if Shake Milton becomes a full-time starter. While McClung is not going to make anyone forget about T.J. McConnell as a passer, as evidenced by his career 2.2 assists per game, he does have an ability to take over the halfcourt offense a la current-Houston Rockets reserve Austin Rivers and run the show as a point-and-shoot combo guard.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no doubt about it, McClung is an NBA player and fits pretty well into this new-era of positionless lineups predicated on shooters, but his lack of a clear role NBA role could be just as detrimental as it is helpful.</p>
<p>Unlike, say, Isaiah Washington, another former viral star and the founding member of the ‚ÄòJelly Fam‚Äò, McClung may struggle to find a consistent role in the NBA. An undersized two-guard trapped in a point guard‚Äôs body, McClung is at his best as a pick and roll basket driver, where he can shine with a wide array of fancy dunks that could make Aaron Gordon blush. Where McClung may struggle, however, is making an impact on the NBA game when the ball isn‚Äôt in his hands, due in large part to a putrid sub-.300 shooting percentage on 4.7 attempts a game from beyond the arc. He‚Äôs also rather undersized to even play point guard in the modern-NBA at 6-foot-2, 186 pounds and may struggle to become better than an average defender against legit NBA talents.</p>
<p>The 76ers aren‚Äôt exactly desperate for backcourt defenders after selecting Zhaire Smith and Matisse Thybulle in back to back drafts, but they likely won‚Äôt want to give meaningful minutes to a 20-year-old rookie without a knockdown 3 point shot or an ability to switch defensively.</p>
<p>On the off chance that the 76ers actually have a first-round pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, an outcome that will only happen if OKC‚Äôs pick falls between 20-30, McClung likely won‚Äôt be a player the Sixers specifically target, instead turning their attention to shooters regardless of position.</p>
<p>However, if McClung is still there when the Sixers are on the clock in the second round, either with the Atlanta Hawks‚Äò pick or the New York Knicks‚Äò pick, that could be a completely different story.</p>
<p>For all of his flaws as a player, there‚Äôs a ton to like about McClung as a prospect from an athletic standpoint. With one of the best developmental G-League systems in place in the new Delaware Blue Coats fieldhouse, it‚Äôs entirely possible McClung could be the next Milton, Norvel Pelle, or even 2019-20‚Äôs breakout star, Marial Shayok.</p>
<p>McClung is also the cousin of Houston based rapper Riff Raff. This has nothing to do with his basketball prowess, of course, but it‚Äôs a fun fact none the less.</p>
<p>In the late 90s, Mac McClung would have been a star, but now, his scoring guard-style is a nostalgic throwback to a bygone-era. However, if allowed to continue to develop, and become a more consistent outside shooter, there‚Äôs enough about McClung‚Äôs upside to get fans ‚Äì on Youtube and otherwise ‚Äì excited about his prospects as a prospect ‚Äì especially if the Philadelphia 76ers can lock up his services with one of their six(!?) second-round picks.

<p><img src="https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-09-at-2-59-55-pm.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
Georgetown commit Mac McClung is arguably the best leaper in a 2018 class that includes Duke-bound dunk artist Zion Williamson.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-2 prospect broke Allen Iverson‚Äôs high school scoring record and produced countless viral moments with his ridiculous in-game dunks. Despite the athleticism and scoring record, McClung is a three-star recruit and hasn‚Äôt cracked the top 200 of 247sports‚Äô national ratings.</p>
<p>That chip on his shoulder was apparent when AND1 Mixtape legend Bone Collector called out the future Hoya at the Ballislife All-American Game this weekend. Bone Collector claimed on Instagram that he would only need three dribbles to get by the kids in a one-on-one challenge. About that, though:</p>
<p>Bone Collector took two dribbles as McClung stuck by him the entire way. McClung proceeded to send the streetball star‚Äôs layup attempt into the back wall.</p>
<p>McClung celebrated the block with his own trash talk. He‚Äôs more than just a dunker, but yeah, he can dunk too.</p>

Justin Fields posted a video of his golf swing on Twitter on Tuesday night. On the surface, that‚Äôs all it was. If you dig a little deeper, though, it looks like a shot at another college football quarterback.</p>
<p>The Ohio State star posted a video of his not-great golf swing on Twitter on Tuesday evening. He posted the video with a simple caption.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGot a lot of work to do, but at least I didn‚Äôt swing and miss,‚Äù he wrote.</p>
<p>Got a lot of work to do, but at least I didn‚Äôt swing and miss. üèåüèæ pic.twitter.com/70kiCYGWmb ‚Äî Justin Fields (@justnfields) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>That seems innocent enough, right? Well, maybe not‚Ä¶</p>
<p>A little more than a year ago, Fields decided to transfer from Georgia to Ohio State. At the time of his transfer decision, Tate Martell was still on the Buckeyes‚Äô roster.</p>
<p>Martell tweeted out a not-so-subtle message for Fields before he officially decided to transfer to Columbus.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWord of advice: Don‚Äôt swing and miss ‚Äì especially not your second time,‚Äù Martell wrote.</p>
<p>The tweet was a shot at Fields, who didn‚Äôt win the starting job at Georgia right away. Martell was implying that Fields wouldn‚Äôt win the job at Ohio State, either.</p>
<p>Of course, he did. Fields led the Buckeyes to a College Football Playoff semifinal appearance. Martell transferred to Miami before Fields even arrived in Columbus.</p>
<p>So‚Ä¶was Fields‚Äô tweet last night a clap-back at Martell one year later? It looks like it:</p>
<p>And, even if it wasn‚Äôt, Ohio State fans are going to act like it was. Fields can do little wrong following his spectacular sophomore season with the Buckeyes.

<h3 id="jake-fromm-reacts-to-his-fall-in-the-2020-nfl-draft">&ldquo;Jake Fromm Reacts To His Fall In The 2020 NFL Draft&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thespun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1175264570-1024x683.jpg" alt="img">
Of all the risers and fallers in the 2020 NFL Draft, Jake Fromm‚Äôs drop was among the most surprising.</p>
<p>The former Georgia superstar was taken No. 167 overall by the Buffalo Bills in the fifth round. He was the eighth quarterback off the board, falling behind the likes of Jacob Eason and even James Morgan.</p>
<p>But Fromm is taking the Draft Weekend fall in stride. In an interview with FOX5 after being taken by the Bills, Fromm admitted that it was tough at first for his family, but he was excited just to get the phone call and get his NFL chance.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hate it a little bit more for my family than for me, the way it‚Äôs been tough,‚Äù Fromm said. ‚ÄúIt was a little longer than expected, but for me, I‚Äôm so excited and so blessed. There‚Äôs only so many people who get this opportunity to get that phone call. Beyond thankful to be here in this position. I couldn‚Äôt be any more grateful and super excited.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fromm ultimately didn‚Äôt seem to mind how things played out, basically considering it par for the course. He considers himself someone who has always been ‚Äúoverseen‚Äù and underestimated for his physical traits.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor me, my entire career, I‚Äôve always kind of been the guy left out,‚Äù Fromm said. ‚ÄúThe guy overseen. The guy who‚Äôs not tall enough, not strong enough. Can‚Äôt do this, can‚Äôt do that. For me, it‚Äôs just showing up to work and competing and doing whatever I can to help the team win. I‚Äôm super excited to get with my new teammates, build relationship and ultimately play NFL football, because that‚Äôs what the dream is about and I‚Äôm happy to be here.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Fromm made a real legacy for himself at the University of Georgia. As a freshman in 2017, he led Georgia to an SEC title and the national title game. Over the next two seasons, he would lead Georgia to two more SEC East titles.</p>
<p>Good luck in Buffalo, Jake!

<p><img src="https://thespun.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-599069972-1024x741.jpg" alt="img">
Following the close of the 2019 college football regular season, the Washington State Cougars inked head coach Mike Leach to a contract extension. The move came after Leach‚Äôs name popped up at several SEC openings, including the Arkansas Razorbacks.</p>
<p>After inking Leach to an extension, it looked like the Cougars locked up their head coach.</p>
<p>However, a new report suggests Leach is still interested in moving on from Pullman. According to a report from ESPN radio host Bo Bounds, Mississippi State athletic director John Cohen traveled to Key West this week to meet with Mike Leach.</p>
<p>Paul Finebaum revealed the news.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAD John Cohen went to Key West this week and interviewed Mike Leach for the vacant Mississippi State job,‚Äù Finebaum said.</p>
<p>According to @bobounds, AD John Cohen went to Key West this week and interviewed Mike Leach for the vacant Mississippi State job. ‚Äî Paul Finebaum (@finebaum) January 8, 2020</p>
<p>On December 5, the Washington State football program Leach‚Äôs contract extension through 2024.</p>
<p>From 2015-18, Leach led the Cougars to a 37-15 record. In 2018, the Cougars went 11-2, winning the Alamo Bowl to finish with the most single season wins in school history.</p>
<p>Washington State suffered a down season in 2019, finishing with a 6-7 record. After failing to find success in 2019, Leach could be looking to move on from the Cougars.</p>
<p>The state of Mississippi might not be able to handle Lane Kiffin and Mike Leach together.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the latest.

<h3 id="kyler-murray-asked-about-playing-both-football-baseball">&ldquo;Kyler Murray Asked About Playing Both Football, Baseball&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thespun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/kyler-murray-1024x683.jpg" alt="img">
It‚Äôs odd to think that less than a year ago, Cardinals QB Kyler Murray was pondering whether to play Major League Baseball or try his hand at pro football. With Murray a candidate for Rookie of the Year and widely considered the Cardinals‚Äô quarterback of the future, it looks like he made the right choice.</p>
<p>But that hasn‚Äôt stopped Murray from trying to follow in the footsteps of Deion Sanders and giving both a try.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Murray kept the door open for possibly playing baseball during the NFL offseason. He explained that he thinks he has the physical talent to do it and thinks it might be a fun idea.</p>
<p>Via USA Today:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAthletically, I think yeah, I could do it. I‚Äôve been playing both my whole life. I would love to add that to the resume. I don‚Äôt understand why in sports they try to marginalize it. They try to make you pick one and I get it, but we‚Äôll see. I think it would be fun. Right now, though, I‚Äôm just focused on football.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pulling off such a feat would make Murray the first athlete to be a first round pick in both the NFL and MLB, and go on to play in both. He was drafted No. 9 overall by the Oakland Athletics in 2018, and No. 1 overall by Arizona last year.</p>
<p>Though Murray may find such a move a tough sell to the Cardinals coaching staff and front office, and especially to the fanbase.</p>
<p>Murray started all 16 games for the Cardinals in 2019, completing 64.4-percent of his passes for 3,722 yards and 20 touchdowns while adding another 544 yards and four touchdowns on the ground.
