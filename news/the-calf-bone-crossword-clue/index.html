<p>The deaths left only one white giraffe remaining in the country: a bull born to the female in 2017.</p>
<p>Mohammed Ahmednoor, the manager of the Ishaqbini Hirola Community Conservancy, where the giraffes were free-ranging, said in a statement Tuesday the animals had been found “in a skeletal state.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“This is a very sad day for the community of Ijara and Kenya as a whole,” he said. “We are the only community in the world who are custodians of the white giraffe. Its killing is a blow to tremendous steps taken by the community to conserve rare and unique species, and a wakeup call for continued support to conservation efforts.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The Kenya Wildlife Service, which is investigating the deaths, said its teams had seen bones believed to be those of the two giraffes and estimated them at four months old.</p>
<p>Villagers alerted the Hirola conservancy to the presence of the giraffes in the spring of 2017 after spotting the pair walking together near the Hirola conservancy. Conservancy employees hurried to the site, where they found the pair “right in front of us.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“The mother kept pacing back and forth a few yards in front of us while signaling the baby Giraffe to hide behind the bushes — a characteristic of most wildlife mothers in the wild to prevent the predation of their young,” the group wrote in an exuberant blog post.</p>
<p>They published footage of the encounter, which racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. With their unique hides, the animals soon made international headlines.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>White giraffe sightings are rare, though they have been reported as far back as 1938, wildlife biologist Zoe Muller wrote in the African Journal of Ecology. When the mother and calf were discovered, the Hirola conservancy said it was aware of just two previous confirmed sightings, as The Washington Post reported at the time.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Their coloring appeared to be leucistic, rather than albino. Leucism causes a partial lack of pigmentation but generally does not affect an animal’s eye color.</p>
<p>“These rare snow white giraffes shocked many locals including myself but these gave us renewed energy to protect and save our unique wildlife,” Hirola Conservation Program Director Abdullahi Ali said in the organization’s blog post. He added, “We pledge to protect these beauties and their vital habitat.”</p>
<p>Last year, officials had more good news when the female giraffe gave birth to her second calf. The family of three became a tourist draw for the area, officials said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Kenya Wildlife Service said conservancy management alerted them of the missing giraffe and calf after not seeing them for some time. The agency said it was working with community rangers and the conservancy to establish what led to the deaths of the two giraffes.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The loss came as the world’s giraffe population has fallen precipitously. Considered “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are about 97,000 of them in the wild, and their numbers have declined an estimated 40 percent in the past 30 years. Last year, the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service announced it was considering adding giraffes to the endangered species list.</p>
<p>Poaching is part of the problem, with the animals prized for their tails, meat and hide, according to the African Wildlife Foundation.</p>
<p>Ahmednoor, the conservancy manager, described the deaths of the animals as a major blow.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“This is a long-term loss given that genetics studies and research which were significant investment into the area by researchers has now gone down the drain,” he said.</p>

SATURDAY PUZZLE — On first glance, I feared that I was going to just be the designated looker-upper of names and places today; there seemed to be a lot of that kind of clue. But by knowing a scant few facts, and by starting at the bottom, I made my merry way through another sprightly weekend Robyn Weintraub puzzle and wound up with a finished grid and a distinctly brighter outlook on the day. Ms. Weintraub is one of those constructors who has that gift of providing edification with minimal mortification, at least as far as my brain is concerned.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>If you knew any entry longer than five letters off the bat, I tip my hat to you, smarty pants. Maybe OVERSIZED or STICK SHIFT was gettable with no crosses, but I had only GADOT, CROC and TEA. Looking back, this puzzle was quite fair — there was deducible fill in every sector, like SOSO, ONCE, STONES, TOMB and HALLE. (Those last two took a modicum of cultural knowledge.) But none of the more substantial stuff came easily to me.</p>
<p>As far as misdirections, my personal notes included “recap” for SUM UP and that one little “N” instead of “E” that I’m sure others stumbled on — it was down a STEEP slope.</p>
<p>As always with Ms. Weintraub’s constructions, there was a generous splash of wit in the fill — clues for PEA, LAST PLACE, SCARECROWS, LISP and, my favorite, I think, SEALY. (Trust me, even if you have to click that link, it’s comedy gold.)

<h3 id="the-wild-woman-awakens">&ldquo;The Wild Woman Awakens&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/18/arts/women-wolves/women-wolves-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
I first spied the book last spring, in the lap of a vaguely witchy young woman pinched between two men on the subway. Soon the book disappeared into a woven bag, her shoulder brushed against mine, and it was as if she had initiated me into a secret club. After that, I saw the book everywhere: in the hands of a tattooed solo diner while she ate a game bird in a Texas restaurant; nestled with the new releases on female rage in a Brooklyn bookstore; on Lana Del Rey’s Instagram.</p>
<p>The book, “Women Who Run With the Wolves: Myths and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype,” by Clarissa Pinkola Estés, was first published in 1992. Its cover recalls a vintage GeoCities website: black background, underlined gold text, thumbnail-sized etching of a woman and her lupine companion. I cracked open a copy and encountered a fecund landscape: folk tales saturated with pollen, cobwebs, plums, petals, gristle, guts, “uncombed cats” and the bodies of human women.</p>
<p>Estés — a psychoanalyst, poet and cantadora, or “keeper of old stories” — draws from Jungian archetypes, hag lore and wildlife observation to build an alternative feminine mythology. She conjures images of a goddess squatting out a baby, of “the pungent odor of iron from the fresh blood of childbirth,” of the “power of the haunches” and “the spiritual placenta.” In her introduction, she explains why: “Over time, we have seen the feminine instinctive nature looted, driven back, overbuilt,” she writes. But “women’s flagging vitality can be restored by extensive ‘psychic-archeological’ digs into the ruins of the female underworld.” It is there that we might reveal “women’s deepest nature” and gain access to “the creative feminine.”</p>
<p>A generation later, “Women Who Run With the Wolves” has returned to a culture suddenly lush with primal visions of women’s bodies — dripping with blood, coursing with hormones and pulsing with pain and arousal. Accounts of menstruation, childbirth, menopause and gender transition howl through the worlds of theater and television, memoir and art. Instagram is overgrown with images of women loping naked through the woods and giving birth in living rooms, tagged #wildwoman or #witch or #laloba, the Spanish feminine for wolf. Related consumer products abound.

<h3 id="an-elephants-story-does-not-end-when-it-dies">&ldquo;An elephant’s story does not end when it dies&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NDS7PWAYUBGBZCD7MQNBX6LCCY.JPG&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
But that was not the end of Victoria’s story.</p>
<p>Several elephants huddled around the body, recalled ecologist Shifra Goldenberg, who was observing the animals with colleagues that day. She noticed that Malasso, a 14-year-old bull, was one of the last to leave. Victoria was his mother.</p>
<p>Later, when Goldenberg and other researchers examined Victoria’s body, they found two fresh cuts in her cheek and at the top of her mouth. Both seemed to have occurred after death, which was judged natural due to old age. “We think possibly [Malasso] tried to lift her, because he has these long tusks,” said Goldenberg, who works at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Another elephant to linger was a 10-year-old named Noor. She was Victoria’s youngest daughter, and when she finally plodded away, the temporal glands on each side of her head were streaming liquid: a reaction linked to stress, fear and aggression.</p>
<p>The researchers’ observations of what happened in the days and weeks after Victoria died — some of the first to document how wild elephants respond to loss over time — are described in a new review paper that examines more than 30 reports of elephant reactions to death.</p>
<p>The scientists do not conclude from these accounts that elephants mourn, an activity that is often attributed to the species. But their response has a common thread, the authors say. When an elephant falls, the loss is acknowledged and investigated by other elephants, even those unrelated to the deceased. Death means something to elephants, in other words — possibly something emotional.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“We don’t know what’s going on in their heads,” said Goldenberg, a co-author of the paper, which was published in a special, death-focused issue of the journal Primates. “But we do know that they’re constantly updating social information about each other. And their place in the social network relates to how they use the landscape, how they survive, how they reproduce.”</p>
<p>The day after Victoria’s death, many of the same elephants were back. And over the next three weeks, the researchers observed members of five families interacting with Victoria’s corpse. Some would have known Victoria by scent, if not sight, but many more would have been strangers. If this had been a wake, it would have been well-attended.</p>
<p>Some elephants touched Victoria’s body with their trunks, while others tried to lift her stiffened ears with their feet. Occasionally, the elephants performed dominance behaviors that scientists say are more typically seen around restricted resources like shady groves, cooling mud wallows or treasured fruit trees. This may suggest that the carcass wasn’t just a point of interest, but something of value — something to guard.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>One obstacle to understanding elephants’ experience — and their reaction to death — is that the animals’ world is inhabited by an array of smells we can scarcely imagine.</p>
<p>“This puts a big barrier between how we interpret what they’re perceiving and interacting with,” said co-author George Wittemyer, a conservation biologist at Colorado State University who has studied the elephants of Kenya’s Samburu National Reserve for more than 20 years. “We’re unable to see the olfactory landscape in which they’re functioning.”</p>
<p>One study found that elephants have more genes dedicated to their olfactory system than any other animal on record — more than twice as many as keen-nosed dogs. Another study found that elephants, using a combination of smell and sight, can differentiate between local human ethnic groups. Asian elephants can even rely on smell to count, sniffing out which locked bucket contains more sunflower seeds between 59 and 82 percent of the time.</p>
<p>This may explain why a bull named Omtata spent eight minutes sniffing Victoria’s body and the dirt around it. Or why the elephants continued to interact with her body even after rangers had removed the tusks to secure them from poachers, or after scavengers had reduced the carcass to skin and bones. Or why studies have found that elephants show extreme interest in skulls, jaws and other bones from their own species while paying little mind to bones from cape buffaloes or giraffes.</p>
<p>Other animals are also known to interact with their dead. The special issue of Primates explores the behavior of several species, from infanticide in chimpanzees to avoidance and vigilance in horses. Occasionally, animals make headlines for what look like displays of mourning: In 2018, Tahlequah, a Pacific Northwest orca, swam carrying the corpse of her dead calf for 17 days.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But elephants are different, because they are much bigger than most animals, which means their bodies take a very long time to decompose. A dead capuchin monkey might be eaten overnight, and a whale’s body will eventually float away or sink. But an elephant skull could sit in roughly the same place for years.</p>
<p>The same is true of elephant tusks, which are important focal points for elephants. Goldenberg and Wittemyer documented an elephant carrying a disarticulated tusk for more than three miles.</p>
<p>“They are touching each other’s tusks all the time,” said Goldenberg, who is also a research fellow with San Diego Zoo Global’s Institute for Conservation Research. “And they tend to show disproportionate interest in tusks relative to other bones.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Joyce Poole, who contributed observations reviewed in the new paper, doesn’t shy away from attributing emotion to what she has witnessed. In an interview, she recalled watching a female named Polly die before her eyes in Kenya.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“She just sort of tipped over, spun around on a tusk, and fell. Her legs kind of went up in the air, and boom, that was it,” said Poole, scientific director for the conservation and education nonprofit ElephantVoices.</p>
<p>The first elephants to find her body were a trio of young, unrelated males. They spent upward of an hour trying to lift Polly and pulling on her tail and tusks before eventually mounting her, said Poole. That night, rangers removed Polly’s tusks.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Poole said she returned the next day to check on the body and was amazed to again find three elephants loitering around Polly, including one that had been there the day before.</p>
<p>“They were just standing over her body where her face had been hacked out, where her tusks had been. And they were touching her bloody face,” Poole said. “It was pretty unsettling, in the sense that it was clear to me that they knew that people had hacked her face off.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Another time, also in Kenya, Poole watched as a female named Tonie tried again and again to get her stillborn calf to stand. “She stood over that calf and protected it from hyenas and from jackals for a couple of days,” she said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The list of examples goes on. But the question of what to make of those responses is still very much up for debate.</p>
<p>“As this paper shows, where there are elephants being intensively observed, there is clear recognition of behavioral responses to loss,” said Phyllis Lee, an evolutionary behaviorist at the University of Stirling in Scotland who has also seen similar behaviors in the wild. “Loss is a phenomenon common to sentient animals, including humans.”</p>
<p>For Wittemyer, the loss of Victoria — an elephant he followed for decades — came with a kind of unexpected joy.</p>
<p>People who study elephants spend a lot of time worrying about poaching, he said. But Victoria had led a long, rich life.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Certainly, it’s sad. But this is what we would hope for, that elephants can live out their lives and die peacefully, in an area where they’re not being hunted,” said Wittemyer, chairman of the scientific board of the Kenya-based Save The Elephants. “We got to watch her die naturally, in a beautiful part of the park, with her family around her.”

<h3 id="asian-elephants-perceive-distress-and-also-respond-to-it-say-researchers">&ldquo;Asian elephants perceive distress and also respond to it, say researchers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/d26ql6/article29483447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG0530-Sanjeeta-Sharma" alt="img">
Even though there are a few anecdotal accounts about Asian elephants’ reaction to death in connection with members of their herd, scientists have for the first time observed and recorded the behavior of free-ranging Asian elephants towards dying and dead elephants.</p>
<p>The paper titled Behavioural responses of free-ranging Asian elephants (elephas maximus) towards dying or dead conspecifics, (conspecifics refers to member of same species) was published in the Springer group of publications earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the publication researchers observed that the elephants showed behaviours like exploratory (sniffing and inspecting) and epimeletic (supporting the distressed animals) or physically helping supporting dying calves.</p>
<p>“We also recorded high frequency vocalisation (trumpets) by an adult female in the case of dying calves. Our observations indicate that, like their African counterparts, Asian elephants might experience distress in response to death of conspecifics and may have some awareness of death,” the paper authored by Nachiketha Sharma, Sanjeeta Sharma Pokharel, Shiro Kohshima and Raman Sukumar states.</p>
<p>Through the publication scientists have observed and recorded three specific cases of elephants responding to injured, dying or dead conspecifics.</p>
<p>“Two of the three cases involved adult female calf pair and involved epimeletic or helping behavior towards the injured and dying calves. In all three cases, exploratory and approach/visit behaviours towards the dying and dead individuals were observed,” the scientists record in the paper.</p>
<p>Well-known ecologist from the Indian Institute of Science and elephant expert Raman Sukumar who has contributed to the paper said that from the evolutionary biology perspective these behaviours of elephants appear as an adaptive feature. “We are just beginning to understand this, especially the calf deaths because those are not easy to observe in the wild. The whole social cognitive makeup of the elephant, these kinds of significant emotions are a part of this framework,” he said.</p>

<p>Prof. Sukumar said that in the case of African elephants a behaviour was observed which involves taking interest in the bones of other elephants. “But that kind of behavior has not been observed in Asian elephants so far,” the scientist said.</p>
<p>In the nine-page long publication, the first example which the scientists cite in this context is of a reaction to a dying calf from an adult female elephant Sita and her two daughters (S1 10-15 years and S2 5-10 years) from Mudumalai National Park in October 2012.</p>
<p>“The three females surrounded the calf with their legs. S1 sniffed the calf, while Sita gently kicked with her forelegs in an attempt to make it stand. S1 and S2 joined Sita to help,” the scientists observed. During the entire period of observations of 506 minutes which included the subsequent day when the calf died, no signs of agitation or aggression were observed from Sita and her daughters and no vocalisations were heard. The scientists observed very little movement from Sita when she was with her calf.</p>
<p>The Forest Department also provided drinking water to the elephants in a large steel container but only Sita drank. She also showed no signs of aggression when the scientists approached the calf. The death of the new born calf was possibly due to dehydration and malnourishment.</p>
<p>In the case of another adult elephant F1 (15 to 20 years old) the reaction to an injured and dying calf appeared to be somewhat different. These observations were recorded in March 2017 when a lone male calf less than a year old rested against the trunk of a dead tree. “The calf stayed in the same position after falling, while F1 touched and sniffed the calf&rsquo;s genital region. F1 blew saliva on herself through her trunk and stood next to the calf, touching it repeatedly. She used her forelegs to encourage the calf to stand on its feet but without much success,” Mr. Sharma said.</p>
<p>Scientists also recorded that when a veterinary team arrived F1 remained vigilant, mock charged the team and displayed body guarding behaviour. In the observation that lasted about 322 minutes, F1 stood vigilant when the veterinary team did an autopsy and during cremation. The cause of death appeared to be injury sustained in a predatory attack by a tiger. Another observation made by the team of researchers is that F1 might not have been mother to the calf as it was still in suckling age and the female showed no signs of lactation.</p>
<p>Commenting on the variability among Asian elephants in response to injured or incapacitated conspecifics the scientists behind the paper observed that age and previous experiences with dying individuals may, therefore, influence the behavioral response of Asian elephants to dying conspecifics.</p>
<p>“Sita, being older than F1, may have greater experience in observing the death of conspecifics and would have interacted with people far more than F1, thus she might have not shown aggression towards the observers,” Dr. Pokharel said, referring to the paper.</p>
<p>The third instance which the publication cites is post-mortem observation (reaction to dead old female from F2 and F3 both 30-40 years old ). These observations to a dead female elephant were recorded in March 2013. A fresh carcass was sighted on the banks of the Kabini reservoir and by the time researchers arrived there with forest officials they found two female elephants at the site. “Two female elephants F2 and F3 were near the carcass. F2 was walking in a circular path while F3 was grazing near the carcass. During her circular movements, F2 did not appear to sniff towards carcass, her trunk stayed low. She did not appear to touch the carcass either by trunk or foot,” the paper said. Meanwhile, the cause of death was deemed to be chronic gastrointestinal infection.</p>
<p>Emphasising that the study shows that Asian elephants perceive distress and respond to dying conspecifcs, the authors of the publication said that the most common thanatological (a branch of behavioural science that deals with death or how animals perceive death) responses they observed was epimeletic response, body guarding, approach, inspection, visiting tactile (touch with legs and trunks) and vocalisations. The paper also suggested carrying out future studies for better comprehensions of thanantological responses in Asian elephants to decode their response to distress, injuries and death in genetically related and unrelated individuals.

<h3 id="column-michael-jordans-last-dance-roots-connect-with-carlsbads-upper-deck">&ldquo;Column: Michael Jordan’s ‘Last Dance’ roots connect with Carlsbad’s Upper Deck&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/78632d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4368x2293+0+309/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fca%2Fc3%2F262c440a416292e33019bd01bd00%2Fmj3.jpg" alt="img">
Maybe it was the call from the office of the U.S. Ambassador in Sweden, hunting a signed Michael Jordan poster. Maybe it was the inquiry from Bahrain, wondering about shipping costs of an M.J. jersey to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Maybe it was traffic for Jordan-related pages on Upper Deck’s website jumping 90 percent or social media chatter related to His Airness spiking 375 percent. Maybe it was related sales for the Carlsbad company surging roughly five-fold.</p>
<p>The impact Jordan had on the court as the most iconic basketball player in history extends far from the basket, then and still. Interest is ablaze as the finish line nears for the docu-series “The Last Dance,” a 10-episode peek behind the curtain of his time with the Chicago Bulls that wraps Sunday (6 p.m., ESPN).</p>
<p>Whatever clue confirmed the phenomena, Upper Deck executive Chris Carlin said it’s clear how many are rushing to soak up the NBA time machine.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“There’s absolutely a ‘Last Dance’ impact, for sure,” Carlin said.</p>
<p>The local company that produces trading cards and sells high-end memorabilia assembled a who’s-who roster of sports superstars, from Wayne Gretzky to Tiger Woods, Serena Williams and LeBron James. No one moves the needle — or merchandise — quite like Jordan, the cultural icon who signed an exclusive deal with Upper Deck in 1992.</p>
<p>With “The Last Dance,” the needle is quivering.</p>
<p>“It’s a reminder of his greatness,” Upper Deck President Jason Masherah said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Another hint of it: Since the series began, the company has sold multiple, signed Legends of Sports prints featuring Jordan, Woods and Muhammad Ali … for $35,000 a pop.</p>
<p>Then again, they already had the Underwear Barometer. Upper Deck partnered with Hanes, Jordan’s longtime undergarment, to make trading cards harkening back to the brand’s light-hearted commercials featuring Jordan. The promotion was timed to the 2019 NCAA Tournament.</p>
<p>People lost their ever-lovin’ marbles.</p>
<p>“We slipped cards into the packs of underwear and some of them were signed,” Masherah said. “People were buying like two years’ worth of underwear. They were grabbing entire skids of them just to get the trading cards. It was amazing.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The series shot interest into the stratosphere. Upper Deck has fielded calls from China, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom and more. Phones jammed with those trying to confirm items purchased on secondary markets were authentic.</p>
<p>That’s easy for Upper Deck, which logs signature dates, hologram technology numbers and other details to track and verify its memorabilia.</p>
<p>They’re so plugged into all things Jordan-signature related that Upper Deck can tell you if you flip one sideways the ‘M’ in his first name becomes his jersey number 23. The superstar has been with Upper Deck and only Upper Deck for nearly three decades.</p>
<p>“Michael takes great pride in his signature,” Masherah said. “When he shows up, it’s go time. There’s no screwing around. He wants to do it right. He wants to make sure the quality is there. If he thinks a piece is not up to his standards, there’s a crease in a card, the marker ink isn’t right, he’ll reject it.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“The intensity and attention to detail he shows on the court is the same he shows with the memorabilia.”</p>
<p>Sounds like the Jordan portrayed in the series, without a doubt.</p>
<p>The relationship and loyalty between the player and company makes a subtle appearance as cameras rolled. When approached for an autograph in France, Jordan declined. That’s purposeful.</p>
<p>“He’ll take care of sick kids, kids at camps or whatever,” Masherah said. “But other than Upper Deck, he doesn’t really sign autographs. From a branding standpoint, Michael and his team realized there’s something to be said for making them high end and super limited.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Roots run deeper than just business, however.</p>
<p>Jordan’s brother, Larry, who is prominently featured in the series, worked at Upper Deck from 1998-2011.</p>
<p>“My favorite Larry story was early on,” Masherah said. “We had a sales meeting in a conference room. In the corner of the room, there was a Michael Jordan (stand-up). It just randomly fell over on Larry. It was like Michael’s presence was in the room and he attacked his brother.”</p>
<p>Touching a corner of Jordan’s life, real or otherwise, translates to staggering dollars. In February, a rare Upper Deck card featuring Jordan and LeBron James with an NBA logo patch and pieces of game-worn jerseys from the players sold for a record $900,000 at a private auction.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Michael’s cards have gone absolutely ballistic over the last six months,” Masherah said. “The value of those have just exploded.”</p>
<p>Jordan isn’t the only one dancing.

<h3 id="all-the-worlds-a-stage-for-san-diegans-viral-sofa-shakespeare-project">&ldquo;All the world’s a stage for San Diegan’s viral Sofa Shakespeare project&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da7fb1d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2Fe8%2F74062abd40d2a35b4ee014857ff5%2Ftitus-andronicus-india.png" alt="img">
On March 14, Julia Giolzetti was juggling three jobs as a touring theater artist, an after-school program teacher and an actor in rehearsals for a play. Then the tidal wave of COVID-19-related closures swept through San Diego and she lost all three positions overnight.</p>
<p>To keep herself creatively engaged while staying at home, Giolzetti got an idea. On March 15, she posted a proposal on Facebook asking other out-of-work local actors for help creating a compilation video of everyone reading different one-minute snippets of William Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” that she would edit together into the full-length play.</p>
<p>Initially, the married San Diego mom hoped she’d get enough submitted video clips to complete the play. But, appropriate to the times we’re in, the post went viral. Within 24 hours, 800 emails flooded in from all over the country. In the five weeks since, her post has been shared more than 4,000 times. Giolzetti has been working up to 18 hours a day, managing and editing more than 500 cellphone-filmed submissions that have arrived from all 50 states, 22 countries and in multiple foreign languages.</p>

<p>Over the past month, Giolzetti has completed films for four full-length Shakespeare plays: “Romeo and Juliet,” “Twelfth Night,” “Titus Andronicus” and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Two more, “Henry V” and “Macbeth,” are in the editing stages.</p>
<p>In her instructions, she insisted performers use the Bard’s words exactly as they were written 400 years ago. But she gave them free rein to perform the lines in whatever style or language they wish.</p>
<p>A fast-forward through Giolzetti’s now-completed plays on her sofashakespeare.com website reveals performers ranging from barely verbal toddlers to Tony Award-winning actors playing scenes staged with sock and shadow puppets, Legos, dogs and cats, hand-drawn animation, Star Wars action figures, Muppets, chalk stick figures and paper cutout designs. There’s a whole family in costume with foam swords and capes, an actor reading lines in Fozzie Bear’s voice, another performing in an inflatable T-Rex costume and a quartet playing a scene together via the Zoom meeting app.</p>
<p>Among the local actors who submitted a film for the project is Lance Arthur Smith of Oceanside, who created a crowd scene from “Titus Andronicus” with his daughter, Pepper, and her L.O.L. Surprise dolls.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“When I first heard about it I thought, ‘Who’s going to contribute a minute of Shakespeare?’ But the response was overwhelming. That made me very happy,” Smith said. “The beauty and joy of it is seeing how it’s interpreted. Because he was such a brilliant writer, there is always another angle in his words that you haven’t thought of. It’s so great seeing all these people celebrating Shakespeare and putting their own spin on it.”</p>
<p>While the humorous submissions make watching the films fun, there are plenty of serious and moving performances by both novice and professional actors, including a piece by married Tony winners Joanna Gleason and Chris Sarandon, who verbally joust with stuffed animals as Sirs Andrew and Toby in “Twelfth Night.”</p>
<p>Having devoted much of her professional career to performing and teaching Shakespeare, Giolzetti said she hopes the videos will make the playwright’s Elizabethan language less daunting for audiences of all ages and theater tastes.</p>
<p>Born and raised in San Diego, Giolzetti’s first exposure to Shakespeare was at age 4 when her mom let her watch Franco Zeffirelli’s 1968 film version of “Romeo and Juliet.” She read the play for the first time in third grade, and by age 12 she was performing in Shakespeare plays at San Diego Junior Theatre. After playing Juliet in her senior year at Scripps Ranch High School in 2004, she moved to New York to study drama at the Stella Adler Studio through the New York University Tisch School of the Arts.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Over the next 12 years, she performed in more than a dozen Shakespeare plays at theaters in New York and abroad, including in an all-female troupe who alternated roles in “The Tempest.” She also spent two years in the company of New York’s Drunk Shakespeare show, where audiences pay to watch a tipsy actor attempt to perform Shakespeare scenes.</p>
<p>Since the central appeal for Drunk Shakespeare audiences is watching actors struggle to deliver their lines rather than the lines themselves, Giolzetti said she worked hard to engage crowds at a deeper level.</p>
<p>“We’d get people there to see actors get drunk. I get it, it was a very fun party to have. But I would always challenge those people by telling them they’d see some Shakespeare and they might surprise themselves by enjoying it, as long as they got the context of the words,” she said.</p>
<p>In 2016, she and her husband, Jason Schalz, moved to San Diego, where their daughter Rosalind, named after Shakespeare’s heroine in “As You Like It,” was born 2-1/2 years ago. For the past three years, Giolzetti has toured schools with Intrepid Theatre’s Shakespeare education troupe, has volunteered for the San Diego Shakespeare Society and has performed several roles onstage.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>She said there are two major reasons she loves Shakespeare. One is because his timeless characters so perfectly reflect who we are as a species. The second is how thoughtfully he wrote for the actor.</p>
<p>“Shakespeare’s ability to speak to the human condition is greater than I have found in any other playwright,” she said. “I always find when I come back and read the sentence structure he uses and the placement of consonants, it’s as if he’s leaving clues for the actors. It’s almost like he’s sitting right next to you whispering in your ear.”
