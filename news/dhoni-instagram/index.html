<p>Ravindra Jadeja took to Instagram to share a picture of former India captain MS Dhoni. Jadeja, who plays under MS Dhoni for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League (IPL), wrote a few words to describe the picture and called the former India skipper his big brother. &ldquo;Tumhari nazron mein humne dekha &hellip; ajab si chhahat jalak rahi hai @mahi7781 #bigbrother #rajputboys,&rdquo; Jadeja captioned the image on Instagram. In the picture, Dhoni can be seen looking at a photo of Jadeja where the all-rounder is celebrating his performance where he bagged three wickets for 18 runs against Royal Challengers Bangalore in IPL 2018.</p>
<p>Soon after the all-rounder posted the picture, fans flooded the comments section with messages for Dhoni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one king in cricket @mahi7781,&rdquo; a fan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss m.s dhoni,&rdquo; another one joined in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best captain &amp; wk @mahi7781 , best fielder &amp; all-rounder @royalnavghan,&rdquo; a user praised both Dhoni and Jadeja.</p>
<p>Jadeja, much like other cricketers, has been active on social media during the ongoing forced break from the game due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Jadeja posted a picture of him with Virat Kohli and tried to troll the India captain over their disagreement on a DRS call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dekho bhai meine nai bola hai review lene <a href="mailto:ko@virat.kohli">ko@virat.kohli</a> #DRS #skipper,&rdquo; Jadeja had captioned his post.</p>
<p>In reply, Kohli came up with a cheeky reply and said that the all-rounder&rsquo;s doubts pop-up after he goes for a DRS call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tujhe toh hamesha out hi lagta hai. Review lene ke baad sab doubts aate hain tujhe,&rdquo; Kohli left a comment with a laughing emoji.</p>
<p>However, it was Jadeja who took the cake with a cheeky reply of his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ab 15 seconds k baad bataunga,&rdquo; Jadeja replied.</p>
<p>If a team wants to challenge the on-field decision, they get 15 seconds to make up their mind on whether they want to go for a DRS call or not.

<p>While fans praised MS Dhoni on Chahal&rsquo;s tweet, Kuldeep Yadav took to Instagram to react to Chahal&rsquo;s post.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old leg spinner has been quite active on social media during the forced break from cricket due to the coronavirus pandmeic.</p>
<p>Recently, Chahal trolled Chris Gayle on Instagram when the West Indies batsman tried to take a cheeky dig at the India spinner.</p>
<p>Chahal had posted a video of him bowling an impressive leg-spinner to knock over Martin Guptill&rsquo;s off stump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You overstepped the line, No ball!! Umpire,&rdquo; Gayle left a comment on Chahal&rsquo;s post.</p>
<p>Chahal, who has played alongside Gayle in Indian Premier League during the left-hander&rsquo;s stint with Royal Challengers Bangalore, hilariously took a cheeky dig Gayle for his comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;haha uncle still last night effect?&rdquo; Chahal replied.

Sakshi Dhoni explained why MS Dhoni had distanced himself from social media during the lockdown. (Photo credit: Instagram/Sakshi Dhoni)</p>
<p>Key Highlights MS Dhoni has been inactive on social media throughout the lockdown The Ranchi superstar has made appearances on Instagram in videos posted by Sakshi Sakshi revealed why Dhoni has maintained a low-profile throughout the lockdown</p>
<p>During the lockdown, while most members of the Indian cricket team have made their presence felt on social media through several interactive sessions, MS Dhoni, the most loved Indian cricketer from the current generation, has kept a low-profile on all social media platforms. The Ranchi superstar has been spotted on Instagram, thanks to Sakshi Dhoni – who has been pretty active on social media.</p>
<p>Throughout the lockdown, Sakshi has shared many videos from Dhoni’s farmhouse in Ranchi – where fans spotted the former Indian captain. In a first, Sakshi also made her Instagram debut - where she went live on Chennai Super Kings’ (CSK) social media account. While Sakshi spoke on several topics, the fans did not get to see Dhoni and Sakshi also explained why Dhoni had maintained a low-profile on social media during the lockdown.</p>
<p>“You know Mahi, how he is. Mahi won&rsquo;t come and talk on Insta live. He has had pressure to post videos on Coronavirus and all but he hasn&rsquo;t because if your PM has said something, you jolly well follow it. And nobody is bigger than your PM right now in the country. This is the reason why he hasn&rsquo;t come and stated anything on social media,” Sakshi said during the session.</p>
<p>For the fans who were expecting Dhoni to make an appearance during the live session, Sakshi said, “Knowing Mahi, they are crazy about him. They will know that he has always kept a low profile on social media. Look at his Instagram, like how many pictures has he posted.”</p>
<p>In the session that lasted 30 minutes, Sakshi spoke on several topics, including her first impression of Dhoni and when did the two meet. While Dhoni has been on a sabbatical from international cricket since India’s semi-final loss against New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup, social media was once again flooded with rumours of his retirement as #DhoniRetires became one of the top trends on Twitter recently. Sakshi expressed her anger at rumours in a tweet and deleted it later.</p>
<p>Recalling the trends, Sakshi added, &ldquo;He has had zero presence on social media during this lockdown, I don&rsquo;t know where these things come from. I just don&rsquo;t know.”</p>
<p>Listen to @SaakshiSRawat spill the beans on Mahi’s absence from social media. Also hear what they’ve planned to do post the lockdown.#Sakshi #MSDhoni @ChennaiIPL pic.twitter.com/XTSQV6AwvV — MS Dhoni Fans Official (@msdfansofficial) June 4, 2020</p>
<p>When asked what would the couple do after the lockdown, Sakshi said the two plan to visit Uttarakhand if there&rsquo;s no cricket scheduled. Sakshi also revealed that Dhoni loves snow and wasn&rsquo;t fond of beaches which is why they would visit the hills and plan to stay in small villages.</p>
<p>In the videos shared by Sakshi, Dhoni, who is known for his love for bikes, was spotted giving bike rides to daughter Ziva inside the farmhouse. Dhoni also recently added a tractor to his collection - a video of which was shared by CSK on social media.

Yuzvendra Chahal is quite active on Instagram and never fails to entertain his fans with funny posts and amusing comments on someone else&rsquo;s post. On Sunday, when MS Dhoni&rsquo;s wife Sakshi did an Instagram Live chat with Rupha Ramani on Chennai Super Kings' handle, Yuzvendra Chahal made frequent appearances with lovable messages for the former India captain. &ldquo;Mahanadhi Shankar for #Thala Ajith, @yuzi_chahal23 for #Thala Dhoni! #WhatteyFan,&rdquo; CSK captioned the screenshot of Yuzvendra Chahal&rsquo;s comments on Sakshi Dhoni&rsquo;s live chat.</p>
<p>Chahal wrote &lsquo;Thalla&rsquo;, &lsquo;Thalla one more time&rsquo;, &lsquo;Mahi, Mahi&hellip;&rsquo; and &lsquo;CSK + emotions = Mahi Bhai (Thalla)&rsquo; in the comments section. He also asked for the whereabouts of MS Dhoni as he commented: &ldquo;Hello bhabhi where&rsquo;s Mahi bhai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the chat, Sakshi opened up about her tweet that put an end to the rumours regarding MS Dhoni&rsquo;s retirement.</p>
<p>Recently, #DhoniRetires started trending on Twitter and Sakshi decided to clear the air with a tweet saying that the lockdown had made people &ldquo;mentally unstable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only rumours ! I understand Lockdown has made people mentally unstable ! #DhoniRetires Get a life,&rdquo; read her tweet, which she later deleted.</p>
<p>Sakshi said she got to know about the hashtag from one of her close friends and that is when she decided to quash the rumours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of my friends messaged me asked me what is going on? That hashtag (#DhoniRetires) has been trending since afternoon. I was like what is it, then I don&rsquo;t know something happened to me and it happened (the tweet) I deleted it, but the job was done, the message was put out,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Sakshi also spoke on what Dhoni has been doing during this coronavirus-enforced lockdown, revealing that he has assembled seven bikes.

Indian cricketers MS Dhoni and Ravindra Jadeja share a good bond with each other. The duo plays together for the Indian team and IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings. Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings in 2012 and since then he has proved to be a vital player for the team.</p>
<p>Since there is a lockdown in the country, cricketers are locked in their houses. As a result, they are spending more time on social media connecting with their friends and family. Ravindra Jadeja is no exception. He is posting funny things about his teammates on Instagram. He posted a picture of MS Dhoni staring at his poster. The thing which caught the attention of the netizens was the poetic caption added by Jadeja.</p>
<p>The cricketer wrote for Dhoni, “Tumhari nazron mein humne dekha … ajab si chhahat jalak rahi hai????@mahi7781 #bigbrother #rajputboys,”</p>
<p>A few days back, Jadeja had taken a friendly jibe at the current Indian team skipper Virat Kohli. Posting a picture of Virat and himself, Jadeja had written, “Dekho bhai meine nhi bola hai review lene ko @virat.kohli #DRS #skipper”</p>
<p>MS Dhoni last donned the Indian jersey in 2019 World Cup</p>
<p>Former Indian captain MS Dhoni was expected to return to the match field during the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League. He was last seen playing for India against New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup semi-finals. However, India lost that match and was out of the tournament. Since then MS had made himself unavailable for selection in the Indian team.</p>
<p>Dhoni plays for the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings and was practicing to lead the team again this season. He had also started practicing for the cash-rich league with his CSK teammates in Chepauk. However, the spread of the deadly coronavirus has halted all the sporting events across the world. This also means that the fans would have to wait for a long time to see MS Dhoni play again.
