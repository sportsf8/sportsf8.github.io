<p>The Fenian scare of 1866, and later in 1870, did more to galvanize the British North American provinces into forming a confederation than any other factor. Huron County’s exposed shoreline was particularly vulnerable to attack and in early June 1866 news of an imminent raid on Goderich sparked a “Fenian Fever”, which drew over 1,000 militiamen to Goderich to defend against an attack.</p>
<p>Although the attack on Goderich never materialized, a generation later men still took pride in answering the call to defend their homes when the Fenian crisis seemed dire.</p>
<p>It only took 32 years but in 1898 the British War Office announced that a general service medal would be awarded to British soldiers and Canadian militiamen called out for active service to repel the Fenian invasion. In Huron County, there were at least 55 known Huron veterans who qualified.</p>
<p>However, after 32 years it was difficult to know for certain how many Fenian veterans were still living and where they lived. As early as February 1897, a year before the medal was struck, an effort was made in Goderich to form a Fenian Veterans Association of Huron County. A meeting was called at the Huron Hotel to register the aging Fenian veterans from the Goderich area. An impressive number – 17 artillerymen of the Goderich Garrison Artillery and 16 from the Huron Rifle company ­– attended the meeting. The Huron Signal speculated that the veterans should organize a “monster parade’ to commemorate the June 1866 scare, with veterans living under canvas to add authenticity to the event. There is no record of a second meeting.</p>
<p>At the height of Canada’s military-imperial era before the Great War, the Fenian medal was a highly-prized trophy. Controversy raged throughout 1899 on who qualified for the medal and who did not. The medal itself was the size of a 50-cent piece. Queen Victoria’s image adorned the medal’s face and the Red Ensign surrounded by a maple leaf wreath emblazoned with the word Canada is on the reverse side.</p>
<p>Minister of Militia, Frederick Borden, suggested that the red and white bars on the medal’s ribbon might serve as Canada’s official colours. A clasp with Fenian Raid 1866 was attached to the ribbon. A rare second clasp with was reserved for those who served in the 1870 Fenian campaign.</p>
<p>On Jan. 22, 1900, the Clinton News Record reported that the medals had arrived at the London Militia District from England and were ready for distribution. One distinguished recipient was Prince Arthur, Queen Victoria’s seventh child and future Governor-General, who earned the medal for his service in Montreal’s Queen’s Own Rifle Brigade, which repelled the Fenian raid at Eccles Hill in 1870. A royal recipient of the Fenian medal heightened the medal’s status as a highly coveted prize.</p>
<p>It was originally intended that medals would be mailed to recipients or presented in low key military ceremonies, but that was not to be. In October 1899, the British Empire went to war with South Africa. As the Canada debated its participation in the Boer War, public medal presentations would become a useful means to bolster support for Canada’s overseas war effort.</p>
<p>Many Huron County veterans like Hugh Elliott of Brussels and Robert McCord of Exeter chose to have their medals sent by post. In February 1900, W. R Lough, the Clinton Public School principal, was the town’s first medal recipient for his service in the Prescott battalion in Eastern Ontario. Although Lough’s was mailed to him, he showed off his “precious treasure” to an awed school population.</p>
<p>In Carlow, Colonel John Varcoe, commander of the 33rd (Huron) Battalion gave out the medals to several Colborne Township men at a patriotic concert held in February. The Carlow hall was filled to capacity to hear speeches and patriotic songs at the presentation. One medal recipient was J.J. Wright, the Point Farm Hotel proprietor, who delivered a stirring address honouring those who “in life’s early years bore arms in defence of fair Canada,” according to the Huron Signal.</p>
<p>At Seaforth’s Cardno Hall, an elaborate ‘Veterans’ Concert’ took place on March 16 to raise money for the 33rd battalion band. The Huron Expositor reported that the “programme was a long one” but the large audience was “a most enthusiastic one.” The veterans of ’66 received a “great ovation” when marched onto the stage and were “very proud of the medals presented to them.” Seaforth Mayor J. Wilson, himself a veteran of ’66, chaired the meeting. With tongue-in-cheek, the Expositor listed the 12 “scarred and weather beaten” Fenian veterans who received their medals from Colonel Varcoe.</p>
<p>Huron County’s most extravagant medal presentation was staged on Feb. 23, 1900 at Goderich’s Victoria Opera House. As Canadians were engaged in the Battle for Paardeburg in South Africa, the Goderich Collegiate Institute cadets enacted what the Goderich Star called “A Brilliant Military Event.” The programme was an impressive martial display of cadet drilling while marine cadets executed a cutlass drill that greatly aroused the packed house.</p>
<p>The evening’s military tone can be gleaned from musical selections such as “We’re Britons None the Less, Sir,” “Rule Britannia” and “Soldiers of the Queen.” A tableau of Red Cross nurses attended wounded soldiers and an apparition of an angel over a slain stirred the audience’s emotions. The evening’s highlight was the medal presentation to each of the veterans who were each escorted onto the stage with a cadet on each side. Among them was Capt. A.M. McGregor who had laid chains across the Goderich harbour mouth to keep out Fenian vessels.</p>
<p>Colonel Varcoe gave what the Huron Signal called a ‘neat speech’ about the ‘troublous times of 1866′. However, it was Mr. R Holmes, MP, who paid the greatest ‘tribute to the men of ‘66,” and “spoke feelingly of the sons of Canada who had lately shed their blood under an African sun for the Empire’s cause.”</p>
<p>Eloise Skimings, writing for the Clinton New Era, wrote that the evening ended when the cadets raised three cheers for the Queen and the veterans of ’66. One of the veterans, Frank Jordan, “was so enthused that he struck up on his own accord God Save the Queen” which brought the gallery to its feet in a rousing chorus. Skimings had a personal interest in the story as she received a medal for her brother, Lieutenant Richard Skimings, who died from tuberculosis as a direct result of his service on the Sarnia frontier in 1866.</p>
<p>Although the Fenian scare of 1866 was a bloodless affair, it bound the country together into the Dominion of Canada. In all, over 16,000 medals were awarded to British and Canadian soldiers. Today, they are a rarity for medal collectors and command high prices at auction.</p>
<p>For many of the Goderich medal recipients, they earned it on active duty within sight of their town’s church steeples. Although it took 32 years since the first Fenian incursion, the medal was an important marker on Canada’s path the nationhood.

<p><img src="https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/newmarkettoday/images/historical-images/2019-01-18-haines-bust-front-view.jpg;w=580;h=594;mode=crop" alt="img">
In this week&rsquo;s Remember This?, History Hound Richard MacLeod shares the story behind Newmarket’s role in the 1899-1902 Boer War fought between the British Empire and South African Republic and Orange Free State</p>
<p>The story behind Newmarket’s connection with the Boer War isn’t well known.</p>
<p>In 1899, Great Britain declared war on the Boers in South Africa. At once, Lt. Col. T.H. Lloyd of Newmarket, commanding the 12th Battalion, York Rangers, offered their services and a cablegram of acceptance was received from the Imperial War Office shortly afterward.</p>
<p>At that time, a branch of the Red Cross was first organized in Newmarket, its patron was the Hon. E. J. Davis and it continued until the end of the First World War, at which time the charter was handed in.</p>
<p>The mayor and council created a committee to organize a patriotic concert to raise money for the benefit of the men who had gone off to South Africa and their families, and to distribute medals to the Volunteers of the Fenian Raid.</p>
<p>When word came of the victory at Pretoria, a local holiday was granted, the citizens band engaged in preparation for a grand celebration. Rockets were procured for a magnificent display visible from the old dam that was partly composed of a platform with a railing extended over the water.</p>
<p>On the platform, the band was stirring the fervor with patriotic music. The box of rockets and other fireworks had been set upon this platform and the first rocket was set off. Unfortunately, it was thrown backwards and exploded among the remaining rockets. An uproar ensued as a great geyser of colourful combustion went up. Bedlam reigned.</p>
<p>Members of the band were thrown into the water where, clinging to their instruments, they floundered. One rocket shot through the drum, ripping the heel from the shoe of the drummer. And still the fireworks continued.</p>
<p>A portion of the dam was damaged but though the bandsmen received a thorough ducking, no lives were lost. I am sure it must have been unanimous that of the many celebrations staged throughout Canada, those of Newmarket must have been unique.</p>
<p>As each boy returned from the war, a reception and banquet were held, each soldier was presented with a gold watch and $100. T.H. Brunton acknowledged how thankful he was that his son had come home, but his thoughts were with the parents of Wesley Haines, who would never return.</p>
<p>Wesley had died of enteric fever and his remains are with other Canadians who fill South African graves. Private Haines had enlisted in the Royal Regiment of Canada in the first contingent.</p>
<p>It was thanks to Mr. A.R. Watson that a memorial was erected to young Private Haines. He sparked the idea in September 1900 and a meeting was called. Mayor Cane presided, assisted by C.G. Ross, manager of the Ontario Bank, and L.G. Jackson, editor of the Newmarket Era.</p>
<p>Mr. Watson outlined his plan to erect a tablet in the public school, but Mr. Jackson suggested that a monument be set up in the public cemetery. It was decided in the end to set up a monument on the waterworks lawn.</p>
<p>The public were asked to subscribe, the money to be collected by the Ontario Bank. In January 1901, there was a good response, the total amount being $305.61 and further funds were obtained from a financially successful patriotic concert.</p>
<p>As far as I have been able to ascertain, Wesley Haines, William Brock, Harold Brunton, W.J. Hartford and Thomas Mills were the boys from Newmarket who volunteered. Two contingents were sent from Canada. They were not away long, but each boy kept in close touch with home by frequent letters, most of which were published in the two local papers.</p>
<p>Even the gift of chocolate sent by Queen Victoria was preserved for those anxious ones back home. Harold Brunton returned in August 1900 to a big reception.</p>
<p>Tom Mills arrived in May 1901 having been severely wounded during the campaign. When he arrived by trolley from Toronto, Main Street was packed with people and as he stepped from the car, the band welcomed him.</p>
<p>Tom and his waiting brother, Bob, were hoisted into a carriage and the procession moved along to the Fire Hall. T.H. Brunton and ex-warden T.J. Woodcock addressed a welcome home to Newmarket’s returned son, who stood up in the carriage and made a short speech of thanks. The red-coated volunteers then harnessed themselves to the carriage, the Mills brothers seated within, and proceeded to the Mills home on Second Street.</p>
<p>Sir William Mulock was asked to procure a captured Boer cannon from the British government to be placed in front of the monument. From my article on the Cannons of Newmarket, you will remember that the Department of the Militia at Ottawa eventually sent a cannon, although two huge mortars were contributed from the government ordnance at Kingston.</p>
<p>Eventually they were raised and mounted solidly on huge rock-faced piers 60 feet by five feet and two feet above the lawn, in position to flank the Haines monument. During the Second World War, every municipality was urged to contribute all available material to the war effort and these mortars were sent to Aurora to be melted down in 1942.</p>
<p>Tenders ranging from $200 to $1,000 were received to erect this monument, which would stand eight feet five inches above the foundation. That of Cassidy &amp; Allen, the local monument makers, for $325, was considered the most satisfactory.</p>
<p>The inscription would read:</p>
<p>In memory of</p>
<p>Private W. Haines</p>
<p>A member of the 1st Canadian Contingent</p>
<p>Who died for his Queen and Country</p>
<p>In South Africa</p>
<p>6th of June, 1900</p>
<p>In August, Cassidy &amp; Allen reported that the memorial was being lettered and in September it was placed exactly 30 feet from the sidewalk on Water Street, unveiled by the Hon. F.W. Borden, minister of militia.</p>
<p>The monument stands nine feet, seven inches above the foundation, granite with a dark bluish tinge in a solid but graceful shape. This is surmounted by a bust of Wesley Haines in fine Sunapee granite, which was sculpted by Walter Aylward of Toronto for $350. It is an excellent likeness and an early piece of this distinguished artist’s work, who, after the First World War, designed and executed the Canadian monument at Vimy Ridge.</p>
<p>Plans were made for the Horticultural and Agricultural Societies to unite to hold an Old Home gathering on the last day of the Fall Fair. The Old Boys of North York Association planned to visit Newmarket Fair.</p>
<p>That year, 1901, was an exciting one in Newmarket with patriotism at fever pitch and grand arrangements were made for the unveiling ceremony, Newmarket citizens united to make the occasion a success.</p>
<p>The Haines monument was to be unveiled at 10:30 in the morning of September 19. A reception worthy of the town and the expected guests was organized. It seems to have been one of the finest processions ever organized in Newmarket.</p>
<p>The North York Old Boys, 500 strong, were accompanied by the 48th Highlanders Band, the Royal Grenadiers Band, the 12th Regimental Band, York Rangers of Aurora, the Indian Band from Christian Island, the Newmarket Citizens’ Band and two companies of the 12th Regiment Volunteers.</p>
<p>The Volunteers formed a hollow square around the monument. On the platform were the Haines family with the grandmother of Wesley Haines, Mrs. Israel Haines, aged 86.</p>
<p>Aemilius Irving, K.C., president of the North York Old Boys Association, was asked to unveil the monument, requesting that Private Brunton, who was not wounded, Corporal Mills, who had been shot in the arm and permanently disabled, and Bugler Williams, who had sounded the call for the battle of Paardeburg, assist in the unveiling. At the same time, the crowd sang the national anthem accompanied by the massed bands.</p>
<p>An account published in the local newspaper in 1930 stated the waterworks lawn was suddenly transformed by the placing of a well-selected collection of verdant conifers intended to form a background for the monument and the pair of 1811 mortars, each more than 5,200 weight, that flank it at the rear. In front of their bases we may soon hope to see beds prepared for a mass of brightly blooming plants and a sodded knoll.</p>
<p>The monument was eventually moved to the area adjacent to St. Paul’s Church on D’Arcy Street, along with other monuments commemorating our military past and the cannons were melted down.</p>
<p>The important point is that the little Town of Newmarket answered the call and rejoiced in the victory united.</p>

<h3 id="petrolia-man-finds-a-piece-of-family-history">&ldquo;Petrolia man finds a piece of family history&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://storage.sarniathisweek.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297662570774_ORIGINAL.jpg?size=650x" alt="img"></p>
<p>Petrolia’s Don Gibson is a man with a keen interest in Canadian military history. And he’s recently solved a military mystery of sorts that involved his great grandfather, the Fenian Raids and a missing medal.</p>
<p>Aside being an avid collector of medals and military miscellanea, Gibson has a family history rich in military service. The 79 year-old is a former member of the Air Force and is past president of the Petrolia Legion. A number of his relatives fought during the First World War. And his great grandfather was one of the soldiers who was charged with protecting Sarnia from roving bands of Irish-American raiders during the Fenian Raids of the 1860s.</p>
<p>“It’s a Sarnia story that nobody’s ever heard of,” Gibson said.</p>
<p>Andrew Kerr was Gibson’s great grandfather. Kerr was born in Fergus, Ontario in 1848, and was a tradesman by profession according to Gibson. At the age of 18, Kerr became a member of the Fergus Rifle Company, formed to protect Canada’s largely unguarded frontier with the United States against the potential invasion of Fenian raiders in 1866.</p>
<p>Fenians were a movement of Irish-Americans who were seeking the independence of Ireland from the United Kingdom. Between the years of 1866-1871, armed groups of Fenians raided several towns across Canada, including Campobello Island in New Brunswick, Ridgeway and Fort Erie in Ontario and Mississquoi County in Quebec.</p>
<p>The Fergus Rifle Company was part of the 30th Wellington Battalion and its mission was to defend Sarnia and its citizens from attacks that had been launched across the American border. Sarnia was seen as a particularly vulnerable area, as its proximity to America was uncomfortably close.</p>
<p>Kerr and his comrades were sent to Sarnia, where the soldiers were initially billeted with locals. After several weeks the company then moved its 35 plus soldiers to local agricultural buildings that had been converted into barracks, and the company stayed there for another eight weeks.</p>
<p>Aside from one false alarm (the bugle sounded, accidentally rousing the troops who believed an invasion was imminent), there were no attacks on Sarnia, nor much action – “They spent two months playing soldier,” Gibson said – and the troops were eventually told to pack up and head home.</p>
<p>For their troubles, the soldiers of the Fergus Rifle Company and all other soldiers in the war were awarded the Canada General Service Medals, silver medals with the portrait of Queen Victoria on them, engraved with the name of the soldier who served during the conflict, supported by a red and white striped ribbon. The individualized medals weren’t handed out until 1899, over 20 years after the conflict.</p>
<p>After the end of his military service, Kerr went back to the town where his family lived, Thessalon, Ontario, before moving out west. Kerr eventually got married and had five daughters and five sons, three of whom were soldiers during the First World War.</p>
<p>When Kerr turned 63, he applied for the Fenian Raid grant, a benefit for veterans of the conflict. It took him two years to prove to the federal government that he was a solider in the war and two of Kerr’s Sarnia comrades, William Gow and Thompson Sherwood, had to vouch for Kerr in a declaration in 1913 that eventually led to Kerr receiving his benefits several years after he first applied.</p>
<p>Kerr died at the age of 95 in 1941 back in Thessalon. But his prized Fenian medal went missing, Gibson said, and was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Being an avid collector of military memorabilia, Gibson had collected several other Canada General Service medals over the years, mostly from local soldiers who remained in the Lambton County region. But not having his great grandfather’s medal kept gnawing at him.</p>
<p>After a bit of sleuth work and a bit of luck, Gibson recently solved the mystery of the missing medal, discovering that his great grandfather’s coveted medal was actually in the possession of a relative who lives in Vancouver.</p>
<p>“I was so pleased when I located that medal,” Gibson said. “The odds on that after over a hundred years to find something like that, it’s amazing.”</p>
<p>“One of my cousins has it in Vancouver. His father was one of the soldiers who fought in the First World War, and he gave the medal to his son.”</p>
<p>While Gibson takes comfort in knowing where his great grandfather’s medal is now, his cousin is still keeping his cards close to his chest.</p>
<p>“He’s a bachelor who lives in Vancouver and I’ve been trying to talk him into sending it to me,” Gibson said with a laugh. “But he said ‘there are other cousins, too’. So we’ll see.”</p>

The issuer of this medal was the Fenian Brotherhood, an Irish revolutionary organization founded in the United States in 1858 by exiles.</p>
<p>The Fenians prepared a highly original plan to attack the British, not at home but in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The Research Desk column from the Jan. 9, 2017, weekly issue of Coin World:</p>
<p>The 30-millimeter brass medal bearing a ship under full sail flanked by F – B and the legend IRISH REPUBLIC presents several mysteries to today’s collectors.</p>
<p>A robust 2.5 millimeters thick and pierced for suspension, the medal’s reverse presents clasped hands between IRELAND and AMERICA, the date 1866 in a shamrock spray, and at base a radiant rising sun.</p>
<p>The issuer was the Fenian Bro­therhood, an Irish revolutionary organization founded in the United States in 1858 by exiles including the learned John O’Mahony and Michael Doheny. O’Mahony later joined one of the many “Irish Brigades” fighting with the Union Army in the American Civil War.</p>

<p>The U.S. Army valued these hard-fighting volunteers, many of whom marched off from their mustering-out shouting “Ireland Next!”</p>
<p>The Fenians prepared a highly original plan to attack the British, not at home but in the Western Hemisphere. Armed with war surplus American rifles, Fenian volunteers would invade Canada and hold it, negotiating its return to Britain in exchange for Ireland.</p>
<p>This audacious plan’s success depended on benevolent neutra­lity of the U.S. government and cooperative blindness of the distinctly anti-British U.S. Army.</p>
<p>The raids were launched and spirited fighting took place. Both Fenian and Canadian volunteers fought valiantly, but the Irishmen failed to sweep the field.</p>
<p>A campaign bar FENIAN RAID was provided as the British award medal for this fighting.</p>
<p>The raid stimulated agitation for closer union among the Canadian colonies, which came together in 1867 as the Dominion of Canada.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the principal Irish revolutionary organization became Clan na Gael, which remained active through the Irish War for Independence, 1917 to 1922. The secret, oath-bound Irish Republican Brotherhood was born at the same time.</p>
<p>The principal numismatic relic of the Fenian affair is an elusive medal. The identity of engraver and manufacturer are not known with absolute certainty, though Leonard Forrer names “SEWELL (Amer.). Die-sinker of New York, of Irish origin, by whom is a Fenian Brotherhood Badge, 1866 …” Lawrence Brown, British Historical Medals, 1837-1901, assigns this number 2863 and repeats the name Sewell. Both references provide concise histories of the Fenian movement.

<p>More than a century after they were first presented to Indigenous leaders, two rare First Nations medals were on display at the Regina Coin Club Spring Show this weekend.</p>
<p>For any curious attendees who stopped to take a look at the medals, George Manz, president of the Regina Coin Club, was on hand at the Turvey Centre to fill them in on the history of the medals and their significance.</p>

<p>“We are on Treaty 4 territory and I don’t think that there’s enough education in our school system to teach people about the settler First Nations treaty that we all benefit from,” he said.</p>
<p>The story began in 1901 when King Edward VII sent his son George (who later become King George V) on a nine month tour of the British Empire, said Manz.</p>
<p>In September of that year just outside of Calgary, the prince and his royal party met with an estimated 2,000 First Nations representatives from across Western Canada, which included representatives from the Blackfoot, Blood, Peigan, Sarcee, Stony and Cree.
