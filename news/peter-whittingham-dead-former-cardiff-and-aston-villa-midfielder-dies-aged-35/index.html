<p>Peter Whittingham, 35, has died after suffering an accidental head injury. The former Cardiff and Aston Villa midfielder has been confirmed dead this afternoon after police reported he had suffered a head injury in a licensed area on March 7.</p>
<p>Whittingham was being treated in intensive care in Cardiff&rsquo;s Heath Hospital before his passing. He leaves behind a wife, Amanda, who is currently pregnant, and a young son. Whittingham scored 85 goals for Cardiff over a 10-year spell at the club having made 413 appearances. He also played for Aston Villa between 2003-07 and made 21 appearances for England&rsquo;s Under-21 side. Whittingham retired after a spell with Blackburn Rovers in 2018. “It is with an immeasurable amount of sorrow that we must inform supporters that Peter Whittingham has passed away at the age of 35,” a statement from Cardiff read.</p>
<p>Petter Whittingham has died following a head injury</p>
<p>“We are heartbroken. “The news of Peter’s sudden and untimely passing has shaken us to our very foundation. Our love goes out to his wife Amanda, their young son and family. They are at the forefront of our thoughts and, on their behalf, we ask for their privacy to be respected at this unfathomably cruel and difficult time. “First and foremost, Peter was a family man - and somebody who could light up a room with his sense of humour, warmth and personality. Then, as a professional footballer - as a Bluebird - he excelled with talent, ease, grace and humility. Nobody did it better. “The loss of Peter will be painfully felt by our city, supporters and indeed all who ever had the pleasure of knowing him. We love you Pete and your memory will eternally stay with us.”</p>
