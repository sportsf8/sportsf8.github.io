<p>Paul McCartney proudly announces the thirteenth installment in his GRAMMY Award-winning Archive Collection: On July 31, Paul’s critically acclaimed and universally beloved tenth solo album Flaming Pie will be the latest to receive the Archive Collection treatment, being released on formats including a 5CD/2DVD/4LP Collector’s Edition, a 5CD/2DVD Deluxe Edition, plus 3LP, 2LP and 2CD editions.</p>
<p>All digital pre-orders for the Archive Collection release of Flaming Pie will include YOUNG BOY. Also available as a stand-alone for digital download &amp; streaming, the EP recreates the 1997 “Young Boy” maxi-single and features the remastered Flaming Pie single “Young Boy,” a home-recorded version of the song, the original B-side “Looking For You,” and excerpts of “Oobu Joobu Part 1,” also from the original single. The two music videos for the track have been restored and will also be published on the same day.</p>
<p>Two additional EPs will be available with “The World Tonight” arriving on June 26 and “Beautiful Night” on July 17.</p>
<p>Originally released May 5, 1997, Flaming Pie ended a four-year gap between McCartney studio albums. Recorded largely in the wake of Paul’s involvement in the curation and release of The Beatles Anthology series, Flaming Pie was shaped and inspired by that experience, with Paul remarking at the time “(The Beatles Anthology) reminded me of The Beatles’ standards and the standards that we reached with the songs. So in a way it was a refresher course that set the framework for this album.” Produced by Paul, Jeff Lynne, and George Martin and featuring a supporting cast of family and friends including Ringo Starr, Steve Miller, Linda McCartney, and son James, Flaming Pie is equal parts a masterclass in songcraft and a sustained burst of joyful spontaneity. With highlights ranging from the uplifting and inspirational opener “The Song We Were Singing” to the raucous title track (named for a quote from an early John Lennon interview on the origin of The Beatles’ name: “It came in a vision – a man appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them, ‘from this day on you are Beatles with an A.'”) to the pensive “Calico Skies,” and featuring singles “Young Boy,” “The World Tonight” and “Beautiful Night,” Flaming Pie would represent yet another pinnacle in Paul’s solo catalogue: Released to rapturous reviews, the album would be Paul’s most commercially successful release of the ’90s, achieving his highest chart positions since the ’80s and would receive gold certifications in the US, UK, Japan and more.</p>
<p>As the thirteenth release in the Paul McCartney Archive Collection, Flaming Pie will be available in formats including a numbered, limited seven-disc (5CD/2DVD) Deluxe Edition Box Set comprised of the original album remastered at Abbey Road Studios, 32 bonus audio tracks including unheard home recordings and demos, alternative studio recordings, rough mixes and B-sides including selections from Oobu Joobu parts 1-6, Flaming Pie At The Mill CD (Paul’s hour-long tour of his studio), video content including the In The World Tonight documentary, original music videos, EPKs, interviews, performances and behind-the-scenes material, a 128-page book containing previously unpublished images by Linda McCartney, expanded album artwork from the archives and the story behind the album written by Chris Heath – including track-by-track information, recipes and new interviews with Paul, Ringo Starr, Jeff Lynne, Steve Miller and key album personnel, studio notes, handwritten lyrics, the 1997 Flaming Pie issue of Club Sandwich, the official newspaper of the Paul McCartney Fanclub, downloadable 24bit 96kHz HD audio, and more.</p>
<p>A 4LP/5CD/2DVD Collector’s Edition — strictly limited to 3,000 numbered copies issued in a cloth wrapped two-piece collector’s box — will feature everything in the Deluxe Edition plus a marbled art print portfolio of six silkscreened Linda McCartney art prints, exclusive vinyl versions of the remastered album cut at half speed across 2LPs in an exclusive gatefold sleeve, an LP of home recordings in a hand-stamped white label sleeve, and “The Ballad of the Skeletons” – Paul’s 1996 collaboration with Allen Ginsberg, also featuring Philip Glass and Lenny Kaye – released for the first time on vinyl and cut at 45 RPM with vinyl etching and poster.</p>
<p>Additional Flaming Pie Archive Collection formats will include 2CD (remastered album + 21 tracks of bonus audio), 2LP (remastered album cut at half speed across two 180g LPs in gatefold sleeve with booklet), and 3LP (remastered album cut at half speed across two 180g LPs in gatefold sleeve with booklet, plus single 180g LP of unreleased home recordings in hand-stamped white label sleeve both housed in a slipcase). The release will also be available on streaming platforms.</p>
<p>The Paul McCartney Archive Collection debuted with the November 2, 2010 re-release of Paul McCartney and Wings’ 1973 milestone Band on the Run, which won the 2010 GRAMMY Award for Best Historical Album, while the Archive Collection’s Deluxe Edition Box Set of the 1976 classic Wings Over America took the 2013 GRAMMY for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. Every release in the ongoing Paul McCartney Archive Collection is supervised by Paul himself, who oversees all aspects of each and every title from remastering to the curation of lost tracks, outtakes, artwork, photographs and video from his personal vaults, and much more. The result is one of the most ambitious and personal undertakings of its kind, one that encompasses more than 50 years of cherished, classic material from the most successful songwriter and recording artist in music history.</p>

He is one of the most recognisable figures in the world.</p>
<p>But you’d be forgiven for walking right past Paul McCartney without a second glance in this outfit.</p>
<p>The former Beatle and his wife Nancy Shevell were kitted out in PPE as they went out for a spot of shopping near their US home last week.</p>
<p>Glove Me Do! Sir Paul McCartney and wife Nancy Shevell wore masks and gloves as they went shopping in the Hamptons on Thursday</p>
<p>McCartney, 77, wore purple latex gloves and a construction site-style face mask, and shaded himself from the sun in a light blue baseball cap.</p>
<p>With his trim frame and toned arms, he could easily have been mistaken for a man half his age.</p>
<p>Miss Shevell, 60, also wore gloves and a mask, but opted for a more basic face covering in a grey fabric.</p>
<p>The trucking company heiress, who is worth an estimated £120million, looked casually chic in fitted black jeans and a top that bore the slogan: ‘People Want Peace’.</p>

<p>The couple own a multi-million-pound mansion in the Hamptons east of New York, having first met in the exclusive neighbourhood after he split from his second wife Heather Mills.</p>
<p>Vegetarian and animal rights campaigner McCartney, who turns 78 on Thursday, recently said he will start celebrating birthdays again only when the world stops harming animals. He has also asked fans to ditch meat for the occasion.</p>
<p>The couple wed in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London in 2011, but had known each other for 3 years prior.</p>
<p>Outing: Miss Shevell, 60, also wore gloves and a mask, but opted for a more basic face covering in a grey fabric</p>
<p>Sir Paul was married previously to photographer and musician Linda McCartney from 1969 to her tragic death from breast cancer in 1998, aged 56.</p>
<p>His second marriage to former model Heather Mills lasted just six-years before their split in 2008.</p>
<p>He went onto tie the knot for a third time with New Yorker Nancy, with whom he has been happily married since 2011.

<h3 id="watch-paul-mccartney-write-the-beatles-song-helter-skelter-on-acoustic-1968">&ldquo;Watch Paul McCartney write The Beatles’ song ‘Helter Skelter’ on acoustic, 1968&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Beatles-film-A-Hard-Days-Night-with-its-best-pictures12.jpeg?fit=700%2C410&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
We’re dipping into the Far Out Magazine vault to bring you this perfect clip of Paul McCartney creating one of his most beloved songs, ‘Helter Skelter’. In 1968 The Beatles released the track and people soon realised that the song was an attempt to make the band sound as dirty as they possibly could.</p>
<p>Famously released as the second single from The Beatles’ ninth studio record The White Album, music historians consider the addition of “proto-metal roar” on ‘Helter Skelter as major early development for music. In fact, it would later be credited as a major influence in the formation of heavy metal music. Below find a rare clip of Macca writing that track with his acoustic.</p>
<p>Macca has grabbed inspiration from everywhere when writing his songs. However, rumour has it that The Beatles bassist had become inspired to write ‘Helter Skelter’ after seeing an interview conducted by the Who’s Pete Townshend. Townshend, who at the time as a cantankerous young upstart, described the song ‘I Can See for Miles’ as their “loudest and dirtiest” song to date.</p>
<p>With those comments, Townshend had seemingly set Macca the challenge of pushing the public perception of The Beatles. McCartney, with the words of Townshend ringing in his ears, sat down to create ‘Helter Skelter’.</p>
<p>After its formation, The Beatles’ bass player described his new creation as something destined to be their dirtiest to date, ensuring the band add in the “most raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera” before adding that he was “using the symbol of a helter-skelter as a ride from the top to the bottom; the rise and fall of the Roman Empire—and this was the fall, the demise.”</p>
<p>Shortly before the release of The White Album, McCartney sat down with Radio Luxembourg as part of an exclusive interview when the conversation turned to ‘Helter Skelter’ and its creation: “Umm, that came about just ’cause I’d read a review of a record which said, ‘and this group really got us wild, there’s echo on everything, they’re screaming their heads off,” McCartney said at the time. “And I just remember thinking, ‘Oh, it’d be great to do one. Pity they’ve done it. Must be great—really screaming record’, he added.</p>
<p>He continued: “And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn’t rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, ‘Oh well, we’ll do one like that, then.’ And I had this song called ‘Helter Skelter,’ which is just a ridiculous song. So we did it like that, ‘cuz I like noise.”</p>
<p>The White Album is often beloved by fans for it’s rawer edge and it’s what made John Lennon call it his favourite. The guitarist picked the 1968 record, perhaps largely because it would’ve annoyed his songwriting partner. McCartney was never a fan of that album and Lennon revealed his theory as to why: “[Paul] wanted it to be more a group thing, which really means more Paul. So he never liked that album.” It’s a record that is full of hits, from ‘Back in the U.S.S.R’ to ‘Blackbird’ to ‘Helter Skelter’ and beyond, it’s an undeniable powerhouse of an album.</p>
<p>He continued with a swipe at Paul’s favourite Beatles record Sgt. Pepper: “I always preferred it to all the other albums, including Pepper, because I thought the music was better. The Pepper myth is bigger, but the music on the White Album is far superior, I think.”</p>
<p>While the end result of his creation became a noisy, raucous and dirty song, rare footage has been unearthed of McCartney in the studio with his bandmates, quietly strumming away on an acoustic guitar on his own.</p>

<h3 id="how-paul-mccartney-proved-wings-haters-wrong-with-band-on-the-run">&ldquo;How Paul McCartney proved Wings haters wrong with &lsquo;Band on the Run&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.salon.com/2020/06/paul-mccarney-0612201.jpg" alt="img">
Each week, I&rsquo;ll present a new album for your consideration —a means for passing these uncertain times in musical bliss. For some readers, hearing about the latest selection might offer a chance reacquaintance with an old friend. For others, the series might provide an unexpected avenue for making a new one.</p>
<p>When it comes to rock&rsquo;s greatest comeback stories, Paul McCartney and Wings&rsquo; &ldquo;Band on the Run&rdquo; looms large. In his post-Beatles years, McCartney had enjoyed accolades for his first two solo albums. But when it came to his formation of Wings, with wife Linda sitting in on keyboards, the critics were merciless. While &ldquo;Wild Life&rdquo; (1971) and &ldquo;Red Rose Speedway&rdquo; (1973) had enjoyed respectable sales, the Cute Beatle had been ragged and tagged as a purveyor of mindless bubblegum music.</p>
<p>On the eve of recording the &ldquo;Band on the Run&rdquo; LP, Wings had been buoyed by four straight top 10 U.S. singles in &ldquo;Hi Hi Hi,&rdquo; &ldquo;My Love,&rdquo; &ldquo;Live and Let Die,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Helen Wheels.&rdquo; But before they could make the trip to Nigeria, where they were slated to record at EMI&rsquo;s Lagos studio, lead guitarist Henry McCullough and drummer Denny Seiwell announced that they were leaving the band. With Linda and sideman Denny Laine in tow, McCartney barreled forward. McCartney had imagined a bucolic African experience in which he and his mates would sun themselves on the beach by day and hit the studio at night.</p>
<p>Advertisement:</p>
<p>As it happened, Wings&rsquo; difficulties were only just getting started. Nigeria was locked in the grip of a military government, for one thing. During their stay in Nigeria, Paul and Linda were robbed at knifepoint. Meanwhile, McCartney was forced to improvise, overdubbing the drum parts in addition to carrying out his usual bass and lead vocal duties.</p>
<p>The trouble and the strife may have been exactly what McCartney and his remaining Wings needed. In spite of the subpar quality of EMI&rsquo;s Nigerian facilities, they managed to produce a slew of top-drawer recordings. Take the title track, for example. With a flourish, &ldquo;Band on the Run&rdquo; saw McCartney elevating his post-Beatles work with renewed abandon. A multipart mini rock opera, the song traces the story of a rock band&rsquo;s longing for the sweet release of freedom and escape.</p>
<p>Listen to &ldquo;Band on the Run&rdquo;:</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jet.&rdquo; Any doubts about Wings&rsquo; capacity for rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll ended with McCartney&rsquo;s raucous new song. The former Beatle was in impeccable form, complete with his hard-driving bass and snarling lead vocals. Indeed, for McCartney, the whole of the &ldquo;Band on the Run&rdquo; album was a vocal tour-de-force, from his gentle balladry on &ldquo;Bluebird&rdquo; through his defiant vocals on &ldquo;Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five,&rdquo; the LP&rsquo;s apocalyptic concluding track.</p>

<p>When it was released in December 1973, &ldquo;Band on the Run&rdquo; proved to be a slow burn. By midsummer though, on the strength of the &ldquo;Jet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Band on the Run&rdquo; hit singles, the album lorded over the charts. Wings enjoyed a spate of rave reviews, along with a Grammy nod for Album of the Year. But no matter how you cut it, the verdict was ineluctably clear. McCartney was back.

<h3 id="paul-mccartney-announces-flaming-pie-special-re-release">&ldquo;Paul McCartney announces ‘Flaming Pie’ special re-release&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Credit-Paul-McCartney-Photographer-Linda-McCartney.jpg" alt="img">
Paul McCartney has announced a special re-release of his 1997 solo album ‘Flaming Pie’ as part of his ongoing ‘Archive Collection’ series.</p>
<p>The reissue of the record, which was the former Beatle‘s 10th solo LP, is the 13th instalment in McCartney’s ongoing Grammy Award-winning ‘Archive Collection’, which began back in 2010 with the purpose of remastering and reissuing the musician’s solo records.</p>
<p>Set for release on July 31, ‘Flaming Pie’ — which was co-produced by ELO‘s Jeff Lynne, the late George Martin and McCartney himself — will be available in a 5xCD/2xDVD/4xLP Collector’s Edition, a 5xCD/2xDVD Deluxe Edition, and 3xLP, 2xLP and 2xCD editions.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Speaking at the time of ‘Flaming Pie”s original release, McCartney said: “[‘The Beatles Anthology’] reminded me of The Beatles’ standards and the standards that we reached with the songs. So, in a way, it was a refresher course that set the framework for this album.”</p>
<p>Pre-orders of the ‘Flaming Pie’ reissue are now live, and each pre-order will include a copy of the ‘Young Boy’ EP. That EP recreates the 1997 ‘Young Boy’ maxi single, featuring the remastered ‘Flaming Pie’ single ‘Young Boy’, a home-recorded version of the song, the original B-side ‘Looking For You’ and excerpts of ‘Oobu Joobu Part 1’.</p>
<p>You can see the unboxing video for the ‘Flaming Pie’ re-issue above.</p>
<p>McCartney fans should also look out for two additional EPs that are available for pre-order, with ‘The World Tonight’ set to arrive on June 26 before ‘Beautiful Night’ is released on July 17.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Each release in the ‘Paul McCartney Archive Collection’ is supervised by McCartney himself, who, as a press release explains, “oversees all aspects of each and every title from remastering to the curation of lost tracks, outtakes, artwork, photographs and video from his personal vaults, and much more.</p>
<p>“The result is one of the most ambitious and personal undertakings of its kind, one that encompasses more than 50 years of cherished, classic material from the most successful songwriter and recording artist in music history.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, McCartney criticised the Italian government for implementing a policy that has prevented gig-goers in Italy from receiving full refunds for shows that have been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Paul McCartney took to social media recently to reveal that during a trip to the US in 1964, the Beatles had been listed to play a segregated show, which they wouldn&rsquo;t do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1964 The Beatles were due to play Jacksonville in the US and we found out that it was going to be to a segregated audience,&rdquo; McCartney, 77, wrote in a statement shared on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It felt wrong. We said &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not doing that!&rsquo; and the concert we did do was to their first non-segregated audience,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We then made sure this was in our contract. To us it seemed like common sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>McCartney went on to share that they support and remain alongside everyone who are protesting and raising their voices at this time.</p>
<p>The singer wants justice for the family of George Floyd. He also wants justice for all those who have died and suffered. McCartney concluded his post, reiterating that silence is a hindrance to equity.</p>
<p>As reported by PEOPLE, McCartney likewise shared a rundown of associations that are already battling for racial justice. That includes Black Lives Matter, Color of Change, the NAACP, Stand Up to Racism, Campaign Zero, and Community Justice Exchange.</p>

<p>The English rock band, The Beatles, were formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up containing McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, they are viewed as the most powerful band of all time.</p>
<p>According to McCartney, he had guessed in the Beatles&rsquo; success when the band&rsquo;s debut single, &ldquo;Love Me Do,&rdquo; first appeared on British charts in 1962, as reported by Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>It had taken about a year before they won attention in the US.</p>

<p>In 1964, they had left England and headed for their first American appearances. That includes an appearance on &ldquo;The Ed Sullivan Show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had taken about a year before they won attention in the US. Their first single for Capitol Records, &ldquo;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&rdquo; had hit Number One on Cashbox. The song sold a quarter-million copies in the U.S. within three days of its release.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on May 25, Floyd passed away after begging that he was unable to breathe while a police officer held him down with a knee on his neck. After a week of protests, Beyoncé shared an inspiring message on Instagram, PEOPLE reported.</p>
<p>In her post, the acclaimed singer stated that while &ldquo;the world came together for George Floyd&rdquo; recently, there is still a lot of work to be finished.</p>
<p>She then asked her legion of followers to &ldquo;remain aligned and focused in our call for real justice&rdquo; as the world pushes ahead in the battle for change.</p>
<p>Singer Halsey, on the other hand, has been blunt about social justice reform, as reported by Insider. She shared images and live commentary from the ground while protesting in LA.</p>
<p>Halsey, who is noted for her distinctive singing voice, revealed that unwarranted violence from the LAPD has been swift and widespread.</p>
<p>Ben Affleck, who began his career as a child, also joined the protesters. The actor was with his current girlfriend, actress Ana de Armas.</p>
<p>The couple tuned in to protesters at the Save Venice march in Venice Beach, California. Affleck carried a sign showing support for Black Lives Matter and another for Save Venice.

<h3 id="paul-mccartney-wants-you-to-ditch-meat-in-honor-of-his-birthday">&ldquo;Paul McCartney Wants You to Ditch Meat in Honor of His Birthday&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/959/files/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-11-at-3.37.29-PM.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
Instead of jamming out to the cover of Twist and Shout by The Beatles on the occasion of Sir Paul McCartney&rsquo;s birthday on June 18th, the music icon wants you to ditch meat. It&rsquo;s hard to believe that Sir Paul is turning 78, but he wants to spread his message of peace, love and &ldquo;stop harming animals&rdquo; to the world, as he did ten years ago when he created &ldquo;Glass Walls&rdquo; with PETA, a film about what happens in slaughterhouses. His theory is that if everyone could see what happens inside these places, and they had glass walls, no one would ever want to eat meat again.</p>
<p>This birthday is a special one because it&rsquo;s the 10th anniversary of the release of Glass Walls, and McCartney says he will be celebrating when the world stops harming animals and eating meat. Sir Paul wrote a guest blog for PETA to get the message out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve ever wanted for my birthday is peace on Earth—including for the animals, he wrote for PETA. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why this year I&rsquo;m urging fans to watch a video I hosted for PETA titled &lsquo;Glass Walls.&rsquo; We called it that because if slaughterhouses had glass walls, who would want to eat meat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The entire birthday message From Sir Paul McCartney is here:</p>
<p>“All I’ve ever wanted for my birthday is peace on Earth—including for animals. That’s why this year, I’m urging fans to watch a video I hosted for PETA, titled ‘Glass Walls.’ We called it that because if slaughterhouses had glass walls, who would want to eat meat? The video debuted exactly 10 years ago. Since then, the public has finally gotten a peek at what happens inside the meat trade, and the demand for vegan food is sky-high. Whether you’re worried about diseases that spring from slaughterhouses, the animals who suffer terribly and needlessly, or the catastrophic impact of the meat industry on our environment, please watch this short video and share it with your friends.</p>
<p>Thank you.”</p>
<p>—Paul McCartney</p>
<p>McCartney, who&rsquo;s recognized as the most influential living band member in the world, is also a well-known animal rights activist. He has been a devoted vegetarian for 45 years&ndash; influenced by his late wife Linda, who was an early advocate of the vegetarian lifestyle. McCartney also started the #meatlessmondays movement with his daughters, the designer Stella and Mary, a well-known British photographer. Stella McCartney has made her luxury fashion lines vegetarian and sustainable, and recently released a vegan version of the Stan Smith Adidas sneaker–proving once and for all that the apples don&rsquo;t fall far from the tree.</p>
<p>In the film, Glass Walls, seen by over 20 million people, powerfully disturbing footage demonstrates the commonplace mistreatment of animals on their way to slaughter, narrated by McCartney himself. The film highlights the manhandling of chickens and turkeys as he points out they are &ldquo;the most abused animals on the planet,&rdquo; and a short snippet shows a slaughterhouse employee beating the animal to death by its throat because &ldquo;sometimes they can be hard to kill.&rdquo; McCartney also adds that conditions in these industrial farms are overcrowded and animals are &ldquo;jammed into filthy sheds by the tens of thousands and forced to live in their own excrement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the eye-opening scenes of animals packed together in unsanitary environments can explain how easily diseases can be transferred into the food system, a point that scientists have made in warning that today&rsquo;s farming practices could lead to the next pandemic.</p>
<p>In the past, there were significant amounts of influenza viruses founded in animals, and passed onto humans, causing widespread illness. Aside from the current situation, of the coronavirus pandemic, which was believed to have been caused by the transference of the virus from animals to humans at a Chinese wet market, other deadly zoonotic diseases (which spread from animals into humans) have come out of unsafe agricultural conditions.</p>
<p>The Avian Flu which came out of infected birds that spread it through overcrowded cages; Swine Flu which originated from U.S factory farms and made people sick in the 1990s; Mad Cow Disease which was a fatal brain disorder in adult cattle and spread to humans through consumption of meat through England in the 1980s and 1990s; and so on, all the way back to the 14th century, when the Bubonic plague also was known as the Black Death, was spread when rats that carried it bit people and the bacteria infection was deadly, killing 75 million people.</p>
<p>If these zoonotic diseases are not enough to persuade you to limit or completely ditch all meat consumption, McCartney asks you to &ldquo;please watch this short video and share it with your friends.&rdquo; Consider it your birthday gift to Sir Paul who gave us all such great music over the years. He adds that it doesn&rsquo;t matter “whether you’re worried about diseases that spring from slaughterhouses, the animals who suffer terribly and needlessly, or the catastrophic impact of the meat industry on our environment.&rdquo; Watch the film, below. Happy Birthday Paul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say it&rsquo;s your birthday. We&rsquo;re going to have a good time&hellip;. &quot; that is if you hit play now.
