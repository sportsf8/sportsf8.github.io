<p>Quique Setién&rsquo;s Barcelona faced their last league match against Alavés on Sunday simply playing for the honour of ending the championship with a win.</p>
<p>After the bad image against Osasuna, Barcelona were expected to start the clash willing to prove that what happened the other day was an accident.</p>
<p>And Setién&rsquo;s men made it clear in the first few minutes, as despite not scoring a goal, they were very close to doing so on three occasions in the first few minutes.</p>
<p>First, it was Riqui Puig who tried his fortune with a great shot from outside the box that hit the woodwork when the ball seemed destined for the corner. It was in the 3rd minute.</p>
<p>After the warning from the Barcelona youngster, in the 12th minute, Arturo Vidal had another great chance, but his shot with his right foot from inside the box also hit the woodwork.</p>
<p>Lastly, Leo Messi was on the brink of making it 1-0 with one of his characteristic shots from the dee, but again it hit the woodwork.

Riqui Puig can be Messi&rsquo;s new partner in crime Alaves vs Barcelona Set Argentine up against Alaves</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s youngsters stepped up during their 5-0 thrashing of Alaves on the final day of the LaLiga Santander season.</p>
<p>Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati both shone at Mendizorroza to ease the pressure on Quique Setien.</p>
<p>Riqui Puig was the director of the orchestra for the visitors, especially in a first half where he hit the crossbar and assisted Lionel Messi.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old also set up Nelson Semedo after the break as he laid down a strong claim to continue in the starting line-up in the future.</p>
<p>Ansu Fati provides something different for Barcelona.</p>
<p>The Catalans don&rsquo;t have someone with his turn of pace in the current squad and it would be a brave move to leave him out against Napoli.</p>
<p>Messi bowed out of LaLiga Santander this season with a brace to cement his place at the top of the scoring charts.</p>
<p>His two goals see him move on to 25 for the campaign, with Karim Benzema needing five goals against Leganes to prevent him from winning his seventh Pichichi Trophy.</p>
<p>Clement Lenglet was forced off with injury at the start of the second half, adding to Setien&rsquo;s defensive problems.</p>
<p>If the Frenchman is injured for the Champions League in August, the Blaugrana boss has an unfit Samuel Umtiti and an inexperienced Ronald Araujo to pick from when partnering Gerard Pique.</p>
<p>Arturo Vidal was all over the pitch for Barcelona as they tried to plug gaps in the team.</p>
<p>After being used as an attacking midfielder in the first half, he ended the game in the centre of defence to accommodate for the injured Lenglet&rsquo;s absence.

<p><img src="https://statics.sportskeeda.com/editor/2020/07/00260-15951769565136-800.jpg" alt="img">
Barcelona rolled back the years to absolutely demolish an Alaves side in its own backyard in the side&rsquo;s last La Liga fixture of the season. The Blaugrana put on a stunning display and put five past a hapless Alaves defence in what was the Catalans' best performance to date under Quique Setien.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi lived up to his supernatural standards today with a mesmerising performance and broke Xavi&rsquo;s record by bagging his 21st assist of the season. The Argentine genius also scored an excellent brace and put in a performance that bodes well for Barcelona in the Champions League.</p>
<p>The performance was also a fitting tribute to La Masia and the likes of Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati were mesmerising on the pitch. Barcelona finally seems to have found some genuine rhythm and will hope to replicate today&rsquo;s magic in the Champions League.</p>
<p>On the final day of the season Messi grabs his 21st league assist of the season—the most ever in La Liga.</p>
<p>Another record for the collection. 📚 pic.twitter.com/LCYG8HJp4f — B/R Football (@brfootball) July 19, 2020</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s stars seal a comprehensive win with five excellent goals</p>
<p>Barcelona showed intent in the opening stages after La Masia product Riqui Puig hit the post with an excellent shot from outside the box. Lionel Messi and Arturo Vidal were next in line with two powerful shots that also cannoned off the woodwork.</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s persistent efforts finally paid off after Ansu Fati latched on to a lobbed pass from Lionel Messi and hammered it into the near post to give the Catalans the lead. Riqui Puig scythed through the Alaves defence only minutes later with an exquisite pass but Luis Suarez failed to make the most of the simplest of chances.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi got his goal immediately after the cooling break after Sergi Roberto and Riqui Pug combined to set the Argentine up for an excellent finish. The Argentine genius then played an exceptional ball to Jordi Alba and Luis Suarez made no mistake with his header.</p>
<p>Riqui Puig was excellent today</p>
<p>Barcelona was in no mood to take the foot of the gas in the second half and Riqui Puig and Lionel Messi showed another glimpse of their flourishing relationship and set Nelson Semedo up for his first goal of the La Liga season.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Lionel Messi seized the initiative yet again and cemented his hold on the game with a precise finish after latching on to a cross from Jordi Alba to cap off an amazing Blaugrana performance. The Catalans were in the form of their lives today and will certainly feel better about themselves after a difficult season.</p>
<p>Neto - 7/10</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s second-choice goalkeeper was handed a rare start today and was rarely troubled as the likes of Joselu and Edgar struggled to find their shooting boots. Neto was good with his feet and proved his credentials as Barcelona kept an easy clean sheet.</p>
<p>Clement Lenglet - 7.5/10</p>
<p>Clement Lenglet was the leader of Barcelona&rsquo;s back-line today and marshalled his teammates well in the absence of Gerard Pique. The defender dealt with the pacy Joselu well and had to be taken off in the second half after experiencing some discomfort.</p>
<p>Ronald Araujo - 7.5/10</p>
<p>Ronald Araujo seems to be growing into his role at Barcelona and will have pushed Samuel Umtiti further down the pecking order with his performance today. The youngster was occasionally troubled by Oliver Burke but held his own to ensure that Alaves had no joy in the final third.</p>
<p>Jordi Alba found some much-needed form today</p>
<p>Jordi Alba - 8.5/10</p>
<p>Jordi Alba finally seemed to be back to his best today and will be thrilled with his two assists. The Barcelona left-back has not been his usual self since the La Liga restart but put in two brilliant crosses to hand Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez their goals today.</p>
<p>Sergi Roberto - 8/10</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s all-weather man is starting to become an important cog in Quique Setien&rsquo;s system and seamlessly transitioned into his preferred midfield role in the second half.</p>
<p>Sergio Busquets - 7/10</p>
<p>Sergio Busquets put in a composed performance and won possession back for Barcelona with ease on numerous occasions. The veteran midfielder was rarely troubled and provided the platform on which Barcelona built its assaults in the first half.</p>
<p>Riqui Puig - 9/10</p>
<p>Riqui Puig sent a massive message to the Barcelona board today and will be an absolute must against Napoli. The young midfielder was all over Alaves in the first half and was unlucky not to score after an excellent long-range effort in the opening minutes.</p>
<p>2️⃣ assists in the first 60 minutes for Riqui Puig today</p>
<p>🤔 Unquestioned starter from now on? pic.twitter.com/3pPWuMdh07 — beIN SPORTS USA (@beINSPORTSUSA) July 19, 2020</p>
<p>Puig went on to bag an assist for Lionel Messi and should have picked up another after picking out Luis Suarez with a stunning through-ball. The Catalan midfielder picked up his second assist of the game with a weighted pass to Nelson Semedo and had one of his best games in a Barcelona shirt.</p>
<p>Arturo Vidal - 8/10</p>
<p>Arturo Vidal was unfortunate not to get on to the scoresheet after making some excellent runs into the penalty area. The Chilean midfielder was one half of a makeshift centre-back pairing in the second half and put in an excellent performance for Barcelona.</p>
<p>Ansu Fati - 8.5/10</p>
<p>Ansu Fati was a livewire on the pitch and justified his selection with a stunning finish to break the deadlock and score his 7th La Liga goal of the season. The 17-year-old oozed confidence in the final third and will play a crucial part in Barcelona&rsquo;s Champions League campaign.</p>
<p>Lionel Messi - 9.5/10</p>
<p>Fans and pundits like may have exhausted their vocabularies singing praises of Barcelona&rsquo;s talisman but it seems as though Lionel Messi just cannot help himself. The Barcelona captain was angry after the Osasuna debacle and showed the world that he cannot be kept down for long with a vintage performance today.</p>
<p>Leo #Messi: ❝The attitude and commitment that the team showed is the path to follow.❞ pic.twitter.com/A0a6G8BW7l — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) July 19, 2020</p>
<p>An early strike that grazed the post was an ominous warning for an Alaves defence that was unable to handle the Argentine genius. With two goals and an assist to boot, Lionel Messi thoroughly deserved his man-of-the-match award today.</p>
<p>Luis Suarez - 7.5/10</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s Uruguayan hitman put in a good performance today and could have scored a hat-trick against Alaves. Luis Suarez scored his header with aplomb after finding Jordi Alba&rsquo;s cross but will have to improve his conversion ratio to take Barcelona across the finish line in the Champions League.</p>
<p>Substitutes</p>
<p>Nelson Semedo - 8/10</p>
<p>Nelson Semedo was brought on in the second half in place of Clement Lenglet and took the opportunity to grab his first La Liga goal of the season. The Portuguese full-back made the right flank his own and scored Barcelona&rsquo;s fourth goal with a thundering finish.</p>
<p>Frenkie de Jong - 8/10</p>
<p>Frenkie de Jong played in his preferred position as a defensive midfielder today and showed exactly why Barcelona has invested in him with an astute performance. The Dutch midfielder linked up well with Riqui Puig and nearly bagged a wonderful assist with a long-range pass to Martin Braithwaite.</p>
<p>Frenkie de Jong had a good outing against Alaves</p>
<p>Martin Braithwaite - 7/10</p>
<p>Martin Braithwaite came on as a second-half substitute for Ansu Fati and had two excellent opportunities to get himself a late goal. The Danish forward showed plenty of energy and drive but will have to work on his final product to find a place in Barcelona&rsquo;s squad next season.</p>

<h3 id="riqui-puig-and-ansu-fati---the-two-shining-lights-in-barcelonas-dismal-season">&ldquo;Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati - the two shining lights in Barcelona&rsquo;s dismal season&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://statics.sportskeeda.com/editor/2020/07/aeee4-15949876845720-800.jpg" alt="img">
Lionel Messi and co have spoilt the fan base to the extent that FC Barcelona are expected to win trophies every season. Going by those staggering standards, the 2019-20 season can be termed a disaster for Barcelona.</p>
<p>They were knocked out of the Copa Del Rey by Athletic Bilbao, eliminated from the Spanish Super Cup by Atletico Madrid and came up second-best against their arch-rivals Real Madrid in the La Liga.</p>
<p>Without any quick-fire, drastic change in their performances, the dream of Barcelona&rsquo;s long-overdue sixth Champions League title seems fanciful. A trophyless season at Barcelona is a distinct possibility, which for a large chunk of Cules is an unthinkable proposition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Barcelona&rsquo;s on-field displays weren&rsquo;t the club&rsquo;s biggest lows this season. Barcelona, under the presidency of Josep Maria Bartomeu, have been a breeding ground for scandals and controversies. Iin this season, things have only exacerbated on that front.</p>
<p>Barcelona witnessed the infamous &lsquo;Barcagate&rsquo; scandal, a fallout within the board of directors that was followed by the resignation of six members including that of the vice president.</p>
<p>There was a public altercation between Barcelona&rsquo;s captain Lionel Messi and the sporting director of the club, Eric Abidal. Another Barcelona news that made negative headlines was the financial bailout in the form of Arthur - Miralem Pjanic swap deal that was purportedly sought by the club to settle their books.</p>
<p>The emergence of Ansu Fati at Barcelona</p>
<p>Lionel Messi celebrates a goal with Ansu Fati.</p>
<p>The emergence of La Masia graduates Riqui Puig and Ansu Fati along with the omnipresent brilliance of talismanic captain Lionel Messi has remained a source of respite for the Barcelona faithful amidst the gloom of the tumultuous 2019-20 season.</p>
<p>While Messi is always expected to perform at his highest level, Puig and Fati have impressed for Barcelona in the limited opportunities they received this season.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Owing to injuries to the likes of Messi, Luis Suarez, and Ousmane Dembele in the era of Ernesto Valverde, the16-year-old Fati became the second-youngest player to debut for the club in a 5-2 home win over Real Betis. Since then, Fati has taken the football fraternity by storm.</p>
<p>Barring his four-minute-long stint that culminated in a red card against Espanyol, Fati has bedazzled almost every time he has been provided an opportunity to showcase his talents. The youngester has made ten starts during his 23 La Liga appearances this season, netting six goals while assisting one.</p>
<p>💥Ansu Fati💥</p>
<p>The youngest player to score a double in Liga history!#UCL pic.twitter.com/XM6NaLPKx4 — UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) February 2, 2020</p>
<p>Along with being Barcelona&rsquo;s youngest ever goal-scorer, Fati is also the youngest player to score in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>Graham Hunter, a Spanish football expert, was full of praise for the Guinea-Bissau-born left-winger on the Football Show.</p>
<p>“Ansu Fati has that mentality in him. He&rsquo;s the youngest player to score for Barcelona in the league, the youngest player in Champions League history to score a goal - and that was at the San Siro against Inter Milan.&quot;</p>
<p>“He&rsquo;s deeply exciting. How he matures and what his attitude to sudden wealth and profile is will determine whether he becomes an absolute stock superstar of European football in the next eight to 10 years. But the repertoire, the mentality is there and, this is absolutely vital; Lionel Messi adores him, thinks very highly of him,” Graham Hunter continued.</p>
<p>The admiration that Messi has for Fati isn&rsquo;t only visible on the pitch but the diminutive Argentinian has also been vocal about it. He wishes to facilitate Fati&rsquo;s growth as Ronaldinho facilitated him in the days of Frank Rijkaard.</p>
<p>“I like him, and I&rsquo;ll try to help him. He is a fantastic player and has what it takes to succeed. But if I look through my eyes, I would like him to have a gradual participation, as it happened to me when I started,” said Messi about Fati.</p>
<p>An iconic striker and Real Madrid legend, Raúl González, also had high words of praise for Ansu Fati.</p>
<p>“There are youngsters who appear out of nowhere and have something different about them. You have to be patient, relaxed, and enjoy them.” Raúl said according to Sport English.</p>
<p>Throughout the season, Fati has tormented defenders on the left flank with his speed and trickery, providing Barcelona with much-needed width and injection of pace. Moreover, Fati has also displayed his impressive temperament despite his young age.</p>
<p>The clarity of mind and the composure he shows in jam-packed regions of the pitch, and especially while shooting, belies his age. The sizzling opener that he scored against Leganes stands a prime testament to Fati&rsquo;s clarity and composure.</p>
<p>While many star names in the recent past, have had cold feet playing the Barcelona way at Camp Nou, the 17-year-old Fati was undaunted by the pressure of expectations.</p>
<p>Riqui Puig is the other Barcelona youngster who has impressed this season</p>
<p>Riqui Puig in his most comfortable habitat - with ball at his feet</p>
<p>Riqui Puig is the other Barcelona youngster who has come across as dauntless, and has grabbed his chances with both hands. Catalan born and bred, Puig, like Fati, is another La Masia graduate whose playing style is instilled with the Barcelona DNA.</p>
<p>Extremely comfortable with the ball at his feet, capable of finding the right pass and being seemingly immune to pressure, Puig oozes with energy and revitalises the game when he&rsquo;s on the field. Like all youngsters, he still has a lot to learn and prove, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be wrong to say that the midfielder possesses traits that are Iniesta-esque.</p>
<p>Puig, who made his La Liga debut last season against Huesca in a goalless draw, has featured 11 times in all competitions for Barcelona this season. He has played 21 times for Barcelona B, tallying two goals and three assists.</p>
<p>However, like Andres Iniesta, who was way more than his numbers, Puig, too,must be viewed through a similar lens. The impact he has had on games after coming on speaks louder than his numbers.</p>

<p>Iniesta&rsquo;s partner-in-crime and another Barcelona legend Xavi Hernández, was also full of appreciation for Puig.</p>
<p>“The truth is that he is a boy who breathes talent. He has self-confidence, personality, does not hide, and asks for the ball,” said the 2010 FIFA World Cup winner after Barecolona&rsquo;s pre-season game against AC Milan.</p>
<p>The then AC Milan manager and legend, Gennaro Gattuso, also wasn&rsquo;t shy of praise for Puig.</p>
<p>“Riqui is spectacular. Even though they (Barcelona) have players that look like kids, the way they handle the ball amazes me. It&rsquo;s the beauty of football. It&rsquo;s like poetry,” Gattuso said during a post-match conference.</p>
<p>Barcelona&rsquo;s biggest criticism under Quique Setien has been that despite having the majority of ball-possession, the team is unable to make any inroads through opposition&rsquo;s defences, and that the team is often found lacking in intensity and energy.</p>
<p>But with both Puig and Fati on the field, FC Barcelona can overcome the issues that have plagued them this season. When the duo play, it is perceptible that they play for the badge. Brimming with self-confidence, they carry with them a vitality that Barcelona have sorely missed in recent times.</p>
<p>The impact Puig and Fati made was prominent in Barcelona&rsquo;s gutsy 1-0 home win against Athletic Bilbao. Setien acknowledged this fact in his post-match conference and said:</p>
<p>“Riqui and Ansu coming on gave us dynamism.”</p>
<p>Yet, Puig and Fati haven&rsquo;t featured as much as they should have. This has baffled many Barcelona fans and experts alike who have questioned Setien&rsquo;s team selection and his substitution tactics, and perhaps rightly so.

<h3 id="riqui-puig-vio-ganar-a-su-barça-b-en-la-tablet">&ldquo;Riqui Puig vio ganar a &lsquo;su&rsquo; Barça B en la tablet&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://estaticos.sport.es/resources/jpg/0/0/riqui-aeropuerto-viendo-barca-1595189978100.jpg" alt="img">
Riqui Puig es un jugador implicado con el Barça y sobre todo con el Barça B, su equipo al que &lsquo;abandona&rsquo; de vez en cuando si Quique Setién le requiere para el primer equipo.</p>
<p>Este es el caso que vivió el centrocampista de Matadepera este domingo. Obligado a viajara a Vitoria para medirse con los &lsquo;mayores&rsquo; al Alavés, Puig no pudo ayudar a sus compañeros en el primer partido del play-off de ascenso que les medía al Valladolid Promesas, partido disputado en Málaga.</p>
<p>Siguiendo el partido en la tablet</p>
<p>Tras finalizar el enfrentamiento ante el Alavés, que acabó con triunfo del los azulgranas por 0-5 con un larguero y dos asistencias del joven centrocampista catalán tras realizar un gran partido, Puig se desplazó junto a la expedición azulgrana al aeropuerto de Vitoria para regresar a casa y se le pudo ver con la tablet sin perder detalle del partido de sus compañeros.</p>
<p>Riqui Puig sufrió de lo lindo al no poder estar con ellos ayudando en el campo, pero respiró tranquilo cuando vio que el equipo de García Pimienta, su equipo, logró la victoria ante el Valladolid Pormesas por 3-2 y pasó a la siguiente eliminatoria.</p>
<p>Pendiente de la segunda eliminatoria</p>
<p>Está por ver si finalmente Riqui puede viajar a Málaga para disputar la segunda eliminatoria tras superar el primer escollo de este play off de ascenso &lsquo;exprés&rsquo; y que se disputa a en sede única y a partido único.

Neste início de sábado (19), o Barcelona se despediu do Campeonato Espanhol, onde terminou na vice-colocação, de maneira honrosa. Goleada de 5 a 0 para cima do Alavés, contra quem ganhou um alento antes do retorno da Champions League: Riqui Puig. O jovem teve grande atuação e foi exaltado pelos culés.</p>
<p>O garoto de 20 anos foi titular e comandou o meio-campo do time de Quique Setién. Além da alta movimentação e da qualidade nos passes, ele quase fez um golaço em chute de fora da área que parou no travessão e distribuiu duas assistências para os companheiros. Uma delas para Lionel Messi marcar um de seus dois gols no jogo.</p>
<p>Nas redes sociais, Puig virou esperança para torcedores e simpatizantes do Barcelona antes do jogo da volta das oitavas de final da Champions League, no próximo dia 08, contra o Napoli. Não somente para o confronto, como também para o futuro do clube. Confira a repercussão com o nome do garoto.</p>

<h3 id="barcelona-riqui-puig-y-ansu-fati-divino-tesoro-para-renacer-la-ilusión">&ldquo;Barcelona: Riqui Puig y Ansu Fati, divino tesoro para renacer la ilusión&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/r/GODO/MD/p7/Barca/Imagenes/2020/07/19/Recortada/1257047704_20200719174545-kkyC-U482405971070TZH-980x554@MundoDeportivo-Web.jpg" alt="img">
Ernesto Valverde se la jugó con Ansu Fati teniendo aún 16 años ante las lesiones de Messi, Suárez y Dembélé y Quique Setién recurrió a Riqui Puig ya viéndose contra las cuerdas en su debut ante el Granada. A falta de alirón para ampliar el ciclo a nueve en 12 años, esta Liga deja como legado dos fichajes de la casa para el nuevo Barça que tanto necesita reducir la masa salarial como la media de edad.</p>
<p>Riqui y Ansu, retenidos por Setién ante la falta de efectivos para no ir al playoff con el filial lo bordaron en Mendizorroza. Talento y hambre al poder. Y más en un contexto como el actual tras perder la Liga y a tres semanas de la Champions League.</p>
<p>Ya que viajaron a Vitoria y no a Málaga, habría quedado mal dejarlos en el banquillo y, como casi siempre, vivieron el partido como si ya fuera el Barça- Nápoles o incluso la soñada final de Lisboa del 23 de agosto. Mucho trecho aún pero ambos contribuyeron a renovar la ilusión y también a que Leo Messi recuperara la sonrisa tras dejarse ir ante el micro el jueves una vez despedido el título.</p>
<p>Riqui avisó antes que nadie en el minuto 3. Un derechazo a lo Arturo Vidal se estrelló en el travesaño, el mismo que repelió luego una volea del chileno. También la madera escupió una rosca con la zurda de Messi, la que se le resiste desde diciembre precisamente ante el Alavés. Todo, para acabar el Barça con 20 postes en esta Liga, más que nadie. Hasta que Leo conectó con los niños. Ansu, en plan ariete, interpretó de cine la 21ª asistencia liguera de Messi en otra muestra de su estado de gracia casi permanente. Son ya siete goles en esta Liga, uno cada 143 minutos. Solo Leo (24), Suárez (16), Griezmann (9) y Vidal (8) acaban la Liga por delante suyo.</p>
<p>Riqui no quiso ser menos y dio más rienda suelta a su calidad dinamizando el juego, rompiendo líneas e incluso pisando área. Allí aguardó la llegada de Messi para regalarle, con su primer pase de gol con los ‘mayores’, el 0-2 que le aseguraba su séptimo ‘Pichichi’ previo a otro abrazo intergeneracional que debe señalar el camino a seguir esta década. Al rato dejó solo a Suárez, que erró ante Roberto y tras el descanso recibió de Leo pero no devolvió la pared al ver llegar a Semedo y dar el 0-4 con otro pase tipo Laudrup o Iniesta. Aún le queda mucho pero, como Ansu, ha llegado para quedarse mucho tiempo.
