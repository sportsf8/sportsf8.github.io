<p>Last week, the New York Times ran an interview with executive Jeffrey Katzenberg, whose most recent venture is Quibi, a watch-on-the-go platform for streaming movies (broken into chapters) and episodic television whose bite-sized installments typically run less than 10 minutes. Since its launch during the pandemic, the app has dropped off the 100 most-downloaded-apps list on the Apple Store, has seen a number of key personnel leave, has already endured a data breach scandal and is about to face a fast-approaching lawsuit over the technology that powers Quibi. In the interview, Katzenberg referred to “hundreds” of people using the app (oof) and blamed its initial shortcomings on the coronavirus. Keep in mind that a few days earlier he talked to internet personality Lights Camera Jackson and said that the launch had been “incredible.”</p>
<p>The failure of Quibi shouldn’t be much of a surprise to anyone who has followed Katzenberg’s career. From his early days at Paramount to the foundation of DreamWorks SKG, few modern executives can share his utter fearlessness and his willingness for experimentation. But with oversized ambition just as often comes historic failure, something that Katzenberg has been faced with time and time again, from the deterioration of DreamWorks and his eventual fire sale of the animation unit to Universal to his latest folly, his dreams are often met equally with bitter disappointment.</p>
<p>And perhaps the brightest spot of his career, that he will, undoubtedly, be the first to point out to anybody that questions him, was his decade-long run at Disney. In particular, Katzenberg’s involvement in the resurrection of Disney’s fabled animation department. (At the time it was on life support and in very real danger of being closed completely.) And it’s true – Katzenberg came in and shook things up. But at the same time a major clarification needs to be made: the so-called Disney Renaissance succeeded in spite of Jeffrey Katzenberg, not because of him.</p>
<p>A former political aid for New York mayoral candidate John Lindsay (who gave him the nickname “Squirt”), he’d risen in the ranks at Paramount, starting as Barry Diller’s assistant and ending up as president of production under President Michal Eisner. When Eisner was brought over to Disney following a lengthy and protracted greenmail attempt by corporate raiders, he brought Katzenberg along. At the time Disney wasn’t even considered a “major” studio, although they seemed to be turning a corner. The year that Katzenberg, Eisner, and Frank Wells (who served as president and COO) gained control of the company, Touchstone Pictures had been founded by then-CEO (and Walt’s son-in-law) Ron Miller to release more mature content that sat comfortably outside of the “Disney” branding. Touchstone’s first release was also the biggest hit in the studio’s history – Splash.</p>
<p>Katzenberg was used to being handed tough assignments; he had successfully brought the Star Trek franchise back from beyond the stars, gamely navigating the actors’ giant egos and the tempestuousness of creator Gene Roddenberry. But returning Disney Animation to its former glory was a different kettle of fish. In the terrific documentary Waking Sleeping Beauty (now streaming on Disney+), Katzenberg recounts how, on his first day at Disney, Eisner pointed him to the Ink &amp; Paint Building and said, “That’s where they make the animated films. That’s your problem.”</p>
<p>Katzenberg first asked to see the studio’s latest animated feature, The Black Cauldron. It was hugely expensive and just as ambitious; pre-production began a decade earlier and it was the first 70mm animated feature since Sleeping Beauty. But it was also, in Katzenberg’s mind, in rough shape. “It was way too dark and violent and scary,” he said in Waking Sleeping Beauty. He asked to see outtakes, unaware that animated films don’t have outtakes. Katzenberg battled producer Joe Hale, replacing songs he considered “old fashioned” and personally removing several minutes of the film. It didn’t matter. The Black Cauldron was the costliest animated film of all time; it made half of what was spent. The Care Bears Movie beat it at the box office.</p>
<p>Retaliation was swift. Hale was fired and the animation department was bumped off the lot and squeezed into a low-hanging building in Glendale (“a gutted wretch of a building,” according to animator Mike Gabriel), near the Walt Disney Imagineering campus. Katzenberg was befuddled by the storyboarding process. At a meeting an animator told Katzenberg they didn’t think he knew what he was doing. Katzenberg was said he was happy to learn. A notorious workaholic, he began scheduling meetings at 6:30 am, sometimes on Sundays. Roger Allers, who would later co-direct The Lion King, recounts in Waking Sleeping Beauty that Katzenberg proclaimed, “I’m not interested in the Academy Awards. I’m interested in the Bank of America awards.” Roy Disney, Walt’s nephew and the technical head of the animation unit, installed Peter Schneider as vice-president, who looked to make the division leaner and more technologically savvy, and aligned himself with Katzenberg.</p>
<p>1986’s The Great Mouse Detective was warmly received but 1988’s Oliver &amp; Company was the film from that period that really bears Katzenberg’s fingerprints. He came up with the idea of doing Oliver Twist in modern day New York and its emphasis on big movie stars, edgy humor and a sense that its general attitude could overcome the film’s technical shortcomings would become the de facto ethos of DreamWorks Animation. It wasn’t a blockbuster but it was an important film in the history of the company since it announced that Disney Animation could be hip, cool, and now. At the press junket for the film, Disney and Katzenberg announced that the studio would be releasing a new animated movie every year. Animator Glen Keane later said in the documentary that the department seemed like it was “being driven by a maniac at the wheel with his foot on the accelerator, driving full speed in a very crowded city.”</p>
<p>The first film of this ambitious plan was The Little Mermaid, a project that Katzenberg had initially rejected, at one of his infamous “Gong Show” Pitch meetings where animators would pitch three ideas and if one of them was “gonged” would have to leave the room, for being too similar to Splash. The company’s first fairy tale in 30 years, it featured music from Howard Ashman (who had provided lyrics to the best song in Oliver &amp; Company) and Alan Menken, a suggestion from Katzenberg confederate David Geffen. In one of the more famous conflicts, Katzenberg took on directors Ron Clements and John Musker, as well as Ashman and Menken, when he wanted to cut “Part of Your World.” It stayed in and was the heart of the movie. The Little Mermaid was a smash.</p>
<p>The studio’s next movie, The Rescuers Down Under, produced using a revolutionary system that replaced the ink and paint department, was placed into development because it was a sequel to the only post-Walt hit, 1977’s The Rescuers. After a disappointing opening weekend, Katzenberg pulled the advertising for the movie. While technically released in the halcyon days of Disney Animation’s resurgence, The Rescuers Down Under was considered a bust. But its technological breakthroughs were widely embraced.</p>
<p>Early in 1991, Katzenberg fired off a memo that would cloud the rest of his career and forever change his relationship with Disney: inspired by the major disappointment of Disney’s costly Dick Tracy, the memo was called “Some Thoughts on Our Business.” It was meant to be internal but was widely circulated and ridiculed. Eisner was furious, both because of the hubris and because of the plagiarism – Eisner had sent a nearly identical manifesto many years earlier while at Paramount. (Years later, Cameron Crowe would say that the memo inspired Jerry Maguire.) A few months after the memo was sent, in a May 1991 article about the making of Disney’s live-action The Marrying Man for Entertainment Weekly, Ryan Murphy (yes, that Ryan Murphy) would talk to Alec Baldwin about the situation. Murphy describes the memo as “gleefully parodied” and Baldwin said a Disney movie “is cheap and looks cheap” (a reference to Disney’s strategy of hiring slightly unpopular talent). Baldwin saved the best dig for Katzenberg: “He’s the eighth dwarf — Greedy.”</p>
<p>The films that followed Rescuers Down Under – Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, went through major (and majorly painful) creative overhauls. Like The Little Mermaid, these movies would both be Oscar winners and Beauty and the Beast would become the first animated feature ever nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award. Katzenberg might not have been interested in the Academy Awards but he got them along with the Bank of America awards (they were huge hits). He also got something else he had been dying for – credit. He was a shameless self-promoter, appearing at press junkets and sitting down for interviews. “As long as he promoted himself around an animated movie, I let it happen,” Eisner said in Waking Sleeping Beauty. “But Roy went nuts.”</p>
<p>In the midst of the success and recognition Katzenberg’s relationship with Eisner and Roy was deteriorating swiftly. At the cast and crew screening of Beauty and the Beast, Eisner had announced that he and Roy were building the animators a brand new, state-of-the-art facility at the lot in Burbank. Katzenberg had never been told of the plans.</p>
<p>The one-movie-a-year mandate that Katzenberg had so bullishly promoted was starting to wear thin. Keane said that animators were developing carpal tunnel syndrome, and everyone was exhausted. Animators told management that they couldn’t successfully maintain families because there was no way to have kids and work at the studio. There was a brain drain but Katzenberg was voracious. There were studios in Florida, Paris, and Burbank. And the executive was working, for the first time, with outside companies to make a pair of oddball experiments – Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas and Pixar’s Toy Story.</p>
<p>And there were two hugely ambitious animated features barreling towards release – The Lion King and Pocahontas, a movie that was famous for getting the quickest-ever greenlight at one of those gong show meetings. Mike Gabriel’s pitch was simply an image of Tiger Lily from Peter Pan with the words “Walt Disney’s Pocahontas” stenciled at the top of the image. It was an immediate “go.” At a breakfast meeting with the teams from both films, Katzenberg made it known that even though they were being produced concurrently, Pocahontas was more important. Lion King, to him, felt iffier. Pocahontas was big, emotional, drama, like West Side Story or Romeo &amp; Juliet. Even though it was about lions, The Lion King was the scrappy underdog.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Katzenberg was pushing the talented animators at Pixar, then housed in a dumpy building in Point Richmond, California, to make one of the lead characters in Toy Story edgier. He wanted the humor to be more adult, sarcastic and barbed; this would be different than the squeaky-clean movies that Disney Animation produced. (Katzenberg’s attitude seemed to many like an about face given his reaction to The Black Cauldron and his cancellation of the original version of Beauty and the Beast.) In a story reel screened in November 1993 what would eventually be known at the studio as “Black Friday,” Woody intentionally shoved Buzz out of Andy’s window. Woody, who would become one of the most universally beloved characters in cinema, was an asshole. (Ham wasn’t very pleasant either.) Everyone was aghast. The film was temporarily shut down. Katzenberg’s instincts, which many thought were razor-sharp when he arrived, had either a) dulled or b) never been there in the first place.</p>
<p>A few months before The Lion King was released, tragedy struck when Frank Wells died tragically in a helicopter accident. If Katzenberg’s memo sent shockwaves through the company, Wells’ death would irrevocably tear everything apart. Long regarded as the peacemaker and the mediator, Wells kept a close eye on the competing egos and oversized personalities at the studio. Now the only man who could keep Roy, Eisner, and Katzenberg happy and working, was gone. While Katzenberg told Eisner that he wanted Wells’ job, Roy refused and threatened a proxy vote if Eisner awarded him the position.</p>
<p>Still, Katzenberg remained at the studio, steadfastly selling their upcoming feature The Lion King. One of the pieces, written by Richard Turner in The Wall Street Journal, supposedly chronicled what life was like at Walt Disney Feature Animation (as it was known then) and the instrumental role of its fearless leader Jeffrey Katzenberg. Animators claimed that much of what Turner saw was staged; in James B. Stewart’s Disney War, he claims that the start of the article, a conversation between Katzenberg and composer Hans Zimmer, was actually a reenactment. They had the conversation earlier. Turner couldn’t tell and his piece was effusive. “Prominent in the Disney formula is Mr. Katzenberg, who, if not exactly the reincarnation of Walt Disney, brings his own blend of passion and obsession to Disney’s mission of creating animated classics,” Turner wrote. In Waking Sleeping Beauty, Katzenberg remembers reading the article, turning to his wife, and saying, “Well, this is over. This is the nail in my coffin.”</p>
<p>And it’s true. The Lion King would open and become a phenomenon; it would become the highest grossing animated movie of all time. It might have been a “B” movie but all of the most exciting young talent at the studio had flocked to it, thanks to its idiosyncratic, Shakespearean storyline and the chance to spend all day drawing animals. But by the end of 1994, Katzenberg would be gone. Pocahontas, the movie Katzenberg had so passionately proclaimed the more important film of the two, was released in 1995 and under-performed, especially in the long, cat-shaped shadow of The Lion King. But Toy Story, released later in 1995, with much nicer characters, was huge.</p>
<p>After he left, he’d still managed to find ways to piss off Disney – as one of the founders of DreamWorks SKG, he created an arms race for talented animators and pouched many of Disney’s top artists. He fast-tracked Antz to come out before Pixar’s A Bug’s Life and left Pixar head John Lasseter incensed. (Later, he would order animators to model Lord Farquaad in Shrek after Eisner.)</p>
<p>Years later, when Katzenberg fought Disney for his rightful share of profits (his contract had an insane clause that guaranteed him 2% in perpetuity for all the films he worked on), the extent to which Katzenberg actually cost the company would have been revealed. As Chairman of Walt Disney Studios, Katzenberg was responsible for overseeing all of the studio’s filmed entertainment, including live-action movies and television. It was Katzenberg who pushed for the acquisition of Miramax, which added prestige to the studio but would up being a costly black-eye, and it was Katzenberg who saw pricey bombs from the studio get released with startling regularity. For every Pretty Woman there was a Billy Bathgate, Dick Tracy, The Distinguished Gentleman or The Rocketeer. That’s what people fail to realize about his time at Disney: while he was making animated hits he was also overseeing complete live-action disasters. In Kim Masters’ great Keys to the Kingdom, she quotes an unnamed executive at the time who said, “Part of the problem is Katzenberg’s taste.” Another executive said, “Jeffrey was involved on a micromanagement level in the movies.” This executive remembers a screening of Straight Talk, where he commented that he didn’t like James Woods’ tie. During the trial, Disney’s lawyer presented documentation that suggested that the live-action films, under Katzenberg, had lost a whopping $231 million for the company. Katzenberg claimed they were all profitable.</p>
<p>In the end, Disney wound up paying Katzenberg (at least) $250 million and Katzenberg got to walk away with the money and the assumption that he was the one who turned around Disney Animation and engineered the films that now carry the title of the so-called Disney Renaissance. He got it all.</p>
<p>The truth, of course, isn’t as easy to explain – the animated films released from the late 1980s to the late 1990s were in part bolstered by Katzenberg’s presence, for sure. But they were also the product of a group of filmmakers that had finally been empowered to create stories of their own, after serving as apprentices to the older animators who worked with Walt and who were still at the studio. (By the early 1990s most had either retired or passed away.) That combination of classical training and new ideas made the movies what they were, and the involvement of overlooked creative principles like producer Don Hahn and songwriters Howard Ashman and Alan Menken cannot be overstated. Eisner and Wells’ shrewd decision to release many of the Disney animated classics on video and show some of them on television at around the same time also energized the medium, as did their investments in the theme parks and television animation (particularly on the burgeoning Disney Channel). And many of the achievements of the division happened in spite of Katzenberg’s demands and input – the early meetings, the jam-jacked schedule, the physically grueling hours that endangered animators and threatened families. (For some reason his micromanaging and second-guessing took a bigger toll on the live-action features, which faltered more often and more spectacularly.) This was the guy that nearly ruined Toy Story and pushed for the marquee value of Bette Midler and Billy Joel. When he left the studio, the animators redesigned the hero from Hunchback of Notre Dame. Katzenberg forbade facial hair on animated characters, so the animators gave Phoebus a golden goatee. It was one of Eisner’s favorite movies.</p>
<p>If the recent Quibi debacle has shown anything, it’s that Katzenberg still pursues his dreams with an unmatched level of determination and aggressiveness. When he was at Paramount he got the nickname “the golden retriever.” It’ll be fascinating to see what he comes back with next.

Students of Camillus Middle School will perform “Shrek the Musical” as their 2019 fall performance.</p>
<p>The story is about a hulking green ogre Shrek (Angelo Procopio) who, after being mocked and feared his entire life by anything that crossed his path, retreats to an ugly green swamp to exist in happy isolation.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gang of homeless fairy-tale creatures, including Pinocchio (Ty Harte), Gingy (Joanna Ray), Mama Bear (Madeleine Barstow), Papa Bear (Jonah Grothier), Peter Pan (Jason Szakacs), The Big Bad Wolf (George Kazantsev) and many more, raid his sanctuary, saying they’ve been evicted by the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad (Nathan Smith).</p>
<p>So, Shrek strikes a deal: I’ll get your homes back, if you give me my home back. On his way to meet Lord Farquaad, he saves his soon-to-be side-kick, Donkey (Daniel Alvaro), from the Captain of the Guards (John Diem) and his guards.</p>
<p>However, when Shrek and Farquaad meet, the Lord strikes a deal of his own: He’ll give the fairy-tale creatures their homes back, if Shrek rescues Princess Fiona (Cindy Schlenker).</p>
<p>While attempting to save the Princess, he and Donkey discover a fire-breathing Dragon (Amelia Rufa) who protects her from would be suitors. Shrek saves Fiona and finds something strange and different &ndash; about this pretty princess. He likes her, a lot. But why does she always run off when the sun sets?</p>
<p>Performances will be 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday, November 7 and 8, and 2 p.m. Saturday, November 9, 2019, at the school, 5525 Ike Dixon Road, Camillus, NY 13031.</p>

<h3 id="uga-baptist-collegiate-ministries-begins-first-night-of-shrek-the-musical-performances">&ldquo;UGA Baptist Collegiate Ministries begins first night of &lsquo;Shrek The Musical&rsquo; performances&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/redandblack.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/5d/f5d5c504-5ab5-11ea-b24a-b72351c29d94/5e59f93ecc4f9.image.jpg?resize=912%2C630" alt="img">
Who would’ve thought that a scary and cynical ogre, a not-so-proper princess and a bold, mouthy donkey would make such a perfect team?</p>
<p>The University of Georgia Baptist Collegiate Ministries performed its opening night of “Shrek the Musical” on Feb. 28 at The Morton Theatre.</p>
<p>Based on the 2001 DreamWorks Animation film “Shrek,” the Tony award-winning musical follows the journey of the titular slimy green ogre with a pessimistic view on life. Under orders from Lord Farquaad, Shrek embarks on a mission to rescue Princess Fiona from a faraway castle — an adventure that will change Shrek’s life forever.</p>
<p>The story begins with a young 7-year-old Shrek being pushed out into the “Big, Bright, Beautiful World” of Duloc — a place where his parents warn him he will not be accepted because of the way he looks. This kicks off Shrek’s physical and mental quest toward self acceptance.</p>
<p>Ethan Norfleet, a sophomore biology major at UGA, portrayed Shrek through the character’s mental metamorphosis. From sulking in solitude in his swamp to dancing alongside fairytale misfits like Pinochio and the Gingerbread man, Shrek showed to be a dynamic character who effectively delivered the show’s overall message.</p>
<p>Doug Goodin, the director of the show, said he has experienced a journey similar to that of Shrek while growing up. Goodin chose to direct “Shrek the Musical” in hopes its message could help audience members also going through struggles of self love.</p>
<p>”Everyone at some point in their life has felt like an outcast,” Goodin said, a junior political science and theater double major. “You are exactly the way that you were intended to be. As long as you like you, that’s all that matters.”</p>
<p>Although the show established a very serious and heartfelt message, “Shrek the Musical” was also full of comedic scenes and dance numbers that had ensued laughter.</p>
<p>Though the antagonist of the story, Lord Farquaad brought a smile to each viewer’s face during his performances, partly because the actor portraying the character performed entirely on his knees. Farquaad’s costume had fake legs to create the illusion of a child-sized height. Chase Robertson, the actor who played Farquaad, held in laughter during certain scenes.</p>
<p>“The legs are so ridiculous that I don’t even have to really try [to be funny],” Robertson said, a 2019 Southern Polytechnic State University graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering. “I grew up really short as a kid, so I guess I channeled my inner angst of being short.”</p>
<p>Audrey Throckmorton, a senior early childhood education major at UGA, also found many parallels between herself and her character, Princess Fiona.</p>
<p>“I’m such a hopeless romantic,” Throckmorton said. “I just live through that fairy tale — perfect happy ending.”</p>
<p>Throckmorton and her castmates endured six weeks of practically “living under a rock” while preparing for the show, Throckmorton said. All of the countless hours of hard work seemed to pay off as audience members were blown away by the cast’s lively performance.</p>
<p>Anne Henley Walker, a senior journalism major at UGA, grew up listening to the “Shrek the Musical” soundtrack with her sister. Walker and her friends spontaneously decided to buy tickets to the show, and they were pleasantly surprised at how much they enjoyed watching one of their favorite childhood stories come to life.</p>
<p>“Everyone&rsquo;s energy was kept up through the entire show,” Goodin said. “It went off exactly the way I wanted it to go, and I am so happy about that.”</p>
<p>The show will run through Feb. 28 to March 1. Tickets are $15 for students and children and $22 for adults. Proceeds will go toward student mission trips.

<h3 id="beck-center-for-the-arts-returns-to-shrek-the-musical-dec-6-through-jan-5">&ldquo;Beck Center for the Arts returns to ‘Shrek the Musical’ Dec. 6 through Jan. 5&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/Wi8KMxBOMg-vQ0JV0mts78C_wyc=/1280x0/filters:focal(1290x1057:1300x1047)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/T64C4ECN55D2HAKAFUF6YNAH7U.jpg" alt="img">
LAKEWOOD, Ohio &ndash; Friendship and loyalty are ultimately the themes behind “Shrek the Musical,” which returns for the second year in a row Dec. 6 through Jan. 5 at the Beck Center for the Arts’ Mackey Theater.</p>
<p>The same is also true for Gilgamesh Taggett, a former Beck Center actor who plays the ogre yet again at the Detroit Avenue theater.</p>
<p>“I was eager to return for year two because it’s such an interesting character, with the friendship with Donkey, the love that he and Fiona find, and the individuality and strength of these so-called freaks,” said national touring actor Taggett, a Michigan native and former Cleveland resident who now calls New York City home.</p>
<p>“It’s a beautiful story, and it’s great for children and adults alike. That makes it a perfect holiday show.”</p>
<p>Last year’s production was the first time that Taggett, who from 2003 to 2011 taught at the Beck Center, was involved in the Tony Award-winning Broadway production that tells the tale of Shrek, Fiona, Donkey and Lord Farquaad.</p>
<p>In fact, playing Shrek can be directly tied back to Taggett’s appearance as Oliver Warbucks in a 2012 Beck Center production of “Annie.” That role represented a major leap forward in his career tackling leading and meatier parts.</p>
<p>From there, he spent three years on the international tours of “Annie” and “Amazing Grace.” It was during a 2016 tour stop in Cleveland of the former that the Beck Center first reached out to Taggett about playing Shrek.</p>
<p>“I loved the original movie so much it made me pick up the musical script to see the differences,” Taggett said. “Because I was a heavy kid growing up, I was a little different than everybody else in my own way. It really spoke to me. To be able to breathe life into this character has been a real exciting time.”</p>
<p>As far as returning to the Beck Center for another run of “Shrek the Musical,” Taggett said, despite being glued inside a warm mask for hours on end, there was never any hesitation.</p>
<p>“The beauty of returning for the second year for me was it really solidified an aspect of my career that has matched what the Beck has done for me &ndash; loyalty,” Taggett said.</p>
<p>“I taught a lot of classes there. I have so much love for that theater, for both my experiences there educationally, as well as my career professionally performing. So, of course, being able to come back and do this again is a thrill.”</p>

<h3 id="grotesque-shrek-is-a-monster-success-at-musicals-at-richter-in-danbury">&ldquo;Grotesque Shrek is a Monster Success at Musicals at Richter in Danbury&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.hamlethub.com/hhresized/500/4677/201908/ShrekProdDHShrekDonkeyFionaMakeAMove-1564684188.jpg" alt="img">
Prev</p>
<p>1 of 2</p>
<p>of Next</p>
<p>Shrek is one of those productions that is tailor made for summer breaks, creative artists, and community, and at Musicals at Richter in Danbury, it has made a happy, swampy home.</p>
<p>Many remember “Shrek!” as a 1990 picture book by writer and cartoonist William Steig, where typical folk tale components are given a sardonic rinse: the focus is firmly on the antihero who is feared and loathed by the townspeople&ndash;who represent the reader/audience&ndash;yet he finds he is perfectly content with himself, “warts and all,” and needs no transformation on his journey, not even for love. The moral is neither “be nice and nice things will happen to you,” nor is it “change yourself and people will like you.” Instead, it is more “your vibe attracts your tribe.” This credo carried into the Oscar-winning Dreamworks eponymous (minus the exclamation point) film, which went a step further by up-ending the antiquated princess tropes around helplessness and beauty concepts, and additionally acknowledging that animosity can be experienced by anyone considered different and viewed as a threat to the homogeneity of those in power, ogre or otherwise.</p>
<p>With a brassy score by Jeanine Tesori (“Thoroughly Modern Millie,” “Caroline, or Change,” “Fun Home”) and cheeky book and lyrics by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (Kimberly Akimbo, Rabbit Hole, High Fidelity the Musical), Shrek echoes the intention of the film and further empowers characters of all stories to embrace their weirdness and enjoy their lives. This spirit is taken for a delightful spin as director Lindsay O’Neil assembles an enormous cast to deliver joy, laughter, and postmodern sass in a classic Broadway package. There are powerhouses at every turn, and even in an ensemble of all ages and experience levels, the most novice performers add to the sparkle of this show. A phenomenal pit, under the musical direction of Dan Koch and housed in a tent at the side of the audience, thoroughly delights in Tesori’s fairytale material and supports the singers uniformly (despite the periodic sound/audio glitches).</p>
<p>The open forest set designed by O’Neil and RJ Bogues perfectly coordinates with Richter’s outdoor audience space and is an ideal arena for a cadre of characters to craft a tale. As we open, Shrek’s parents (impeccably sung by Missy Slaymaker-Hanlon and the criminally under-acknowledged Daniel Satter, who brighten and lighten the action whenever they are on stage) is banished to live on his own on his seventh birthday, while the princess is sent to live in a tower by her parents (solidly sung by Robert Geils and Denise Milmerstadt), complete with a hideous curse that can only be lifted by the kiss of her true love, naturally, and guarded by a dragon, because that is the plot of all story princesses before her.</p>
<p>Soon, nearly every storybook character ever is squatting in Shrek’s swamp with woes of eviction from the ruling Lord Farquaad (Roger Grace, substantially tucking his towering torso into the finatical fop’s four-foot frame). A deal is made that if a marriageable princess is delivered to Lord Farquaad, he will allow the fairy tale characters to return to their homes and leave Shrek in peace in his stinky shelter.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Kevin Bielmeier shows he is more than adept at embodying the titular ogre, and maneuvers his customary swath and Scottish brogue with organic ease. A character that is descibed with such (delicious) lyrics as “when you are grotesque, life is Kafkaesque” paint Shrek as a tragic and ostracized curmudgeon, yet Bielmeier’s Shrek settles in his gooey green guts with affable humor and heroic hubris. In fact, the one thing the audience isn’t, is afraid of the stout fellow. He is a joy to watch and hear, particularly in “Who I’d Be,” and “When Words Fail.”</p>
<p>Shrek’s equitably outcast but desperately optimistic counterpart is the marvelous Princess Fiona. We meet three ages of the cursed ingenue in “I Know It’s Today”: the polished beyond her years Abigail Rivas as Young Fiona, the vocally vivacious Madison Beilmeier as Teen Fiona, working her strong alto until it lands with Emily Walsh as the adult Fiona, stretching her belt through this tricky song and fully harmonic with her two “selves” in a top notch trio.</p>
<p>As fairytales are big on trios (we meet the Three Bears, the Three Little Pigs, and Three Blind Mice among a forest of famous folktale friends), the “big three” are Shrek, Fiona, and a mysterious talking Donkey with the comedic sensibilities of Eddie Murphy who is among the evicted and additionally shunned withing the fairytale community. As a role, Donkey is the epitome of the wacky sidekick and given that he was written with specific Murphy DNA (many jokes, deliveries, and plot points were improvised by him in the 2001 film), is always in danger of being played as a one-dimensional mascot whose suit never quite fits. The blessing of the production is the perky and perfect Teah Renzi, who gives Donkey a sweet and sincere spin. She sings up the octave for songs originally nestled in Daniel Breaker’s Broadway baritone and nails every one of them. Her riff at the end of “Don’t Let Me Go” is sensational.</p>
<p>Before Shrek finally finds the fair Fiona, he must outwit, outlast, and not be out-barbecued by the guardian dragon, who is without the clunky puppet in this production and portrayed fabulously by Fiona Bryson. In addition to being a situational setup song, “Forever” serves as Dragon’s soulful vehicle to set her sites on Donkey as a romantic partner. Surrounded by cleverly choreographed Flames, Dragon and Donkey ignite the unconventional fires of romance. Manipulation, violence, and sexual aggression are not the healthiest beginning to a relationship, but that’s another story.</p>
<p>Regarding the FIames squad, praise to choreographer Lindsay T. Miller for all of the dances in this production. From Grace’s entrance as Farquaad’s (highlighted by an unintentional and hilarious train whistle), he is tasked with maintaining tall confidence in a short stature, shuffling tiny legs in a full company dance number. Extra credit to him for being able to speak after that number, let alone sing. Then, from the precise cuckoo-clockery of the Duloc ensemble, to the Temptations uniformity of the imprisoned knights, to the best darn tappers in the Pied Piper (stellar dance captain Viola Minor)’s Rat line, and colored throughout with solid elements of classic Broadway dance, Shrek’s choreography is a mini-master class.</p>
<p>In a play where fantasy is mandatory, fairy tale costumes may be, for lack of a better word, too costumey, a cheeky interpretation is most appreciated. Costumes by Sarah Daleo are charming and cohesive, but especially fun when sidestepping the expected to tell a supplemental story: the Pigs with suitcases that correspond with their house materials; the attempted drag of the Big Bad Wolf, Dragon’s sequins scales, the Bears’ fur jackets, Pinocchio’s exquisite wood appendage detail (which may be a combination of costume and makeup).</p>
<p>A note about makeup in a show full of imaginary creatures: MAR has no indication of a makeup coordinator in the program, so while it took a bit more time than preferable for Fiona to green and de-greenify, accolades to whomever had any hand in creating the faces and features of the creatures in this production.</p>
<p>As we are mentioning our boy Pinocchio, strength to Weston Pytel for singing and acting through Pin’s heinous (mandatory) falsetto. In “Story of My Life,” we are given first glimpses of the immense talent that is generously sown through this show, startng with the glorious vocals of Sydney Gershon as the Ugly Duckling, Ella Zamek as the Elf, and Emma Lubber as Peter Pan. “Freak Flag” shoots more comets across the stage in brilliant solos: Daisy Stott has the vocal glamour of the Sugar Plum Fairy while puppeteering the Gingerbread Man (Gingy) on a sheet pan and alternating characters with hilarious pluck. She also has solid dramatic moments in the comedic “muffin man” exchange. Denise Milmerstadt then gets the big finish verse and polishes it with panache.</p>
<p>This production has the good fortune to have a cast that is willing and able to participate anywhere and as anything required and give it their presumed all as they deliver the multitude of visual gags and witty remarks flying through this play. The cast is rounded out by Dolly Conner, who takes a scene as the Bishop, with no identified comedic bits or folklore, and performs with clarity, as well as Rachel Koch, Brenda Schoenfeld and Steve Stott as the Three hilariously German Little Pigs, Kevin and Carolyn McCarthy as Big Bad Wolf (with one of the best lyrics regarding his dress) and Wicked Witch respectively, Ethan Berger as Farquaad’s lackey Thelonious, Rose Giardiello as Baby Bear, Donovan Koch as assorted short people, and dancers Domenic Burns and Michaela Milmerstadt.</p>
<p>Shrek the Musical continues to wave its freak flag at Musicals at Richter until August 10. Bring a picnic to enjoy when the grounds open at 7 PM before the 8 PM “curtain.” Audiences are encouraged to bring chairs and blankets for lawn seating, while a limited number of chairs are available free of charge at the concession area. Don’t forget your chosen method of bug repellent! (Thanks to Priscilla Squiers for lending me hers!)</p>

Wesley Slade as Shrek in Shrek, The Musical</p>
<p>Photo by Rodrigo Balfanz</p>
<p>Slow Burn Theatre Company begins its 10th season with an ogre-ific musical about self-acceptance and letting your freak flag fly. Shrek, The Musical, which opened on October 26 at the Broward Center&rsquo;s Amaturo Theater, gives audiences the perfect blend of heart and gross-out humor.</p>
<p>With libretto by David Lindsay-Abaire (Rabbit Hole) and music by Jeanine Tesori (Thoroughly Modern Millie, Fun Home), Shrek, The Musical premiered at New York&rsquo;s Broadway Theatre in December of 2008, where it would run for 441 performances. The Broadway production was nominated for eight Tony Awards®, winning one for Best Costume Design.</p>
<p>Based on the Oscar®-winning DreamWorks animated film of the same name, this musical tells the unorthodox fairy tale of an ogre named Shrek (Wesley Slade) and his sidekick Donkey (Reynel Reynaldo) as they attempt to rescue the beautiful but hot-headed Princess Fiona (Kimmi Johnson) from her prison of a tower. Will Fiona find her true love in the vertically challenged but handsome Lord Farquaad (Clay Cartland), or will she continue to transform into an ogress nightly?</p>
<p>Slade plays the title ogre with a level of charisma matched only by Broadway veterans like Nathan Lane and Brian d&rsquo;Arcy James (who originated the role). His smooth and warm high baritone voice does not disappoint, especially during numbers like &ldquo;Who I&rsquo;d Be&rdquo; and &ldquo;When Words Fail.&rdquo; Slade also maintains dynamic relationships with Reynaldo&rsquo;s Donkey and Johnson&rsquo;s Princess Fiona. His chemistry with Johnson is especially apparent during the song &ldquo;I Think I Got You Beat,&rdquo; where the two protagonists reveal their difficult childhoods to each other.</p>
<p>Johnson, who previously appeared in Slow Burn&rsquo;s productions of Freaky Friday and Legally Blonde, showcases her strong mezzo-soprano voice in the role of Princess Fiona. Even her higher belt notes in the song &ldquo;I Know It&rsquo;s Today&rdquo; are well-supported. Johnson gives Fiona the right touch of crassness to her archetypically classy character. She seems to have fun in her role as &ldquo;a mess of contradictions in a dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During &ldquo;I Know It&rsquo;s Today,&rdquo; Johnson is supported by two young actresses who play juvenile versions of her royal role-Ellie Rose Pulsifer (as Young Fiona) and Miranda Ferreira (as Teen Fiona). In this number, all three princesses are fantasizing about their ideal &ldquo;happily ever after,&rdquo; where they are rescued by a white knight with his noble steed. Both performers display poised stage presence, and Ferreira gets to showcase her spot-on comic timing during her verse of the song.</p>
<p>Cartland&rsquo;s Lord Farquaad is nothing short (yes, I said short) of a tour-de-force! Cartland may be performing on his knees throughout the show, but his resonant Shakespearean voice with crisp diction makes him stand tall onstage. Whether he is meticulously torturing the Gingerbread Man or leading the ensemble in the show-stopping &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Up, Duloc,&rdquo; Cartland&rsquo;s onstage antics are no small feat.</p>
<p>Reynaldo&rsquo;s flamboyant performance as Donkey keeps audiences laughing throughout the show. As an actor, Reynaldo&rsquo;s energy, dynamic facial expressions, and physicality easily compensate for rushed lines and muddled diction. Despite this, he still delivers a heartfelt rendition of the song &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Let Me Go,&rdquo; where Donkey professes his devotion to his newfound friend in Shrek.</p>
<p>The show&rsquo;s ensemble of 16, who play Lord Farquaad&rsquo;s henchmen and various fairytale characters, come in many shapes and sizes. Their collective energy keeps audiences engaged, even with the principals offstage. Several standout performances from the show&rsquo;s fairytale freaks include Trevor Wayne, Kristi Rose Mills and Cindy Pearce.</p>
<p>Wayne unofficially takes charge of the fairytale ensemble as the wooden boy Pinocchio with his gravely falsetto and quick wit. While Mills maintains a cute demeanor as the Sugar Plum Fairy, her puppetry skills and no-nonsense toughness shine through as she voices and operates the Gingerbread Man puppet. As Mama Bear and the voice of the dragon (another puppet operated by three actors in black), Pearce showcases her soulful and earth-shaking belt voice, especially during the power ballad &ldquo;Forever&rdquo; as the Dragon.</p>
<p>Slow Burn artistic director Patrick Fitzwater stages and choreographs this musical spectacle. As a director, he fleshes out a three-dimensional story arc in a two-dimensional fairytale environment. While the choreographic vocabulary in this production is closer to movement than actual dance, there are several moments where actors can showcase their technical prowess. Some of the sharpest dancing of the evening appears in the Act Two opener, &ldquo;Morning Person,&rdquo; where Princess Fiona performs a tap dance break (a la 42nd Street) with a chorus line of rats.</p>
<p>Scenic designer Kelly James Tighe utilizes colorful and flat set pieces to enhance Fitzwater&rsquo;s vision of an illustrated children&rsquo;s storybook. Every scenic element from the trees of the swamp to Fiona&rsquo;s tower and Farquaad&rsquo;s castle are made entirely out of well-painted luan drops. Costume coordinator Dawn Shamburger and makeup designer Andrew Rodriguez-Triana pay close attention to detail in recreating Tim Hatley&rsquo;s Tony-winning costumes from the Broadway production.</p>
<p>Slow Burn continues to display their ability to make magic onstage with Shrek, The Musical. As a critic and avid theatergoer, it was a joy to see parents bringing their children to see this show. For many, it was their first time attending the theater. With beautifully crafted production values and performances by some of the finest actors in South Florida, this production of Shrek, The Musical may be the perfect introduction to musical theater for audience members of all ages.</p>
