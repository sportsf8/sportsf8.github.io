<p>BEIRUT: Two suicides in Lebanon on Friday, apparently linked to the country’s spiralling economic downturn, sparked angry protests over the government’s handling of the crisis.</p>
<p>A 61-year-old man from the eastern region of Hermel shot himself outside a cafe on a busy Beirut shopping street shortly before noon, leaving a Lebanese flag, a note and a copy of his clean criminal record at the scene.</p>
<p>Shocked onlookers said that his suicide was linked to the economic crisis that has been ravaging the country.</p>
<p>“He killed himself because of hunger,” the man’s cousin screamed as the security forces carried away the body.</p>
<p>The death sparked street protests in Beirut’s Hamra neighborhood, denouncing the government for its handling of the country’s worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war.</p>
<p>“He did not commit suicide, he was killed in cold blood,” read one sign.</p>
<p>Protesters denounced “a government that does not represent them and does not care about inflation, the high dollar exchange rate and power outages.”</p>
<p>A second suicide, by an unemployed van driver near the southern city of Sidon, was also apparently linked to the economic collapse, according to local officials.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old man hanged himself in his home in the town of Jadra and his body was found early on Friday.</p>
<p>Officials said the man, who was married and had a daughter, was struggling financially.</p>
<p>The protests come amid a currency collapse, with the Lebanese pound reaching more than 9,000 to the dollar this week on the black market.</p>
<p>Prices have soared almost as fast as the exchange rate has plummeted, leaving companies, institutions and small businesses with little room to maneuver.</p>
<p>Growing anger among the population prompted Jan Kubis, UN special coordinator for Lebanon, to issue a warning to government officials.</p>
<p>“Do not count on the endless patience of the Lebanese. They have faced enough of the complete absence of reforms, starting with the electricity sector, of the lack of unified vision and effort to deal with the collapse and their growing misery,” he tweeted.</p>
<p>Hopes of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) rescue package also dimmed, with Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni saying negotiations “are on hold, awaiting Lebanon’s implementation of reforms.”</p>
<p>Political differences have halted reforms demanded by the international community to pull the country out of its financial crisis.</p>
<p>Wazni called for “a unified approach between the government and Parliament,” saying there was “no time for delay.”</p>
<p>Disagreements over the government’s submission to the IMF have led to calls for Prime Minister Hassan Diab’s government to quit and former leader Saad Hariri to head a new leadership.</p>
<p>However, Hariri said that “the password for rescue is reform.”</p>
<p>He told reporters on Thursday that his conditions for heading the government “have not changed, so the work style must be changed and quotas must end.”</p>
<p>Referring to Hezbollah, he said: “We cannot understand how a government is asking Arabian Gulf countries to provide money to Lebanon when, within this government, there are people who clap when a Houthi missile hits Riyadh or any region in Saudi Arabia. Logic says that the two things do not go together.”</p>
<p>Hariri added: “There is a movement (the Free Patriotic Movement) that wants to quarrel with everyone in the Cabinet, whether Amal Movement, Saad Hariri, Walid Jumblatt, or the Lebanese Forces. How will the government function?”</p>
<p>The former prime minister said that he “is not at odds with President Michel Aoun or anyone else” — referring to the head of the Free Patriotic Movement, Gebran Bassil.</p>
<p>Hariri said that supported a financial crime audit of the central bank “because we have nothing to hide.”

Can Putin’s Syria peace plea reconcile Tehran and Ankara?</p>
<p>ANKARA: Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged his counterparts in Turkey and Iran to encourage peaceful dialogue between rival forces in Syria in a bid to end the country’s bitter 9-year war.</p>
<p>Speaking during a televised video conference with Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Hassan Rouhani on July 1, the Russian leader said: “An inclusive inter-Syrian dialogue should be actively promoted within the framework of the constitutional committee in Geneva. I propose to support this process, to help the participants to meet and start a direct dialogue.”</p>
<p>To what extent the three countries can agree on genuine political transition remains unclear, however, especially with Ankara and Tehran supporting vastly different regional agendas.</p>
<p>But Galip Dalay, a visiting scholar at the University of Oxford, believes one thing is certain: In Idlib, the so-called “Astana three” have effectively become the “Astana two,” with Ankara and Moscow excluding Iran.</p>
<p>“This, in turn, gives Iran added motivation to undermine any Turkish-Russian deal,” he told Arab News.</p>
<p>“While both Iran and Turkish interests are aligned when it comes to opposing the territorial disintegration of Syria and a larger US role, their priorities conflict almost on everything else,” he said.</p>
<p>“They can try to keep a conflict management process on track, but the divergence between them is only getting larger.”</p>
<p>Russia and Iran have been the main supporters of President Bashar Assad’s regime, while Turkey backs the opposition. The three countries began cooperating to reduce the fighting in Syria as part of a diplomatic process dating back to 2017.</p>
<p>Bedir Mulla Reshid, a researcher at the Omran Center for Strategic Studies in Istanbul, said that Iran and Turkey have been in indirect confrontation on Syria since the civil war began.</p>
<p>“Turkey has supported the Syrian political and military opposition, both in the face of the Assad regime and the sectarian militias sent to Syria by Iran. As for Iran, from the first day it stood beside Assad regime, and is one of the two main parties that refused to allow the regime to fall,” he told Arab News.</p>
<p>During the televised video conference, Rouhani again pledged his country’s support for the “legal government of Bashar Assad.”</p>
<p>The next trilateral meeting between the guarantor countries is expected to be held in Iran, but a date has yet to be specified.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a third round of Syrian constitutional committee talks overseen by the UN are set to be held next month.</p>
<p>The 150-member committee, which was launched in Geneva on October 2019, includes Syrian government and opposition leaders, as well as civic representatives.</p>
<p>Ankara has stopped the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), which it considers a terror group, from taking part in the Geneva talks.</p>
<p>According to Reshid, Iran hopes to strengthen its influence in Syria through its military militias and relief institutions.</p>
<p>Joe Macaron, a Middle East foreign policy analyst at the Washington-based Arab Center, said that regional dynamics, especially the US Caesar Act sanctions on Syria, “make it difficult to imagine a path forward to reach a political settlement.”</p>
<p>The Caesar Act entered into force on June 17, 2020, with sanctions targeting the Syrian government for war crimes.</p>
<p>“Idlib remains a contentious issue between Turkey and Russia, while competition continues between Moscow and Washington in northeast Syria,” Macaron told Arab News.</p>
<p>He said that the rival countries “seem to be interested in buying time to consolidate their influence” and are not ready to resolve the conflict under the current terms.</p>
<p>However, the Syrian regime’s willingness to implement a political transition by giving concessions is also open to doubt.</p>
<p>“Damascus blocked the political process and tried to disrupt committee meetings in Geneva,” Anton Mardasov, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute’s Syria program, told Arab News.</p>
<p>“This whole process is a fiction, which Russia is trying to demonstrate under the guise of a real compromise,” he added.</p>
<p>Mardasov believes that a compromise solution is unlikely in a short term, with presidential elections due in Syria and Iran in 2021.</p>
<p>“Moscow is trying to return to the idea of ​​a transitional government. The main focus of the negotiations between Turkey and Russia seems to be about the eastern part of Syria. Moscow is likely to approve Ankara’s operations to put pressure on the Kurds again,” he said.

The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.</p>
<p>Bewildered and scared, Ife, an Ethiopian domestic worker, explains how a few hours ago she thought she was on her way to Beirut airport. “So you can fly home,” her cash-strapped employer had said while pushing her out of the car in front of the Ethiopian embassy.</p>
<p>“It was a lie,” whispers the 24-year-old, clutching her belongings like a lifebuoy.</p>
<p>“I cried and cried because I haven’t been paid since January. I have no money. I have a son.”</p>
<p>Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines</p>
<p>Ife only has one option: sleep rough alongside a dozen other Ethiopian women also dumped by their employers in front of the consulate in Beirut, and beg to be repatriated home. They are among a growing number of migrant workers in Lebanon that have been abandoned by their bosses who, amid an unprecedented economic collapse, cannot afford to pay their salaries.</p>
<p>Most of the workers interviewed by The Independent say they have not been paid since January when Lebanon’s financial woes began to bite, and so few have the resources to get home. Many also do not have their passports. Under the country’s abusive kafala system, which rights groups say traps them into forced labour and abuse, migrant workers in Lebanon cannot change jobs or leave without permission of their employer, who often withholds their documents.</p>
<p>And so, without rights, funds, and passports, Lebanon’s quarter of a million migrant domestic workers are among the most vulnerable in the country’s economic crash.</p>
<p>This Is Lebanon, an organisation that shames abusive employers, says its caseload has more than doubled over the last few months as the crisis deepened. It is so overwhelmed by calls for help that staff now have to turn away women who have been unpaid for less than seven months.</p>
<p>“It’s awful but we have to tell them we can’t help you any more,” Patricia, a spokeswoman, tells The Independent. “We’re saying the only way is to cut their losses and try to get home.”</p>
<p>And so the group outside the embassy, sleeping amid their suitcases, wait each day for news of a flight home.</p>
<p>“Everything got so much worse these days. No is getting paid,” says Hayat, 21, who was dumped by her employer four days ago.</p>
<p>“Now I’m sleeping here, I have no passport, no money, I have my pyjamas only.”</p>
<p>Lebanon’s embattled local and immigrant population has been sucker-punched by a staggering financial crisis that could become so severe, experts warn many may starve.</p>
<p>Grounded in decades of chronic mismanagement and corruption, Lebanon saw its economic woes crescendo in October, sparking a revolution. The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic in March, which shuttered businesses and halted already dwindling remittances, only made matters worse.</p>

<p>For years, the central bank and successive governments have used the banking system to finance the state, in what critics say is a national equivalent to a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>Amid a growing liquidity crisis, the government shut people out of their dollar accounts in the autumn, crippling households and businesses. Three-quarters of deposits to banks in the country are made in dollars.</p>
<p>Blocks from accounts have driven up demand for the US currency and sent the lira into an unprecedented tailspin.</p>
<p>The lira has lost nearly 85 per cent of its value since the start of May and is now trading at over 9,000 to the dollar despite being officially pegged at 1,500.</p>
<p>In fact, the country is just weeks away from official hyperinflation, according to Steve H Hanke, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University and a world expert on the subject. He says if this does happen, it will mark the first-time hyperinflation has ever occurred in the Middle East and only the 61st time it has happened in history.</p>
<p>Right now, he says Lebanon’s inflation rate is more than 500 per cent year-on-year, and 124 per cent compared to last month.</p>
<p>“Lebanon is in a death spiral,” Mr Hanke continues, warning of a situation like Venezuela, which he says is the only country in the world to be experiencing hyperinflation right now. “The government must stop the raging inferno of the currency crisis.”</p>
<p>But little has been done. Food prices change so fast that most shops have stopped putting price tags on items.</p>
<p>Supermarkets have started rationing key purchases, such as baby supplies, as the public has rushed to get supplies before prices rise too much.</p>
<p>Hunger is setting in.</p>
<p>Facebook posts have been shared online showing families trying to barter clothes and shoes for food and cooking oil. An unverified video shared online on Thursday purported to show a man in a surgical mask robbing a pharmacy at gunpoint for nappies in western Beirut.</p>
<p>On Friday, two Lebanese men in different parts of the country committed suicide due to hunger and the economic crisis. One of them shot himself outside Dunkin’ Donuts in Beirut’s busy shopping district of Hamra. He left a copy of his clean criminal record on his chest, with a note reading “I am not a heretic”, local media reported.</p>
<p>The problem is that food items, particularly imported goods, are now too expensive. In one Beirut supermarket this week, a medium jar of Nescafe coffee was being sold for 70,000 lira – which is $47 (£38) on the official exchange rate. A large bag of low-quality processed pizza cheese there was 75,000 lira, which is pushing $50 (£40).</p>
<p>Even staples like sugar, cereals and beans have more than doubled, according to the Consultation and Research Institute.</p>
<p>Martin Keulertz, assistant professor in the food security programme at the American University of Beirut, warned that amid soaring prices, three-quarters of Lebanon’s 6 million population will be relying on food handouts by the end of the year.</p>
<p>People can barely afford one meal per day&hellip; There will be food riots Martin Keulertz, assistant professor at the American University of Beirut</p>
<p>But even then, given the country imports 80 per cent of its food, therefore relying on the fast-disappearing dollars, there may be nothing to hand out.</p>
<p>“Already people can barely afford one meal per day and even then, it’s potatoes and lentils,” he tells The Independent.</p>
<p>“The international community needs to step up now to avoid an all-out crisis. We are going to have a difficult winter. There will be food riots.”</p>
<p>An injection of foreign cash looks unlikely, as previous donors like France, the United States, Britain and the Gulf, are no longer willing to bail out the country without reforms.</p>
<p>The Lebanese government is pinning some hope on a loan from the International Monetary Fund. But despite weeks of discussions, neither side has managed to agree to the size of the country’s losses, let alone how to recover them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the authorities have done little to firefight other burgeoning crises like fuel shortages which have sparked punishing days-long electricity cuts in many parts of the country. The power outages were so great in Bint Jbeil, in south Lebanon, they caused water shortages as the pumps stopped working. In response, Lebanon’s energy minister Raymond Ghajar urged citizens not to panic-buy candles.</p>
<p>Ensnared in the teeth of the tornado are the poorest and the most vulnerable, like the migrant workers. Rights groups expect many will try to leave as conditions worsen but also fear many more, who are being subjected to increasingly violent levels of abuse, will be locked up at home and made to work for free.</p>
<p>Several women from Ghana messaged The Independent to say their employers had not paid their salaries, had banned them from leaving the house and were rationing their food.</p>
<p>Vida, 27, says she is only fed once a day.</p>
<p>“I’m dizzy. I don’t have the strength to stand, I keep falling down,” she whispers in a WhatsApp voice message, where she describes the sexual assault she suffers at the hands of her male employer.</p>
<p>“They owe me nearly $1,000 but will only give me my passport if I drop my demand to be paid.”</p>
<p>Alberta, also from Ghana, says her 26-year-old cousin Ruby, a domestic worker, passed away three months ago in Lebanon from hunger and neglect.</p>
<p>“She made one phone call in December and she said she was hungry and sick. She called on 15 April the day before she died and said the same thing,” Alberta adds.</p>
<p>This Is Lebanon says Ruby’s medical records show she was hospitalised for general fatigue and anorexia and eventually died “from a heart attack due to septic shock”. The family could not afford a post-mortem examination to determine exactly what had happened.</p>
<p>Outside the Ethiopian embassy, meanwhile, desperation is turning to despair as the days go by. Additions to the group continue to arrive.</p>
<p>Hawa, who is just 17 and so the youngest of the party, says she escaped her employment by climbing out the window. Sitting on a scrap of cardboard, she explains how as the finances of the family worsened the violence shown against her increased.</p>
<p>“My madam would hold me down as her son beat me,” she says, showing a scar snarled across her stomach.</p>
<p>“She still has my passport, but I had to get out. My only hope is to go home.”

BEIJING (AP) — The United States, Japan and France are prodding their companies to rely less on China to make the world’s smartphones, drugs and other products. But even after the coronavirus derailed trade, few want to leave China&rsquo;s skilled workforce and efficient suppliers of raw materials to move to other countries.

<p><img src="https://english.aawsat.com/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2020/07/03/the_remains_of_24_algerians_are_carried_by_members_of_the_algerian_republican_guard_at_the_moufdi-zakaria_culture_palace_in_algiers_friday_july_3_2020._afp.jpg?itok=-Ed0gsWV" alt="img">
The remains of 24 Algerians are carried by members of the Algerian Republican Guard at the Moufdi-Zakaria culture palace in Algiers, Friday, July, 3, 2020. (AFP)</p>
<p>Asharq Al-Awsat</p>
<p>Algeria on Friday received the skulls of 24 resistance fighters decapitated during France&rsquo;s colonial occupation of the North African country, and which had been stored for decades in a Paris museum.</p>
<p>The return of the remains comes amid a global reexamination of the legacy of colonialism since the May killing of 46-year-old African American George Floyd by a white police officer sparked mass protests.</p>
<p>UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has urged countries to make amends for &ldquo;centuries of violence and discrimination&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The skulls, once viewed as war trophies by French colonial officers, were flown into Algiers airport on a Hercules C-130 transport plane, escorted on arrival by Algerian fighter jets.</p>
<p>To a 21-gun salute, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and a military guard of honor gave them an official welcome, an AFP correspondent said.</p>
<p>The remains, in coffins draped with the Algerian flag, were carried shoulder high out of the aircraft by soldiers as a military band played a funeral march.</p>
<p>Tebboune bowed in front of each coffin and a Muslim cleric recited a prayer for the dead.</p>
<p>Army chief of staff Said Chengriha delivered a speech denouncing colonialism as &ldquo;despicable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The heroes of the popular revolt have returned to the land where they sacrificed their lives,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>One Algerian tweeted: &ldquo;The city is incredibly silent as the sirens of boats echo across the port of Algiers in a great moment of emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The coffins will be taken to the Palace of Culture in Algiers where they will be on display Saturday for the public to pay their respects.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the 58th anniversary of Algeria&rsquo;s independence, the skulls will finally be laid to rest in the martyrs&rsquo; section of the capital&rsquo;s El Alia cemetery, local media reported.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heroes&rsquo;</p>
<p>France&rsquo;s 132 years of colonial rule in Algeria, and the brutal eight-year war that ended it, have left a legacy of often prickly relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>But the return of the remains has been seen as indicating a thaw in ties.</p>
<p>The French presidency, in a statement to AFP, said the return of the remains was a gesture of &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; and part of efforts to &ldquo;reconcile the memories of the French and Algerian people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Announcing the repatriations on Thursday, Tebboune said the decapitated fighters &ldquo;had been deprived of their natural and human right to be buried for more than 170 years&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He called them &ldquo;heroes who confronted the brutal French occupation between 1838 and 1865&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The savage enemy decapitated them in reprisals before transferring their skulls overseas so that their graves would not become a symbol of the resistance,&rdquo; Tebboune added.</p>
<p>Among the remains were those of revolt leader Sheikh Bouzian, who was captured in 1849 by the French, shot and decapitated, and the skull of resistance leader Mohammed Lamjad ben Abdelmalek, also known as &ldquo;Cherif Boubaghla&rdquo; (the man with the mule).</p>
<p>Historian Malika Rahal described them as &ldquo;martyrs&hellip; returning home&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The body parts of those who fought the conquest of their country are returning home after a very long stay in cardboard boxes at the Musee de l&rsquo;Homme in Paris,&rdquo; she tweeted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cardboard boxes&rsquo;</p>
<p>Emmanuel Macron, the first French president to be born after the 1954-62 independence war in which 1.5 million Algerians died, made his first official visit to the country in December 2017, saying he came as a &ldquo;friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the time, he told news website Tout sur l&rsquo;Algerie that he was &ldquo;ready&rdquo; to see his country hand back the skulls.</p>
<p>Algeria had officially asked for their return in 2018, as well as requesting the handover of colonial archives.</p>
<p>Algerian and French academics have long campaigned for the return of the skulls.</p>
<p>Algerian historian Ali-Farid Belkadi was the first to call for their return in 2011 after undertaking research work at the Musee de l&rsquo;Homme.</p>
<p>At the time, he said the skulls were kept in &ldquo;vulgar cardboard boxes that resemble shoe boxes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In December 2019, Macron said that &ldquo;colonialism was a grave mistake&rdquo; and called for turning the page on the past.</p>
<p>During his presidential election campaign, he had created a storm by calling France&rsquo;s colonization of Algeria a &ldquo;crime against humanity&rdquo;.

Can Putin’s Syria peace plea reconcile Tehran and Ankara?</p>
<p>ANKARA: Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged his counterparts in Turkey and Iran to encourage peaceful dialogue between rival forces in Syria in a bid to end the country’s bitter 9-year war.</p>
<p>Speaking during a televised video conference with Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Iran’s Hassan Rouhani on July 1, the Russian leader said: “An inclusive inter-Syrian dialogue should be actively promoted within the framework of the constitutional committee in Geneva. I propose to support this process, to help the participants to meet and start a direct dialogue.”</p>
<p>To what extent the three countries can agree on genuine political transition remains unclear, however, especially with Ankara and Tehran supporting vastly different regional agendas.</p>
<p>But Galip Dalay, a visiting scholar at the University of Oxford, believes one thing is certain: In Idlib, the so-called “Astana three” have effectively become the “Astana two,” with Ankara and Moscow excluding Iran.</p>
<p>“This, in turn, gives Iran added motivation to undermine any Turkish-Russian deal,” he told Arab News.</p>
<p>“While both Iran and Turkish interests are aligned when it comes to opposing the territorial disintegration of Syria and a larger US role, their priorities conflict almost on everything else,” he said.</p>
<p>“They can try to keep a conflict management process on track, but the divergence between them is only getting larger.”</p>
<p>Russia and Iran have been the main supporters of President Bashar Assad’s regime, while Turkey backs the opposition. The three countries began cooperating to reduce the fighting in Syria as part of a diplomatic process dating back to 2017.</p>
<p>Bedir Mulla Reshid, a researcher at the Omran Center for Strategic Studies in Istanbul, said that Iran and Turkey have been in indirect confrontation on Syria since the civil war began.</p>
<p>“Turkey has supported the Syrian political and military opposition, both in the face of the Assad regime and the sectarian militias sent to Syria by Iran. As for Iran, from the first day it stood beside Assad regime, and is one of the two main parties that refused to allow the regime to fall,” he told Arab News.</p>
<p>During the televised video conference, Rouhani again pledged his country’s support for the “legal government of Bashar Assad.”</p>
<p>The next trilateral meeting between the guarantor countries is expected to be held in Iran, but a date has yet to be specified.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a third round of Syrian constitutional committee talks overseen by the UN are set to be held next month.</p>
<p>The 150-member committee, which was launched in Geneva on October 2019, includes Syrian government and opposition leaders, as well as civic representatives.</p>
<p>Ankara has stopped the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), which it considers a terror group, from taking part in the Geneva talks.</p>
<p>According to Reshid, Iran hopes to strengthen its influence in Syria through its military militias and relief institutions.</p>
<p>Joe Macaron, a Middle East foreign policy analyst at the Washington-based Arab Center, said that regional dynamics, especially the US Caesar Act sanctions on Syria, “make it difficult to imagine a path forward to reach a political settlement.”</p>
<p>The Caesar Act entered into force on June 17, 2020, with sanctions targeting the Syrian government for war crimes.</p>
<p>“Idlib remains a contentious issue between Turkey and Russia, while competition continues between Moscow and Washington in northeast Syria,” Macaron told Arab News.</p>
<p>He said that the rival countries “seem to be interested in buying time to consolidate their influence” and are not ready to resolve the conflict under the current terms.</p>
<p>However, the Syrian regime’s willingness to implement a political transition by giving concessions is also open to doubt.</p>
<p>“Damascus blocked the political process and tried to disrupt committee meetings in Geneva,” Anton Mardasov, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute’s Syria program, told Arab News.</p>
<p>“This whole process is a fiction, which Russia is trying to demonstrate under the guise of a real compromise,” he added.</p>
<p>Mardasov believes that a compromise solution is unlikely in a short term, with presidential elections due in Syria and Iran in 2021.</p>
<p>“Moscow is trying to return to the idea of ​​a transitional government. The main focus of the negotiations between Turkey and Russia seems to be about the eastern part of Syria. Moscow is likely to approve Ankara’s operations to put pressure on the Kurds again,” he said.
