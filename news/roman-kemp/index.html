<p>Piers Morgan has upset Conservative MPs so much that they are boycotting Good Morning Britain (Getty Images)</p>
<p>The global pandemic has put a lot of things into new perspective, but this one might come as a surprise to some: Capital FM DJ Roman Kemp says he’s finding Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan a bit of a comfort.</p>
<p>Kemp, who was chatting to Kate Thornton on White Wine Question Time, said he’s finally agreeing with what Morgan is saying.</p>
<p>“I think it&rsquo;s just a really strange time, whereby Piers Morgan is now sounding like a voice of reason,” he joked.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Piers Morgan says he received death threats for challenging government over coronavirus</p>
<p>“For the moment, honestly, everything that Piers has said is dead on the money. And I think that, you know, in a way, he&rsquo;s kind of been this voice of reason in a weird, weird way.”</p>
<p>According to Morgan, Conservative MPs have boycotted Good Morning Britain because he asked those that appeared on the show “tough questions”.</p>
<p>Speaking on Twitter, the former Britain’s Got Talent judge said: &ldquo;This is the 15th day of its boycott of our show during the worst national crisis since WW2. All because we asked them tough questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roman Kemp says one of the strangest things about the pandemic is agreeing with Piers Morgan! (Getty Images)</p>
<p>Good Morning Britain has received 212 complaints about the confrontational interview style that Morgan has been demonstrating on the show, but Kemp believes that the former Mirror editor has become the voice of the nation, as he’s getting angry on their behalf.</p>
<p>“At the moment, you know, he is what people need when they wake up, because he is venting for the nation,” he said. “He is stopping people from going through their day angry, feeling like they&rsquo;re not understood.”</p>

<p>The I’m A Celebrity star continued: “The biggest reason when people get angry is when they feel misunderstood, and they feel like they&rsquo;re not heard. He&rsquo;s literally just venting for the nation… and that provides a little bit of relief.”</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>While podcast host Thornton agreed with Kemp’s sentiment, she also said they should be careful not to swell Morgan’s head with too many compliments, to which Kemp delivered the ultimate parting shot:</p>
<p>“Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: sometimes he can be an absolute knob,” he laughed. “But, you know, he&rsquo;s really been really getting it right.”</p>

<p>While he acknowledges his job as presenter of the Capital Radio Breakfast Show isn’t saving lives, Roman Kemp says he still feels a great responsibility to get his job right.</p>
<p>Speaking on White Wine Question Time, the I’m A Celebrity star said he was scared, because he feels like entertaining and informing the nation is such an important job right now.</p>
<p>He said: “It&rsquo;s really scary to be 27 and feel like I&rsquo;ve got to [&hellip;] tell everyone what&rsquo;s going on with the country and try to make everyone feel better. That feels like a lot to take on my shoulders.”</p>

<p>Roman, who won Radio Programme of the Year at the TRIC Awards in March, said that he’s aware “how that weight is such insignificance” compared to young doctors saving lives every day, but he also feels a weigh of responsibility in his job.</p>
<p>“Our job in entertainment is to make people feel better and give them some escapism,” he told podcast host Kate Thornton.</p>
<p>“I was meant to have time off work, but I&rsquo;ve cancelled that because I feel like this is an important time, and people will rely on us to kind of help move their day a little bit.”</p>
<p>Roman, son of Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp and Wham! backing singer Shirlie, said the prospect of mucking it all up had him reaching out to fellow breakfast show presenter Chris Moyles for advice.</p>

<p>Chris, 46, who presents the breakfast show on Radio X, told him it’s important to just keep talking.</p>
<p>“I spoke to Chris Moyles about it today and spoke to him about what we can do,” Roman revealed.</p>
<p>“And, he was saying to me, ‘Mate, you know you can really, really help people here, and so if you ever feel like you don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re doing the right things… it&rsquo;s all about the talking.’”</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Chris isn’t the only breakfast show host that Roman has reached out to: just before lockdown, he met up with Radio 1’s breakfast DJ, Greg James for a coffee and a chat, and now keeps in touch regularly via text.</p>

<p>“I&rsquo;m texting Greg James every other day about how he&rsquo;s getting on,” he explained to Kate.</p>
<p>“We had a chat and we had a coffee, and then all of a sudden we were in this situation. And it&rsquo;s nice to be able to reach out to people and say, ‘Hey man, how are you getting on?’ You both can say about how kind of scary this is.”</p>

<p>Roman says the one good thing that has come from this pandemic is that everyone in the entertainment industry is now concentrating on just trying to make the nation feel better.</p>
<p>“You know, we&rsquo;re just trying to get by,” he admitted. “I think that’s what we&rsquo;re all trying to do. I don&rsquo;t think anyone&rsquo;s trying to think about ratings, and that&rsquo;s what’s really nice about it. No one is thinking about that; everyone is just thinking about ‘how do we make someone feel better’?”</p>

<p>Rachel Riley Pranks Roman Kemp Before LOSING His Quiz Live On Air</p>
<p>Rachel Riley surprises Roman Kemp on Capital Breakfast. Picture: Getty Images</p>
<p>Roman Kemp was set-up by co-hosts Sian Welby and Sonny Jay on Capital Breakfast as Countdown star Rachel Riley was this morning&rsquo;s surprise quiz contestant.</p>
<p>Roman Kemp&rsquo;s Mega Hard Super Quiz is undoubtedly the toughest game on the radio and it requires some serious brainpower if you&rsquo;re even going to attempt to take it on&hellip;</p>
<p>Whilst you can hear Capital Breakfast listeners struggling to make it to through the five rounds all through the week, things are a little different on Friday mornings with the kids edition of the quiz.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>However, this morning Roman was set-up by his co-hosts Sian Welby and Sonny Jay as it wasn&rsquo;t 8-year-old Rachel trying to beat his quiz like he thought&hellip; it was 34-year-old Countdown mathematics champion Rachel Riley!</p>
<p>Surely Rachel would be able to beat Roman at his own game?! Well, not quite as it turned out&hellip;</p>
<p>We thought we&rsquo;d set @romankemp up by secretly getting @RachelRileyRR to take on the Mega Hard Super Quiz this morning&hellip;</p>
<p>Then Rachel only goes and fluffs it! 😅😬 pic.twitter.com/dQtuFMo41s — Capital (@CapitalOfficial) May 29, 2020</p>
<p>Whilst Rachel sailed through the initial questions, there was one in particular that had her completely stumped: &ldquo;What does the Q stand for in IQ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a slightly ironic question for Rachel to struggle with given her own IQ must be through the roof, judging by how quickly she&rsquo;s able to solve sums on the Channel 4 teatime show.</p>
<p>Sadly, not matter how hard Rachel reached for an answer she couldn&rsquo;t get it right before the timer ran out, meaning - like all contestants who don&rsquo;t make it through the Mega Hard Super Quiz - she &lsquo;perished in embarrassment&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rachel did seem genuinely shocked by her poor performance, tweeting Roman, Sian and Sonny after the show.</p>
<p>Absolutely perished in embarrassment just now!!! 🙈🙈🙈🙈</p>
<p>Taxi for Rachel 🙋🏼‍♀️🚕</p>
<p>I’ll get my coat 🧥</p>
<p>I blame the baby 😴🤪😂😂😂🤣@romankemp @Sianwelby @SonnyJay @CAPITALRADIOB pic.twitter.com/EPrp7OvCcC — Rachel Riley 🍊 (@RachelRileyRR) May 29, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely perished in embarrassment just now!!! Taxi for Rachel. I’ll get my coat. I blame the baby,&rdquo; Rachel tweeted.</p>
<p>If even Rachel Riley can&rsquo;t beat Roman&rsquo;s Mega Hard Super Quiz&hellip; is there hope for any of us?!</p>

<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SRUlQ2wZCaUlP5rBQT5VQg--~B/aD03ODc7dz0xNDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/6b2f6430-a0ee-11ea-9f3e-62f5a1f72a4a" alt="img">
Roman and Martin Kemp had the honour of being the last people ever to play on Arsenal&rsquo;s pitch at Highbury (Getty Images)</p>
<p>Sometimes it pays to have a father who’s a well-known pop star. Especially when it comes to making footballing dreams come true.</p>
<p>Capital Radio breakfast show DJ Roman Kemp knows this only too well, as it’s thanks to his dad, Martin Kemp, that he got to score a goal at Highbury.</p>
<p>Roman, who was appearing on White Wine Question Time, was asked by podcast host Kate Thornton about his most magical childhood memories and the I’m A Celebrity star had no doubt about which memory he would cherish forever – a kick-about on his beloved Arsenal’s pitch!</p>
<p>READ MORE: &lsquo;Arsenal would&rsquo;ve won the Premier League if we kept team together&rsquo; - Wilshere rues Emirates departures</p>
<p>Explaining how the love of Arsenal runs in his family, Roman said he was allowed to bunk off school one day back in 2006 to accompany dad Martin to Highbury to buy some very special turf. Arsenal, who had played at Highbury for 93 years, were set to move to their brand new Emirates Stadium.</p>
<p>“We had this opportunity whereby, when Highbury was being demolished, they were actually cutting up the grass and giving away pieces of the grass,” he explained.</p>
<p>“Now, I was a massive Arsenal fan, and, you know, obviously my dad being really sentimental with the ground, he actually gave me the morning off school to go with him and go and collect the piece of grass in person.”</p>

<p>So far, so good. But what Roman didn’t know was that his visit to the closing ground was going to get even better.</p>
<p>The pair were among the first to arrive and due to Martin’s pop star status, he was asked by news teams there covering the event to say a few words on camera.</p>
<p>“They came over to my dad and they were like, ‘Martin, Martin can we get an interview? Just get in a couple of words on why Highbury so special to you.’” Roman recalled, revealing his dad said he would only do the interviews if they got him and Roman onto the pitch.</p>
<p>Roman continued: “They had a couple of conversations with the club and they let me and my dad play on the pitch at Highbury.</p>
<p>We were the last people to score a goal on there, because they took up the turf literally in front of us right when we got off. It was just the two of us. It was something that, still to this day, that we say to each other, I can&rsquo;t believe we did that!’</p>

<p>Kate commented that such a negotiating tactic from Martin was very unlike the Spandau Ballet guitarist.</p>
<p>Roman replied: “It is very unlike him. He&rsquo;s always too giving, so that was really, really nice. It was a good move from him!”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the memory will undoubtedly last a lifetime, the piece of Highbury turf didn’t fare quite so well.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it lasted about two weeks in my mum&rsquo;s flower bed,” laughed Roman, who was 13 at the time.</p>
<p>“I don&rsquo;t know if she purposefully got rid of it, but it did not last long. I think my mum kind of said, ‘Well, you&rsquo;ve got to look after it.’ And then obviously I&rsquo;m no good at that.”</p>

<p>&lsquo;With the gym it gives me a good head-space and resets my day. I have always felt better being active. When I was a kid I was playing football til my mum would call me in for tea&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go to the gym to just get my head out of work. And I love the adrenaline. Once you get that buzz of doing it, you want to do it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all about personal health for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Roman revealed he keeps up a regime of training five times a week - on top of his early-morning starts as the host of Capital Breakfast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I basically reached my heaviest two years ago,&rsquo; Roman recounted. &lsquo;It was because my Mrs was living in Hong Kong. So I just sat around and ate.&rsquo;

<p>&ldquo;I cry. I have put myself in my car outside my house and locked the doors,&rdquo; openly admitted Katy. &ldquo;I think about cravings, but I think &lsquo;Do I want to risk my life getting those cravings?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katy Perry then expressed that she&rsquo;s taking the pregnancy one day at a time, as she also plans to release new music during quarantine.</p>
<p>While on Facebook Live to her 65 million followers, Katy said &ldquo;I definitely have to stay creative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put out a record this year; quarantined or not. Because we ain&rsquo;t gonna let no coronavirus stop us from dancing. Even if we&rsquo;re dancing in our homes,&rdquo; confirmed Katy, who said that she will release her fifth studio album.</p>
<p>Continuing, the &lsquo;Dark Horse&rsquo; singer said, &ldquo;Also, I think some of these songs could be helpful and empowering and joyful. With that, knwoing there&rsquo;s going to be a lot of restrictions, I have to be innovative, so I&rsquo;m coming up with a lot of innovative plans along the way.</p>

<p>Wow! The TV funnyman, 43, admitted that the singer, 32, looks &lsquo;amazing now&rsquo; and he is desperate to try out her new diet that has seen her shed seven stone</p>

<p>Celebrity pals: Speaking to host Roman Kemp on Capital Breakfast, Alan also said that he has been chatting to his other celebrity pals, Gok Wan, John Bishop and David Walliams</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Well, what do you do? All I do is get up, walk to the bin and come back. I mean, I&rsquo;m gagging to see people but it&rsquo;s just… it&rsquo;s very odd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope no one&rsquo;s having their Rice Krispies listening to this… And then there was a time when I&rsquo;d have to put me hand up to get the lamb out. And I get the fear sticking me hand in an oven glove, do you know what I mean? So it&rsquo;s all been like that really.&rsquo;</p>
