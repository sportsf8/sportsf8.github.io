<p>Floyd Mayweather’s uncle and former trainer Roger has died at the age of just 58.</p>
<p>He is credited with helping make Floyd one of the greatest ever boxers, retiring undefeated and a five-weight world champ, The Sun reports.</p>
<p>Roger’s health had been “declining” in recent years, with the legendary trainer believed to have suffered from diabetes.</p>
<p>The Michigan-born sporting great trained Floyd when he turned professional in 1996, but then took a step back when the boxer decided to be coached by his dad.</p>
<p>But he returned again in 2000, sticking with his nephew all the way until 2012 — where Floyd became one of the sport’s best ever.</p>
<p>Speaking about Roger’s passing, Floyd said: “My uncle was one of the most important people in my life inside and outside of the ring.</p>
<p>“Roger was a great champion and one of the best trainers in boxing. Unfortunately, his health was failing him for several years and now he can finally rest in peace.</p>
<p>“Roger meant the world to me, my father Floyd Sr my uncle Jeff, our whole family, everyone in and around the Mayweather Boxing Gym and the entire boxing world.</p>
<p>“It is a terrible loss for all of us.”</p>
<p>media_camera Trainer Roger Mayweather with boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2010.</p>
<p>Roger, nicknamed the Black Mamba, was a former boxer himself - winning the WBA and Lineal super-featherweight world titles in 1983.</p>
<p>He also secured the WBC light-welterweight strap in 1987 and finished his career with 59 wins from 72 fights.</p>
<p>Despite being one of boxing’s biggest ever names, Floyd appeared to blame the sport for causing some of his uncle’s health problems when speaking back in 2015.</p>
<p>He said: “My uncle Roger Mayweather has lost a lot of memory from the sport of boxing.</p>
<p>“It’s sad that he’s only in his 50’s but it seems like he’s an old man that’s in his 80’s.”</p>
<p>Top US boxing promoter Lou DiBella posted his condolences on Twitter, adding “prayers up for all”.</p>
<p>#RIPRogerMayweather. Condolences to the Mayweather family. Prayers up for all. 🙏 — Lou DiBella (@loudibella) March 17, 2020</p>
<p>And current boxer and former world champ Caleb Truax tweeted: “Rest easy to the original #BlackMamba.”</p>
<p>And Floyd added: “We are thankful for all the love and well-wishes we have already received as word travelled about Roger’s passing.</p>
<p>media_camera Floyd Mayweather is doing it tough.</p>
<p>“It helps me to see that he was able to touch so many people through his life in boxing, because he gave so much to the sport which was his first and longtime love.”</p>
<p>The news comes just days after the death of Floyd’s ex-girlfriend Josie Harris.</p>
<p>She was found dead in a car at her home in California.</p>
<p>Floyd, 43, and Harris had three kids together.</p>
<p>Mayweather shared a series of snaps of Harris with his 23 million followers on Instagram.</p>
<p>The American superstar described her as “my angel”, “my heart”, “my sweetheart”, “my love”, “my rock”, “my family”, “my kiss”, my sunshine” and “my flowers”.</p>
<p>One pictured showed him kissing her on the cheek, while another showed her smiling alongside their two sons.</p>
