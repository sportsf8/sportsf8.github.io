<p>The principle they settle upon is utilitarian. “Informed by the principle of maximizing benefits for the largest number,” they suggest that “the allocation criteria need to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care.”</p>
<p>The authors, who are medical doctors, then deduce a set of concrete recommendations for how to manage these impossible choices, including this: “It may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care.”</p>
<p>Those who are too old to have a high likelihood of recovery, or who have too low a number of “life-years” left even if they should survive, would be left to die. This sounds cruel, but the alternative, the document argues, is no better. “In case of a total saturation of resources, maintaining the criterion of ‘first come, first served’ would amount to a decision to exclude late-arriving patients from access to intensive care.”</p>
<p>In addition to age, doctors and nurses are also advised to take a patient’s overall state of health into account: “The presence of comorbidities needs to be carefully evaluated.” This is in part because early studies of the virus seem to suggest that patients with serious preexisting health conditions are significantly more likely to die. But it is also because patients in a worse state of overall health could require a greater share of scarce resources to survive: “What might be a relatively short treatment course in healthier people could be longer and more resource-consuming in the case of older or more fragile patients.”</p>
<p>Read: America’s nursing homes are bracing for an outbreak</p>
<p>These guidelines apply even to patients who require intensive care for reasons other than the coronavirus, because they too make demands on the same scarce medical resources. As the document clarifies, “These criteria apply to all patients in intensive care, not just those infected with CoVid-19.”</p>
<p>My academic training is in political and moral philosophy. I have spent countless hours in fancy seminar rooms discussing abstract moral dilemmas like the so-called trolley problem. If a train is barreling toward five innocent people who are tied to the tracks, and I could divert it by pulling the lever, but at the cost of killing an innocent bystander, should I do it?</p>
<p>Part of the point of all those discussions was, supposedly, to help professionals make difficult moral choices in real-world circumstances. If you are an overworked nurse battling a novel disease under the most desperate circumstances, and you simply cannot treat everyone, however hard you try, whose life should you save?</p>
<p>Despite those years of theory, I must admit that I have no moral judgment to make about the extraordinary document published by those brave Italian doctors. I have not the first clue whether they are recommending the right or the wrong thing.</p>
<p>But if Italy is in an impossible position, the obligation facing the United States is very clear: To arrest the crisis before the impossible becomes necessary.</p>
<p>This means that our political leaders, the heads of business and private associations, and every one of us need to work together to accomplish two things: Radically expand the capacity of the country’s intensive-care units. And start engaging in extreme forms of social distancing.</p>
<p>Cancel everything. Now.</p>

“Did you know an anagram of ‘coronavirus’ is ‘carnivorous’?” my friend Marina wrote to me yesterday.</p>
<p>She is obsessed with anagrams. For my 35th birthday, she drew seven versions of me, each bearing an anagram of my name: Boriz Zaricomiz sporting short hair and a camo T-shirt, Ramiro Scibizzo with a handlebar mustache, and so on.</p>
<p>This time though, her wordplay is particularly accurate. This virus is indeed carnivorous. The animal, in this case, is us. Here in Italy, we are so terrified by this tiny predator that we have resorted to locking ourselves inside.</p>
<p>Marina and I have always enjoyed words and logic games. When we were colleagues in Treviso, a city in northern Italy, we spent long nights playing Scrabble. For a while we indulged in making Sudokus, before she told me she had given up because they’re “so easy, a computer could solve them.”

<h3 id="op-ed-italy-is-on-a-coronavirus-lockdown-heres-what-its-like">&ldquo;Op-Ed: Italy is on a coronavirus lockdown. Here&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a28eeda/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F30%2Fd7%2F5c551aeb47faa2d7884bae0252fd%2Fhttps-delivery.gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1206477483.jpg" alt="img">
Under other circumstances, being homebound here might not seem a bad thing. Not for nothing is this stretch of the Italian Riviera called the Golfo Paradiso, the Gulf of Paradise. From our apartment, my wife and I look out at the Mediterranean, the nearby city of Genoa and the snow-capped mountains beyond. Now, with no one supposed to leave home, there are no errands to run, grace periods have been granted on mortgage, utility and tax bills. My shelves bulge with books that I now have more time to read.</p>
<p>But these circumstances are horrific. Italy is living through a national tragedy of incomprehensible proportions. More than 10,000 people here are ill with the coronavirus and more than 800 have died. Things could get worse, much worse, before they get better.</p>
<p>And no one knows when this will end.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>This region, known as Liguria, is not the worst hit, but is just south of the areas that are. On Saturday, March 7, our streets and beaches teemed with tourists from the colder cities of the north. On Sunday morning, the government ordered the northern regions most affected by the virus sealed off. Two days later the whole country was locked down.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the nationwide closure of all shops, except food stores and pharmacies. Now our streets and beaches are deserted, with most of the locals behind closed doors.</p>
<p>It has come to this even though Italy moved early and aggressively against the coronavirus threat with what it thought were strict measures of containment. When two travelers, who arrived in Italy from Wuhan, China, tested positive, they were quarantined and further flights from China were banned. When a new cluster of cases emerged in northern Italy in late February, the government moved quickly to blockade all areas of known infection, sealing off some 50,000 people in 11 northern municipalities. But what seemed unusually strict soon turned out to be not strict enough.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The virus had moved beyond a limited number of locations with a limited number of people who had been in direct or indirect contact with China or other foreign hot spots. It had turned into “community spread,” infecting people who had not traveled anywhere but had picked up the virus at the end of a longer chain of transmission.</p>
<p>Now the Italian government asks everyone in Italy to stay home, keep a distance of at least one meter from others, to not shake hands or hug when greeting people. It also advises washing hands frequently because the virus can stay alive outside the body and is present in droplets from coughing or even exhaling. A main route of transmission is when people touch surfaces that have virus-laden droplets and then touch their eyes, noses or mouths.</p>
<p>To be extra cautious, I chat with my neighbors mainly by Facebook Messenger to avoid face-to-face contact. Yet I am able to do full and frequent advisory sessions with graduate students at my university, hundreds of miles away, with Apple’s FaceTime. In the age of the internet and social media, isolation is not what it once would have been, at least for those with online connections.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>There are huge economic and social consequences to shutting down a whole country of 60 million people, telling everyone to stay home and enforcing restrictions on even short-range travel.</p>
<p>But the most profound crisis, and the one that is driving the government toward all these restrictions, is the potential overwhelming of Italy’s hospital system, particularly intensive care. If not soon checked, this epidemic could lead to triage decisions that would potentially require rationing emergency care to those with the best underlying health and with the longest remaining life expectancy.</p>
<p>There is special concern about the virus spreading to southern Italy, with its lower number of current coronavirus cases but much thinner medical infrastructure. But local officials report that areas of the north, like Lombardy, are already close to being overwhelmed. And with Italian hospitals stretched to capacity caring for coronavirus victims, other medical needs are going unattended.</p>
<p>Italy is now a test case for the rest of Europe and perhaps the U.S. as well. Learning the right lessons from Italy’s current trials is now a matter of life and death.</p>

<h3 id="italys-coronavirus-response-is-a-warning-from-the-future">&ldquo;Italy’s Coronavirus Response Is a Warning From the Future&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ztvIVs997VzSw3WV4_KpbHRskxk=/0x0:5990x3120/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/03/RTS34UT1/original.jpg" alt="img">
These steps are dramatic, and have caused significant uncertainty and growing panic across Italy. They are also quite confusing, and how they’ll even be enforced remains unclear. They came to light in an atmosphere of total chaos, after a draft bill outlining the measures was leaked to the press yesterday evening. The proposal suggested that northern Italy would be on total lockdown, and so thousands of people rushed to hop on overcrowded trains heading south. Finally, at 2 a.m. local time, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte gave a press conference, clarifying that Lombardy and the other provinces wouldn’t seal their borders, just that citizens would be “obligated” to practice “reduced mobility” and could leave only for emergencies.</p>
<p>What, Italians wondered, does that mean? Who will enforce these new rules? And will they even work?</p>
<p>Italy has long been a political laboratory, for better or worse, and a harbinger of developments that later spread. It’s also a rule-bound country where rules are often ignored, a place that often falls short on long-term planning but rises to the occasion in emergencies and has a knack for improvisation that its northern neighbors lack. It is a free society in which information is often unreliable and politicized. Today, it is an experiment in which free movement of people and goods meets free movement of a deadly virus. Countries across Europe and the world are watching how Italy handles an epidemic that knows no borders, has been putting tremendous strain on public-health structures, and is pushing the country’s already fragile economy to the brink. Lombardy alone is responsible for more than 20 percent of national gross domestic product, and tourism is one of Italy’s most important sectors.</p>
<p>Thomas Wright and Kurt M. Campbell: The coronavirus is exposing the limits of populism</p>
<p>The European debt crisis revealed the flaws in a bloc that shares a currency but not a fiscal policy. The migration crisis of 2015 revealed that individual European countries want to protect their own borders and control the number of immigrants arriving, in a zone built on the ideal of visa-free travel and burden sharing. The coronavirus could pose an even greater test for the European Union, which has free movement of people but no standard health protocols across countries. Will the EU’s member states band together to work with Italy, or will they cordon it off? Will richer northern-European countries hoard medical equipment, or partner with poorer southern- and eastern-European ones to slow the outbreak? Is Italy overreacting, or is the rest of the continent underreacting?</p>
<p>Each European country is handling things in its own way. Italy has a fragile coalition government and strong regions, and its response has been rapid, if chaotic. Germany, which has 939 cases and so far no reported deaths, has a highly federal structure, in which regions have a lot of autonomy in handling crises of this type. As of this weekend, Germany was still holding soccer matches with tens of thousands of fans—to the distress of some German doctors, who feel the country isn’t taking the threat seriously—though its health minister has urged organizers of events with more than 1,000 attendees to cancel them. He has said he was more concerned about panic stemming from the virus than the virus itself.

Amanda’s and Joon’s crossword — and story — were so good, I wanted to share it with you.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone by my now husband who proposed to me via a New York Times crossword, this cruciverbalist bride wanted to make her own special puzzle for the wedding. I immediately came up with the AB POSITIVE theme based on our first initials.</p>
<p>I made a list of about 20 possible theme entries of varying lengths. In addition, I was determined to hide our names somewhere in the grid, as well as somehow create an attribution to my father who passed away over the summer. More on that last part in a bit.</p>
<p>Given the constraints (not to mention the time sensitivity), I enlisted my friend and genius constructor Joon Pahk, who agreed to help me actualize my lofty idea. He would make the grid and I would do the cluing.</p>
<p>His first grid contained theme answers I wasn’t wild about (ARMY BRAT, ALL BETTER) so I had the nerve to ask him to redo it, as I had my heart set on more sparkly fill like AURORA BOREALIS and AWESOME BLOSSOM. Joon generously obliged and then showed me where he had hidden our names, which leads me to how the published puzzle is a little different than the one we had at the wedding.</p>
<p>At the reception, guests were all given a copy of the puzzle at their seats, but Will Shortz also let me borrow one of the big whiteboards he uses at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for the event. As guests completed their grids, I invited them to come up and fill something in, because doesn’t every recreational solver want to feel like a finalist at a crossword tournament, even if just for a moment?</p>
<p>As for the puzzle itself, I gave it a title on the page: “Marriage is as easy as … see?” and a hint:</p>
<p>“When read in order, the answers to the starred clues will reveal the ultimate 60 Across.” (Those starred clues are 16-across, 36-across, 65-across, and 68-across.) During the party, I cryptically told Will (Yes, Will Shortz was at my wedding!) that I was counting on him for something but he’d have to figure out what it was. He nodded, grinned, and accepted my challenge. (None of my five test solvers had grokked this last layer, so I deemed it best to offer the prompt, even to the puzzle master himself).</p>
<p>When the big board was completed, I talked about the puzzle, the theme, the title, and our names, much to everyone’s delight. And then I asked if anyone found anything else worth noting. Will raised his hand and addressed the crowd, explaining that what he found was the difference between a good puzzle and an amazing puzzle. He rightly discovered that I had coded the clues acrostic style, meaning that reading the first letter of each clue in order it would reveal a message.</p>
<p>I won’t spoil that bit here but now you know where to find it. It was my stealthy way of making sure my dad was at my wedding after all.

<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/WlehHdvyb2IW9IXhxKFV425EBiE=/5x0:3542x1842/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/03/RTS33ESZ/original.jpg" alt="img">
But not everyone will behave badly. Camus’ story also has heroes, though these aren’t the sort of heroes found in most other novels. Instead, the heroes are the doctors, the volunteers who help them, and even a civil servant, Monsieur Grand, who seeks to deal with the plague by recording it, measuring it, and keeping track of what has happened: “This insignificant and self-effacing hero who had nothing to recommend him but a little goodness in his heart and apparently a ridiculous ideal. This would be to give the truth its due, to give the sum of two and two as four.” Grand, Dr. Rieux, and a few others try to use science, transparency, and accuracy to contain and control the disease and to save as many people as possible, without giving in to hysteria or despair: “It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.”</p>
<p>These are the kinds of people who will be the heroes in our era, too. The scientists and public-health scholars who immediately put out information about numbers and cases; the research teams that immediately began to work on vaccines; the nurses and doctors who immediately decide to remain inside quarantined regions, as many did in Italy, as well as in Wuhan, China. Not all of their judgments will be correct, and they will not always agree with one another: There is no precise way to determine which quarantines and cancellations are prudent and which are unreasonable, given the potential economic effects on the one hand, and the real desire to slow the spread of the epidemic on the other. In Italy, there have already been a few public squabbles among virologists who have different estimates of how bad the disease will be.</p>

<p>But at least they have the public’s interest at heart. Here is a rule of thumb to use in the coming weeks: Judge politicians by how much and how clearly they defer to the people who give the sum of two and two as four. What you want is accurate information, not politicized information. And the more the better. After four years of hearing, in the words of a British politician, that “we’ve had enough of experts,” this is the moment when the value of expertise has suddenly become crystal clear. Suddenly, facts matter.</p>
<p>Epidemics, like disasters, have a way of revealing underlying truths about the societies they impact. The Chinese have already paid a high price for the secretiveness of their system, and for the top-down bureaucratic culture that led many, initially, to conceal the disease. By contrast, one of the reasons Italians aren’t panicking more is that they have confidence in the public-health system, and indeed the system in the broader sense of the word, despite Salvini and his disinformation campaigns. Italy has already tested many thousands of people for the virus—testing is free, of course—which is one of the reasons the numbers are so much higher there than elsewhere. People know this, and repeat it to one another, sometimes joking about it (“We Italians are too honest”) but it is a source of pride. Few others in Europe, so far, are testing that widely. And, of course, the U.S. is not doing anything of the sort.

<h3 id="103-year-old-italian-coronavirus-survivor-beat-the-odds-with-courage-faith">&ldquo;103-year-old Italian coronavirus survivor beat the odds with ‘courage, faith’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72a7ad1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F39%2Ff7%2F770fef878e494fb02323c4ab00bb%2Fd4302483b2fd40a49c5ce357fca9f661" alt="img">
To recover from the coronavirus, which she managed to do at age 103, Ada Zanusso recommends courage and faith, the same qualities that have served her well in more than a century on Earth.</p>
<p>Italy, along with neighboring France, has Europe’s largest population of what has been dubbed the “super old” — people who are at least 100. As the nation with the world’s highest number of COVID-19 deaths, Italy is looking to its super-old survivors for inspiration.</p>
<p>This week, Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera devoted an entire page to the stories of super-old survivors, called “healing at 100 years old.” The inspirational portraits are a counterpoint to news of large numbers of deaths from COVID-19 among elderly people living in Italian nursing homes and other assisted-living facilities.</p>
<p>“I’m well, I’m well,” Zanusso said this week during a video call from the Maria Grazia Residence for the elderly in Lessona, a town in the northern region of Piedmont. “I watch TV, read the newspapers.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Zanusso wore a protective mask, as did her family doctor beside her, Carla Furno Marchese, who also donned eyewear and a gown that covered her head.</p>
<p>Asked about her illness, Zanusso is modest: “I had some fever.”</p>
<p>Her doctor said Zanusso was in bed for a week.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“We hydrated her because she wasn’t eating, and then we thought she wasn’t going to make it because she was always drowsy and not reacting,” said Furno Marchese, who has been Zanusso’s doctor for 35 years.</p>
<p>“One day she opened her eyes again and resumed doing what she used to before,” Furno Marchese said, recalling when Zanusso was able to sit up and then later managed to get out of bed.</p>
<p>What helped her get through the illness? “Courage and strength, faith,” Zanusso said. It worked for her, so she advises others who fall ill to also “give yourself courage, have faith.”</p>

<p>COVID-19 can cause mild or moderate symptoms, and most of those who are infected recover. But the elderly and those with existing health problems can be at high risk for more serious illness.</p>
<p>The virus has killed nearly 18,000 people in Italy and more than 88,000 worldwide. The World Health Organization says 95% of those who have died in Europe were over 60 years old.</p>
<p>Under Italy’s five-week-long lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of infections that have overwhelmed hospitals, visitors aren’t allowed at homes for the elderly.</p>
<p>Her doctor asked Zanusso what she would like to do when “they open the doors.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“I’d like to take a lovely walk,” she replied. And your three great-grandchildren? “Watch them play together.”</p>
<p>Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are leveling off in Italy, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is expected to announce in the coming days how long the lockdown will remain in place, with expectations that some restrictions could be eased.</p>
<p>For now, Zanusso is isolated from other residents as she awaits a follow-up swab test to confirm she is negative for the virus.</p>

<p>She grew up in Treviso, in the northeastern Veneto region, where she worked for many years in the textile industry. Zanusso, who turns 104 on Aug. 16, had four children — three of whom are living — and has four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>“She’s old but healthy, with no chronic illness,’’ her doctor said.</p>
