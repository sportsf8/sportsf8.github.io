Ch v m Krishna Rao By</p>
<p>Is Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao a trusted friend of Narendra Modi or an unadulterated foe? While some sections and political parties oppose whatever the BJP does regardless of merits, KCR is different. He unexpectedly extended full support to some of the most controversial decisions taken by the Centre like demonetisation, GST and the reading down of Article 370, but is now opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR). He has gone to the extent of adopting an Assembly resolution opposing the new format for capturing NPR data, asserting its updation will be allowed only if it is done using the old format. KCR even threatened to launch a nationwide stir with all like-minded chief ministers on the matter. The NPR exercise is scheduled to begin anytime between April 1 and September 30 across the country if the Coronavirus outbreak does not put it off.</p>
<p>“If you are not making the bread, why are you kneading the dough?” he asked, delivering an iron-fisted punch on the BJP while speaking in the Assembly on the resolution. In fact, moving the resolution in the Assembly was a long time coming. He maintained stoic silence even in the face of the BJP’s taunts over whether the TRS’ opposition to the CAA in Parliament was just an eyewash. The BJP’s game plan was to force KCR to commit himself to his anti-CAA stand, which it hoped would polarise Hindus in its favour in the municipal polls held a few months ago. The BJP argued that KCR wanted to keep the issue simmering as he was not sure how Hindus would react if he took to the streets with his anti-CAA stand.</p>
<p>Though Muslims would rally behind him, it could ruffle the sentiments of the Hindus, which he was wary of ahead of the municipal elections, particularly at a time when the anti-incumbency luggage was slowly piling up.For, one unguarded comment by him ahead of the Lok Sabha elections had cost the TRS four seats in the state, including that of daughter K Kavitha in Nizamabad, who went down to the BJP as if pole-axed. Criticising the BJP’s Hindutva agenda, he had used the phrase ‘Hinduvulu Bonduvulu’ (nincompoops), which riled the Hindus though it was a dart aimed at the BJP. KCR later tried to make amends by saying there could be no greater Hindu than himself and recounted the many yagnas he had performed, but the damage was done.</p>
<p>After KCR changed tack with his anti-CAA resolution, the BJP initially ran for cover to unscramble his googly. It then claimed that KCR is positioning himself as a messiah of the Muslims because elections to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation are due and the city has over 40 per cent Muslim population. Till the municipal elections were over, the TRS had stayed silent on the CAA so as to mobilise Hindus, while ally AIMIM tore into the BJP, thus consolidating the Muslim votes. Wherever the MIM was in the fray, the TRS worked for it, and vice versa, with the common intention of arresting the BJP’s rise.</p>
<p>KCR, as any other politician, would naturally look for electoral benefit in every decision that he takes.</p>
<p>Since Muslim population is about 12 per cent in the entire state and over 40 per cent in Hyderabad, he chose to strategically time his anti-CAA stand. Politics apart, when the Muslim community is agitated, as a leader of the state, he probably thought he should defend their rights. While TRS calls him a champion of secularism, the astute politician knows when to play up an issue and when to lie low. He knows how to get the best of both the worlds while protecting the interests of the largest segment of the electorate.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a senior BJP leader has filed a PIL in the Hyderabad High Court challenging the Assembly resolution against the NPR. It remains to be seen how the NPR politics eventually plays out. Also, the fallout of the state government stalling a Central programme would be anybody’s guess.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/03/24/600x338/KCR_1553516489547_1585065729413.jpg" alt="img">
In a stern warning, Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) on Tuesday warned citizens that he will be forced to call in the army or issue ‘shoot at sight’ orders if people continue to violate the 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in the state, imposed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>
<p>KCR’s statement comes in the wake of the public defying the lockdown imposed in the state (now till 15 April), which has resulted in the police clamping down on civilians from moving about.</p>
<p>“Please don’t let it come to this. The administration cannot stop everyone and I will have to call in the army or issue ‘shoot at sight’ orders. Please stay at home, otherwise the entire society will get hurt. I am appealing to everyone,&rdquo; KCR said while addressing a media briefing on Tuesday evening at his camp office. The chief minister also asked the local corporators to help the police and administration in their respective areas.</p>
<p>“This is the time to be out, and the public will be watching you. All the MLAs should also coordinate and lead (in coordinating to help with the lockdown,&rdquo; he said, and added that the state government will transfer the Rs.1,500 to below poverty line (white ration card holders) persons in their bank accounts in a few days. KCR also said that the police will seize passports of those who have travelled abroad recently and who are under quarantine, as they are still moving about, violating the health advisory to stay in quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>“Nobody should step out of their homes strictly after 7 p.m. If at all they need something, they can dial 100 and the police will help them. If need be we will also shut down petrol pumps. The state has also a surplus in production of vegetables so there is no nee to worry,&rdquo; stated KCR. He also warned shops against hoarding and hiking prices, and said that any business owner found indulging in such acts will have their shops seized. “Don’t spoilt your business,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<p>KCR also said that the police have been asked to allow the media to go about freely, in wake of an untoward incident on Monday night wherein some policemen assaulted some media personnel. “It is a stray incident,&rdquo; he added. On Tuesday, another three cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in Telangana, taking the total number of cases detected to 36 in the state.

<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/3/21/w600X390/KCR_plans_cancel.jpg" alt="img">
By Express News Service</p>
<p>HYDERABAD: The Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s proposed tour to Karimnagar on Saturday has been postponed. Earlier in the day, Rao decided to visit Karimnagar to oversee arrangements made by officials to stop the spread of Covid in the city, in the wake of seven Indonesians testing positive at Gandhi Hospital. However, Rao decided to postpone the tour, as his visit may hamper the work being taken up by officials. Karimnagar district officials too requested the CM to cancel his tour.</p>
<p>On Friday, BC Welfare Minister Gangula Kamalakar said that around 70 persons had come in contact with the Indonesian nationals in Karimnagar and tests for all of them have turned out negative, but all of them are under quarantine. The State conducted a door-to-door survey over the last two days to trace people who came in touch with the Indonesians and visited 13,428 households, surveyed around 50,910 people in Karimnagar city.</p>
<p>Two suspected Covid cases have been sent to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, Kamalakar added. One had returned from Thailand, and another person was in touch with the Indonesians. Their test reports are awaited. Also, about 375 foreign returnees appeared in the survey, of whom 70 belonged to Karimnagar city. All of them are under home quarantine. They all travelled to Karimnagar from RGIA. Those under home quarantine are being stamped with the message “Proud to Protect Karimnagar, Home Quarantined till March 31, 2020” on their hands.
