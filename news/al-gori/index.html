<p>Al Gore has become the latest environmental campaigner to express solidarity with the protestors for racial justice facing increasingly violent crackdowns across the U.S., warning that &ldquo;the need for climate action is bound together with the struggle for racial equality and liberation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a day when huge protests sparked by the death of George Floyd were again met with city-wide curfews and frequent outbreaks of violence — including numerous cases of police using teargas, rubber bullets and baton charges — the former vice president issued a statement declaring he stood with &ldquo;the peaceful demonstrations across America calling for equal justice now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gore also highlighted how there was an environmental component to the protests against the &ldquo;long-standing injustices borne by black, brown and indigenous people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entrenched, systemic racism in our country has led to disproportionate impacts of pollution on communities of color, along with disparities in income, education, healthcare and more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Today, African Americans are suffering from COVID-19 more than any other race, in part because their much higher exposure to air pollution increases the mortality rate from the virus. We have a moral obligation to demand equality for all, regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation or economic status. The need for climate action is bound together with the struggle for racial equality and liberation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gore&rsquo;s statement followed interventions from a host of environmental leaders and campaigners, including a growing number of businesses that have expressed dismay at both the latest cases of police brutality that sparked the protests, the violent crackdowns on peaceful protestors and President Donald Trump&rsquo;s belligerent response.</p>
<p>Climate Chads are self-identified environmentalists who say they care about pervasive racial inequality and police brutality, but don&rsquo;t believe these issues are related to the climate fight.</p>
<p>Writing on Twitter, Greta Thunberg said it was &ldquo;devastating to see the development taking place in the USA. Centuries of structural and systematic racism and social injustice won&rsquo;t go away by itself. We need a global structural change. The injustices must come to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of major U.S. environmental groups also drew direct links between the campaigns for racial and climate justice.</p>
<p>Writing in response to the high-profile incident that saw Christian Cooper, a black birder, unjustly harassed by a white woman illegally walking her dog off-leash in Central Park, Sierra Club&rsquo;s Michael Brune argued that &ldquo;just like we need to work hard to fight climate change and protect nature, we need to be active in dismantling the racism that is tearing our country apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot separate these issues,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The companies that have profited from fossil fuels and accelerated the climate crisis are the same ones who have benefited from environmental injustice, colonialism and racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similarly, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) issued a statement stressing that &ldquo;as an organization that envisions a world with clean air, clean water, public lands, and a safe climate that are protected by a just and equitable democracy, we also believe that we are only as safe as the members of our communities who are most at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group added, &ldquo;LCV recognizes the leadership of frontline organizations and individuals, and we stand among those calling for justice, accountability, and an end to racial violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the United Kingdom, WWF chief executive Tanya Steele stressed that everyone has a responsibility to bring an end to racial violence. &ldquo;Racism should have no place in the things we say, think or do,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;The killing of George Floyd is another death caused by violent bigotry that we all have a responsibility to end — we need to stand together to fight for our world, our friends and to end racism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reflecting on the flurry of statements in support of the protestors, Emily Atkin from influential U.S. climate newsletter Heated warned that despite growing co-operation between environmental and civil rights campaigners, there remained an &ldquo;insidious form of anti-Blackness within the climate movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This silent racism, environmental justice activists say, is preventing the climate movement from standing in true solidarity with Black Americans as they protest their systemic brutalization by police,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;And if the movement continues to stay silent while the country burns, they say, the planet will continue to burn alongside it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Atkin quoted comments from Liz Havstad, executive director of Hip Hop Caucus, a black-centered progressive group, who argued that the willingness of environmental organizations to express solidarity with black communities was &ldquo;an important step&rdquo; forward that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. But she added that &ldquo;anti-Blackness is rampant in the climate and environmental movement. &hellip; It&rsquo;s our responsibility to align our climate and environmental work with the movement for black lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a stance that, as Atkin noted, has exposed faultlines within the environmental movement, with some campaigners — to whom she assigns the disparaging moniker &ldquo;climate Chads&rdquo; — privately arguing that aligning green demands with wider social issues could undermine efforts to build bipartisan support for climate policies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climate Chads are self-identified environmentalists who say they care about pervasive racial inequality and police brutality, but don&rsquo;t believe these issues are related to the climate fight,&rdquo; Atkin explained. &ldquo;Or if they do, they believe focusing on racial equality &lsquo;undercuts&rsquo; the fight, and limits the climate movement&rsquo;s ability to achieve broad support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Atkin forcefully rejects such calculations, branding them both &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; and anti-black. &ldquo;Imagine thinking you have a better chance convincing racists to support the climate movement than engaging minorities across the world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Imagine asking black people to risk their lives to protect a planet full of people who have never, and will never, risk anything to protect theirs, and thinking that&rsquo;s the more successful strategy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a powerful challenge to green campaigners and businesses everywhere that further highlights how the debate on the extent to which calls for climate action and racial justice are aligned is set to intensify still further as protests escalate across the U.S. and elsewhere. And all against a backdrop where the Trump administration is poised to run an election campaign set to be one of the most divisive and dangerous in modern history — a campaign that threatens both the integrity of the U.S. and the stability of the climate.

Text size</p>
<p>Generation Investment Management, which former Vice President Al Gore co-founded and currently chairs, revealed it had made sizable investment changes in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Generation exited an investment in Amazon.com (ticker: AMZN), materially reduced a position in Microsoft (MSFT), and initiated a large position in Palo Alto Networks (PANW). The firm disclosed the trades, among others, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Generation declined to comment on the transactions.</p>
<p>Gore’s firm focuses on sustainable investing, and it is trouncing the market. Generation’s largest public fund under its management, Lombard Odier Funds-Generation Global, is crushing its benchmark, the MSCI World index with a total return of 143.3% to 64.6%, respectively over the last 13 years. The dollar-denominated version of the fund is also topping the S&amp;P 500 index for the year to date and for periods longer than a year.</p>
<p>Editor&rsquo;s Choice</p>
<p>Generation sold 43,736 Amazon shares in the first quarter, to end March with no shares of the online-retail and cloud-computing giant. Shares have surged more than 30% year to date.</p>
<p>Gore’s firm also sold 1.7 million Microsoft shares in the quarter, reducing its investment to 1.1 million shares. Microsoft stock has gained more than 15% in 2020.</p>
<p>Generation also purchased 2.5 million shares of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto in the first quarter. It hadn’t owned any at the end of 2019. Palo Alto stock is about flat for the year.</p>

<p>Ten years ago: Attorney General Eric Holder said federal authorities had opened criminal and civil investigations into the BP oil spill. A divided U.S. Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that criminal suspects had to explicitly invoke their right to remain silent, and that simply remaining silent was not sufficient to stop police questioning.

To the editor: The U.S. Supreme Court has changed the course of history. In its 2000 appointment of George W. Bush to the presidency, the court ignored the Constitution and halted Florida’s ballot recount. That year and in 2016, the candidate who got the greatest number of votes would not go on to be president. (“The electoral college is a blot on democracy. The Supreme Court shouldn’t make it worse,” editorial, May 15)</p>
<p>Had Democrat Al Gore been inaugurated in 2001, there would have been no Iraq war and possibly even no Great Recession. We would have had a 20-year head start on climate change and, most likely, Hillary Clinton would be the president of the United States today.</p>
<p>For the court to even consider “faithless electors” is an abdication of the Constitution and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Craig Simmons, Northridge</p>

<p>To the editor: As your editorial rightly puts it, the “electoral college is a blot on American democracy.” But it’s in our Constitution, a harmful anachronism that we are forced to obey.</p>
<p>The answer isn’t to pile on patches and kluges such as binding electors or multi-state compacts. We need a constitutional amendment instituting a national popular vote for president.</p>
<p>Randall Gellens, San Diego

New Jersey has become the first state in the nation to add climate change education to its learning standards for kindergarten through high school.</p>
<p>The state Board of Education adopted the plan to incorporate climate change lessons across seven content areas — science, social studies, technology, 21st Century Life and Careers, health and physical education, arts, and languages.</p>
<p>The initiative was first detailed in February by first lady Tammy Murphy, who is a charter member of former Vice President Al Gore’s Climate Reality Action Fund.</p>
<p>In a written statement, Gore congratulated the state.</p>
<p>“This initiative is vitally important to our students as they are the leaders of tomorrow, and we will depend on their leadership and knowledge to combat this crisis,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Climate change standards also have been added to the appendices of the Mathematics and English Language Arts guidelines, which are up for review in 2022.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Student Learning Standards outline what is taught in the state&rsquo;s public schools and set the foundation for school districts to craft instruction.</p>
<p>As part of her efforts, Tammy Murphy has met over the past year with more than 130 educators who have been reviewing and revising the NJSLS, a process that occurs every five years.</p>
<p>“In New Jersey, we have already begun to experience the effects of climate change, from our disappearing shorelines, to harmful algal blooms in our lakes, super storms producing torrential rain, and summers that are blazing hot,” she said in a written statement Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decades of short-sighted decision-making has fueled this crisis and now we must do all we can to help our children solve it. This generation of students will feel the effects of climate change more than any other, and it is critical that every student is provided an opportunity to study and understand the climate crisis through a comprehensive, interdisciplinary lens.”</p>
<p>Gov. Phil Murphy said the education standard &ldquo;will strengthen the future of New Jersey’s green energy economy.”</p>
<p>The announcement of the additional learning standards comes as the entire state remains in remote learning mode, nearly three months since the pandemic first hit New Jersey.</p>
<p>In January, the governor released the state’s updated Energy Master Plan, which included strategies for making all of New Jersey&rsquo;s energy emissions-free within 30 years. He also signed an order requiring regulatory changes that were branded as Protecting Against Climate Threats – or PACT.</p>
<p>The governor said proposed development projects that don’t align with efforts to shift to a clean energy economy and respond to climate change will not be approved.</p>

Insight</p>
<p>Speaking to comedian Trevor Noah, the Democratic candidate for the US presidency said he fears the Republican would try to steal the election if he loses in November.</p>
<p>The peaceful transfer of power is a hallmark of US democracy, so much so that when Al Gore lost a controversial presidential contest against George W Bush in 2000, it was the former vice-president himself who certified the result despite objections from Democratic party colleagues.</p>
<p>But today a fear unprecedented in modern US history is beginning to reveal itself explicitly - that the incumbent US president, Donald Trump, will not go without a fight should he lose his 2020 re-election bid.</p>
<p>The concerns come from none other than Democratic candidate Joe Biden himself, who in an interview with comedian Trevor Noah said he feared Trump would try to “steal” the election.</p>
<p>Biden told the Daily Show host that such an eventuality was his single biggest concern regarding the 2020 race.</p>
<p>Asked what would happen if Trump refused to relinquish power, Biden responded: “I am absolutely convinced they (the military) will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.”</p>
<p>Just a day earlier, a top military official, General Mark Milley, apologised for attending a Trump photo opportunity outside a church, saying that his involvement &ldquo;created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Biden’s fears were echoed by another top Democrat, New Jersey governor Cory Booker, who said that any attempt by Trump to hold on to power, should he lose, would be checked by others in power.</p>
<p>For their part, the Trump side has completely dismissed the idea that Trump would not relinquish power should he lose.</p>
<p>“This is just another brainless conspiracy theory from Joe Biden as he continues to try to undermine confidence in our elections,” Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign’s communication director said.</p>
<p>‘Fixed’ election</p>
<p>Fears among Trump’s critics stem from statements he has made both recently and during the 2016 presidential campaign against Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Before his victory in the 2016 presidential election, Trump suggested the election was “absolutely rigged”, while his top advisor Rudy Guiliani said the Democrats were cheating.</p>
<p>Trump has also raised the issue of staying beyond his two-term limit but whether that is a serious statement of intent or just rhetoric to fire up his base is uncertain.</p>
<p>“At the end of 6 years, after America has been made GREAT again and I leave the beautiful White House (do you think the people would demand that I stay longer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT).” Trump wrote on his Twitter account in June 2019.</p>
<p>Trump has again raised the spectre of possible Democrat manipulation of the November 2020 vote through the use of fraudulent ballots, despite analysts pointing out such votes have extremely low statistical rates of fraud.</p>
<p>Reality check</p>
<p>Any suggestion that Biden is likely to beat Trump should come with the caveat that the result is far from certain. As Trump showed in 2016, pollsters and analysts who predicted he would likely lose, can get it wrong.</p>
<p>Nevertheless that victory was narrow with Trump losing the popular vote by almost three million ballots, and only securing the victory thanks to the electoral college system and less than a hundred thousand votes spread almost perfectly across key battleground states.</p>
<p>With polls showing Biden in the lead in some battlegrounds, such as Florida, the former vice-president during the Obama administration seems well placed to give Trump a strong challenge in the very least.</p>
