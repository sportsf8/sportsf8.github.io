<p>Odsonne Edouard became the main protagonist in Celtic&rsquo;s first win. The French striker scored the first goal of the season and scored a hat-trick in the win against Hamilton Academical.</p>
<p>Neil Lennon&rsquo;s men didn&rsquo;t suffer, who only took 20 minutes to celebrate the first of the six goals scored in the match. Edouard got the first goal of the match.</p>
<p>Hamilton reacted just after Jeremie Frimpong scored the Bhoys&rsquo; second. Martin gave the visitors hope, but they were quickly brushed aside in the second half.</p>
<p>Edouard, the same as in the first half, found a route to Fulton&rsquo;s goal. Two more goals to score his second hat-trick for Celtic, the first in almost three years.</p>
<p>The placid afternoon for Celtic would be sealed by Klimala, who put the icing on the cake in the 90th minute.

<h3 id="celtic-boss-lennon-braced-for-edouard-bids-after-rumoured-arsenal-target-hits-hat-trick">&ldquo;Celtic boss Lennon braced for Edouard bids after rumoured Arsenal target hits hat-trick&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ecm04j.EEy79ghs.t0_Ihg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/uk.goal.com/ecaa5203610d1ae54abce8b3b88deaf5" alt="img">
Neil Lennon expects Odsonne Edouard to be in demand after he started the new season with a hat-trick in a 5-1 thrashing of Hamilton, though Celtic intend to do all they can to keep the forward.</p>
<p>Everton and Leicester City are among the Premier League clubs to be linked with Edouard, who joined Celtic for a reported club-record fee of around £9million in 2018 after a successful season-long loan.</p>
<p>Arsenal are also believed to be monitoring the striker&rsquo;s progress as they consider potential replacements for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose Emirates Stadium future remains uncertain.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old hit the ground running with a treble as Celtic began their quest to win a record 10th consecutive Scottish Premier League title with a commanding win on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lennon is braced for interest in the former Paris Saint-Germain player during the transfer window, but he hopes to keep hold of his prized asset.</p>
<p>Asked about rumoured interest in Edouard, the Celtic boss said: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t help that, it&rsquo;s inevitable. But we&rsquo;ll try to stave off any admirers. I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty out there, but we love having him here and I&rsquo;m sure he’s enjoying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be well on the radar of clubs before the start of this season. He had 28 goals up until March last season and I was delighted with that goal return.</p>
<p>“I was delighted with the goals he got too, he was on the end of things and that pleased me.</p>
<p>“I was really pleased, he scored great goals. His volume of goals is really pleasing me.</p>
<p>“They were striker&rsquo;s goals. Normally you associate Odsonne with brilliant individual goals, but there were a few tap-ins and a near-post run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled and I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s happy, but we are as a team looking to build on what we&rsquo;ve started with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edouard played down talk of a move when he was asked about his future earlier this summer, saying he would &ldquo;love to be a part&rdquo; a tenth straight title win for Celtic despite being &ldquo;flattered&rdquo; by talk of a move to Arsenal.

<h3 id="celtic-5-1-hamilton-odsonne-edouard-shines-again-but-can-celtic-keep-him">&ldquo;Celtic 5-1 Hamilton: &lsquo;Odsonne Edouard shines again&hellip; but can Celtic keep him?'&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/C204/production/_113786694_19951276-1.jpg" alt="img">
When Odsonne Edouard was replaced shortly before the end of this thumpingly impressive victory for the champions, his manager Neil Lennon went to the big forward and declared - we can only presume - his undying love for him.</p>
<p>The Frenchman scored 11 goals in 13 games at the end of last season, and on the restart of competitive football he looked as fresh as a daisy and as lethal as a dagger to the heart.</p>
<p>His three goals were outstanding, but it wasn&rsquo;t just that. It never is with Edouard. It was his movement, his physicality, his giant footballing brain that stood out. Again.</p>
<p>Hamilton were the opposition on Sunday but you&rsquo;d now bet the house on him being able to do it at a much higher level. He&rsquo;s 22 and, goodness, with every game he looks the part. How long he will look it in a Celtic jersey is always a question that will trouble the Glasgow club&rsquo;s fans, but they can revel in his presence for now. Maybe there&rsquo;s another season left in him in Scotland. There can&rsquo;t be any more than that.</p>
<p>The French magician</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Celtic 5-1 Hamilton</p>
<p>In the end, it was a rout, but even though Hamilton were buried under a goals mountain, they still gave a decent account of themselves.</p>
<p>That might seem a peculiar thing to say when you&rsquo;ve been done 5-1, but the visitors created chances, caused some bother, never gave up. It&rsquo;s just that they came up against a team that had no right to be this slick this early in the season after more than four months without a game that meant anything.</p>
<p>Just before kick-off, Hamilton head coach Brian Rice was asked about the champions&rsquo; flag day and the odd circumstances it was taking place in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not our flag day,&rdquo; he shot back, in the manner of a guy who was just about to reinforce a message to his players that they weren&rsquo;t in Glasgow to worship at the altar of their nine-in-in-row hosts.</p>
<p>Hamilton took their lead from their boss&rsquo; fighting talk. After 20 minutes of chances, mostly for Celtic but some reasonable ones for the visitors, the aggression spilled over a touch and there was a price to pay.</p>
<p>When Scott Martin cynically tripped the flying Jeremie Frimpong, there was a bit of a contretemps in midfield. Scott Brown mouthed-off at Martin and Martin replied in kind. Brown pointed at him in the style of a player saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be seeing you later&rsquo; and Martin did the same. There was only ever going to be one winner there.</p>
<p>Hamilton were competitive, their spirit strong, but two minutes after that mini spat between Brown and Martin, Celtic launched an attack that told us much about why they are champions. Edouard&rsquo;s opening goal was a peach, a length-of-the field beauty that began with Scott Bain, involved a pair of one-twos culminating with a precise cross from Greg Taylor to Edouard and a tap-in for the striker.</p>
<p>It only took seconds, was done at pace and with every contribution right on the money. If Celtic had scored this type of goal two months into a season when they were up to the speed of league football, you&rsquo;d have called it excellent. The fact that they did it 20 minutes into their first game of the season was something else entirely.</p>
<p>For a man of 6ft 2in, Edouard has a brilliant knack of making himself invisible in moments like that. As Taylor prepared to play the decisive ball, the Frenchman was surrounded by Hamilton defenders and yet alone in a pocket of space. He pointed to where he wanted Taylor to place the pass and when it arrived he duly planted it into the net.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We saw difference between Celtic and Rangers&rsquo;</p>
<p>Media playback is not supported on this device Highlights: Aberdeen 0-1 Rangers</p>
<p>One goal became two inside 11 minutes and here we saw a difference between Celtic on Sunday and Rangers on Saturday. Rangers were completely dominant at Pittodrie and yet couldn&rsquo;t add the second goal their play deserved. Celtic did it with ease.</p>
<p>The argument that their job was simpler because Aberdeen represent a tougher nut to crack than Hamilton is moot. In their penultimate game before lockdown, many of the same Hamilton players went to Ibrox and won.</p>
<p>Edouard&rsquo;s second and Celtic&rsquo;s third was another that went 100 yards-plus, from Bain and Christopher Jullien and Brown and Frimpong to Ryan Christie and James Forrest, who set up for Edouard. It wasn&rsquo;t just the speed of movement that did for Hamilton, it was the speed of thought. It was a goal of high class.</p>
<p>The striker&rsquo;s third began not quite near their own penalty box but certainly in their own half and it was an exercise in split-second ruthlessness. When Edouard put it away it was his 14th league goal in 14 league games, a return that many a terrific Celtic centre-forward of the last few decades would have been envious of. Patryk Klimala, scorer of a smart fifth, has his template on how it&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Lennon spoke glowingly of Edouard in the aftermath. Once he finished describing how good he currently is and how much better he can become over the next few years, he might have been advised to then tamper with the telecommunications at Celtic Park while driving to Lennoxtown and doing the same.</p>
<p>The last thing Lennon will want is for the phone to start ringing, bringing with it the fear of the Frenchman being lured away in this season of all seasons. When you have a player like Edouard, there are twin emotions - joy of having him and concern of losing him. Celtic will focus on the former for now. They&rsquo;re up and running. Same as before.

Celtic defender Jeremie Frimpong insisted he is paying no attention to what Rangers do after the Hoops began their quest for 10 in a row in style.</p>
<p>Steven Gerrard’s side came through a tough Premiership opener against Aberdeen at Pittodrie on Saturday with a 1-0 win.</p>
<p>Champions Celtic, after unfurling the ninth title-winning flag at Parkhead on Sunday, responded with a thumping 5-1 triumph over Hamilton.</p>
<p>Full-back Frimpong, who scored the second goal with French striker Odsonne Edouard netting a hat-trick and Polish substitute Patryk Klimala getting his first competitive Celtic goal in the final moments, said after the game that he is unperturbed by what their Old Firm rivals are doing.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old, signed from Manchester City in 2019, said: “I don’t really care about Rangers, if they lose or win.</p>
<p>“I just focus on Celtic and what is the goal ahead. We go out to win. We don’t really care about other teams. We just care about ourselves.”</p>
<p>It was a difficult day for Hamilton, who scored through a deflected Scott Martin strike to make it 2-1 at the interval.</p>
<p>However, Celtic improved further in the second half, to the delight of boss Neil Lennon, and ended up easy winners.</p>
<p>Accies boss Brian Rice said: “We had a few chances and had worked on things which we felt would help us create chances.</p>
<p>“But, as I said to them, I’ve been here many, many times when at half-time you think you are doing all right.</p>
<p>“But the first 20 minutes of the second half are crucial at Celtic Park.</p>
<p>“Two goals in the first few minutes of the second half killed the game off.”

<p>That Steven Gerrard’s a lucky man.</p>
<p>If the lockdown hadn’t intervened in March and Celtic had gone to Ibrox, beaten Rangers and moved 16 points clear at the top of the Premiership table, the manager would have faced calls for his dismissal from his own fans.</p>
<p>Calls the Ibrox hierarchy might have found it impossible to throw out of the court of public opinion.</p>
<p>You couldn’t be accused of an over-active imagination if you think that scenario was eminently possible.</p>
<p>Now, instead of being 90 minutes from the sack, the manager’s employers have found a magic money tree and provided Gerrard with funds to buy the players he needs to avoid the next brush with the bullet.</p>
<p>The nightmare scenario for him is that Celtic get a quadruple Treble for their Christmas by winning the Scottish Cup Final then go on to 10 In A Row.</p>
<p>(Image: SNS Group)</p>
<p>At which point Steven can set off down the road for a reunion with his family on Merseyside – and no one will block his path on the way to the front door on Edmiston Drive.</p>
<p>On the basis that one man’s immortality is another man’s infamy, Gerrard could always prevent Ten In A Row from happening, of course, and inflict a watershed moment on Celtic in general – and Neil Lennon in particular.</p>
<p>There will be no mitigating circumstances available to the Hoops manager who has worked wonders in the aftermath of Brendan Rodgers’ sudden departure.</p>
<p>Some Celtic fans see Leicester City’s collapse in the closed-door finale to a title race that once had them in contention for a Champions League place as a judgment from above.</p>
<p>Now they will cast out into the wilderness anyone who lets them down in the pursuit of the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>(Image: SNS Group)</p>
<p>Eternal damnation, it’s the only fit punishment. But it now remains to be seen if there is a divine providence that halts Celtic and Rangers at nine titles in succession and prevents one or the other from re-writing history.</p>
<p>I have lived through three nine-in-a-row events, starting with Celtic’s championship win at Motherwell 54 years ago.</p>
<p>That run, completed in 1975, was the best because of the quality of the opposition.</p>
<p>Can you imagine winning a European trophy and appearing in another European final but not being able to win your own domestic league?</p>
<p>That fate befell Rangers and spoke volumes for Celtic’s achievement in being dominant for so long in so distinguished a field.</p>
<p>But a flag unfurled inside an empty stadium, as will happen at Celtic Park this afternoon, is still a championship flag.</p>
<p>There’s no need for talk about an asterisk and no room for claims that Celtic’s nine is somehow blemished by Rangers’ absence from the major league for four seasons.</p>
<p>(Image: SNS Group)</p>
<p>League business does not go into suspended animation because a club mismanaged its business affairs all the way ultimately to liquidation.</p>
<p>By the same token, titles are not tainted by the payment of EBTs unless someone can prove illegality on Rangers’ part – and that has yet to happen.</p>
<p>Whatever’s coming down the track this season, you’ll need to accept it. It’s like the SPFL’s judgment to call last season’s league early due to the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic, a decision upheld in law last week.</p>
<p>Just because you don’t like that outcome doesn’t mean it’s the wrong one.</p>
<p>(Image: Craig Foy/SNS Group)</p>
<p>If the rule of law is not your thing then stand over there with the fly-tippers and face mask refuseniks while the rest get on with the game.</p>
<p>And getting on with the game really should be our biggest worry. If there’s a second wave of coronavirus then I’m told the SPFL could withstand a two-week break.</p>
<p>But not a two-month interruption.</p>
<p>There are no contingency plans for what would happen in that eventuality and no talks scheduled because some clubs do not trust the SPFL’s administration.</p>
<p>So if the worst happens, the next course of action will be determined by a vote – and we all know where one of those got us the last time.</p>
<p>Meantime, the arbitration panel who relegated Hearts and Partick Thistle will now meet to decide who bears the legal cost of going to The Court of Session.</p>
<p>God forbid anything happens but if the Premiership has to be stopped again this season it might be cheaper to go on the Judge Rinder programme and make it pay-per-view to watch him decide who wins the league.
