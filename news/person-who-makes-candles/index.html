<p>Birthday celebrations in 2019: “It’s time for cake!” Everyone trickles into the kitchen and surrounds the dining room table as the candles on the cake are set ablaze atop the artfully decorated cake.</p>
<p>article continues below</p>
<p>“Okay, let’s sing Happy Birthday&hellip; Happy Birthday to you&hellip; Happy Birthday to you&hellip; Happy Birrrrrrrthdaaayyy dear (insert name here)! Happy Birthday to you!”</p>
<p>“Make a wish and blow out the candles!”</p>
<p>A deep inhale and then an exhale, emptying the lungs and blowing ‘moistly’ on the lovely angel food cake covered in whipping cream.</p>
<p>“I wanna blow!” screams the first grandchild</p>
<p>Screams the second grandchild: “NO! I wanna blow!”</p>
<p>Candles are now relit and both grandchildren sit on the birthday person’s knee and they blow as hard as they can, moistly, on the cake.</p>
<p>Now, we remove the candles and cut the cake, serving it to everyone in the room. The air crackles with conversation: “How is your bronchitis? Did you get antibiotics?” Or, “No cake for you? You sick or something?”</p>
<p>We don’t give a thought that the top of the cake is now a petri dish alive with whatever the birthday celebrant was currently incubating, not to mention what the two grandchildren spittled and splattered all over the cake – invisible, yet multiplying.</p>
<p>When I think about our pre COVID rituals, I shake my head. It’s no wonder school kids are continually sick. Think about the darn birthday party circuit.</p>
<p>I think about this because my niece is going to be celebrating her 5th birthday in a few weeks. Her mom has already thought about the candle-blowing, and has arranged for her to have a single cupcake. This cupcake will have a candle that is set alight and wishes can be made and the candle can be blown..</p>
<p>Will that be how you order a birthday cake from a bakery in this day and age? Will you automatically receive a large cake for the crowd and a single, small cake for the ritual of the candle blowing? It reminds me of the throwaway bouquet that goes hand-in-hand with the bridal bouquet – one to keep and one to throw. In this case, it’s one to eat and one to blow.</p>
<p>A friend of mine told me they have a wooden birthday cake that serves this purpose (genius). It has holes for candles and is used for the singing and the blowing, while the edible cake is left free of germs.</p>
<p>Dragon’s Den here I come!</p>

<p><img src="https://framinghamsource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BLM.june_.14.protest.cushing.2020.jpeg" alt="img">
FRAMINGHAM – A Black Lives Matter candle lighting ceremony is scheduled for Sunday, June 14 at Cushing Memorial Park.</p>
<p>The event organized by Anjeh Tita, will take place at 3 p.m. near the September 11 gazebo at the park.</p>
<p>“I really wanted to organize this because I feel every single black person that has died from racism deserves to be honored and this is the best way I know how, since they are always on my mind. I just want to make sure every black person or person of color can feel safe just driving home for in these times I fear for my black brothers and sister,” said Tita.</p>
<p>All are invited to attend and bring a candle.</p>
<p>“I am calling ALL Framingham Citizens AND our neighboring towns to join us in demanding change for racial injustices, police brutality, justice, and fighting all black lives,” said Tita.</p>
<p>Tita asked that everyone dress all in black for the event.</p>
<p>“I know the world 🌍 has been very crazy these past few day and lots of things are out of our control. But with everything happening, I am a strong believer in trying to center yourself and express your emotions,” she wrote on social media in the posting for the event. “I want to ask you all to come join me on Sunday for a peaceful gathering filled with; talking, sharing and venting, candle lighting ceremony to honor and mourn our black brothers and sisters and prayer (any and all religions are welcomed).”</p>
<p>Tita said she hopes Framingham Police Chief Steven Trask, his deputy chiefs and police officers will attend the event.</p>
<p>“I think the black community and support need a space to pray, join together in peace and vent out/ release pent up emotion,” said the 10 year-resident of Fraingham.</p>
<p>She said the event is a peaceful event.</p>
<p>“This day is to honor and stand together peacefully talking and figuring out ways to make a change,” said Tita.</p>

<h3 id="vancouver-candle-co-apologizes-after-racist-messages-shared-online">&ldquo;Vancouver Candle Co. apologizes after racist messages shared online&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.dailyhive.com/20200608114124/VCC-500x258.png" alt="img">
A Vancouver-based sales agency shared screenshots of racist messages over the weekend that its owners say they received from Vancouver Candle Co. employees, prompting the candle-maker to issue an apology.</p>
<p>In the screenshots shared by Warner McDaniel Agency, which describes itself as a boutique sales agency for lifestyle and beauty products, one Vancouver Candle Co. employee uses anti-Semitic language and another appears to support using the N-word.</p>
<p>“Racism is real and this is our story,” Warner McDaniel wrote in the caption. “Our business is woman-owned, and owned by a woman of colour. A proud black woman, born and raised in British Columbia. What we are sharing has left us speechless, heartbroken and silent.”</p>
<p>The agency also shared a third message from an unnamed number calling one of Warner McDaniel’s employees the N-word.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Vancouver Candle Co. addressed the allegations in its own Instagram post. It confirmed the messages labelled “Vancouver Candle Co.” and “Nicholas” were sent by their employees in 2017. It said it did not know who sent the message referring to the Warner McDaniel employee as the N-word.</p>
<p>“We are not proud of this type of vulgar language. In context and out of context, this is not appropriate and we are deeply apologetic,” Vancouver Candle Co. wrote. “We apologize to Warner McDaniel and to all those that we have hurt. For that, we are truly sorry.”</p>
<p>The candle company added it severed business ties with Warner McDaniel in 2018 and said the two businesses are involved in “ongoing litigation.”</p>
<p>Both Instagram posts have well over 1,000 comments, many of them from people saying they will no longer buy Vancouver Candle Co.’s products. Daily Hive has reached out to Warner McDaniel for an interview but has not yet heard back.

<h3 id="vancouver-candle-co-founder-resigns-from-company-after-racist-messages-surface">&ldquo;Vancouver Candle Co. founder resigns from company after racist messages surface&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4979014.1591833871!/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png" alt="img">
VANCOUVER &ndash; The founder and creative director of the Vancouver Candle Co. says he is resigning his position with the company, days after racist messages appeared on social media.</p>
<p>In a post to Instagram on Tuesday, the company shared an image with the words &ldquo;I F**KED UP&rdquo; written on top of a grey background, along with a lengthy caption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I did not send the offending text message that used the N-word, I did rationalize the use of that hateful slur as being an acceptable part of pop culture,&rdquo; the caption, written by company founder Nick Rabuchin, reads. &ldquo;I apologize sincerely and absolutely. I was totally out of line &amp; wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rabuchin also admits to sending a &ldquo;derogatory text about a fellow member of the Jewish community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My text was most offensive. I&rsquo;m ashamed and embarrassed. I apologized to the recipient and I apologize now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Rabuchin goes on to say that he will be stepping away from the company and plans to take sensitivity training. He also says that he will be contacting Black Lives Matter Vancouver and the Jewish Foundation of Greater Vancouver with an apology.</p>
<p>The company faced intense backlash earlier this week after Warner McDaniel Agency, a boutique sales business, posted a series of photos on Instagram showing text messages using racial slurs. The company said it received the messages from Vancouver Candle Co.</p>
<p>In addition to a number of local retailers – including Vancouver&rsquo;s Welk General Store and North Vancouver&rsquo;s Get Dressed – Indigo Books &amp; Music says it has also decided to stop selling Vancouver Candle Co. products.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Indigo, we take pride in the assortment of products and brands we carry,&rdquo; an emailed statement from the company says. &ldquo;Given current events, we are removing all Vancouver Candle Company products from our site and stores.&rdquo;</p>

The event was a tribute to the black lives matter movement and featured an eight minute, 46 second moment of silence, as well as a performance of &ldquo;Show Me&rdquo; by Dispatch guitarist Pete Francis and his family. less Riverside residents Ama Boaten, left, and Nana Boateng participate in the candlelight vigil in memory of George Floyd at Binney Park in Old Greenwich, Conn.

<p>GREENWICH — With the sun setting around them, people gathered in Binney Park Wednesday night for a candlelight vigil marking the life and death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis’ man’s death, captured on video, at the hands of police has sparked international protest and demands for reforms in law enforcement practices.</p>
<p>With candles lit, event co-organizer Whitney Keyes urged the approximately 150 gathered in Old Greenwich to “spread love and peace of our hearts” by “bringing the light of all the love in our hearts into this universe.”</p>
<p>“All of us have seen the video and felt the trauma of a hate crime that we all witnessed,” Keyes said. “Because of social media, never again will human rights violations go unnoticed by the world. I’ve been so encouraged by all of the protest and all of the outcry. This can no longer happen.”</p>
<p>The candles were lit and held for an eight-minute-47-second observation of silence to signify the length of time that police officer Derek Chauvin had his knee on the back of Floyd’s neck as he lay, handcuffed on his stomach on the pavement.</p>
<p>Keyes and Meg Nolan Van Reesema, president of the Old Greenwich Association, organized the event with the help of JJ Worden, who coordinated the involvement of the nearby First Congregational Church. The church’s bells rang after the observation of silence.</p>
<p>“We want to send a message of unity and togetherness while recognizing what we need to do to move to a brighter future,” Van Reesema said, adding later that organizers wanted to pay tribute not only to Floyd, but all others who came before him.</p>
<p>Pete Francis, a town resident and a member of the band Dispatch, performed his original song “Show Me” with his wife and children, to send, he said, a message about “coming back to love to heal.”</p>
<p>Many families attended the vigil, along with children. Some took to marking the pavement walking trail with chalk, writing down messages including “Be Love,” “Black Is the Same as White,” “This Is Not Fair” and “Black Lives Matter.”</p>
<p>“We want our children to be able to digest the trauma that we’ve all gone through in seeing these videos,” Keyes said. “We want to be a part of creating a vision of what we want to see in the world and the love we want to express in the world.”</p>
<p>Among attendees were Jamil and Prema Wayland, who brought their children Ellie, Alex and Avery, because they wanted them to learn that the more people speak out, the more they are heard.</p>
<p>“We wanted to support the cause and be there with people and all the sadness we’re all feeling,” Jamil Wayland said. “We want to make it known that we all care and we all have a voice. We’re here to support everything that’s going on.”</p>
<p>“We’re an interracial family and being a person of color I wanted to support Black Lives Matter and support the community and hope we all come together, listen and educate ourselves,” Prema Wayland added. “We have to learn from this.”</p>
