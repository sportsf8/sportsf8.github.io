<p>MUMBAI: Arjun Kapoor, who is currently binge watching acclaimed &rsquo;90s TV series &ldquo;Byomkesh Bakshi&rdquo;, says he wishes to play a detective on screen.</p>
<p>Byomkesh Bakshi, based on the fictional character created by writer Sharadindu Bandyopadhyay and starring Rajit Kapur, is being re-telecasted on DD National during the nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of coronavirus pandemic in the country.</p>
<p>For Arjun, this show is like a whiff of nostalgia from his childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever I could catch &lsquo;Byomkesh Bakshi&rsquo; as a kid, I remember I enjoyed it thoroughly. For me, Byomkesh was what a hero should be. Slick, super-intelligent, and charismatic, he is one of the best sleuths that I have seen on screen!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been watching &lsquo;Byomkesh&hellip;&rsquo; on TV again and it is pure nostalgia for me,&rdquo; Arjun said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to the 34-year-old actor, the show is backed by great writing and acting, which makes it a &ldquo;timeless&rdquo; watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing about Byomkesh was that he solved intelligent crimes and that really hooked me on. The writing, the cleverness of the cases really got me interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The show still hooks you thoroughly and that&rsquo;s what great writing, great acting can do.</p>
<p>Great content has the ability to become timeless and universal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arjun said he does wish to play a detective on screen, someday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had always wanted to play a detective who saves the day and saves lives. I got to live my childhood dream by playing an undercover agent and saving the country in &lsquo;India&rsquo;s Most Wanted&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I still hope I get to play a detective on-screen one day,&rdquo; he said.

<h3 id="ranbir-kapoor-to-play-byomkesh-bakshi-in-his-new-project-alia-bhatt-to-play-female-lead">&ldquo;Ranbir Kapoor To Play Byomkesh Bakshi In His New Project, Alia Bhatt To Play Female Lead?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.odishatv.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Alia-Bhatt-Ranbir-Kapoor.jpg" alt="img">
Ranbir Kapoor currently has two projects-Brahmastra and Shamshera in his kitty. The first movie is being directed by his close friend Ayan Mukerjee and produced by Dharma Productions whereas Shamshera is being produced under the YRF banners. While Alia will be playing the female lead in Ayan’s movie, Vaani Kapoor is being paired with the “Sanju” actor in Shamshera.</p>
<p>Currently, the shootings have been paused and it has been a big jolt to the movie industry. Many sets had to be dismantled and bookings canceled as the uncertainty of when everything will come back to normalcy continues. That is why Ayan who was keen to complete Brahmastra very fast has decided to take the help of VRX experts from Hollywood. Despite the lockdown, negotiations and discussions regarding new projects are still on.</p>
<p>Ranbir Kapoor To Play Vyomkesh Bakshi?</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertisement -</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently when a picture of Ranbir Kapoor in the getup of a detective went viral, fans could not stop speculating about a new movie project. Many believe that the actor would be wonderful as Byomkesh Bakshi, a fictitious character who has currently made a comeback on Doordarshan during the lockdown. The serial was a big hit when it aired on Doordarshan with Rajat Kapoor playing the lead character during the nineties.</p>
<p>Now fans are wondering whether Ranbir is thinking of playing a detective in his next project. He has already played the role of a detective in Jagga Jasos which also starred his ex-girlfriend, Katrina Kaif. It is rumored that Ranbir was not keen on doing this movie but had accepted on Katrina’s insistence.</p>
<p>But the character of Byomkesh Bakshi is way different from this movie and is also quite challenging. Ranbir is known for his perfection similar to Aamir Khan and is ready to make huge changes in himself to ensure that he looks like the real character. So if at all Ranbir is planning to play a detective in his next movie, he may have already started trying up the look for his role.</p>

<p>Also, the speculations are on whether Alia Bhatt will be roped in to play the female lead.</p>
<p>Even though fans are yet to see their onscreen chemistry, their social media pictures and videos are widely followed and loved. Also, both Ranbir and Alia are one of the finest actors from the current lot; fans are assured that they will make justice to their roles.

Ramayan, Mahabharat and old TV hits find takers in this generation seeking the comfort of nostalgia</p>
<p>Every crisis brings with it an opportunity and the present pandemic has resurrected the nearly-dead public service broadcaster founded by the Government in the late 50s, Doordarshan (DD). Time was when DD, as it was colloquially called, was the only channel in the country and people used to wait the whole week for their all-time favourites, Chitrahaar, Krishi Darshan and, of course, the Sunday movie. Then DD began expanding its fare with Sunday and primetime treats like Star Trek, Secrets of the Sea, Here’s Lucy, Yes, Minister, Different Strokes and the likes. But of course, these were watched mostly by the urban, English-speaking viewers and not by the masses. Then in the 80s came the era of the mega soaps, like Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan and BR Chopra’s Mahabharat and the whole of India was hooked to DD like never before. No one had ever attempted something on such a huge scale before and, of course, the mythological content was lapped up by everyone in urban and rural India alike, because we in India wear our religion on our sleeves. People actually used to factor in their social commitments around Ramayan and Mahabharat, such was their hold on the imagination. Then came the era of Direct to Home channels with slick productions powered by money and unfettered use of better technology, something that DD, bogged down by red-tapism and babudom, could not compete with. But in Corona-weary times and a distraught nation seeking solace and comfort in the simple joys of nostalgia, Ramayan and other old hits have rescued DD yet again as a leader of content. In fact, March 25 onwards, most TV channels actually had a “captive” audience, viewership rising by 37 per cent.</p>
<p>And as live soaps began drying up due to actors being unable to arrive for shoots due to the nationwide lockdown, DD dug into its archives to pull out its hit shows of the 80s and had the nation hooked again. In the first week of April 3, a whopping 545.8 million viewers tuned in to DD National to watch reruns of Ramayan while 145.8 million watched Mahabharat on DD Bharti, says a report by Broadcast Audience Research Council. Reruns of Shaktimaan on DD National attracted 20.8 million viewers, while Byomkesh Bakshi, Shrimaan Shrimati, Buniyaad, Dekh Bhai Dekh and Circus also witnessed a similar rise in viewership. Shows that when it comes to content, DD did have a spark at one time. Maybe it will reinvent itself, post-lockdown, prizing quality once again.

For Yasmin Walker, a humanitarian worker stationed in northern Iraq, returning to simpler times by listening to radio plays she first heard as a kid helped calm her nerves during a stressful and chaotic time. “When missiles were launched at a nearby air base in January and there was talk of evacuating us, I cleaned my entire apartment while listening to The Murder on the Links by Agatha Christie. It was the same again after getting out of the country on the last flight before they closed the airspace because of Covid-19 – I had Agatha on my headphones,” she says.</p>
<p>“Agatha is from a very specific time in my life – from when I was about nine or 10 and my family used to sit around and listen to them. They’re set in the 1920s and 30s, which for some reason I find a really comforting time. If I’m really stressed, I can almost physically feel the effect they have on me. I clearly remember that feeling when I was cleaning my apartment – your heart rate and breathing slows and it’s like a warm fog goes into your brain and dampens down all the stress. I don’t even really listen to the storyline, the tone is enough.”</p>
<p>Psychotherapist and author of The Phone Addiction Workbook, Hilda Burke, agrees it’s possible to find shelter and reassurance in a familiar TV or radio show. “I can imagine that in situations where you’re faced with an unpredictable and dangerous environment, you would find comfort in being ‘cocooned’ by a familiar TV or radio show. Maybe the unconscious driver being ‘nothing bad can happen when I’m watching or listening to x’,” she explains.</p>
<p>Of course one of the hardest things about living day-to-day life in lockdown, amid strict social distancing measures, is a lack of human contact – many people have not had any physical contact, such as a hug, with another person, nor had a face-to-face conversation for more than a few minutes, for several weeks.</p>
<p>Although wrapping ourselves in the comfort blanket of feelgood cultural favourites doesn’t replace touch, or conversation, they can help with loneliness by rooting – and routing – us to people we are close to. “Nostalgic entertainment gives our lives a sense of personal history, meaning and belonging, as we appreciate our connection with our communities and significant others, and ourselves,” says Dr Pointer, who’s recently revisited the Back to the Future trilogy and Edward Scissorhands. In terms of Indian TV, it could be the appeal of fantasy as much as nostalgia: after the success of The Ramayan, DD National is set to bring back another mythological series, Sri Krishna. Either way, it allows us to escape – into another world, and another time.</p>
