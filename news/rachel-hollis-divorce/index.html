<p>Alright, I think we can all admit at this point that the thing preventing us from reading the stack of books on our bedside table <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> that we don&rsquo;t have enough free time. Right now I&rsquo;ve got nothing but free time and yet I&rsquo;m not plowing through an impressive pile of literature any more than I am starting every day with a yoga sesh. Thankfully, sitting down with a physical book isn&rsquo;t the only way to &ldquo;read&rdquo; things due to the glorious invention of the audiobook. So when you&rsquo;re absolutely spent after a day of Zoom happy hours and working from home (aka your couch), throw on an audiobook, close your eyes, and let a stranger (who, most likely, is famous and super accomplished) read to you.</p>
<p>So many kick-ass audiobooks have already come out this year, so if you&rsquo;re jonesing for a buzzy new release that&rsquo;ll keep you hooked for hours, you&rsquo;re in luck. There&rsquo;s a Hunger Games prequel, a creepy collection of Stephen King stories, a few spooky crime novels, and a handful of juicy summer reads—all narrated beautifully for your listening pleasure. All you have to do is pop in your headphones and smash the play button, though going to the trouble of pouring yourself a glass of wine also won&rsquo;t hurt. Here are the 20 best audiobooks of 2020.

<p>You might have heard the saying that life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. If that saying were a person — well, have you met Rachel Hollis? Hollis, now a successful blogger, speaker, and author of the mega-best-selling book Girl, Wash Your Face, has come a long way from where she started: the tiny town of Weedpatch, California, an unincorporated community southeast of Bakersfield that’s one of the poorest parts of Kern County, with 2,394 residents and a median household income of $28,451. You might remember that name from a scene in The Grapes of Wrath, in which a watchman at the migrant worker camp in Weedpatch tells the Joad family about the “Holy Rollers” — Pentecostal ministers — who had been coming through town. They kept asking for money, so the camp’s Central Committee decided that “‘Any preacher can preach in this camp. Nobody can take up a collection in this camp.’ And it was kinda sad for the old folks, ’cause there hasn’t been a preacher in since.’” Hollis is herself the daughter and granddaughter of Holy Rollers whose family migrated from Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Kansas to end up in Weedpatch. She writes in the book about leaving home after high school and striking out for Los Angeles, where an obsession with Matt Damon led her to apply for (and get) a job at Miramax (which had produced Good Will Hunting). That job led to Rachel meeting her husband and eventually starting a wildly successful event-planning company, Chic Events, which morphed into a lifestyle blog called the Chic Site, which in turn has led to the creation of a nebulous, evolving business empire — first the communications and branding company Chic Media, now the Hollis Company, through which Hollis and her husband Dave (now the company’s CEO) oversee her motivational speaking circuit and podcast as well as “Rise” conferences for women and couples. And did I mention the books? At 35, now living outside of Austin, Hollis has written three novels, two cookbooks, and, as of this year, the #1 New York Times best-selling book Girl, Wash Your Face.</p>
<p>AP Rachel Hollis with her husband Dave during an interview.</p>
<p>Girl, Wash Your Face, which was published in February 2018 by Thomas Nelson, a HarperCollins imprint devoted to “Christian content,” is an amalgam of stories, tough-love advice from a woman who has been there, and vaguely biblical encouragement. This is structured by tackling the various “lies” that Hollis believes have held her back — and maybe you too? — which she deconstructs chapter by chapter: “I Am Bad at Sex,” “I Should Be Further Along by Now,” “I Am Defined by My Weight,” and so on. “Recognizing the lies we’ve come to accept about ourselves is the key to growing into a better version of ourselves,” Hollis writes. Promotional copy from the publisher’s website describes it thusly: “With unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity, Girl, Wash Your Face shows you how to live with passion and hustle — and how to give yourself grace without giving up.” It’s simple, according to Hollis: Stop breaking promises to yourself. You, after all, are the only one in control of how your life goes. It is hard to overstate the popularity of this book. Since its release in February, according to Publishers Weekly, Girl, Wash Your Face has maintained a spot in the top 10 best-selling books in the country for seven months, has held the No. 1 spot for 12 of those weeks (it is now No. 8), and has sold more than 880,000 total copies in the US. The book has almost 7,000 Amazon reviews, the vast majority of them five stars; as of the week of Nov. 4, it remains the No. 1 best-selling nonfiction book on Amazon, and currently the site’s second-most popular book of the year (outsold only by Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury). But if you aren’t already familiar with the book, or Hollis, you might be forgiven for wondering: What, exactly, is she saying that people are so eager to hear?</p>
<p>Hollis is all of us — only she doesn’t have to try at all. Or is she trying the hardest?</p>
<p>Hollis also uploads a steady trickle of videos to her 71,000+ YouTube subscribers, with topics ranging from chatty family life updates (“Say Hello to Dave’s New Bronco!”) to, recently, inspirational montages pieced together from her speaking engagements (“Do you feel like giving up?”). The homepage of the Chic Site, as of mid-October, featured a recipe for slow-cooker pumpkin spice latté, a post about how to incorporate Spanx leggings into your fall look, and a video on how to host a “Girls Night In,” sponsored by Rubbermaid. Even as the core of Hollis&rsquo;s business shifts away from being, as she puts it, “a lifestyle influencer,” this lifestyle is still largely what Hollis is selling. She wants to be relatable, and she is, to many thousands of women, in her blog posts and her speeches and her best-selling book. “I’m not an expert. I’m not a guru,” Hollis told the AP in September. “Anything I’ve ever done, the work I’ve done, has always been like your girlfriend telling you what worked for her.” Hollis is all of us — overloaded, exhausted, smiling through the long days of work, child care, meal prep, and relationship highs and lows. Only she doesn’t have to try at all. Or is she trying the hardest? Hollis “vowed to be authentic and sincere” in her online life, which is why, she writes, “for every gloriously styled cupcake picture we produced, I shared a photo of myself with facial paralysis.” (She at one point suffered from stress-related Bell’s palsy.) In the book’s first chapter, Hollis describes getting dressed up and attending the Oscars with her then-Disney executive husband. “In these instances, photos show up on Instagram and Facebook of us looking well coiffed and ultra glam, and the internet goes wild.” Note the use of the passive voice here: “photos show up.” Not “photos are strategically posted at just the right time of day by my social media team for maximum engagement.” But even the “messy” pictures of Hollis are adorable, so maybe it doesn’t matter whether she’s wearing sweatpants or a designer brand so much as that her audience believes it’s real. Authentic. Sincere. Is that dishonest? What is honesty when your life is your brand? Hollis’s vow of authenticity doesn’t seem to extend very far into difficult political conversations, which isn’t surprising for someone with a popular lifestyle brand to maintain. In one YouTube video from August 2016, she referenced the “terrifying” state of politics in the US — just before saying, “I’m not going to talk about my beliefs or my political affiliation, because I know that we’re gonna some of us disagree, and I’d rather not know if you disagree.” But to my mind, her core philosophy itself is emblematic of a huge division in American thought that dominates our national discourse: Are people who have problems responsible for fixing them themselves? Or is there some collective responsibility that we are shirking — does a society owe something to all its members? There are dark implications in making everything a matter of personal responsibility, which is Hollis’s bias. She asks us to interrogate and deconstruct the lies that we’ve believed about ourselves, and I wonder how that lens would function if we turn it on the lies she promulgates in Girl, Wash Your Face.</p>
<p>There are dark implications in making everything a matter of personal responsibility.</p>
<p>The lie: “You, and only you, are ultimately responsible for who you become and how happy you are.” In good faith, I think that what Hollis (who declined to be interviewed for this story) means here is some “I am the captain of my soul,” “Invictus” stuff: I have to make the decision to be happy; no one else is going to do that for me. And to a degree, that makes sense. Your mental, physical, and emotional well-being are influenced by your mindset. But mindset isn’t the only thing that influences your well-being. Not everyone has enough money to let them take the kind of professional and financial risks that might lead to greater happiness, for example. Things like systemic racism can wear on a person to the point that it degrades her health at the same time it restricts her access to good health care, resulting in higher rates of chronic disease and shorter life expectancies for black women than white women. Can you tell a woman who has lost her hoped-for child as a result of state officials turning a blind eye to a water-poisoning crisis in a predominantly black area, or a mother seeking asylum whose child was taken away from her at the border, that “you are ultimately responsible for who you become and how happy you are”? You can, but you would be wrong. And cruel. Hollis doesn’t address the possibility that for some people, obstacles to happiness are outside their control. And it is proof of her hard-earned privilege that she doesn’t have to.</p>
<p>Rachel Hollis / YouTube</p>
<p>In a recent Instagram post thanking her followers for helping her sell over 1 million total copies of Girl, Wash Your Face, Hollis gives us some insight into whom she considers to be her target demographic, and who makes up the small army of readers that has helped build word-of-mouth buzz for her book: “Thank you for writing a review! Thank you for hollering at the other girls on your MLM team to read it! Thank you for telling the other wives on base that it’s worth their time!” I spoke with more than a dozen women for this story — friends of friends, people who responded on social media, and at least two women I spotted out in the wild — to try to understand exactly what it is about Hollis’s gospel that appeals to them. “I think the adversity she’s been through gives her a lot of credibility,” said Alex Ethridge, a 27-year-old marketing professional in Missouri. (Hollis had a difficult family upbringing — she calls it “traumatic” — and was just 14 years old when she found her older brother, Ryan, after he had killed himself.) Elissa Johnson, a 35-year-old mom in St. Louis who co-owns a small business with her husband, told me she appreciates Hollis’s tough-love approach: “There’s something refreshing in a post-truth world about rooting out some lies you might be telling yourself … It feels like so many things are out of our control in the world today, but there’s so much within our reach.” One of Hollis’s videos was particularly helpful for Chrissy Malson. A student and part-time teacher’s aide near Peoria, Illinois, Malson told me she always put herself “last on the list” and put her career on hold for her husband’s. She decided to go back to college last year to get a degree in occupational therapy. “This is terrifying for me,” Malson said. “Going back to college is scary.” But watching Hollis’s video about taking control of her life has inspired Malson. “It’s a reminder that &hellip; I can do hard things. I can do things that scare me. Yes, I have a family, a special needs kiddo, a husband who travels internationally, but I can do this. I define my reality.”</p>
<p>Rachel Hollis / YouTube / Via youtube.com</p>
<p>The video includes an image of Hollis running through a crowded room, high-fiving the people who have gathered to hear her speak. “You get to decide, right now, who you want to be,” the voiceover says. There is something to this, and something to hearing it from a woman, at least in a way that trades on a certain kind of privilege. I do get to decide, I want to tell myself. And I can decide. I am writing this on the outdoor patio of the $250/month coworking space I belong to in San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities in the world, where, thanks to my husband’s salary from his tech-sector job, I can afford to live. Being empowered to let go of my anxiety or self-criticism as a wealthy white woman is certainly helpful to me, and I appreciate that message from Hollis on a certain level. But my anxiety is largely rooted in unrealistic fears, whereas many women don’t have the opportunity to go back to college or own a house from which to be liberated. Hollis’s book is in many ways a return to the kind of second-wave feminism that privileged the liberation of middle-class straight white women from the domestic sphere while at the same time completely ignoring — or actively opposing — the rights and needs of poor and queer and nonwhite women. Hollis, who has four children, doesn’t mention child care at all in the book until the acknowledgments, when she thanks her nanny: “People ask me how I do it all, and the honest truth is, I absolutely don’t,” she writes. “Behind the scenes is an incredible, loving friend and sister who takes care of my kiddos when work or travel takes me away from them.” In one anecdote about the power of setting goals, Hollis recounts her obsession with buying a Louis Vuitton Speedy bag, which cost a thousand dollars. “I wanted it because it represented the kind of woman I dreamed of becoming,” she wrote. The day she got her first $10,000 consulting check, Hollis drove to the Louis Vuitton store at the Beverly Center and walked out with her bag. Hollis makes no attempt to interrogate her desire for an expensive designer bag here, just as there is no effort to interrogate her desire to own a vacation home in Hawaii by the time she’s 40. “Honestly, I think it’s kinda shameful and not something to be proud of,&rdquo; said Amber Cessac, a 32-year-old mother of five in Austin. The book caught Cessac’s eye at a local Target, and she found a few “nuggets of inspiration” in it. But she was turned off by what she saw as Hollis’s constant push for bigger and more expensive things. “She just comes off as so incredibly tone-deaf,” Cessac said.</p>
<p>Hollis equates having “made it” with being able to drop a lot of cash on a status-symbol bag, using purchasing power as a path to self-realization.</p>
<p>There is more than a hint of #Girlboss corporate feminism at work here, as Hollis equates having “made it” with being able to drop a lot of cash on a status-symbol bag, using purchasing power as a path to self-realization. And she takes that brand of feminism a step further by marrying it with Christianity, in what is essentially a Pinterest-worthy version of the prosperity gospel. This attitude has a historical context in the Pentecostal religious tradition in which Hollis was raised. Pentecostalism has always been the slightly embarrassing uncle at the evangelical family reunion — its unfiltered and emotional expressions of faith can make it look a little unseemly to outsiders. And Pentecostals have long associated spiritual blessing with material wealth, which may help explain why there is something talismanic about the Louis Vuitton bag for Hollis: It showed that her hard work and strategic goal-setting channeled the kind of earnest faith that God rewarded in the form of $10,000 consulting checks. A patina of racial diversity has been another hallmark of Pentecostalism, although during the civil rights era, racism from white leaders of the church caused a division that lasted through the 1960s, and well into today in some parts of the country. In the United States, the movement gained momentum in the early days of the 20th century with several well-known revivals, the most famous of which was the Azusa Street Revival in 1906, led by a black preacher named William Seymour. And as far back as the Azusa Street Revival, white Pentecostals displayed a religious version of black cultural appropriation. Charles Fox Parham, a preacher and early proponent of Pentecostalism, heard reports that “white people [were] imitating the unintelligent, crude negroisms of the Southland, and laying it on the Holy Ghost.” Interestingly, this kind of appropriation echoes throughout Girl, Wash Your Face. It is impossible to read the book and not notice Hollis’s frequent use of African American Vernacular English, beginning with the title. The book’s introduction is called “Hey Girl, Hey,” and Hollis uses a popular mangled version of a Maya Angelou quote (“when you know better, you do better”) to explain why she wants to become a better hip-hop dancer. Osheta Moore started following Rachel Hollis when Moore was living in Los Angeles. “I was going through this season of isolation after a cross-country move, and I wanted some inspiration,” said Moore, a pastor and author. “There was a time when she was more open about some of her family struggles and things that were going on, and I just found that really refreshing.” Moore was so inspired by Hollis’s work that she ended up getting an internship at Chic Media for several months in 2016, just before she published her own book. After working at Chic and following Hollis more closely, Moore started to notice that Hollis was influenced by “prosperity teachings” and people like Tony Robbins.</p>
<p>Rachel Hollis / YouTube / Via youtube.com</p>
<p>When Moore, who is black, interned at Chic, she said “it was a very diverse workspace.” She felt that Hollis had a blind spot around race, but liked the diversity of the team she worked with. There came a time, though, when Moore — as a woman who at one time hoped to work her way down to a size 14, a size Hollis said she was when she was her highest weight ever — “realized that either I had to kind of adjust some of my expectations in order to continue working there or change some of my views about my own body.” “For me, the point where it became really dangerous was when I noticed a fat-shaming component to her platform,” Moore said. “There’s a lot of talking about how being overweight is hindering you from achieving your dreams, or, ‘If you don’t stick to your diet, then you’re not a person of integrity.’ That shaming component is really harmful.” “You get one and only one chance to live, and life is passing you by,” Hollis writes in the introduction to Girl, Wash Your Face. “Stop beating yourself up, and dang it, stop letting others do it, too.” But anyone reading her book may find it hard to follow that last bit of advice. The trouble with, and the appeal of, curated imperfection is the assumption that all imperfections lie in the past — they have supposedly been understood, integrated, and learned from in order to create a present that is blissfully free from earlier mistakes. And at her worst, Hollis refashions her own (apparently resolved) struggles into astonishingly harsh instruction for other women, under the guise of women’s empowerment and tough love.</p>
<p>At her worst, Hollis refashions her own (apparently resolved) struggles into astonishingly harsh instruction for other women.</p>
<p>In a chapter of Girl, Wash Your Face about her “emotional eating” and desire to lose weight, Hollis warns the reader, “This is where I should tell you that I am worthy and loved as I am. This is absolutely true, but that’s not where I’m headed with this chapter.” For the next several pages, she continues to shame fat people: “Humans were not made to be out of shape and severely overweight. You can choose to continue to abuse your body because it’s all you know … You can choose to settle for a half-lived life because you don’t even know there’s another way … But please, please stop making excuses for the whys.” Hollis spends a lot of time on body image in Girl, Wash Your Face, but perhaps nowhere is it as harmful and ignorant as when she is berating people who do not “keep their commitments,” especially when using the example of dieting. “[D]iets do not work,” Michael Hobbes wrote in a recent HuffPost article on harmful misperceptions around obesity among medical professionals as well as civilians. “Not just paleo or Atkins or Weight Watchers or Goop, but all diets. Since 1959, research has shown that 95 to 98 percent of attempts to lose weight fail and that two-thirds of dieters gain back more than they lost.” Yet, according to Hollis, we shouldn’t respect women who don’t stick with their diets because we cannot rely on them to keep their word. She imbues fatness with the shame of moral failure and demeans women who struggle to — or do not want to — lose weight. This is perhaps the clearest encapsulation of the cruelty baked into Hollis’s philosophy. But it’s certainly not the only example.</p>
<p>Hollis and her husband went through a difficult time before adopting their daughter Noah, now about a year and a half old, in 2017. They signed up to be foster-to-adopt parents, and Hollis talks throughout the book about their wrenching experience with the adoption process. It was in the middle of these tumultuous few years, full of long days spent in survival mode, that Hollis started drinking more. “Vodka was my copilot, and I was grateful for its presence in my life,” she writes. But she has little to no empathy for the birth parents or family of the children she and her husband thought they would permanently adopt. When Hollis recounts waiting for the birth parents of one child to show up, her attitude of superiority and willful ignorance is almost breathtaking: How do you keep taking babies to see parents who aren’t parenting? How do you give up half a Saturday to wait in a McDonald’s playland for addicts who may or may not show up, then hand over an innocent baby and watch them erase whatever progress you’ve made with their daughter? How do you do all of this KNOWING that they’ll be reunited at the end of it all, and there’s nothing you can do about it? If you’re like me, you find a way. But at night, when no one is looking, you drink, and when it gets really bad, you take a Xanax, too. Hollis has made no secret of her past drinking issues; in an interview in September, she said, “I was abusing alcohol. I was making really poor choices, and I thought, gosh, I don’t want to go through the rest of my life like this.” But in her book, it’s clear that Hollis is the one readers are supposed to empathize with, and the “addict” parents are the bad guys. She’s bold enough to blame them not just for their parenting, but also, indirectly, for her own substance abuse. Which begs the question: When two people have similar struggles but one is white and one is not, when one is wealthy and one is not, when one writes books and blog posts and hosts conferences and the other goes to McDonald’s hoping to see their child for an hour a week — who gets to be the good mom?</p>

<p>Despite its undeniable popularity, Girl, Wash Your Face has not been met with universal acclaim. One indication of how polarizing it is is how many of the book’s Amazon reviews rated “most helpful” — despite an overall rating of 4.8 stars — give the book just one star: at last count, 43 out of the top 50. “I don’t understand all the hype about this book,” one such review begins. “Rachel Hollis’s life experience is so near perfect and so far removed from that of the average woman, that there is almost nothing in this book that is actually relatable.” (This review garnered more than 50 comments, nearly all of them agreeing.)</p>
<p>“What about women that have lost a child? Those that have been beaten, verbally abused, raped, or shot at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another popular review called the book “sanctimonious twaddle” and asked what Hollis could possibly offer women who have been through real hardships: “What about women that have lost a child? Those that have been beaten, verbally abused, raped, or shot at? What about those forging their way through life in male-dominated careers instead of party planning?” A third reviewer says that Hollis “lost me when she spends an hour talking about her super emotionally abusive relationship and then reveals that the abuser is now her husband.” One top Amazon review describes the book as “page upon page of her repeatedly tooting her own horn and every so often throwing God a bone,” and plenty of dissenters can be found within the Christian online community too. “Reading Girl, Wash Your Face exhausted me,” wrote Alisa Childers, a Christian blogger and singer-songwriter. “Make no mistake, sisters. This book is all about YOU … Jesus offers us true joy and peace, but only after we realize that we are not the center of our own lives and we are no longer in charge.” Another Christian blogger wrote that Hollis “fails to identify the ‘lies’ as a secular worldview with all that entails, and her solutions are self-sufficient and not Jesus-oriented.” I was struck by how liberally Hollis interpreted Bible verses to suit her message, like in a chapter about sex where she quotes Hebrews 13:4 (“Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled”) and says, “what I take away when I read that line is that the things that happen in my bed with my husband cannot be weird or bad or wrong.” No Biblical scholar on Earth would read that passage to suggest what she says, but to Hollis, traditional theology doesn’t seem to matter as much as finding Bible verses that seem to prop up the message she is communicating.</p>
<p>Hollis’s star seems to be on the rise — her next book, called Girl, Stop Apologizing, will be published in March — and her popularity shows no signs of waning; her next Rise conference, in June, is already sold out. From the ashes of her former life as a lifestyle influencer, Hollis is rising to lead an army of inspired women as a motivational speaker, media guru, business consultant, and tough-talking best friend, all in one. She has become a semi-secular preacher, and she has found her flock. Following in the footsteps of tough-love doyens before her, Hollis’s audience of mostly white, middle-class women will probably be glad to have someone to tell them what to do, how to follow their dreams, to give them permission never to break a promise to themselves. But, in what many people would consider to be a moment of full-blown cultural crisis in the United States, are white, middle-class women the people who most need a champion telling them to prioritize themselves above all others? There are so many systems in place to ensure that the people who are already down stay down: mass incarceration, voter disenfranchisement, rising health care costs, lack of public education, a narrowing path to citizenship for immigrants — the list goes on. And yet so many working and middle-class white people (not to mention billionaires) seem increasingly gripped with anxiety over the idea that what they have is not enough, or that what they deserve is somehow being taken from them by the undeserving. “You are in charge of your own life, sister, and there’s not one thing in it that you’re not allowing to be there,” Hollis writes. But Hollis’s glibness makes clear that her “sisters” are only such if they look like her, share her padded bank account (and her priorities), and don’t venture too far into the real and wrenching difficulties of life. The book never quite explains what it means to “wash your face,” but you get the idea that it’s a euphemism for toughening up, taking a good, hard look in the mirror, and getting out into the world with a kind of clear-eyed resolve. Rachel Hollis writes about that really well. I just wish she would actually do it. ●

Rosayra Pablo Cruz and Julie Schwietert Collazo. HarperOne, $26.99 (246p) ISBN 978-0-06-294192-3</p>
<p>This disturbing and unforgettable memoir follows the path of Guatemalan mother Pablo Cruz, who fled to the U.S. in 2018 with her two sons after her husband is murdered, she herself is shot, and her oldest son is threatened by criminals. Writing with Schwietert Collazo, who initiated the Immigrant Families Together grassroots organization to aid mothers detained at the U.S. border, Pablo Cruz narrates her agonizing eight-day journey to the border crammed in a truck with other refugees and her 81 days in a cell after being separated by ICE agents from her boys (ages five and 15). In the months without her boys, who are placed in foster care in the Bronx while she remains in Arizona, Pablo Cruz paints a heartbreaking picture of the many incarcerated mothers who spend hours weeping and praying together. A devout evangelical Christian, Pablo Cruz draws upon her faith to see her through the desolation and despair, and eventually her prayers are answered by a group of angry, “bad-ass ladies” from Immigrant Families Together who raise a $12,000 bond for her release. This wrenching story brings to vivid life the plight of the many families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. (June)

<h3 id="sony-pictures-amazon-alex-de-la-iglesia-set-the-fear-collection-exclusive">&ldquo;Sony Pictures, Amazon, Alex de la Iglesia Set ‘The Fear Collection’ (EXCLUSIVE)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/alex-de-la-iglesia-borja-b-hojas.jpgw1024-1000x600.jpeg" alt="img">
Sony Pictures International Productions and Amazon Prime Video have closed a multi-picture deal with celebrated Spanish cineaste Álex de la Iglesia to produce a new horror feature film anthology, “The Fear Collection.”</p>
<p>Put through Pokeepsie Films, De la Iglesia and Carolina Bang’s Madrid-based production company, the deal will see De la Iglesia direct and/or produce movies from The Fear Collection, which also take in suspense titles.</p>
<p>Produced in association with Amazon Prime Video, the films will be initially theatrically released by Sony Pictures Entertainment Iberia. They will then be made available on Amazon Prime in Spain. SPIP will control all distribution rights for each picture outside of Spain.</p>
<p>Though always made under De la iglesia’s creative influence, movies may be directed by other notable filmmakers. Sony announced Thursday that several projects are currently in development for “The Fear Collection,” with established writers and directors such as the De la Iglesia himself teaming with his longterm co-writer Jorge Guerricaechevarría as well as “[REC]” writer-director Jaume Balagueró, Paula Ortiz, director of B.O. breakout “The Bride,” Fernando Navarro, co-writer of Paco Plaza’s Netflix hit “Verónica,” and Carlos Theron, director of 2019 Telecinco Cinema B.O. hit “I Can Quit Whenever I Want.”</p>
<p>Related Stories</p>
<p>De la Iglesia is, moreover, bringing to the table a precise idea of the caliber of fear which will set the Collection apart.</p>
<p>He commented: “It’s an ambitious project that I’ve been hauling around for years. The concept is to make a collection of films that unveil a universe of horror beyond time. The characters face supernatural forces that threaten humanity. The idea is to generate a label of films with a specific character, Cosmic Horror.”</p>
<p>The partners will aim to produce two films a year with directors and screenwriters that are lovers of the genre, he added, saying that “If there’s something known very well in this country, it’s being afraid, it’s planted in our brains ever since, on a school excursion, we gazed for the first time on the dark paintings of Goya.”</p>
<p>Breaking out with his second feature, 1995’s black horror comedy “The Day of the Beast,” a milestone in modern-day Spanish cinema yoking U.S. genre and a bathetic Spanish reality, De la Iglesia remains one of Spain’s most-courted directors, helming Spanish remake “Perfectos Desconocidos” to $25.8 million in 2018 and now directing drama series “Treinta Monedas” for HBO Europe.</p>
<p>The Fear Collection is now one way to make movies count in a new movie landscape where theatrical release is essential for marketing and other media impact and horror when it clicks can prove extremely profitable to producers.</p>
<p>A series of movies is, moreover, potentially a much more powerful IP in a digital platform space, where horror is an audience mainstay.</p>
<p>“Álex is a true maestro of horror. The Fear Collection is the perfect platform for Álex and Sony Pictures International Productions to explore the boundaries of genre filmmaking in Spanish cinema,” said Laine Kline, head of Sony Pictures International Productions.</p>
<p>Iván Losada, managing director of Sony Pictures Spain, stated that “Álex is one of the most brilliant and prolific directors in this country, and we celebrate with great enthusiasm the fact that we are able to include his talent in the development of this collection of horror films”.</p>
<p>“Álex de la Iglesia is one of Spain’s great cinematic benchmarks. To be able to collaborate with him, hand-in-hand with Sony Pictures Entertainment and Pokeepsie Films, is a privilege for us, for it enables us to offer our customers a collection of films with a seal of indisputable quality,” added Ricardo Carbonero, head of content at Amazon Prime Video in Spain. “Cinema is one of the great pillars of our service, and this project will help us to carry on developing a catalogue of Spanish content that is exclusive, differentiating and innovative.”</p>
<p>Founded by De la Iglesia and actress-producer Carolina Bang, Pokeepsie Films has set out to date to bring on a new generation of Spanish horror talents producing movies such as “Musarañas” (Esteban Roel and Juan Fernando Andrés), “Los héroes del mal,” “En las Estrellas” (Zoe Berriatúa) and “Pieles” (Eduardo Casanova). De la Iglesia and Bang are now preparing the shoot of “La Casa de Tiza” (Ignacio Tatay) and “La Piedad” (Casanova).</p>
<p>The Fear Collection now raises the bar, in ambition, reach and big company backing.

<h3 id="noah-baumbach-marriage-story-illustrates-that-to-take-sides-is-folly">&ldquo;Noah Baumbach: ‘Marriage Story illustrates that to take sides is folly’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/858d4332ae9f85b293e1b86984e10c1fb7e40685/105_219_3356_2014/master/3356.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=235ee598b541a99585292e4b05669d97" alt="img">
Over the years, Noah Baumbach, the American writer/director, has made films about all sorts of things. Kicking and Screaming (1995) is about a group of college pals who refuse to move on with their lives. While We’re Young (2014) is about a friendship between a middle-aged documentary-maker and his wife, and a couple in their 20s. The Meyerowitz Stories (2017) is about siblings attempting to live in the shadow of their egomaniacal artist father. But for some of us, he really has only one true subject: D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Consider the best movies of his career so far, made almost 15 years apart: The Squid and the Whale (2005), the bittersweet picture that first brought him to most people’s attention, is about divorce, and so, too, is Marriage Story, his hotly Oscar-tipped new film. To pinch from Philip Larkin, separation is to Baumbach what daffodils were to Wordsworth.</p>
<p>Not that he sees it quite like this. When we meet in a clattering New York restaurant on a cold, bright autumn morning, Baumbach is annoyingly keen to resist my passionately held theory that people whose parents split up when they were children (him, me) grow up to be somewhat preoccupied by divorce, a fascination that will probably end (at least in my case) only with death. “Yes, both those films are about divorce,” he says, in his careful, rather ponderous way. “The Squid and the Whale from the kids’ perspective, and Marriage Story from that of the adults. But what they also provide narratively is the opportunity to talk about other things.” I stare at him. What other things? What can he possibly mean?</p>
<p>“Well, Squid is about family,” he says, with the kind of patience a therapist might reserve for a particularly anxious patient. “It’s really about the necessary movement away from our parents, whether divorced or not, and their conscious or unconscious tugging back [of us]. And although Marriage Story is about the disintegration of a marriage, it enables you to look at marriage itself, too.” Both films, he insists, are surprisingly hopeful, in spite of what I regard as all the evidence to the contrary. “No, no,” he tells me, reassuringly. “They’re really about starting again.”</p>
<p>Baumbach, who is a boyish 50, has the kind of hairstyle that manages somehow to be both long and short, and the kind of clothes that pull off the rare feat of appearing both pin-neat and artfully dishevelled. He looks, in other words, like a cross between a university lecturer and an assistant in Comme des Garçons. He also looks exhausted. The shadows under his eyes match the navy of his boiled wool blazer; he clings to his coffee cup as if to a life buoy. But this is hardly surprising. His schedule appears to be quite mad. This morning, I was woken at 5am by a message informing me that our encounter might be off because he was going to have to fly at short notice to Los Angeles to appear in a Q&amp;A at a film festival – and, in fact, when he leaves here that’s exactly what he will be doing. Even as we speak, a frazzled PR is standing at the door, stopwatch in hand.</p>

<p>“This has been going on since Venice in late August,” he says. Not that he’s complaining. He could hardly be more gracious: “When you finish something, you don’t come out of the gate with a fully formed idea of what you’ve done. In a way, I feel talking about the movie, and hearing what other people think about it, helps me to understand it better myself.” The beauty of a film like Marriage Story, he thinks, is that people bring their own stuff to it, and thus the conversations he has about it tend to be as much about life as about the film itself. But in any case, irrespective of the demands of producer/distributor Netflix, which clearly hopes Marriage Story is going to win it an Oscar, I think he feels a certain duty of care.</p>
<p>When he was growing up, lots of people used to make films like his: interior dramas (though his movies undoubtedly have their blackly funny moments, they can hardly be accurately described as comedies) starring east coast liberal intellectual types with extensive bookshelves, subscriptions to the New Yorker and complicated emotional lives. Nowadays, though, they’re increasingly a rarity. He is determined to do his best to “articulate something that is essentially inarticulate by design” to the press and to festival audiences alike.</p>
<p>In Marriage Story, Scarlett Johansson plays Nicole, an actor, and Adam Driver her estranged husband, Charlie, a perfectionist director of edgy off-Broadway theatre. We know that Nicole and Charlie were once madly in love – as the film opens, we hear Charlie describing all the things he adored about her when they first met – but somewhere along the way, their relationship has broken down. Having previously turned her back on Hollywood in favour of working in New York with Charlie’s theatre company, Nicole has now returned to LA with their eight-year-old son, Henry, to star in a TV series.</p>
<p>The film depicts not only the couple’s increasingly toxic custody battle – it comes with brilliant turns from Laura Dern, Alan Alda and Ray Liotta, all of whom play divorce lawyers of varying degrees of rapaciousness, and from Mary Hollis Inboden as a terrifyingly silent family court representative – but also its subtle effects on their sense of identity. It is in some ways a movie about power. As Nicole grows ever stronger, her world expanding, her voice becoming louder and more confident, Charlie is ever quieter and more fragile. On Halloween, when he dresses up as the invisible man, the bandages he wraps around his face speak volumes. It’s as if he is determined to erase himself before someone else does.</p>

<p>Can Baumbach remember the tug on the line that was the beginning of this film? “It really isn’t possible to do that,” he says. “It’s so… these things are garnered all the time. I often have a lot of… I wouldn’t even call them ideas. Sometimes, they’re ideas, but it can also be an atmosphere, a line, a relationship, a location. These things are in a notebook, and in my head, and then they keep finding their way back to whatever I’m working on. Something will return, and I won’t know where to put it. It will keep bouncing around until, at a certain point, it’s like the electrical current in a dead wire suddenly goes on – and then that wire is the one, and I start looking at it in a way that I wasn’t before. When I started writing this movie – well, the actual writing was probably only six months or something, but all the stuff that went into it you can’t quantify.”</p>
<p>So in the beginning, he’s basically a kind of ambulant whiteboard? He smiles. “Yes. In this case, I was working on The Meyerowitz Stories and things got auditioned in that script, and then they got kicked out, and then they found their way into this one.”</p>
<p>Aware that a film about a custody battle might be gruelling, he knew it was vital that the audience have a sense of Nicole and Charlie’s former happiness: hence the early scene – an extended flashback – during which Charlie lists his wife’s virtues. “I wanted that to feel very immediate and intimate and active, knowing that very soon it was all going to be destroyed,” he says. “The audience need that memory for perspective. I wanted people to feel as though they had been inside this family, however embarrassing that might be – because after this, the journey is into all these sterile office environments and courtrooms. We’re going to be wrenched out of home life. In fact, the notion of home life is going to be completely redefined.”</p>
<p>Baumbach went through a separation himself some years ago; he and Jennifer Jason Leigh, with whom he has a son, Rohmer (named after the French film director Eric Rohmer), divorced in 2013; he now lives with Greta Gerwig, the actor and director, with whom he has a new baby (they met in 2010, when she starred in his film Greenberg, though their relationship did not begin until later). To what degree, then, is Charlie a version of himself? “He’s not me any more than Nicole is,” he says. And whose side is the film on? Some people think that Nicole fades from view; that in the end, it comes down, for whatever reason, on Charlie’s side. “I’m aware of that view. But if anything, this movie only illustrates that to take sides at all is folly. When it begins, we’re with her: we’re in LA, where she grew up, with her mum and her sister. She’s telling her story. But then he turns up, and we drift into his. I feel like the job of the last part of the movie is to say: it’s all true, and none of it’s true. These are just people trying their best. Her story is one of momentum, rebuilding and finding her voice, and his is a story of breaking down; it’s a kind of role reversal, because he’s a director and she’s an actor – not that I want to stereotype those roles. But I also think that her monologue and his song at opposite ends of the movie are mirror images of something: in a way, both of them find their voice.”</p>

<p>The song in question is Being Alive, from Stephen Sondheim’s Company. Charlie sings it in a bar, with exquisite sincerity and immense feeling, watched by members of his theatre company, and it’s extraordinary: an epiphany that seems to come out of nowhere, and somehow puts a bow around the whole film. Baumbach nods: “You didn’t know that you needed it, right?” This is true, but it also raises the question: how did he know that I needed it? For a few moments, he tries to explain – something about avatars and voices and perspective – but in the end, perhaps it simply comes down to this. Driver loves that song, and its lyrics speak to one of the film’s themes, which has to do with the fact that just as familiarity can breed contempt, perhaps one can only feel truly alive when one is absolutely loved and seen (“Somebody pull me up short/And put me through hell/And give me support”). Anyway, it’s perfect. That was the moment when, sitting there in the dark, something inside me gave way, and my eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>Why does Baumbach think people get married at all – especially people like us, whose parents failed at it several times? “Oh, boy.” Looking agonised, he puts his forehead in his hand. “Um, um … Well, why wouldn’t people get married? It’s a very… hopeful, very… brave thing, getting married. It’s great that people want to do that. It’s a great act of hope. It’s… romantic. Perhaps it has to do with repair as well: that’s something we’re all doing, in our different ways. Whatever our family damage is, repair takes a lot of forms.” Can those who have been through a painful divorce – though not all divorces are, or need to be, painful – ever recover from the experience? “It’s like any childhood event or trauma … it’s up to us. As the Wallace Shawn character says [Shawn plays an actor in Charlie’s company who functions as an occasional Greek chorus]: it’s going to be horrible, but it’s also going to be over.” A pause. “Though as we know, it keeps going, too.”</p>
<p>Baumbach grew up in Brooklyn, the older son of the novelist Jonathan Baumbach (who was married four times) and Georgia Brown, a film critic at the Village Voice (she was Jonathan’s third wife). He was 14 when his parents separated. He remembers it vividly. He went out to watch Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas in Romancing the Stone, having been warned that when he got home there was going to be a family meeting – a scene he reprises beautifully in the semi- autobiographical The Squid and the Whale, in which Laura Linney and Jeff Daniels play a version of his parents – and he knew perfectly well what that meant: “I watched the movie with some sense of dread, though I guess it took me out of my head for a while.” He began to cry even before his parents announced their complicated custody arrangements (in the interests of fairness, the two boys would visit their father every Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday, and every other Thursday). Has he seen Romancing the Stone since, or are the glorious adventures of Turner and Douglas in the Colombian jungle forever ruined for him? He laughs. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen it for years. But I liked it at the time. Doesn’t Michael Douglas end up in a boat on Central Park South or something?”</p>
<p>Did he always know that he wanted to make films? “I had, at least, the dream. I didn’t know anyone in film, so I didn’t know it was possible. I wanted to do it, and I would say that I wanted to do it, but there was a second voice in my head that said: well, how would that even happen? But I did a lot of plays, and wrote stories, and when VHS happened, I got a camcorder and lugged that around. VHS was amazing. You could watch movies at home, and you didn’t have to wait till Easter to see The Wizard of Oz or whatever.” Did it help that his parents led creative lives? “It did, and they loved movies, too.” He has said that his father took him to see Truffaut’s The Wild Child when he was just five, or thereabouts. “I was lucky to have them as an example, though it also created its own burdens and challenges. I guess film, for me, was both a kind of inheritance, and a way of doing something different [from them].”</p>

<p>Baumbach studied English at Vassar College, where he wrote, directed and acted in plays, but made no movies, largely on account of the fact that its film department had no decent equipment. How, then, did it happen that he came to release his first film, Kicking and Screaming, when he was only 26? He shakes his head. “There isn’t a good story. Except to say that I’d worked on a script, and I had two good friends who were my housemates in senior year, Jason Blum and Jeremy Kramer, who are both still in films, and the three of us would give it to anyone we could. Again, we had no idea how it worked, and it fell apart many times, even in pre-production. It was so random. The video company involved threatened to pull out at one point, and I had to write the part Eric Stoltz plays at the last minute to get it financed. His character was just slapped on.” He smiles. “I was in LA, and I felt so old, and yet I was so young. I just thought it was all too good to be true.”</p>
<p>And in a way, it was. A second film, Mr Jealousy, followed, after which there was a quite long period of silence. “Yeah. What happened? It was hard for me. I went through this time after Mr Jealousy: I’d had this early opportunity, and then I was having trouble getting anything made. I was writing pilots, things like that. I was staying busy and making a living, but not the living I wanted. I began to wonder: am I a film-maker? Will I ever make another one? I didn’t think about quitting, but it was really difficult. What I ended up doing was working on myself. I went into therapy. I grew up a bit. I started to understand myself better, and because of that I started to write and think more creatively. Then I wrote The Squid and the Whale. I had a breakthrough. It was a case of: I’m not the film-maker I thought I was.”</p>

<p>The other thing that helped was his friendship with the film-maker Wes Anderson, with whom he wrote The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004) and Fantastic Mr Fox (2009). “We were both friends with [the director] Peter Bogdanovich, and we would hear about each other. We finally met at a John Waters premiere in 1998; afterwards, we ended up at a bar in Soho called Toad Hall. We started talking, and we realised we shared a lot of likes: when we exchanged numbers, we realised we both had the same kind of notebook in our pockets. He was making The Royal Tenenbaums, and just watching how he did it was so inspiring to me. His work ethic, his precision.” Anderson went on to co-produce The Squid and the Whale.</p>
<p>“A lot of film-makers are nice,” he says. “But it can be tough. Directing is lonely. Mike Nichols said a director always needs a buddy, and that’s wise: to have a producing partner, or a writer. Though if you write and direct, obviously you don’t have a writer.” These days, however, he has Gerwig, with whom he wrote two films, Frances Ha and Mistress America. “The press part is harder, because we’re on different schedules. But in terms of the rest of it, for us, it’s nice.” Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s Little Women, starring Meryl Streep and Saoirse Ronan, opens at Christmas. He beams. “Oh, it’s great. When you see it, you’ll realise immediately. You’ll think: of course, this is why she did it.”</p>
<p>For his own part, he has no idea what he’ll do next. “I was with Adam [Driver] last night, having the conversations we tend to have: how about this? How about that?” All he knows is that he and Driver, who have become close in spite of the 14-year age gap between them, will certainly work together again in the future. “He’s amazing. He’s always alive as an actor to the particular moment.” Baumbach only wants, he says, to go with what he’s doing right now. “The whole process is a conversation with my younger self, who so loved movies.” He won’t – he can’t – take it for granted. “You’re at Venice, or somewhere, and something happens, and it’s so exciting, and all you want to do is check in with your 17-year-old self who, had he known what was coming, would have thought it so cool.”</p>
<p>Noah’s arc: the best of Baumbach, by Guy Lodge</p>
<p>Kicking and Screaming (1995)</p>
<p>Aged just 26, Baumbach made his debut with this modestly scaled but spiky ensemble piece following a group of college graduates all struggling to start the next phase in their lives. Made with a script endorsed by Steve Martin, it earned Baumbach a pile of “names to watch” notices, though his true breakthrough would take another decade.</p>
<p>The Squid and the Whale (2005)</p>
<p>Now thematically bookended by Marriage Story, this mordantly funny divorce drama starred a peak-form Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney as warring literary spouses and was inspired by Baumbach’s parents’ split. It was the director’s fourth film, but it announced his name to a wider audience, scoring him his only Oscar nomination to date.</p>
<p>Margot at the Wedding (2007)</p>
<p>Reviews were chilly for Baumbach’s follow-up to the success of The Squid and the Whale, but this piquant study of a successful, narcissistic writer descending on her estranged sister’s Long Island wedding festivities gets too little credit. Nicole Kidman and Jennifer Jason Leigh give exquisite performances and there’s hard humanity under the sour surface.</p>
<p>Frances Ha (2012)</p>
<p>Baumbach’s collaboration with Greta Gerwig began with the droll LA story Greenberg, but it blossomed in this vibrant, New Wave-styled character study of a young would-be dancer in personal, professional and even residential limbo. Co-written with Gerwig, and shot in gorgeous, grainy black and white, it’s less jaded and more joyful than his previous work.</p>
<p>Marriage Story (2019)</p>
<p>Fourteen years after making drama from his parents’ divorce, Baumbach gives the same treatment to his own split from Jennifer Jason Leigh, following Adam Driver’s New York theatre director and Scarlett Johansson’s LA-native actor through the travails of a bicoastal separation. Brutally close to the bone and sometimes raucously comic, it’s earned the best reviews of his career.

Mantel’s Trophy</p>
<p>Hilary Mantel has the #2 book in the country with The Mirror &amp; the Light, the “magisterial conclusion to the Wolf Hall trilogy,” our starred review said. Just ahead of the book’s publication, PW asked Mantel why she thought her nearly 1,800–page trilogy chronicling 16th-century English politics was so popular in the U.S., where the first two books have sold 798K print copies. Her reply: “Perhaps it shows that it’s about more than 16th century politics—that it addresses certain lasting truth about power and sex and love, public image and private dreams.”</p>
<p>Wild at Heart</p>
<p>Glennon Doyle has the #1 book in the country with Untamed, her third memoir. “Motivational speaker Doyle writes of divorcing her husband, finding love with Olympic soccer player Abby Wambach, and coming out to family and fans in this inspirational memoir,” our review said, predicting the book “will delight readers.” Doyle first gained popularity as a confessional Christian mom blogger, and her candor continues in the new book: “I will not stay, not ever again—in a room or conversation or relationship or institution that requires me to abandon myself,” she writes.</p>
<p>Into the Dark</p>
<p>My Dark Vanessa, Kate Elizabeth Russell’s debut novel, “offers readers an introspective narrative that fully captures the complexity and necessity of the #MeToo movement,” our starred review said. It was slated to be an Oprah Book Club pick and then dropped after a Twitter controversy; nonetheless, it lands at #8 in hardcover fiction. The plot, in which a 15-year-old girl has a relationship with her 42-year-old teacher, is based on the author’s experience as a teenager. “I do not believe that we should compel victims to share the details of their personal trauma with the public,” she wrote on her blog. “The decision whether or not to come forward should always be a personal choice.”</p>
<p>NEW &amp; NOTABLE</p>
<p>GET OUT OF YOUR OWN WAY</p>
<p>Dave Hollis</p>
<p>#2 Hardcover Nonfiction, #3 overall</p>
<p>Prescriptive book titles run in the family for the author, a life coach: his wife is Rachel Hollis, author of the blockbuster Girl, Wash Your Face. Together, they run the Hollis Company, a lifestyle brand focused on personal growth.</p>
<p>DEACON KiNG KONG</p>
<p>James McBride</p>
<p>#13 Hardcover Fiction</p>
<p>“McBride (The Good Lord Bird) delivers a sharply compassionate shaggy dog tale of a heavy-drinking Baptist deacon who shoots a drug dealer and becomes a ‘walking dead man,’ ” our starred review said of this “generous, achingly funny novel.”
