​Billie Eilish is giving critics what they want ... on her terms.

On Monday, during the first night of her Where Do We Go? world tour, the everything i wanted singer who is known for wearing baggy clothes, gave Miami's American Airlines Arena a different sort of show, TMZ reported Tuesday.

Between songs, the 18-year-old Grammy winner played a quick video, showing herself in a form-fitting black tank top, which she then removes, standing in just a bra.

YOUTUBE Billie Eilish has slammed body shamers by stripping down at her concert while delivering a body positive poem.

"You have opinions, about my opinions, about my music, about my clothes, about my body," she says in a voiceover, according to the outlet.

"Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it, and judge me for it. Why? We make assumptions about people based on their size.

"We decide who they are. We decide what they're worth. If I wear more. If I wear less."

She concluded by asking, "Who decides what that makes me? What that means? Is my value based only on your perception? Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?"

Eilish previously attributed her unique style to wanting to avoid judgement based on her physique, and told Elle last year that she didn't approve of s...-shaming "all these girls for not dressing like Billie Eilish."

She also said that upon turning 18, she wanted the ability to, if the mood struck, "look desirable" and "be a woman ... show my body."

Back in January, she posted a series of photos of herself in more formfitting clothes and a bikini while on vacation in Hawaii, which garnered close to 13 million likes.
