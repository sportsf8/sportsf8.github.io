<h1 id="19-of-the-most-viral-dances-on-tiktok-from-the-renegade-to-toes">19 of the most viral dances on TikTok, from the &lsquo;renegade&rsquo; to &lsquo;TOES&rsquo;</h1>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e4af18a96eee66bf2147972?width=1300&amp;format=jpeg&amp;auto=webp" alt="Jalaiah Harmon & Charli D&rsquo;Amelio"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Renegade&rdquo; dance creator Jalaiah Harmon met up with TikTok stars Charli D&rsquo;Amelio and Addison Easterling to perform her iconic choreography.</p>
<p>Charli D&rsquo;Amelio / TikTok</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok is leading the current dance trends popular among millennials and Gen Z </li>
<li>Along with &ldquo;Renegade,&rdquo; other notable dances have grown in popularity on the app</li>
<li>Below is a comprehensive guide to some of the most popular dances on TikTok</li>
<li><a href="https://www.insider.com/?hprecirc-bullet">Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Walk into almost any middle school or high school, and nine out of 10 kids could not only tell you what the &ldquo;Renegade&rdquo; dance is but most likely perform it. The viral dance made popular on TikTok is a testament to the app&rsquo;s power and influence over today&rsquo;s trends and pop culture. TikTok users across the country are getting signed to management companies and TikTok choreographers are being asked by notable artists to promote their songs on their account. The Chinese-created app has taken the world by storm as it&rsquo;s grown from a video sharing app for today&rsquo;s youth, to a multi-generational content sharing platform for creatives in dance, film and music. </p>
<p>One of the biggest aspects of the app is the ability to create dances to remix music or popular songs and then &ldquo;hype&rdquo; yourself in the hope of going viral and having other TikTok users attempt your choreography on their own accounts. </p>
<p>For those who aren&rsquo;t on the app, there are quite a few dances that have spilled into mainstream pop culture, with millions of people participating in viral challenges daily. The hardest part of being a viral choreographer on TikTok is making sure you&rsquo;re given credit for your dance. Tagging choreographers in videos by posting &ldquo;dc:&rdquo; [dance credit] and then their name is becoming more commonplace as users fear the backlash faced from stealing another&rsquo;s dance. </p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a comprehensive guide to some of the biggest and trendiest dances on TikTok in the past year.</p>
<h2 id="renegade">&ldquo;Renegade&rdquo;</h2>
<p>By far the most popular dance on TikTok with more than 29.7 million users attempting the fast-paced choreography is the &ldquo;renegade.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s perhaps one of the first viral dances to break out of the confines of the app itself and prompt so many others to strive to &ldquo;go viral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8kZhr9Dbed/?utm_source=ig_embed">original dance</a> was created by Atlanta-based 14-year-old Jalaiah Harmon in September 2019, and quickly blew up with students in middle school and high school. Set to the song &ldquo;Lottery&rdquo; by K Camp, Harmon&rsquo;s dance has now been performed in talent shows and at school pep rallies for TikTok competitions.</p>
<h2 id="number-one-baby">&ldquo;Number One Baby&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Although not the official title of this dance, ask any TikTok user to do the &ldquo;number one baby&rdquo; dance and most likely they will start performing choreography that requires primarily hand and arm movements ending in holding an invisible baby.</p>
<p>The dance is at a close second to &ldquo;renegade&rdquo; and set to rappers Young Thug and Future&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Relationship.&rdquo; The song has spurred a viral dance movement where 27 million people are dancing to the lines, &ldquo;had to take the time to cut &lsquo;em off, I need help/I know how to make the girls go crazy/When you treat her like your number one baby.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="7-rings">&ldquo;7 Rings&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Twenty-six-year-old Devin Santiago in Linden, New Jersey made up a dance to a remixed version of Ariana Grande&rsquo;s &ldquo;7 Rings&rdquo; in his sister&rsquo;s bedroom. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Initially I posted it and didn&rsquo;t get much hype at first,&rdquo; Santiago said. &ldquo;I had to promote myself almost.&rdquo; </p>
<p>However, the dance didn&rsquo;t start trending until user @itsjaymoneyy <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsjaymoneyy/video/6775961669169450246?lang=en">posted a video</a> of herself dancing to Santiago&rsquo;s choreography with her mom. Shortly after, &ldquo;everyone was doing my dance,&rdquo; Santiago said. JJ&rsquo;s video has more than 800,000 likes and the dance is trending among 87,300 people. Santiago said the DJ&rsquo;s responsible for the mix, DJ Flex &amp; BasedPrince reached out to him to thank him for promoting the song.</p>
<h2 id="get-up">&ldquo;Get Up&rdquo;</h2>
<p>More than a decade after it was first published, Ciara&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Get Up&rdquo; featuring Chamillionaire is making a comeback thanks to the 4.5 million TikTok users enjoying the &ldquo;Get Up&rdquo; challenge. Trending primarily in December, this dance blew up after a high school teacher (user @beewright) was pulled into her student&rsquo;s video and surprised the student by flawlessly executing the challenge. Professional dance stars like Maddie and Mackenzie Ziegler, formerly of &ldquo;Dance Moms&rdquo; fame, have completed the challenge, as well as some of the most popular TikTok stars. </p>
<h2 id="the-box">&ldquo;The Box&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In the past couple of months, Roddy Ricch&rsquo;s song &ldquo;The Box&rdquo; has gained even more popularity thanks to the help of 15-year-old Charli D&rsquo;Amelio, who is by far TikTok&rsquo;s most recognizable star. D&rsquo;Amelio created a dance to the beginning portion of the song around January and continued posting additional videos of herself performing the same choreography. One of her posts alone has 4.8 million likes. It didn&rsquo;t take long for the trend to catch on and the dance has currently been attempted by nearly two million users.</p>
<h2 id="cannibal">&ldquo;Cannibal&rdquo;</h2>
<p>For those wondering why Kesha&rsquo;s 2010 song &ldquo;Cannibal&rdquo; is suddenly making a comeback, it&rsquo;s thanks to 14-year-old Briana Hantsch from Illinois. She created a TikTok in February of herself dancing to the song in her bedroom which has more than 52,000 likes and has already been attempted by more than 9 million users including some of the most viral TikTok stars like D&rsquo;Amelio and Addison Easterling. Kesha herself even tried out the teen&rsquo;s choreography, <a href="https://twitter.com/KeshaRose/status/1232682119954157568">posting her attempt on Twitter.</a></p>
<h2 id="git-up-challenge">&ldquo;Git Up Challenge&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Two half brothers from Utah, 19-year-old Ajani Huff and 21-year-old Davonte House, have created more than one viral TikTok dance. Their first dance, posted in May 2019, was to Blanco Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Git Up&rdquo; and has been used in three million videos on the app. Huff and House&rsquo;s initial video and original choreography was filmed in a gazebo. </p>
<p>&ldquo;At first [we were] just doing it for fun, but then after we did &ldquo;get up&rdquo; we realized the power choreographers have,&rdquo; House said. </p>
<p>Their spry footwork — a combination of country mixed with hip-hop — started trending but they weren&rsquo;t getting credit. After commenting on various videos of users completing what became known as the &ldquo;Git Up challenge,&rdquo; many in the TikTok community now know the brothers created the dance.</p>
<h2 id="toes">&ldquo;TOES&rdquo;</h2>
<p>On Dec. 3, 2019, Huff posted a video of himself dancing to the song &ldquo;Toes&rdquo; by DaBaby (featuring Lil Baby and Moneybagg Yo). On Dec. 10, he &ldquo;claimed&rdquo; the dance to the accompanying song as his own so that other users would know where the choreography came from. Huff said he and his brother feel an immense amount of pride in knowing their dances make people happy, but do feel frustrated occasionally that they are not credited as the choreographers. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be nice to get credit, but it&rsquo;s nice to know that we started this trend,&rdquo; Huff said. </p>
<p>Their dance is now trending with 1.7 million people and dominated TikTok for weeks.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;It got 500,000 views in one month,&rdquo; Huff said.</p>
<h2 id="dont-start-now">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Start Now&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Dua Lipa&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Start Now&rdquo; dominated the first half of February on TikTok. Teenager Hannah Kaye Balanay posted a video of herself outside dancing to the song and captioned it, &ldquo;pls do my dance.&rdquo; More than 3.8 million people listened to her request, completing a dance routine that sways to the lyrics, &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you the guy who/tried to,&rdquo; with many popular TikTok stars like D&rsquo;Amelio and Easterling posting videos of themselves doing the dance multiple times. </p>
<h2 id="say-so">&ldquo;Say So&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Say So&rdquo; by Doja Cat is currently the artist&rsquo;s most popular song and has already been trending in the charts. Once it blew up on TikTok with more than 16.8 million people trying out the dance, the song&rsquo;s popularity only grew. Teenager Haley Sharpe from Alabama created choreography to accompany the song and said in her caption to Doja Cat that she&rsquo;d love to be in a future music video. The video went so viral that Doja Cat obliged and invited Sharpe to perform it in the music video that dropped Feb. 27. Sharpe&rsquo;s own TikTok received 923,000 likes and thanks to her recent cameo, she has now amassed 53,000 Instagram followers and has 1.2 million TikTok followers.</p>
<h2 id="walked-in">&ldquo;Walked In&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Set to the song, &ldquo;Walked In&rdquo; by Ultradiox, this dance was originally created by Hunter Lasater and later slightly altered by one of TikTok&rsquo;s most popular stars Addison Easterling (known to fans as Addison Rae). The first move of both dances is identical, and from there other similarities can be seen. &ldquo;Walked In&rdquo; is currently trending on TikTok amongst 652,100 users since Easterling&rsquo;s version was first posted Feb. 18  and more videos are uploaded daily.</p>
<h2 id="vibe--cookie-kawaii">&ldquo;Vibe- Cookie Kawaii&rdquo;</h2>
<p>One of the more recently trending dances set to Cookie Kawaii&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vibe,&rdquo; was created by 22-year-old Mikeila Jones because she &ldquo;just wanted to be cute&rdquo; and thought for sure it would be a &ldquo;flop.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I got into the vibe of the song because it&rsquo;s super catchy and felt like it&rsquo;s easy to dance to,&rdquo; Jones said. </p>
<p>In one hour after posting to her account [@mikeilajduh] on Feb 6, 100,000 people were trying it. The second hour it was up to 300,000 and before long she had 6 million views. Like the #OutWestChallenge, this dance is an easier style that begs users of all skill levels to try. Most users know the dance by a line from the song, &ldquo;If I back it up, is it fat enough?&rdquo; </p>
<h2 id="out-west-challenge">&ldquo;Out West challenge&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Richmond, Virginia native Nicole Bloombgarden wasted no time creating one of the simplest dances on TikTok, &ldquo;literally the day it [the song] came out.&rdquo; The song &ldquo;Out West&rdquo; by Travis Scott featuring Young Thug dropped December 2019 and 19-year-old Bloomgarden&rsquo;s dance only requires raising your arms and moving your hips. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A strategy I learned is [that] dances have to be more catchy than hard,&rdquo; Bloomgarden said. &ldquo;The easier it is to do, the more people are gonna&rsquo; do it.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Once her video was uploaded she began encouraging people to do it and commenting on those that were trying it, asking them to tag her. Usher, YouTube stars Emma Chamberlain and David Dobrik, and 11.2 million others have tried Bloomgarden&rsquo;s dance.</p>
<h2 id="get-busy-shake-that-thing">&ldquo;Get Busy&rdquo; (Shake That Thing)</h2>
<p>On Jan. 31, D&rsquo;Amelio posted a new dance video shot in her favorite location: the bathroom. She uploaded TikToks of herself completing the fast-paced choreography more than once, and one version alone has 11.2 million likes. Although not an official challenge, users on the app seem to enjoy attempting the &ldquo;helicopter hands&rdquo; featured at one point in the choreography that has become a trendy move in a variety of other modern dances. Celebrities like Jessica Alba have attempted &ldquo;Get Busy&rdquo; along with 7.6 million other people. </p>
<h2 id="get-loose-challenge">&ldquo;Get Loose challenge&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It only took three days from the time 18-year-old Dallas, Texas teenager Taydon Smith posted the &ldquo;#GetLooseChallenge&rdquo; until it went viral. The video now has 99,000 likes. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment I realized it went viral was when Chance the Rapper did it and Lebron&rsquo;s son [Bronny James],&rdquo; Smith said. </p>
<p>Smith said he and his friends enjoy dancing all of the time for fun and when they saw YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgdSnmumx2c">TisaKorean&rsquo;s video</a> they thought &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t we do it?&rdquo; </p>
<p>The dance has now been used in more than 250,000 videos, with most people attempting it the same way as the original — three people stand in pyramid formation as one person begins twirling their arm, then the second and third people follow in suit. &ldquo;The Bachelor&rdquo; contestant Madison Prewett even tried out the dance on her own account.</p>
<h2 id="freddie-dredd---opaul">&ldquo;Freddie Dredd - Opaul&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Because of D&rsquo;Amelio&rsquo;s high profile, millions of people attempt to mimic her movements or looks in their own TikToks whenever she posts a new video — even if she records it in her bathroom mirror. She created a dance to the song, &ldquo;Opaul&rdquo; by Freddie Dredd that was all about body rolls and swinging hips. The lyrics to the song are in Portuguese and more than one native Portuguese speaker on TikTok was quick to point out that the choreography did not match the actual words of the song, because many people think the artist is saying &ldquo;no, I know&rdquo; and refer to the dance as such. The actual lyrics on that line are, &ldquo;Não vai não.&rdquo; However, lyrics aside, it didn&rsquo;t keep this dance from trending with 2.5 million users. </p>
<h2 id="gimme-some">&ldquo;Gimme Some&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Unlike other dance trends on TikTok, the &ldquo;Gimme Some&rdquo; challenge is unique in that it went through a string of variations and transformations during the height of its popularity in December 2019. While the actual dance was said to have been created by user @global.jones, most complete the challenge with some version of a slow-motion move in the song&rsquo;s introductory lyric, &ldquo;Gimme some.&rdquo; The song is a remix of Beyoncé&rsquo;s 2013 &ldquo;Partition,&rdquo; and finds the app&rsquo;s users completing a series of claps or &ldquo;throwing it back&rdquo; slowly. Now, more than 2.7 million people have tried this challenge.</p>
<h2 id="panoramic-b-tch">&ldquo;Panoramic B-tch&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This dance almost speaks for itself. &ldquo;Panoramic B-tch&rdquo; is a trend set to the song, &ldquo;Different Varieties&rdquo; by KingMostWanted. The line, &ldquo;Panoramic b-tch ooo&rdquo; starts off with users holding their hands up like they&rsquo;re taking a picture. It&rsquo;s another more recent trend, but already has more than one million people uploading videos to the song. </p>
<h2 id="im-moving-too-fast">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m moving too fast&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In March, another challenge went viral in less than a week. The &ldquo;#2liveSoundsmix&rdquo; challenge with both audio and choreography created by Deaundre Lamar [@2live.d], has grown to trend amongst 5.7 million users since Lamar first posted a video of himself dancing to the mix on Feb. 29. The sound features a line from another one of his popular mixes, &ldquo;why is everything chrome&rdquo; and incorporates a variety of trending dance moves like the &ldquo;woah&rdquo; and &ldquo;throw it back.&rdquo; </p>
