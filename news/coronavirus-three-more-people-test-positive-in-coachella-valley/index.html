CLOSE County Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser declares coronavirus a public emergency as first patient admitted to Eisenhower hospital in Rancho Mirage. Palm Springs Desert Sun

A total of six Riverside County residents have tested positive for COVID-19, otherwise known as coronavirus, as of Monday afternoon. Two people are being treated outside of the county, two are being treated at hospitals in the Coachella Valley, and two are quarantined at home in the Coachella Valley.

Officials announced three positive cases in the Coachella Valley on Monday afternoon. Health investigators believe the three infections were the result of contact with a known case or travel into areas where the coronavirus has been detected, according to Riverside County health officials. Two of the people have been isolated at home and the third is being cared for at a local hospital.

in the Coachella Valley on Monday afternoon. Health investigators believe the three infections were the result of contact with a known case or travel into areas where the coronavirus has been detected, according to Riverside County health officials. Two of the people have been isolated at home and the third is being cared for at a local hospital. Health officials also announced Monday morning that a second Riverside County resident tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship . Jeff Van Wageman, Riverside County assistant county executive officer for public safety, said the patient was a passenger on a Diamond Princess cruise ship and is being treated in Northern California.

. Jeff Van Wageman, Riverside County assistant county executive officer for public safety, said the patient was a passenger on a Diamond Princess cruise ship and is being treated in Northern California. Officials announced the county's first case of locally acquired coronavirus on Saturday. That patient is undergoing care at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage. Health officials declined to disclose details about the patient, including how and when the virus was contracted. Riverside County Public Health Officer Cameron Kaiser said Sunday that officials are still investigating the source of contraction, which they hope to complete in a couple days but it may be a case of "community spread." The patient has no connection to schools in Riverside County, Kaiser said.

on Saturday. That patient is undergoing care at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage. Health officials declined to disclose details about the patient, including how and when the virus was contracted. Riverside County Public Health Officer Cameron Kaiser said Sunday that officials are still investigating the source of contraction, which they hope to complete in a couple days but it may be a case of "community spread." The patient has no connection to schools in Riverside County, Kaiser said. The first Riverside County resident to be diagnosed with the coronavirus was also a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and is being treated at a Northern California facility, which officials announced on Feb. 25.

Additionally, there are more than 100 people in Riverside County who are self-quarantined at home due to possible exposure. These individuals have not necessarily shown symptoms, but may have been exposed at various times. Health officials order self-quarantines as a precaution.

Two weeks ago, those in self-quarantine were just travelers who returned from impacted countries. Now, that number includes others including health care workers who may have been exposed, said Shane Reichardt, Riverside County emergency management spokesman. It also includes a Riverside County Sheriff's Department employee. Sheriff Chad Bianco on Monday morning would not elaborate on the staffer and only said that her quarantine began Friday after returning from Italy and she’s doing well.

Riverside County hasn't been able to test locally for the coronavirus since the county lab is undergoing renovation and is not currently certified by the state. Because of this, there has been a delay in receiving test results since lab samples must be sent to the state lab or to San Bernardino County for testing.

By early next week, Riverside County is slated to receive new equipment — and receive expedited re-certification — in order to conduct tests.

Coachella, White Party still on

As the number of cases increase, local agencies and organizations are responding. On Sunday, the 2020 BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells was canceled amid coronavirus concerns, according to an announcement by tournament officials.

County health officials said Monday morning they are still not pushing for the cancellation of large events such as the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival or its country music festival counterpart Stagecoach, which are scheduled over three weekends in April at the Empire Polo Club in Indio.

Van Wagemen said Monday that BNP Paribas Open organizers made the decision to cancel the tennis tournament.

Riverside County Supervisor V. Manuel Perez added, “This is a public health decision that has to be based on data.”

White Party Palm Springs, a gay circuit party slated for the end of April, also has no plans to cancel weekend events, said publicist Jack Ketsoyan. White Party officials said Monday they are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and are following measures that the health department has outlined to protect partygoers.

Fashion Week El Paseo on March 20-28 will go on as planned, it was announced on Monday by event organizer Palm Springs Life.

"We are in daily contact with city and government officials and have taken all of the precautions ... to best assure the safety of all our patrons," officials said in a statement.

Precautions include:

Site cleaning protocols will be increased to ensure sanitation of shared surfaces.

Sanitizing wipes will be provided at the ticketing counter and hand sanitizer dispensers will be placed throughout the venue.

The number of hand washing stations will be increased and made available to anyone on site at all times.

"We are in constant contact with city agencies for guidelines on best practices and we are actively monitoring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - CDC - and the World Health Organizations websites for updates," organizers said.

Another update will be provided on Wednesday. Refunds are available: If you wish to have your ticket refunded, please visit fashionweekelpaseo.com/refund.

Rancho Mirage closes library, observatory

Rancho Mirage is closing its library and observatory through at least March 22 and is cancelling upcoming concerts in the park, as well as an appearance by tennis star Chris Evert on March 17, the last of this year’s speaker series. Tickets will be refunded.

The action came during an emergency meeting of the City Council Monday afternoon.

“These are precautionary measures,” City Manager Isaiah Hagerman said.

By reducing events that draw large crowds, it is hoped the city is reducing the chance for infection of coronavirus, he said.

Officials also are asking that anyone with business at City Hall make an appointment or ask questions by email.

The next City Council meeting is March 19, but an emergency meeting can be called again, if needed, Hagerman said.

Mayor Pro Tem Dana Hobart suggested the council also pull the plug on the upcoming ANA Inspiration LPGA tournament, scheduled for April 2-5 in Rancho Mirage.

"It is the responsibility of the cities to protect their residents and to me already this has been far too much spread of this disease...," Hobart said.

But Hagerman said staff is in regular contact with tournament organizers and it would be premature to cancel now.

"I don't think this is a decision the city will have to make," he said, but rather it will be made by tournament organizers, if necessary.

Coachella Valley schools remain open

While some schools in California, particularly in the northern part of the state, have canceled classes or issued work-from-home orders, schools in the Coachella Valley have not yet taken similar action.

Coachella Valley students returned to classes Monday, one day after Riverside County's top health official proclaimed a local public health emergency.

Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser made the declaration following reports of the county's first case of locally acquired coronavirus. He said the patient had no connection to schools in the county.

The Palm Springs Unified School District is working closely with county health officials and, "at this time, there are no recommendations to change our daily operations, close schools or cancel activities," superintendent Sandra Lyon said Monday in a letter to parents.

The school district is taking steps to prevent the spread of germs, Lyon said. Custodial staff are sanitizing classrooms daily, she said, and the district has provided teachers with disinfectant spray to use in their classrooms throughout the school day. Additionally, the district's bus contractor, First Student, has protocols in place for daily sanitizing of buses, she said.

The district is also developing contingency plans, Lyon said, underscoring that the situation is "fluid."

The district will continue providing school meals if one or more schools are closed, she said. In that case, she said, the nutrition services department would set up locations where families can collect student meals. If one or more schools close, she said, the district's Educational Services team plans in place for distance learning.

"I want to emphasize that the health and safety of our students and staff is our top priority, and all plans, procedures and decisions are being made with this in the forefront of our hearts and minds," Lyon said.

Desert Sands Unified School District is open and "continues to follow the guidelines provided by Riverside County Health," spokesperson Mary Perry said in an email. A message circulating that says Desert Sands will be closing schools from March 10 to April 10 is "bogus," she said.

"We continue to work with county school and health officials to establish protocols for schools in the event that coronavirus does spread to the Coachella Valley," the district said in a Feb. 27 message posted on its website.

The Coachella Valley Unified School District is closely monitoring the coronavirus situation and working with county officials, superintendent Maria Gandera said.

She said there has been misinformation circulating on Snapchat about Coachella Valley Unified schools.

"I would just say to parents: Please look at the district's website and wait for a phone call from the superintendent to inform you if there has been a change in the normally scheduled day," Gandera said. "At this point, there is no need to close schools."

On Friday, Murrieta Valley Unified School District officials announced the closure of one of its schools out of an abundance of caution, in response to the news that an employee was ill and being tested for COVID-19.

Murrieta Valley High School was closed Monday and is expected to remain closed until testing of the affected individual is complete, county health officials and the school district said in a statement. The campus was expected to be disinfected during the closure.

The school districts are reminding families to maintain proper hygiene to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and keep sick kids home from school.

Transit agency, hospital react to concerns

SunLine Transit Agency, which services the Coachella Valley, recently announced it was enhancing cleaning efforts on its buses.

According to an update on the bus agency’s website, “SunLine will be revising its cleaning procedures to include additional disinfecting efforts of our fixed route and paratransit vehicles and our bus stops.”

Eisenhower Health has created a coronavirus hotline for people to call to discuss any exposure or symptom concerns. The hotline is staffed 24-hours a day by registered nurses at (760) 837-8988.
