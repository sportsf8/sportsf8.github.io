<h3 id="why-you-can-ignore-reviews-of-scientific-code-by-commercial-software-developers">&ldquo;Why you can ignore reviews of scientific code by commercial software developers&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg" alt="img">
tl;dr: Many scientists write code that is crappy stylistically, but which is nevertheless scientifically correct (following rigorous checking/validation of outputs etc). Professional commercial software developers are well-qualified to review code style, but most don’t have a clue about checking scientific validity or what counts as good scientific practice. Criticisms of the Imperial Covid-Sim model from some of the latter are overstated at best.</p>
<p>Update (2020-06-02): The CODECHECK project has independently reproduced the results of one of the key reports (“Report 9”) that was based on the Imperial code, addressing some of the objections raised in the spurious “reviews” that are the subject of this article.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching with increasing horror as the most credible providers of scientific evidence and advice surrounding the Coronavirus outbreak have come under attack by various politically-motivated parties — ranging from the UK’s famously partisan newspapers and their allied politicians, to curious “grassroots” organisations that have sprung up overnight, to armies of numerically-handled Twitter accounts. While there will surely be cause for a sturdy review of the UK’s SAGE (Scientific Advice Group for Emergencies) system at some point very soon, it seems clear that a number of misinformation campaigns are in full flow that are trying to undermine and discredit this important source of independent, public-interest scientific advice in order to advance particular causes. Needless to say, this could be very dangerous — discrediting the very people we most need to listen to could produce very dire results.</p>
<p>The strategies being used to undermine SAGE advisers will be familiar to anyone who has worked in fields related to climate change or vaccination in recent decades. I will focus on one in particular here — the use of “experts” in other fields to cast doubt on the soundness of the actual experts in the field itself. In particular, this is an attempt to explain what’s so problematic about articles like this one, which are being used as ammunition for disingenuous political pieces like this one [paywall]. Both articles are clearly written with a particular political viewpoint in mind, but they have a germ of credibility in that the critique is supposedly coming from an expert in something that seems relevant. In this case, the (anonymous) expert claims to be a professional software developer with 30 years’ experience, including working at a well-regarded software company. They are credentialled, so they must be credible, right? Who better to review the Imperial group’s epidemiology code than a software developer?</p>
<p>Most of what I’m going to say is a less succinct restatement of an old article by John D. Cook, a maths/statistics/computing consultant. Cook explains how scientists use their code as an “exoskeleton” — a constantly-evolving tool to help themselves (and perhaps a small group around them) answer particular questions — rather than as an engineered “product” intended to solve a pre-specified problem for a separate set of users who will likely never see or modify the code themselves. While both scientists and software developers may write code for a living — perhaps even using the same programming language and similar development tools — that doesn’t mean they are trying to achieve similar aims with their code. A software developer will care more about maintainability and end-user experience than a scientific coder, who will likely prize flexibility and control instead. Importantly, this means that programming patterns and norms that work for one may not work for the other — exhortations to keep code simple, to remove cruft, to limit the number of parameters and settings, might actually interfere with the intended applications of a scientific code for example.</p>
<p>Software development heuristics that don’t apply to scientific code</p>
<p>The key flaw in the “Lockdown Sceptics” article is that they apply software engineering heuristics to assess the quality of the code when they simply don’t apply here. As someone who has spent a good fraction of my scientific career writing and working with modelling codes of different types, let me first try to set out the desirable properties of a high-quality scientific code. For most modelling applications, this will be:</p>
<p>Scientific correctness: A mathematically and logically correct representation of the model(s) that are being studied, as well as a correct handling and interpretation of any input data. This is distinct from “correctly fitting observations” — while finding a best-fit model to some data might be one aim of a code, the ability to explore counterfactuals is also important. A code may implement a model that is a terrible fit to the data, but can still be “high quality” in the sense that it correctly implements a counterfactual model.</p>

A code may implement a model that is a terrible fit to the data, but can still be “high quality” in the sense that it correctly implements a counterfactual model. Flexibility: The ability to add, adjust, turn on/off different effects, try different assumptions etc. These codes are normally exploratory, and will be used for studying a number of different questions over time, including many that will only arise long after the initial development. Large numbers of parameters and copious if statements are the norm.</p>

Large numbers of parameters and copious if statements are the norm. Performance: Sufficient speed and/or precision to allow the scientist to answer questions satisfactorily. Repeatability and numerical precision fall under this category, as well as raw computational performance. (It is also common for scientific codes to have settings that allow the user to trade-off speed vs accuracy, depending on the application.)</p>
<p>Note that I have in mind the kinds of codes used by specialist groups that are usually seeking to model certain classes of phenomena. There are other types of scientific code intended for more general use with goals that hew closer to what software engineers are generally trying to achieve. The Imperial code does not fall into this second category however.</p>
<p>What things are missing from this list that would be high priority for a professional software developer? Here are a few:</p>
<p>Maintainability: Most scientific codes aren’t developed with future maintainers in mind. As per John Cook, they are more likely to be developed as “exoskeletons” by and for a particular scientist, growing organically over time as new questions come up. Maintainability is a nice-to-have, especially if others will use the code, but it has little bearing on the code’s scientific quality. Some scientifically valuable codes are really annoying to modify!</p>

Some scientifically valuable codes are really annoying to modify! Documentation: Providing code and end-user documentation is a good practice, but it’s not essential for scientific codes. Different fields have different norms surrounding whether code is open sourced on publication or simply available on request for example, and plenty of scientists do a bad job of including comments or writing nice-to-read code. This is because the code is rarely the end product in itself — it is normally just a means to run some particular mathematical model that is then presented (and defended and dissected) in a journal article. The methods, assumptions, and consistency and accuracy of the results is what matters — the code itself can be an ugly mess as long as it’s scientifically correct in this sense.</p>

User-proofing/error checking: To a software developer, a well-engineered code shouldn’t require any knowledge of internal implementation details on the part of the end user. The code should check user inputs for validity, and, to the greatest extent possible, prevent them from doing things that are wrong, or invalid, or that will produce nonsense results, for the widest possible range of possible inputs. Some level of error-checking is nice to have in scientific codes too, but in many cases the code is presented “as-is” — the user is expected to determine what correct and valid inputs are themselves, through understanding of the internals and the scientific principles behind them. In fact, a code may even, intentionally, produce an output that is known to be “wrong” in some ways and “right” in others — e.g. the amplitude of a curve is wrong, but its shape is right. In essence, the user is assumed to understand all of the (known/intended) limitations of the code and its outputs. This will generally be the case if you run the code yourself and are an expert in your particular field.</p>

In essence, the user is assumed to understand all of the (known/intended) limitations of the code and its outputs. This will generally be the case if you run the code yourself and are an expert in your particular field. Formal testing: Software developers know the value of a test suite: Write unit tests for everything; throw lots of invalid inputs at the code to check it doesn’t fall over; use continuous integration or similar to routinely test for regressions. This is good practise that can often catch bugs. Setting up such infrastructure is still not the norm in scientific code development however. So how do scientists deal with regressions and so on? The answer is that most use ad hoc methods to check for issues. When a new result first comes out of the code, we tend to study it to death. Does it make sense? If I change this setting, does it respond as expected? Can it reproduce idealised/previous results? Does it agree with this alternative but equivalent approach? Again, this is a key part of the scientific process. We also output meaningful intermediate results of the code as a matter of course. Remember that we are generally dealing with quantities that correspond to something in the real world — you can make sure you aren’t propagating a negative number of deaths in the middle of your calculation for example. While these checks could also be handled by unit tests, most scientists generally just end up with their own weird set of ad hoc test outputs and print statements. It’s ugly, and not infallible, but it tends to work well given the intensive nature of our result-testing behaviour and community cross-checking.</p>
<p>These last four points will horrify most software developers (and I know quite a few — I was active in the FOSS movement for a solid decade; buy my book etc etc). Skipping these things is terrible practise if you’re developing software for end-users. But for scientific software, it’s not so important. If you have users other than yourself, they will figure things out after a while (a favourite project for starting grad students!) or email you to ask. If you put in invalid inputs, your testing and other types of scientific examination of the results will generally uncover the error. And, really, who cares if your code is ugly and messy? As long as you are doing the right things to properly check the scientific results before publishing them, it doesn’t matter if you wrote it in bloody Perl with Russian comments — the quality of the scientific results is what matters, not the quality of the code itself. This is well understood throughout the scientific community.</p>
<p>In summary, most scientific modelling codes are expected to be used by user-developers with extensive internal knowledge of the code, the model, and the assumptions behind it, and who are routinely performing a wide variety of checks for correctness before doing anything with the results. In the right hands, you can have a lot of confidence that sensible, rigorous results are being obtained; however they are not for non-expert users.</p>
<p>Specific misunderstandings in the “Lockdown Sceptics” article</p>
<p>I will caveat this section with the fact that I am an astrophysicist and not an epidemiologist, so can’t critique the model assumptions or even really the extent to which it has been implemented well in the Imperial code. I can explain where I think the Lockdown Sceptics article has missed the point of this kind of code though.</p>
<p>Non-deterministic outputs: This is the most important one, as it could, in particular circumstances, be a valid criticism. The model implemented by this code is a stochastic model, and so is expected to produce outputs with some level of randomness (it is exploring a particular realisation of some probability distribution; running it many times will allow us to reconstruct that distribution, a method called Monte Carlo). Computers deal in “pseudo-randomness” though; given the same starting “seed” they will produce the same random-looking sequence. A review by a competing group in Edinburgh found a bug that resulted in different results for the same seed, which is generally not what you’d want to happen. As you can see at that link, a developer of the Imperial code acknowledged the bug and gave some explanation of its impact.</p>
<p>The key question here is whether the bug could have caused materially incorrect results in published papers or advice. Based on the response of the developer, I would expect not. They are clearly aware of similar types of behaviour happening before, which implies that they have run the code in ways that could pick up this kind of behaviour (i.e. they are running some reproducibility tests — standard scientific practise). The bug is not unknown. A particular workaround here appears to be re-running the model many times with different seeds, which is what you’d do with this code anyway; or using different settings that don’t seem to suffer from this bug. My guess is that the “false stochasticity” caused by this bug is simply inconsequential, or that it doesn’t occur with the way they normally run the code. They aren’t worried about it — not because this is a disaster they are trying to cover up, but because this is a routine bug that doesn’t really affect anything important.</p>
<p>Again, this is bread and butter for scientific programming. They have seen the issue before, and so are aware of this limitation of the code. Ideally they would have fixed the bug, yes, but with this sort of code we’re not normally trying to reach a state of near-perfection ready for a point release or some such, as with commercial software. Instead, the code is being used in a constantly evolving state. So perhaps, being aware of it, it’s just not a very high priority to fix given how they are using the code. Indeed, why would they run the code in such a way that the bug arises and knowingly invalidates their results? It’s pretty clear this is not a major result-invalidating bug from their behaviour (and the behaviour of the reporter from Edinburgh) alone.</p>
<p>Undocumented equations: See above regarding the approach to documentation. It would definitely be much more user-friendly to document the equations, but does it mean that the code is bad? No. For all we know, there is a scruffy old LaTeX note explaining the equations, or they are in one of the early papers (either are common). This is totally normal — ugly, and not helpful for the non-expert trying to make sense of the code, but not an indicator of poor code quality.</p>
<p>Continuing development: As per the above, scientific codes of this kind generally evolve as they need to, rather than aiming for a particular release date or set of features. Continuing development is the usual, and things like bugfixes are applied as and when they crop up. Serious issues that affect previously published results would normally prompt an erratum (e.g. see this one of mine); some scientists are less good about issuing errata (or corrective follow-up papers) than others, especially for more minor issues, although covering up a really serious issue would be a career-ending ethical violation for most. As I hope I’m making clear from the above, the article’s charge of serious “quality problems” isn’t actually borne out though; they are just (harmlessly!) violating the norms they are used to from a completely different field.</p>
<p>Some other misunderstandings from that article:</p>
<p>“the original program was ‘a single 15,000 line file that had been worked on for a decade’ (this is considered extremely poor practice)” — Not to a scientist it’s not! If anything, the fact that the group have been plugging away at this code for a decade, with an increasing number of collaborators, confronting it with more and more peer reviewers, and withstanding more and more comparisons from other groups, gives me more confidence in it. It certainly improves the chances that substantial bugs would have been found and resolved over time, or structural flaws noticed. Young, unproven codes are the dangerous ones! And while the large mono-file structure will surely be annoying to work with (and so is poor in that sense), it has no bearing on the actual scientific correctness of the code.</p>
<p>“A request for the original code was made 8 days ago but ignored, and it will probably take some kind of legal compulsion to make them release it. Clearly, Imperial are too embarrassed by the state of it ever to release it of their own free will, which is unacceptable given that it was paid for by the taxpayer and belongs to them.” — This is a tell-tale sign that this person isn’t a scientist. First, the motto of most academics is “Apologies for the late reply”! Waiting 8 days for a reply to a potentially complicated and labour-intensive request is nothing, especially as the group is obviously busy with more urgent matters. Second, there’s no saying that the taxpayer paid for most of the code (it could be funded by a charitable foundation like the Wellcome Trust for example), and the code will likely remain the IP of the author, but with Imperial retaining a perpetual license to it. Instead, the obligation for openness here comes from the publications that use the code. Most journals require that authors make code and data used to produce results in particular journal articles available on request. Note that some scientists are cagey about releasing their code fully publicly because they worry about competitors co-opting it (and not without good reason). I personally have made all of my scientific code available by default however, and it’s good that this group are making theirs fully public too. It’s the right thing to do in this scenario (and we should also recognise previously opened codes, such as the one from the LSHTM group also used by SAGE).</p>
<p>“What it’s doing is best described as ‘SimCity without the graphics'” — Fantastic! The original SimCity used a tremendously sophisticated model for what it did, and has even been used in teaching town planners (I remember reading the manual in the 90s).</p>
<p>“The people in the Imperial team would quickly do a lot better if placed in the context of a well run software company….the difference between ICL and the software industry is the latter has processes to detect and prevent mistakes” — Now really, this is teaching grandma to suck eggs. Remember that much of modern programming emerged from academic science. This is not to say that your average scientific programmer couldn’t stand to learn some cleaner coding practises, but to accuse scientists of not having processes to detect and prevent mistakes — ludicrous! The bedrock of the scientific process is in validation and self-correction of results, and we have plenty of highly effective tools in our arsenal to handle that thank you very much. Now I have found unit testing, continuous integration etc. to be useful in some of my more infrastructural projects, but they are conveniences rather than necessities. Practically every scientist I know spends most of their time checking their results rather than coding, and I sincerely doubt that the Imperial group is any different. If anything, in most fields there is a culture of “conspicuous correctness” — finding mistakes in the work of others is a highly prized activity (especially if they are direct competitors).</p>
<p>“Models that consume their own outputs as inputs is problem well known to the private sector – it can lead to rapid divergence and incorrect predictions” — This is a highly simplistic way of looking at things, and I suspect the author doesn’t know much about this kind of method. I don’t know specifically what the Imperial folks are doing here, but there are important classes of methods that use feedback loops of this kind called iterative methods that are common in solving complicated systems of coupled equations and so on, which are mathematically highly rigorous. I have used them in a statistical modelling context on occasion. Ferguson and co are from highly numerate backgrounds, and so I think it’s safe to assume they’re not missing obvious problems of this kind.</p>
<p>I could go on, but hopefully this is enough to establish my case — the author of that article is out of their depth, and clearly unaware of many of the basics of numerical modelling or the way this kind of science is done (with great historical success across many fields, might I add). In fact, they are so far out that they don’t even realise how silly this all sounds to someone with even a cursory knowledge of this kind of thing — it is an almost perfect study in the Dunning-Kruger effect. How they reached the conclusion that scientists must be so incompetent that “all academic epidemiology [should] be defunded” and that “This sort of work is best done by the insurance sector” is truly remarkable — there is a remarkable arrogance in overlooking the possibility that, just maybe, the failure is in their own understanding.</p>
<p>The peculiarly implausible nature of the accusations</p>
<p>What I have discussed above is a (by no means complete) explanation of how many, if not most, scientific modellers approach their job. I have no special insight into the workings of the Imperial group; this is more an attempt to explain some of the sociology, attitude, and norms of quantitative scientific modelling. Professional software developers will hate some of these norms because they are bad end-user software engineering — but this doesn’t actually matter, since scientific correctness of a code typically owes little to the state of its engineering, and we have a very different notion of who the end user is compared to a company like Google. Instead, we have our own well-worn methods of checking that our codes — our exoskeletons — are scientifically correct in the most pertinent ways, backed up by decades of experience and rabid, competitive cross-checking of results. This, really, is all that matters in terms of scientific code quality, whether you’re publishing prospective theories of particle physics or informing the public health response to an unprecedented pandemic.</p>
<p>Let’s not lose sight of the bigger picture here though. The point of the Lockdown Sceptics article is to challenge the validity of the Imperial code by painting it as shoddy, and presumably, therefore, to undermine the basis of particular actions that may have taken note of SAGE advice. For this to actually be the case, though, the Imperial group must have (a) evaded detection for over 10 years from a global community of competing experts; (b) be almost criminally negligent as scientists, by having ignored easily-discovered but consequential bugs; (c) be almost criminally arrogant to suppose that their unchecked/flawed model should be used to inform such big decisions; and (d) for the entire scientific advisory establishment to have been taken for a ride without any thought to question what they were being told. Boiling this all down, the author is calling several hundred eminent scientists — in the UK and elsewhere — complete idiots, while they, through maybe half an hour of cursory inspection, have found the “true, flawed” nature of the code through a series of noddy issues.</p>
<p>This is clearly very silly, as even an ounce of introspection would have revealed to the author of that article had they started out with innocent motives. Their “code review” is no such thing however — instead, it is a blatant hatchet job, of the kind we have come to expect from climate change deniers and other anti-science types. The article author’s expertise in software development (which I will recognise, despite their anonymity) is of entirely the wrong type to actually, meaningfully, review this codebase, and is clearly misapplied. You may as well ask a Java UI programmer to review security bugs in the Linux kernel. To then rejoice in the fact that this has been picked up by an obviously lop-sided wing of the press and used to push a potentially harmful agenda, against the best scientific evidence we have, is chilling.

<h3 id="easing-the-restrictions-open-borders-by-july-and-let-us-move-freely">&ldquo;Easing the restrictions: Open borders by July and let us move freely&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_2.5%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_320%2C$x_0%2C$y_12/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/f99c40f8f58613dce792569e6603174b1a3d478c" alt="img">
We&rsquo;re all in this together, so let&rsquo;s work together It would be a great help if premiers and medical officers would stop squabbling about whose border closures and restrictions are bigger or better. This problem deserves a more mature approach. What is happening makes our leaders look rather silly, and the last thing Australians need is to lose respect for the very people whom we need to guide us. I am, you are, we are Australian. The virus is not political, and none of us have all the answers. Meet, agree and move forward. It cannot be that hard to reach a compromise. Tim Shirley, Benalla Selfish city tourists, keep away from our community We have seen the selfish, uncaring behaviour of tourists visiting the Daylesford region before. They clog up the parking, use disabled car parks, reverse out of centre parking. As a group, they generally do not give a fig for other people. Last weekend, a multitude of these metro-centric, self-obsessed, selfie-taking people came to Daylesford and Hepburn. We have, for two months, locked down, changed our ways and protected each other. All that may now be undone by these selfish city dwellers.</p>
<p>OK, there is an argument that the success of Hepburn Shire lies in tourism. Those of us who were here three decades ago know it was kicking along all right and we could actually afford to buy a house. The reality is that businesses designed for tourists fail so frequently that economic growth is a false idol. As an extremely vulnerable individual, I am now back to lockdown for another fortnight as a result of this invasion. Brian Hawkes, Daylesford So why are some businesses open, but not others? I am the co-owner of an inner-city bar. While I applaud the Victorian government&rsquo;s response to COVID-19, I am at a loss to understand the reasoning behind allowing restaurants to reopen but not bars. Is there any more danger in sharing a few drinks with friends as opposed to eating a meal that has been handled by chefs and waiters? If social distancing is maintained, a bar is as safe as a supermarket or hairdresser. I suspect there is a wowserish attitude to bars behind this anomaly. At this rate, Melbourne will lose a lot of its character permanently and family businesses like mine will go broke. I am not advocating business as usual, just logical consistency. I await the Premier&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>Robert Price, Preston Do we have a constitutional right to travel interstate? With the closure of state borders, one wonders how constitutional this is. Whereas Section 92 guarantees free trade between the states, there is no specific guarantee of free movement of people. The nearest provision seems to be Section 117, which in essence says that, while any state may have different or unique laws, any such law must not discriminate against a visitor from another state. Therefore border crossing and quarantining rules should apply equally to residents returning to their home state and to visitors from any other state. Also, if returning residents are allowed back to their resident state, there should be no restrictions on the entry of citizens from other states. Anyone for a challenge to the High Court? Richard Harding, Port Melbourne</p>
<p>THE FORUM Selective compassion Peter Dutton accused the Queensland Premier of putting people&rsquo;s mental heath in jeopardy by refusing to open her state&rsquo;s borders (ABC, 21/5). I wonder how he justifies the continued confinement of the family from Biloela. Their mental health is likely to be seriously and permanently affected by their exile on Christmas Island at his behest. Juliet Flesch, Kew A form of slavery?</p>
<p>Re &ldquo;Warning of migrant worker cluster risk&rdquo; (The Age, 21/5). It appears our government is preparing us for another increase in numbers of new migrants, when we are already proving incapable of ensuring the safety and wellbeing of a large percentage of our current migrant workforce. It makes me wonder if this country has been quietly introducing a new tier of slave labour in its economic framework for some time. Otherwise it makes no sense that a modern First World nation can hide 100,000 &ldquo;undocumented&rdquo; workers. Surely the lack of regulation implied by this rings &ldquo;slavery alarm bells&rdquo;. In the past we had the appalling practices of &ldquo;blackbirding&rdquo; of Pacific Islanders and the outright exploitation of Indigenous labour during the colonial days. Haven&rsquo;t we already demonstrated how cruel a nation we can be without allowing this? Annie Mullarvey, North Fitzroy More double standards</p>
<p>A New Zealand woman has been allowed to visit her dying sister in Australia and it was touching to see her total joy when she was interviewed. For a minute I wondered if this government might next be reviewing its refugee policy, but then I realised that the woman was Caucasian. Evert de Graauw, Wantirna An overstep by Victoria What constitutional &ldquo;rights&rdquo; does the Victorian government have to enter into any foreign government agreement, even the Belt and Road memorandum of understanding, with China? If foreign government agreements are a Commonwealth responsibility, then it should take punitive measures against the Andrews government either through the GST or other capital grant programs. Rodney Reed, Geelong</p>
<p>More details, Premier Victoria is due to formally sign the agreement to China&rsquo;s Belt and Road Initiative in mid-June. Premier Daniel Andrews owes it to all Victorians to say whether this will proceed or not. Bill Holmes, Kew Giving to the needy Now that the panic buying is over, can the supermarkets set up food donation boxes to assist those organisations which provide food and groceries to people in need? Your article – &ldquo;Cracks show as carers facing a struggle&rdquo; (The Age, 21/5) – highlights the need for ongoing support, and given the number of people who have lost their jobs and are ineligible for JobKeeper, there will be more people requiring assistance.</p>
<p>Perhaps those organisations can tell the supermarkets what is needed, and those of us who are lucky enough to still have income can help to provide. Brenda McKinty, Oakleigh East Housing the homeless I have just received, and responded to, a request for a donation to Melbourne City Mission, which claims to be seeking shelter for 6000 young, homeless people. You have reported a strong call for building more low-cost social housing but also report (The Age, 20/5) that 13per cent of dwellings available for rent in Southbank, and 7.6per cent in the CBD, are unoccupied. These places are mainly too expensive for homeless people. Surely it would be much cheaper and quicker to subsidise the rent on the available dwellings than to build more social housing, which needs huge capital outlays.</p>
<p>Harley Powell, Elsternwick Boom time for Boomers Thank you, Jessica Irvine – &ldquo;The true value of home comforts&rdquo; (Comment, 21/5). We bought our house in 1981 for $50,000 (about two years' salary). It is now worth $1million (about 10 years' salary). There are things we could do to mitigate this, but we do not. After our lack of action on climate change, this is probably the second most iniquitous legacy of the Baby Boomers. Andy Hannah, Macleod The battle for surgery</p>
<p>Restricting non-coronavirus-related access to healthcare, based on the need to have capacity in case of a rush of COVID-19 patients and a lack of personal protective equipment, seems sensible until you look at the cost. My daughter had an infection in a tooth. Due to delays in getting treatment, with restrictions on dentists, hospital admissions and now COVID-19 test results, the situation has escalated such that she now has an infection that is on the verge of sepsis, has been in severe pain for weeks, needs to have six teeth removed, and may never recover feeling in her jaw due to nerve involvement. She has been told she needs emergency surgery but the hospital will not allow it until she gets results from a COVID-19 test, which may take another week. Although the testing centre acknowledged she needed priority, she was told it was too difficult for the pathology lab to identify priority cases. Surely it was not hard to foresee circumstances like this, and contingency plans could have been made. Sue James, Rowville Long wait for results</p>
<p>My daughter, wife and I were tested for COVID-19 on Sunday, May 3 at Doncaster Shopping Town. My daughter received her result the next Thursday. As of yesterday afternoon, my wife and I had not been notified. What is the point of testing if results are not given? Cor Peeters, Doncaster Protecting our babies Australian drinkers will be warned &ldquo;alcohol can cause lifelong harm to your baby&rdquo; under a new mandatory labelling scheme approved by the regulator, unless state and federal ministers veto the plan (The Age, 20/5). Alcohol Beverages Australia chief Andrew Wilsmore says the decision is a &ldquo;bitter disappointment&rdquo;. Does he believe the number of babies currently suffering brain damage and growth problems from fetal alcohol syndrome in this country is at an acceptable level? Justin Shaw, Ringwood East</p>
<p>My sacrifice for Australia We will be facing a glut of barley soon. I will be doing my bit by increasing my beer consumption. We&rsquo;re all in this together. Michael Lunney, Leopold What guarantee integrity? I have no objection to protective services officers being give extra power (The Age, 21/5). But I want to know if they will use these powers properly, with discretion, and not abuse the powers given to them. I just hope we do not become a police state.</p>
<p>Sin-Li Tan, Box Hill South Love where you live Joseph Allen (Comment, 20/5) may convince some that the air quality on planes is safe. I stopped flying in October last year because of the air quality in our wider atmosphere. There is nothing else you can do to have a bigger impact on global warming than flying. It is an extremist position that Qantas' Alan Joyce (The Age, 20/5) is taking: to pump his business back up when many people are finding ways to use Zoom etc to hold business meetings and Victorians need to support local tourist destinations. So many flights are unnecessary. Also, I am not convinced that airlines consider fully the health of their staff when so many cases of coronavirus are popping up in aged care homes and similar close-contact settings. Love where you live and support local businesses.</p>
<p>Alex Mungall, Ascot Vale Jobs and environment Carbon capture (The Age, 20/5) is not a plan to reduce emissions. It is a magical-thinking exercise to move emissions into the ground, or under the sea. The fossil fuel industry thinks carbon capture is its last best hope to keep mining, burning and polluting. But despite billions of dollars spent on decades of research, it remains massively expensive and unproven at scale. Like proposals to use more polluting &ldquo;natural&rdquo; gas, this is not a solution to the pandemic-caused economic crisis, and it is certainly not a solution to climate change. With the right policies (according to the Australian Energy Market Operator), renewables could supply 75per cent of Australia&rsquo;s electricity needs within five years, and create thousands of future-proofed jobs in the process. Guy Abrahams, Fairhaven</p>
<p>Too close to home Logging is taking place 1.5kilometres from Big Pats Creek and six kilometres from Warburton. The science tells us this makes the forest drier, more susceptible to fires and increases the severity of fires. Logging so close to our homes is criminal. Paul Colcheedas, Warburton Let&rsquo;s have cleaner buses The most obvious vehicles to be constructed using electric motors would have to be metropolitan buses. Currently they have large, diesel engines and stop and start frequently, which creates air pollution. Buses have fixed routes taking a known amount of time, and batteries can be replaced or recharged at the end of a shift. Solar panels could be placed on the roof to assist in the recharging.</p>
<p>Keith Handscombe, Ashwood Business built on greed Hear, hear Carolyn Crawford (Comment, 20/5). Leave those pokies turned off. My partner has not played them in four years now, after a 20-year addiction. Once that pacifying urge was satisfied with love and connection, he realised what a hole he had been in. What a business it is to take advantage of loneliness and simple, forgivable greed. Name withheld, Preston How did NS get it wrong?</p>
<p>I was disappointed that the answer to the quick crossword clue – &ldquo;extremely stupid or foolish&rdquo; (Puzzles, 21/5) – was not Trump. Peter Hendrickson, East Melbourne AND ANOTHER THING Environment</p>
<p>When will we be able to pry our politicians' hands out of the pockets of the fossil fuel industry? John Uren, Blackburn Gas-led recovery. An oxymoron. Christine Morris, Hoppers Crossing Will Scotty from marketing bring a lump of gas into Parliament?</p>
<p>Denny Meadows, Hawthorn Logic says don&rsquo;t make carbon in the first place. Then carbon capture wouldn&rsquo;t be required. John Kellett, Bundoora Politics Australians care about what happens in Wangaratta, not Wuhan or Washington.</p>
<p>William Stewart, Eaglemont Trump: a bull in the China shop. Jacki Burgess, Port Melbourne As if Donald Trump needs any more serious side effects. Gary Sayer, Warrnambool</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonder Trump isn&rsquo;t encouraging Biden to take the medically unproven hydroxychloroquine. Garry Meller, Bentleigh Furthermore To all cooks and chefs out there: buy barley and put it in your soups and casseroles. Dianne Jones, Point Lonsdale</p>
<p>Casual workers would be more aptly called flexible workers. Joan Segrave, Healesville Jim Pilmer (18/5), the app for locating your secateurs is called a holster. Ian Kerr, Camberwell Jim Pilmer and Brian Morley (19/5), I need an app with large print to find my reading glasses.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Meredith, Surrey Hills Doctors around the world are like superheroes with no capes. Anastasia Panagiotidis, Our Lady&rsquo;s Primary School, Craigieburn Eating on a Qantas flight while wearing a protective face mask is going to prove tricky. Erica Grebler, Caulfield North</p>
<p>Warne on Waugh: like Trump on Obama with different caps. Bernd Rieve, Brighton *Sign up to editor Alex Lavelle&rsquo;s exclusive newsletter at: <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/editornote">www.theage.com.au/editornote</a>.

SUNDAY PUZZLE — I am so glad that we are all in Cruciverbala, where the presence of a Big Red Button is an indication of a major sight gag and there are no geopolitical implications. I assume that we are all looking at said red button, which I am told is present in electronic versions. If you are solving online, Will Shortz’s print introduction is helpful. To quote him, quoting today’s constructor, Natan Last: “I wrote a computer program to help me find words that [ ] once you [ ].”</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>18A: This is a debut clue for a rarely-used entry (that had previously been defined as “paired” or “double”). I am dubious that this guy is a household name. I habitually listen to his music when I do household chores (something Pavlovian I cannot explain involving beats dropping while I fold clothes), so I figured out DIPLO fast, but when I looked up some videos where he actually appeared on camera, I realized I was mixing him up with Skrillex. There were plenty of names in this puzzle but the crosses were kind, I think. TAMORA Pierce and Hermione GRANGER might have been the other toughies, and some were just fun, like EBERT.</p>
<p>40A: This element wangles its way into the puzzle every once in a while — point for everyone who knew it from the actual clue and not from some vague chemistry recollection. This is a stalwart transitional metal known for its stabilizing properties, despite its crazy name, YTTRIUM. It was named after the town in Sweden where it was originally discovered.</p>
<p>50A: If you did not know your YTTRIUM facts and asked your iPhone, this answer might have just presented itself. My personal SIRI, at least, did not know her element 39 even though it is a part of her physical host.

<h3 id="our-favorite-crossword-clues-of-2019">&ldquo;Our Favorite Crossword Clues of 2019&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5abd243731a8d50df08d57dd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Crossword-Puzzle-Eustace.jpg" alt="img">
The New Yorker’s crossword puzzle family grew this year: in April, we introduced a second weekly puzzle, the Weekend Crossword, and added two new constructors—Erik Agard and Aimee Lucido—to our roster, alongside Patrick Berry, Kameron Austin Collins, Elizabeth C. Gorski, Natan Last, and Anna Shechtman. Last month, we revived an old favorite—you can now play a cryptic crossword every Sunday on newyorker.com—and this month, we’re continuing a recent tradition, counting down to the new year with seven days of holiday crosswords. Each morning, you’ll find a year-in-review puzzle with a different theme: literature (Tuesday), language (Wednesday), movies (Thursday), music (Friday), TV (Saturday), science and tech (Sunday), and news and politics (Monday).</p>
<p>In the video above, Anna and Erik look back on some of the words and phrases that defined 2019. Erik has a hunch that crosswords are going to take over the nation in 2020; we hope he’s right. In the meantime, we’re taking a look backward, rounding up some of the most memorable New Yorker crossword clues of the year. And, if you haven’t picked out a New Year’s resolution yet, we have a humble suggestion: do more crosswords. Happy holidays, and happy solving.</p>
<p>“Career advice that may be purely academic?”</p>
<p>A.: PUBLISHORPERISH</p>
<p>Liz was responsible for some of our favorite puns this year. Others that tickled us: “Hammer home?” for TOOLBOX, “Give a damn?” for CUSS, and “It’s no place for free spirits” for CASHBAR.</p>
<p>“Cosmetic trend involving serums and essences”</p>
<p>A.: KBEAUTY</p>
<p>A phenomenon that was overdue for its crossword début. Props to Kameron for working this tricky combination of letters into a grid—and for crossing it with SKIN and EYEMASK to give its corner a subtle cosmetics theme.</p>
<p>“Where you might meet your match”</p>
<p>A.: TINDERDATE</p>
<p>Anna’s grids are often sprinkled with neologisms (TWITTERRANT, MOMAGER, SNEAKERHEAD) clued in unexpected ways. (We had trouble choosing between this and her clue for DIGITALNATIVE: “One socialized with social media, say.”)</p>
<p>“Liverpool street whose signs are prone to tourist theft”</p>
<p>A.: PENNYLANE</p>
<p>There’s a whole story of pop culture and local politics wrapped up in this pithy clue.</p>
<p>Photograph by Peter Byrne / PA Images / Getty</p>
<p>“Eartha Kitt song often misattributed to Marilyn Monroe”</p>
<p>A.: SANTABABY</p>
<p>One of many instances of a white performer getting credit for a black musician’s song—and an example of how crosswords can help set the record straight.</p>
<p>“ ‘A Voice from the South’ author, 1892”</p>
<p>A.: ANNAJULIACOOPER</p>
<p>Speaking of welcome correctives, Erik’s puzzles often center—literally—women and people of color whose stories have been pushed to the margins (see also: MADAMCJWALKER). Revisionist history via the fifteen-by-fifteen grid.</p>
<p>“Cause of certain nocturnal emissions”</p>
<p>A.: SLEEPAPNEA</p>
<p>This one almost didn’t make it past the censors.</p>
<p>“Common malapropism used to mean ‘Nonetheless!’ ”</p>
<p>A.: IRREGARDLESS</p>
<p>A word doesn’t have to be dictionary-sanctioned to be “cross-worthy,” as Aimee has demonstrated more than once this year.</p>
<p>“Lil Nas X No. 1 hit with the lyric ‘I’m gonna ride ’til I can’t no more’ ”</p>
<p>A.: OLDTOWNROAD</p>
<p>When something becomes a full-blown cultural phenomenon overnight, there’s an informal race to get it into a puzzle—and Natan frequently wins.</p>
