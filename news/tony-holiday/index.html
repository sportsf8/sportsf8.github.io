<p>Tony Holiday’s new album, SOUL SERVICE, from the VizzTone label group, is available now worldwide.</p>
<p>Memphis based Tony Holiday came to international attention with his 2019 VizzTone release, the star-studded PORCH SESSIONS, in which he established himself as a top-notch harmonica player and producer of modern field recordings. With SOUL SERVICE, Holiday also proves to be a powerful, soulful singer, and a songwriter of smart, moving roots music songs that expand his palette beyond blues to show his diverse influences.</p>
<p>Produced by Grammy nominee Ori Naftaly (Southern Avenue, Stax Records) at Zebra Ranch, the Dickinson family studio in Independence, Mississippi, the album features Holiday on lead vocals and harmonica, Landon Stone on guitar, Max Kaplan on bass and background vocals, Danny Banks (John Nemeth band) on drums, and special guests producer Ori Naftaly on guitar and Grammy nominated Victor Wainwright on keys.</p>
<p>Tony Holiday says, “Recording Soul Service at North Mississippi’s Zebra Ranch was a gratifying experience. It really captured the soul of the Memphis influence that’s at the heart of this record.”</p>

<p><img src="https://bsp-static.playbill.com/dims4/default/f37aa15/2147483647/thumbnail/1200x627/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpb-asset-replication.s3.amazonaws.com%2F73%2F58%2Fdd352fb44c199755562d0a710f4f%2FChita-Rivera-1-Photo-by-Laura-Marie-Duncan.jpg" alt="img">
Stream of Chita: A Legendary Celebration Raises Over $100K for Broadway Cares’ COVID-19 Emergency Efforts</p>
<p>In addition to Tony winner Chita Rivera, the 2013 concert also featured Tommy Tune and Ben Vereen, plus a video tribute from John Kander.</p>
<p>The May 29 stream of Chita: A Legendary Celebration, an October 2013 concert starring Tony winner Chita Rivera to benefit Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS, raised $100,036 for the organization and its COVID-19 emergency efforts.</p>
<p>Proceeds help provide healthy meals, lifesaving medication, emergency financial assistance, housing, counseling and more to people across the country, including those within the entertainment industry, whose needs are heightened by the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The 2013 event, which took place at the August Wilson Theatre, originally raised $413,660, bringing Chita: A Legendary Celebration’s performance total to $513,696.</p>
<p>Chita: A Legendary Celebration featured performances from Rivera plus fellow Tony winners Tommy Tune and Ben Vereen, as well as a video tribute from composer John Kander. Interspersed among the performances were new interviews with Rivera from her home.</p>
<p>The original evening was directed by Graciela Daniele and written by Terrence McNally with music direction by Michael Croiter, sound design by Andrew Keister, and lighting design by Jeff Croiter. Richard Hester served as production supervisor, and Arturo E. Porazzi was production stage manager.</p>
<p>“My history with Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS goes back to the beginning,” Rivera said in an earlier statement. “I’m overjoyed that this magical evening is being shared with even more people now, and feel so fortunate that this performance will yet again help people in need, especially during this most challenging moment in history.”</p>
<p>Tom Viola, executive director of Broadway Cares, added, “Since our earliest days, Chita has been one of Broadway Cares’ biggest champions, a true and loyal friend. She has appeared in nearly all of our annual events, signed thousands of posters and Playbills, made audience appeals, worn Easter Bonnets, been immortalized as a holiday ornament, greeted fans at the Broadway Flea Market &amp; Grand Auction, and, through it all, encouraged us because she cares for those who need help most. And that continues today, as she shares her heart and talent virtually with this special stream.”</p>
<p>Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS is one of the nation’s leading industry-based, nonprofit AIDS fundraising and grant-making organizations. By drawing upon the talents, resources, and generosity of the American theatre community, since 1988 Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS has raised more than $300 million for essential services for people with AIDS and other critical illnesses across the United States.</p>

<h3 id="leslie-odom-jr-raises-a-glass-to-billie-holiday-and-new-york-city">&ldquo;Leslie Odom Jr. Raises a Glass to Billie Holiday and New York City&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/31/arts/31my10-odom-web/31my10-odom-web-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<ol>
<li>Billie Holiday at Carnegie Hall</li>
</ol>
<p>I haven’t been home for this long a stretch since my kid has been born. I’ve never had the pleasure of putting my daughter to bed every single night. Bath time is part of the wind down for bedtime for her, and I’ve taken that as a time to help lay a really good musical foundation. One of my dad’s favorite games was that he would have his music on, and he would quiz me: Who’s this? Who’s that? And it gave me great pleasure to get the answer right. Lucille can recognize Billie’s voice now. When I ask her, “Who’s that?,” she says, “Billie Holiday.”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“The Sopranos”</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m in the prequel David Chase wrote that deals with a pivotal summer in young Tony’s life. That audition came up fast, so I watched a couple of episodes just to learn what I could. Then I thought I would watch all six seasons. Chase writes about family and brutality and violence and criminality, but I’ve never seen it handled with quite the same economy or eloquence. There’s so much poetry in the series, all the dream stuff, plus the whole notion that a guy like Tony is putting himself on the proverbial couch. Watching someone do the hard work on themselves leads to powerful change, because it inspires someone else to do the same thing.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Toni Morrison’s “Beloved”</li>
</ol>
<p>After I saw “The Pieces I Am,” the Toni Morrison documentary, I was like, it would be worth my time to complete my education. I’d read “The Bluest Eye,” “Song of Solomon” and maybe one other book. So at the top of quarantine, I picked “Beloved.” Sometimes it’s hard to carve out the time to sit and peacefully read with a toddler, so books on tape have been great — that one in particular, because Ms. Morrison reads it herself. I’ve had a very fun time toggling back and forth between the book and the audiobook, to have her tell the story to me. I think I know something; I know what it meant to me. And then I’ll hear her read the same phrase and it opens it up in a whole different way.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>HypeMiC</li>
</ol>
<p>We are recording “Central Park” in quarantine. They sent us any equipment that we didn’t have so that we could keep the work going. So I’ve been recording from home. Between that and the concerts, the benefits and the fund-raisers that we’re doing online, the HypeMiC has become my favorite little mic. It sounds great.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Words With Friends</li>
</ol>
<p>With all the free time, it’s been a great source of time suckage, but also of strategy and staying nimble and keeping the brain moving a little bit. I’m very, very focused right now on the six-letter word. That’s all I care about.

<h3 id="the-grand-theater-in-wausau-announces-season-lineup">&ldquo;The Grand Theater in Wausau announces season lineup&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/wausaupilotandreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Grand-2021.jpg?fit=1025%2C413&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
NEWS RELEASE – After a record-breaking season with 31 sold-out shows, repeat recognition as one of Pollstar’s Top 150 Theatres in the World, and performances from incredible artists across genres, The Grand Theater on Monday announced the lineup for its 2020-2021 season.</p>
<p>Since they were not able to gather in person to celebrate the launch of the season, The Grand announced its 2020/21 Season via a virtual preview party on Monday evening. The announcement featured videos of all the shows on the season, special guest appearances by several of the artists, and performances from the Central Wisconsin Jerry Ensemble. The full broadcast is available on The Grand’s Facebook page, YouTube channel, and website at <a href="http://www.grandtheater.org">www.grandtheater.org</a>.</p>
<p>The new season is full of Tony and Grammy Award winners, Broadway hits, music legends, holiday shows, and some of the hottest touring acts today. Blockbuster shows like Riverdance and Blue Man Group will return to The Grand this year, and Broadway smash hits Anastasia and Waitress will make their Wausau debuts. The legendary rock band Three Dog Night and country icon Wynonna Judd and her band The Big Noise are also featured on the season, as well as Wausau favorites The TEN Tenors, the Red Hot Chilli Pipers, the illusionist Bill Blagg, and more.</p>
<p>Due to late changes with tour dates, the annual season brochure has transitioned into a digital brochure to accommodate date changes in real time. The full brochure is available on The Grand’s website. Since they were not able to print and mail brochures this year, The Grand will also host a “20/21 Season Brochure Walk” around the building. Starting with the doors under the Marquee, each show will be featured on a different door of the venue.</p>
<p>“We know that things might be a little different for the upcoming season, but we are committed to our mission of bringing the best in the performing arts to our region,” said Sean Wright, Executive Director of The Grand. “We are working with health officials and industry leaders to ensure that our venue is safe for all patrons, performers, volunteers and staff whenever we are able to gather again. While that is still uncertain right now, one thing we know for sure is that this long ‘intermission’ has reminded us more than ever of the power of the arts and of coming together to enjoy them. These are challenging times for artists and arts organizations alike and we hope that the announcement of the new season will give us all something to look forward to in the months ahead.”</p>
<p>All of the shows on The Grand’s 2020/21 Season are available for season subscription at 9:00 AM on Tuesday, June 2 online at <a href="http://www.grandtheater.org">www.grandtheater.org</a> and by phone at 715-842-0988.

<h3 id="listen-up-tony-holiday">&ldquo;Listen Up: Tony Holiday&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media1.fdncms.com/memphisflyer/imager/u/feature/22695901/img_1211_1_.jpg" alt="img">
Tony Holiday just released his first single, “It’s Gonna Take Some Time,” from his debut album, Soul Service, but the album’s release-date party has been postponed because of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>For now, the 37-year-old blues harpist says he’s “staying inside, spending time with family. Trying to stay inside and do the thing.”</p>
<p>He’s happy doing “the thing” in Memphis.</p>
<p>Born in South Jordan, Utah, Holiday moved to Memphis about two years ago.</p>
<p>“I love Memphis,” he says. “Absolutely. I had been here. Played Rum Boogie on tour coming through and things like that.</p>
<p>“I know one thing: I was given some advice not to gig in this town when I first got here. Get to know the town instead of just showing up swinging.”</p>
<p>So, he didn’t get out and play clubs right off the bat. He loved all the great music, but, he says, “I was very poor ‘cause I took that advice. I wasn’t gigging. I didn’t have any money.”</p>
<p>He managed to eat. “I found in Memphis you can get two pieces of chicken, beans, and a piece of cornbread for two bucks at the Cash Saver by my house in Midtown at the time.”</p>
<p>He and his music partner, Landon Stone, “found all the great music at Wild Bill’s.”</p>
<p>That was all he needed for a while. “Between good music and cheap Southern food, I fell in love with Memphis right off the bat.”</p>
<p>Growing up in Utah, drawing cartoons and playing football and baseball were his passions. He also liked to listen to music. “I was always captivated by the country songs that my grandparents listened to. Like George Jones. Marty Robbins. Marty Robbins was big. Johnny Paycheck was big. And Willy and Waylon.”</p>
<p>Listening to those songs bring back great memories, Holiday says. “These songs painted big pictures in my head. It was like going into a movie or something. Like going to a little scene in my head when I’d hear these country songs. They were so well written.”</p>
<p>Recordings weren’t scarce at his home. “My mom was a big fan of the library. And she used to bring home music from the library. When I was 12 or 13, she brought home — for whatever reason — a B. B. King and Bobby Bland record. I think it was a B. B. King record and Bobby was just on it. That changed my life. Time stopped. And then all the clocks stopped on the wall.”</p>
<p>Why? “I could never tell you. Music brings a lot of colors to me. I see a lot of colors when I play and listen to it. Whatever it was, I can’t describe that sound when you hear that for the first time. The only thing I can think to describe it is fireworks and a massive color explosion.”</p>
<p>As for King, he says, “I just remember when I heard B. B. King, it was like, man, I could just relate to it a lot. Not the stories. I’ve nothing in common with B. B. King, really, but somehow through his music he finds a place for common ground for you. B. B. King did that. I just felt welcome.”</p>
<p>Holiday’s mom bought a guitar for him when he was 15. “There wasn’t any YouTube or anything. I taught myself. I just listened to records. And playing with them. I started out listening and playing with Doc Watson records.</p>
<p>”It’s funny. My grand pop plays guitar and my dad plays. And whenever we would pick with certain friends, I think some of the country singers would get mad at me for bending the strings, the notes, all crazy. Doc Watson was doing that. What I liked about him so much was he was kind of meeting everybody in the middle of country and blues.”</p>
<p>When he was 24, Holiday began playing guitar in his first band, Blueroot.</p>
<p>Tony Holiday and the Velvetones with Holiday on guitar and vocals was his next group. “We toured the whole country, coast to coast, for five years.”</p>
<p>Putting a name on their music style isn’t easy, Holiday says. “They might call it country blues or blues rock. It wasn’t traditional. Man, we toured a lot. We opened for a lot of people. Willie Nelson. Steve Miller.”</p>
<p>His stage attire fit the part. “I had a kick ass cowboy hat. And mutton chops that grew up from my mustache to my chops like Duane Allman. Slacks and pearl snap shirts. And always cowboy boots back then.”</p>
<p>In addition to touring, Holiday also moved to different places. “I was just skipping around meeting people and checking out different scenes and stuff.”</p>
<p>Another life changer occurred after Holiday had moved back to Utah. “I was basically living at this barbecue place and working there. I was cutting meat and they had live music. This sound came from the stage and I dropped everything. I’ll never forget. I sneaked down the hallway. I had on this apron covered with blood from cutting meat. I was trying to be elusive. Customers were in there. And there was a young clean-shaven John Nemeth singing and playing the harmonica.”</p>
<p>That did it. “The very next day I put my guitar up for sale and I went and bought as many harmónicas as I could get. And that’s where I am now. That was the day the music changed for me. The day I was able to see.”</p>
<p>And, he says, “I knew instantly I could speak through it.”</p>
<p>He bought a bunch of Marine band harmónicas in different keys. He learned to play the harmonica by listening to records and watching Adam Gussow and Ronnie Shellist on YouTube. “Just watching their videos.”</p>

<p>Holiday was signed to Vizztone Records and he put out his first album, Tony Holiday’s Porch Sessions in 2018. In addition to himself and Stone, also included on the critically-acclaimed album, which was nominated for best live recording of the year in 2019 by Blues Blast magazine, are Charlie Musselwhite, Bob Corritore, and John Primer. Holiday wanted to make the record so they could “bring blues back to the porch. It’s a place families used to — at the end of the day — cool off and get to know each other and play music together.</p>
<p>“I play on every track. But I feature those people coast-to-coast, porch-to-porch. That was my first record, really.”</p>
<p>It was Nemeth, who influenced Holiday to move to Memphis. “We were on his porch smoking some cigars and he said, ‘You’ve got to move to Memphis because there’s nothing cooler than a Memphis groove.”</p>
<p>Five months after Holiday moved to Memphis, he met Ori Naftaly of the Southern Avenue band. “He reached out to me. I got a message from him basically, ‘Welcome to Memphis.’ And that he’s watched what I was doing for a while. And if I was into the idea, he’d like to produce me. I said, ‘Yes.’ He was so awesome to work with.”</p>
<p>Naftaly produced Soul Service, which is Holiday’s debut solo album. The album includes a song, “Day Dates Turn into Night Dates,” which Holiday co-wrote with Nemeth.</p>
<p>click to enlarge</p>
<p>Holiday and Naftaly co-wrote the single, “It’s Gonna Take Some Time.”</p>
<p>“It’s about this singer that died a couple of years ago, Mike Ledbetter. I had just done a video vocal lesson with him the Sunday before he died. I wrote it for his music partner, Monster Mike Welch, because I knew it was going to take a lot of time for him to get through that.”</p>
<p>The album was set to be released April 24th at 3rd &amp; Court Diner. “Because of the COVID-19, the release got set to July 10th.”</p>
<p>So, how is Holiday spending quarantine? “I’m writing my next album. I’m calling a lot of friends. Doing a lot of video calls with family and friends. Just checking in with everybody.”</p>
<p>And, he says, he’s hanging out with his wife, Camille, and their daughter. “Spending a lot of time playing The Floor is Lava and building forts with my three-year-old, Bonnie Rae Holiday. We play this game where we pretend the floor is lava, so we have to put pillows on the floor and run around. We’re bare-footin&rsquo; around here.”</p>
