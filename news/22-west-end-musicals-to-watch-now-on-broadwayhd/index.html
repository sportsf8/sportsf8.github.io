<p>With theatres locked down, streaming platforms like BroadwayHD, Digital Theatre or Marquee.TV have come into their own – offering audiences a chance to witness old productions with high quality streams and excellent back catalogues. And if you want to do a hardcore theatre binge, there&rsquo;re are also free trials – BroadwayHD offers a week (tip: a calendar notification can mean you don&rsquo;t forget to cancel after seven days) while Marquee TV has a 30-day option.</p>
<p>There are oodles more than just simply musicals on BroadwayHD (we&rsquo;ve rounded up some of our favourite Shakespeare productions here) but below are some of our favourite showtune-laden productions. Thankfully, all of the shows are also captioned.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s great to watch shows, also think about ways to help the community during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Les Misérables</p>
<p>The 2010 concert show, staged at the O2 arena, was truly a historic moment for musical theatre. Relive the glory days back when you could fill a stadium safely.</p>
<p>42nd Street</p>
<p>Clare Halse in 42nd Street</p>
<p>© Dan Wooller for WhatsOnStage</p>
<p>The iconic show was the last to be staged at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane before its refurbishment and it is a magnificent watch – a huge cast serenading audiences with exquisite number after exquisite number. Clare Halse and Bonnie Langford star in this dance masterclass of a meta-musical.</p>
<p>Miss Saigon</p>
<p>The award-winning revival (which at the time broke WhatsOnStage Award records when it was on at the Prince Edward Theatre, is now available on BroadwayHD.</p>
<p>Love Never Dies</p>
<p>The epic Australian production with Ben Lewis and Anna O&rsquo;Byrne picks up where the original left off to describe what happens to the Phantom after Phantom. Some rather lush tunes.</p>
<p>Fame</p>
<p>The current UK tour production of Fame</p>
<p>© Tristram Kenton</p>
<p>They were on stage at the Peacock Theatre in 2019, but they&rsquo;re gonna live forever online – the hit production (which wrapped up its run recently) was captured for streaming during its London run. A chance to revel in some pumping tunes and energetic choreography.</p>
<p>Lady Day at Emerson&rsquo;s Bar and Grill</p>
<p>The legend that is Audra McDonald brings Billie Holiday to life in this special production that wowed West End audiences when it first ran.</p>
<p>Kinky Boots</p>
<p>Matt Henry (Lola) and Killian Donnelly (Charlie)</p>
<p>© Dan Wooller for WhatsOnStage</p>
<p>What else can we say about Kinky Boots – the beloved cult classic won our hearts when it was at the Adelphi, and seeing two leads Matt Henry and Killian Donnelly back for the recorded production is a nice touch. Shoe manufacture has never been the same since this show landed.</p>
<p>From Here To Eternity</p>
<p>Tim Rice&rsquo;s wartime musical ran in the West End for half a year and amassed a large following during that time – you can catch it here on BroadwayHD.</p>
<p>The King and I</p>
<p>Ken Watanabe and Kelli O&rsquo;Hara in The King and I</p>
<p>© Matthew Murphy</p>
<p>Bartlett Sher&rsquo;s enormous, vibrant production was a sell-out hit at The London Palladium, with leads Ken Watanabe, Kelli O&rsquo;Hara and Ruthie Ann Miles receiving heaps of praise for their performances.</p>
<p>The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall</p>
<p>The epic spectacular with Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess is now available to watch online – Phantom as you&rsquo;ve never seen it before!</p>
<p>An American in Paris</p>
<p>The cast of An American in Paris</p>
<p>© Johan Persson</p>
<p>Another dance-tacular show that lived on one of London&rsquo;s biggest stages, An American in Paris had a brilliant run at the Dominion Theatre, wowing with its 20-minute ballet sequence. Now that it&rsquo;s been recorded, they can&rsquo;t take that away from us!</p>
<p>Cats</p>
<p>The stage production of the show, with Elaine Paige, John Partridge and more, has made its way online.</p>
<p>Hetty Feather</p>
<p>Matt Costain as Jem and Phoebe Thomas as Hetty in Hetty Feather</p>
<p>© Donald Cooper</p>
<p>Jacqueline Wilson&rsquo;s novel was adapted for the stage by Emma Reeves and Sally Cookson, and went on a massive tour after its original run at the Rose Theatre Kingston. One to keep the whole family entertained, the show features acrobatics, aerial skills and whimsical tales.</p>
<p>Oklahoma!</p>
<p>Hugh Jackman</p>
<p>© David Gordon</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to rewind back to 1999 for this one – the Hugh Jackman, Josefina Gabrielle-led Oklahoma! is presented in all its glory on BroadwayHD. A chance to see Jackman just before he shot to stardom as Wolverine.</p>
<p>Ruthless the Musical</p>
<p>Tracie Bennett and Kim Maresca in Ruthless</p>
<p>© Alastair Muir</p>
<p>The new musical was a rip-roaring fun fest at the Arts Theatre, with a cast including the award-winning great Tracie Bennett, Harriet Thorpe and Jason Gardiner. Bennett and Thorpe would go on to repeat the same trick in Mame on tour last year.</p>
<p>The Toxic Avenger</p>
<p>The Toxic Avenger</p>
<p>© Claire Bilyard</p>
<p>The B-movie bonanza is borderline batty but also oodles of fun – it ran at the Arts Theatre after a UK premiere at Southwark Playhouse. A great show for kicking back and wallowing in stupendous fun, featuring a great big slime hero monster.</p>
<p>Into the Woods</p>
<p>The award-winning Open Air Theatre revival was recently added to the platform for anyone who&rsquo;s missed it, with Jenna Russell, Hannah Waddingham and more bringing Sondheim&rsquo;s extravagant show to life.</p>
<p>Funny Girl</p>
<p>Sheridan Smith leads the rollicking revival of the iconic musical in what is a side-splitting ride for all involved. You&rsquo;ll rarely find a show this fun! (Not available in the UK)</p>
<p>Billy Elliot Live</p>
<p>The Ruthie-Henshall-starring stage production has been immortalised in digital format – you only need a bit of Electricity (and a Wi-Fi connection) to watch it.</p>
<p>The Wind in the WIllows</p>
<p>Rufus Hound in The Wind in the Willows</p>
<p>© Helen Maybanks</p>
<p>The London Palladium production was being streamed for free earlier in the lockdown and while it&rsquo;s now pay-to-play, you can still catch the wonderful version of Kenneth Grahame&rsquo;s whimsical tales on BroadwayHD.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ Superstar</p>
<p>The epic 2012 stadium production, which veritably launched the career of Ben Forster, is now available to stream online.</p>
<p>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</p>
<p>Maria Friedman guides us through the glorious panoply of colours in Andrew Lloyd Webber&rsquo;s first real hit, which is still a firm family favourite.

<p>The exclusive four-city tour was originally scheduled to take place earlier this year but was sadly postponed due to venue closures following the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In My Life premiered at the Sydney Opera House in June 2019 and went on to tour Australia playing to packed houses and a slew of 5-star, rave reviews. The 2021 tour will play Leicester (12-13 March), Dublin (16 March), London (19 March), and Salford Quays (25 March).</p>

It’s so sad because when things are scary and sad, the theatre is always a pick-me-up and we have not been able to do that. The theatre opening again is something I can’t wait for. It is my breath. To perform and to watch, it gives me something nothing else does. I am thrilled to be doing this tour and having not performed for a while, I will have even more to give! It’s a very personal show that Is about life, loves and shows and it’s got a whole lot of heart. There’ll be stories to tell, songs to sing, I cannot wait to share this show with you and be back in a theatre.”
