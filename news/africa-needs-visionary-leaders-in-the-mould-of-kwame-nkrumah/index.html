<p>opinion</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the future on Africa Day, Africa needs leaders like Kwame Nkrumah - educated, understanding the international dimension, and passionate about using education as a useful instrument for the development of the African people.</p>
<p>One of the things that I miss during the Covid-19 national lockdown are my occasional visits to downtown Johannesburg. It is a vibrant place teeming with people selling clothing and all manner of paraphernalia from the rich African heritage. From beads, the ever-iconic Ndebele outfits and bangles to the opulent dresses of other ethnic groups, the place is the kaleidoscope of everything African. It reminds me of a day like today, 25 May, which is an important day on the calendar of the African people. It is Africa Day. This is the day we commemorate where we come from as Africans, where we are now and where we ought to go.</p>
<p>So, where do we come from? Africa is the cradle of humankind because this is the origin of human beings or more scientifically the origin of Homo sapiens. Africa has been a theatre of foreign invasion for a long time. From the destruction of the Egyptian civilisation by the Greeks and Romans, the&hellip;

General News of Monday, 11 May 2020</p>

<p>The story of the battle over Kwame Nkrumah&rsquo;s remains</p>
<p>On April 27, 1972, Kwame Nkrumah, the deposed President of Ghana and a great Pan-Africanist died in Bucharest, Romania after six years in exile in Guinea far away from his birthplace of Nkroful at the age of 62.</p>
<p>Kwame Nkrumah arrived in Conakry, Guinea after being invited by Sékou Touré just after the Military Coup that unconstitutionally ousted his Government from power.</p>
<p>The death of one of Africa’s most prominent personalities normally would have occasioned a dignified reaction from the two major parties concerned:</p>
<p>*President Sékou Touré of Guinea, who had granted Nkrumah political asylum in his country following the latter’s removal from power.</p>
<p>Colonel Ignatius Acheampong was at the time, the leader of the Ghana’s military regime which seized power from Prime minister, Kofi Busia in January 1972.</p>
<p>The two leaders then began a quarrel over the final resting-place of the ex-President’s remains.</p>
<p>Colonel Ignatius Acheampong on his part, desired that Kwame Nkrumah ’s body be returned to Ghana where, he said, the former President would be given a dignified burial.</p>
<p>Madam Elizabeth Nyaniba, aged mother of the deceased President, made an impassioned plea to President Sékou Touré to allow the body to be returned to Ghana: “I want to touch the body of my son before he is buried, or I die.”</p>
<p>She also indicated that she would like her son’s body embalmed and kept permanently on public display the way Lenin’s body is preserved.</p>
<p>Sékou Touré however would not consent, at least not until he had extracted from the Ghanaians important concessions which would redound to his personal profit.</p>
<p>And, since the Romanians had sent the body to Conakry, the Guineans were in a strong position to dictate terms.</p>
<p>Press reports shortly after Kwame Nkrumah’s death announced that Toure had attached four conditions to the return of the ex-President’s body to Ghana:</p>
<p>*Nkrumah’s complete rehabilitation in the eyes of the Ghanaian people (lifting all charges that had been pending against him).</p>
<p>*Liberation of all of Nkrumah’s partisans still held in Ghanaian jails.</p>
<p>*Removal of the threat of arrest which hung over all of Nkrumah’s followers who had chosen to remain with him in exile.</p>
<p>*An official welcome by the Ghanaian government of Nkrumah’s remains, with all the honors due a deceased chief of state.</p>
<p>On May 20, 1972, it was revealed that Touré had imposed even more conditions. He now insisted that Nkrumah’s tomb be placed in front of Ghana’s Parliament building, and that all of the men who had occupied ministerial appointments and high positions in his civil service be restored to their former posts.</p>
<p>Touré sought, in other words, to re-impose Nkrumah’s discredited government minus only Nkrumah on the Ghanaian people as the price for recovering the former President’s body.</p>
<p>Barring acceptance of these terms, Touré implied the body would be kept in Guinea. Not unexpectedly, Colonel Ignatius Acheampong refused to negotiate on such a basis and continued to urge the Guineans to allow the body to be brought back to Ghana.</p>
<p>Sékou Touré based Guinea’s right to keep Nkrumah’s body on Nkrumah’s having been granted asylum in Guinea and having been declared co-President of the Guinean Republic in 1966 when he was “betrayed” by the Ghanaian officers who overthrew him.</p>
<p>He claimed that Nkrumah had actually been co-President of Guinea as far back as 1958, when the two countries had formed the Guinea-Ghana Union.</p>
<p>He even insisted that this important decision which automatically made each man co-President of the other’s country, in addition to being head of his own state-had been officially communicated at the time to all the countries and to all the international organizations with which the Republic of Guinea had diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>Touré obstinately refused to assent to the pleas of Nkrumah’s family and the Ghanaian people, and to the demands of the Ghanaian government and press.</p>
<p>When Guinea’s leader appeared to have no moral justification for retaining Nkrumah’s body, African public opinion began criticizing Touré’s intransigence with increasing severity.</p>
<p>The Daily Nation of Nairobi, in an editorial titled “A Cruel Refusal,” stated:</p>
<p>Though he now denies it, President Sékou Touré is believed to have asked for the impossible before allowing Kwame Nkrumah ’s body to be taken to Ghana to be buried in his home town of Nkroful… The people of Ghana cannot be dictated to as to where Nkrumah’s mortal remains should be buried… Guinea should not fear loss of face. Facing realities is more important. It should reverse the decision and thus fulfill and honor a dead man’s wishes.</p>
<p>The Daily Times of Lagos editorialized:</p>
<p>President Sékou Touré should see reason to release the corpse as he had earlier promised… If he remains adamant, he would not be depriving the military Junta in Ghana of anything. It is the common people of Ghana who would be deprived of paying their final respects to their bereaved leader.</p>
<p>The quarrel, now attracting attention from the non-African press as well, continued unabated.</p>
<p>Finally, several African leaders, notably Presidents William Tolbert of Liberia, Siaka Stevens of Sierra Leone, and General Yakubu Gowon of Nigeria, tried to persuade Sékou Touré that it was in the best interests of African dignity, and Africa’s image abroad, that the body be returned to Ghana.</p>
<p>The West African press reported that Toure finally gave in to these appeals but this proved to be unfounded. As events were to show, Touré determined to squeeze every possible propaganda advantage from Nkrumah’s demise.</p>

<h3 id="kwame-nkrumah-ideological-institute-commends-african-union">&ldquo;Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute commends African Union&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.businessghana.com/site/img/../../cms/img/news/2020-05-11-2016231.jpg" alt="img">
The Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute (KNII), has commended the African Union (AU), for taking steps towards getting the African Center for Disease Control, to examine and determine the efficacy of COVID-19 Organics.</p>
<p>The COVID Organics, which is a herbal drink, recently discovered in Madagascar, has been announced by President Andry Rajoelina as a cure for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Dr. Benjamin Anyagre, Executive Director of the KNII, told the Ghana News Agency in an interview that the move by the AU was a laudable one saying, &ldquo;we hope the AU would continue to show interest in such initiatives, towards the growth of Africa for the benefit of not only the continent, but the entire world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the current global struggle to find a cure for COVID-19 proved, that it was crucial to encourage innovation from every part of the world, instead of looking up to only one group of people for ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>Dr Anyagre said the time had come for Africans to begin looking from within for solutions, as Madagascar had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We congratulate the people and government of Madagascar, as well as the AU for the bold move, and we are of the hope that such initiatives from Africa would be encouraged and not discouraged,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Anyagre said the discovery in Madagascar should make Africans bold to come out with what could help not only Africa, but the entire world.</p>
<p>He urged Africans to shake off the long held notion that efficient innovations only came from the West and said it was worth noting, that several great innovations in the world were originated by Africans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Africans should also be strong and supportive of each other, and also believe in ourselves towards the well-being of Africa and the entire global community,&rdquo; Dr. Anyagre said.</p>
<p>The KNII executive secretary encouraged the leadership of Africa to work hard towards strengthening the various systems and institutions on the continent, in order to ensure a largely self-sufficient people.</p>
<p>He said what mattered most, was for the continent to ensure that people with the right knowledge and expertise, took the lead in the continent&rsquo;s quest for true growth and self-realization.</p>
<p>President Andry Rajoelina of Madagascar, launched the drink in April and said it could prevent and cure COVID-19.</p>
<p>President Rajoelina explained that the drink would undergo clinical trials, whilst a number of African countries have also expressed interest in it.</p>
<p>Whilst efforts are being made globally to find a cure for COVID-19, a remedy is yet to be found against the disease, which has cowered the entire global community.

<h3 id="10-ways-in-which-the-african-union-betrayed-kwame-nkrumah-on-pan-africanism">&ldquo;10 Ways in which the African Union Betrayed Kwame Nkrumah on Pan-Africanism&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d7nm3c5ruslmy.cloudfront.net/africanexponent-com-client/images/94350338-308d-406b-8beb-4b48f3af1475-kwame-nkrumah_aspR_1.48_w592_h400_e.jpg" alt="img">
When the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was founded in 1963, Kwame Nkrumah said it aimed to ‘lay the foundations for a continental Union of African States’; critics argue that 57 years later, the organization has betrayed Nkrumah and become a tool of Neo-colonialism.</p>
<p>Ghana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah’s speech at the founding of the OAU on 24 May 1963 has been classified by many historians as one of the greatest speeches ever made. Standing before 31 African leaders in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, on 24 May 1963, Nkrumah pleaded with his colleagues to work towards creating a united Africa.</p>
<p>Many social observers claim that this speech and the events that followed highlights the treachery of the other African leaders - some of whom were agents of erstwhile colonial masters. Nkrumah will not only be deposed and overthrown as president of Ghana in 1966 by the National Liberation Council which under the supervision of international financial institutions, but would also live in exile in Conakry, Guinea until 1971 before his death in a Romanian hospital on 27 April 1972 at the age of 62.</p>
<p>The sad tale of Africa’s greatest statesman and independence hero gives credit to the theories that Nkrumah was betrayed by the majority of the other serving African heads of states. Critics from a different School of Thought, however, argue that it was difficult to come to the aid of Nkrumah considering his ideologies and how he handled opposition.</p>
<p>While we can continue to debate the role of the OAU on Nkrumah’s case, it is hard to credit the organization on how it has handled issues on Pan-Africanism and African unity – the founding ethos of the organization. It is on this rationale that many critics agree that the OAU (now African Union) has betrayed Kwame Nkrumah on Pan-Africanism and African Unity.</p>

<p>The African Union (AU) is a continental union consisting of 55 member states in Africa; it was established under the mandate of the OAU and assumed responsibility of its parent organization.</p>
<p>This article highlights ten actions (or inactions) by the African Union which critics say highlights the betrayal on Nkrumah’s idea of Pan-Africanism and credits the assertion that the organization has become a tool of Neo-colonialism.</p>
<ol>
<li>Changing Organization of African Unity (OAU) to the African Union (AU): Many critics continue to question the decision to change the OAU to AU. The AU came into being when two-thirds of the members of the former Organization of African Unity (OAU) signed the Constitutive Act in July 2001. The AU was formally launched in Durban South Africa in July 2002, replacing the OAU.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many social observers say the change was a way of wiping out the legacy of Kwame Nkruma and taking away the most important mandate from its name – AFRICAN UNITY. The Organization of African Unity was founded by Kwame Nkrumah and Haile Selassie.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Inaction in Democratic Republic Congo: Despite being the second-largest country in Africa and widely considered to be the richest country in the world regarding natural resources - its untapped deposits of raw minerals are estimated to be worth more than the U.S. $24 trillion, the Democratic Republic of Congo remains one of the poorest countries in the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite gaining independence in 1960, the country continues to be exploited by Belgium and other superpowers due to its large mineral deposits. Critics believe that the African Union needs to come to the aid of DR Congo, with the entire continent putting its weight behind the country to take over control of its resources.</p>
<p>Sadly, the African Union is doing nothing in this regard, and the country like many others like it in the continent remains poor and exploited despite its potentials.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Absence of a Mandate in Re-writing and Documenting African History: African history and culture are dying fast as more and more people tend to adopt western lifestyles and ideologies. One should have thought that the African Union would have a mandate that seeks to preserve the culture of peoples across the continent and document African history.</li>
</ol>
<p>Students still depend on foreign accounts on African history when we have millions of people on the continent who witnessed this history first hand. Many critics argue that the West has adulterated African history to suit their intent, and sadly so.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Claim on Western Sahara by Morocco: Western Sahara is a disputed territory on the northwest coast and in the Maghreb region of North and West Africa, partially controlled by the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic and partially occupied by neighboring Morocco. Its surface area amounts to 266,000 square kilometers.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s been more than 40 years since Morocco claimed sovereignty over Western Sahara, setting off a conflict that seems no closer to resolution. The African Union betrays its founding ethos by keeping silent on the matter rather than providing a solution, especially critics continue to accuse Morocco of exercising undue privilege over little Western Sahara and ‘colonizing’ the nation against its will.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Dependence on World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF): The founding fathers of the OAU never wanted Africa’s continued dependence on its colonial masters for survival.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the reasons for independence in the first place was for African to become independent and survive without having to eat off the feet of Europe and America. Today, the African Union is involved in borrowing from the World Bank and the IMF more than ever before. The debt status of African shows that no African nation is truly independent.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>China’s involvement in Africa: One thing that Kwame Nkrumah continuously told Africa to prepare itself for was Neo-Colonialism. He never stopped warning the continent to prepare itself for a different form of colonialism – indirect colonialism, which Nkrumah said is a more deadly form of colonialism.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no doubt that the activities of China in many parts of the continent are evidence that Kwame Nkrumah was not just a barking dog who wanted to rule Africa for life, he was right. Today, neocolonialism is alive and well in Africa, and sadly so.</p>
<p>More disheartening is the fact that the African Union since its establishment in 2002 has favored the advancement of China across Africa especially through the yearly China-Africa summit.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Ousting Dictators: When it comes to holding on to the seat of power, African leaders are perhaps the most skilled and experienced; even some of the most qualified and educated leaders have abused their credentials by continuing to hold on to power.</li>
</ol>
<p>It should be the duty of the African Union to make sure leaders respect the constitution and laws, especially when it comes to amending the constitution regarding power tenure. Many African leaders never want to leave the office and it is disheartening that in modern times such as this, individuals and families can continue to hold on to power despite the revolt from citizens.</p>
<p>Sadly, many of these leaders hold the reigns of affairs in the African Union.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Inaction towards African Unity: It is a thing of shame that despite almost six decades since the founding of the OAU, the continent has not succeeded in achieving African unity. In Nkrumah’s speech in 1963, he told African leaders without mincing words that “Africa must unite or perish”.</li>
</ol>
<p>It appears African leaders have chosen the latter. After 57 years, Africans are still battling with free-market policies, one currency adaptation, regional integration, etc. Africa remains one of the most disjointed continents in the world which battles with ethnic and border conflicts to date. If Nkrumah’s recipe of effort and determination is adopted, there is no denying that African unity would have reached a higher point.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>The Fall of State-Directed Economic Growth Strategy: Ghana&rsquo;s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, pursued a strategy of state-directed economic growth which involved countries deriving their wealth without foreign aid. To achieve this, Nkrumah required African leaders to produce and manufacture with their raw materials and trade amongst each other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso once attended an African leaders meeting where he told the world that no thread in his outfit or that worn by any of the members in his team came from Europe.</p>
<p>Today, the case is different. African nations are dependent on foreign revenue or aid to function, and the African Union seems unconcerned; the majority of the mandates by the African Union center on new ways to attract aid and assistance from abroad.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Relief and Distress Response: Kwame Nkrumah envisaged an Africa that would be its brother’s keeper; he wanted bigger nations to cater for the smaller and poorer nations with lesser resources. It is on record that during the Cocoa boom, which saw Ghana as one of the richest countries in the continent, Nkrumah assisted in many African nations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Critics have accused that African Union of not having a Fund which every member nation contributes to for the sole purpose of assisting poorer nations; they claim that rather than approach the World Bank or IMF for aid or loans, African Nations should approach the African Union instead, and the organization should be capable of accommodating the needs of African countries.</p>

<p>Kwame Nkrumah&rsquo;s hideout at Karimenga left to rot</p>
<p>On the hills of Karimenga in the North East Region of Ghana stands a two-bedroom apartment dilapidated and abandoned for reasons that cannot be told. It is believed to be the hideout of Ghana’s First President Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah.</p>
<p>Built with hard blocks and galvanized iron so many years ago, the building still appears strong with scruffy walls, warn out ceilings and broken Water Closets.</p>
<p>The building has a water reservoir and a detached structure is in the same condition as the main building.</p>
<p>Upon our visit to the community, we discovered through Godwin Wuni who is an opinion leader of the community that the building was a place of rest for Ghana’s first President Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah.</p>
<p>According to him, while the President was alive, he used the building anytime he visited the Upper East region.</p>
<p>With the kind of architecture, the President created an emergency exit behind his room where he could bolt in case some people came for his life.</p>
<p>Godwin Wuni told MyNewsGh.com that the existence of the building in the community brought hope to the people because Kwame Nkrumah provided them with a water reservoir where they could have access to potable water while the detached building was used as an office for Kasajan Quarry that employed many of the people in the community.</p>
<p>However, the building has been abandoned since the President’s death and although Tourism Authorities have on several occasions visited the facility, they are yet to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Currently, the building is surrounded by weeds and some portion of the building now serving as the hideout for smokers who smoke and defecate in the edifice.</p>
<p>For Godwin, a renovation of the building will help improve the fortunes of the community since it will bring in foreign exchange and also provide some level of employment for the people.</p>
<p>With Ghana’s huge investment in the Year of Return and huge investment in “Destination Ghana”, a look at this facility could also go a long way in boosting the tourism sector in the North East region of the country.</p>
<p>Karimenga is a farming community located a few meters drive from the Upper East regional capital, Bolgatanga. The people here depend on subsistence farming with hardly any proper commercial activity going on.</p>
<p>The Community has one basic which ends at Primary six and pupils so pupils who would want to continue their basic education will have to walk to an adjoining community to further their education.</p>

<p><img src="https://macaubusiness.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mb-logo@2x.png" alt="img">
At least 60 rig workers on the Jubilee oil production field offshore Ghana have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, international oil firm Tullow which operates the field has said in a statement.</p>
<p>“As part of contact tracing, GHS (Ghana Health Service) tested personnel on board contractor support vessel CSV Lancelot and has confirmed that 57 of the 200 personnel tested positive for COVID-19. All affected people are being brought onshore for isolation and case management,” the statement said.</p>
<p>It said two of the cases were reported by the oil firm earlier on Tuesday, while contact tracing led to one additional case on the production vessel FPSO Kwame Nkrumah.</p>
<p>The company said it is enforcing enhanced social distancing on both vessels, with a permanent restriction of movement between the two vessels to minimize any potential for the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana has increased to 7,768 as of Sunday morning, according to the Africa CDC data.

<p>This is how Accra’s flour queen Rebecca Aryeetey financed a party to gain Ghana’s freedom</p>
<p>Rebecca Naa Dedei Aryeetey via pinaxonline.com</p>
<p>Although brilliant and a master strategist, Ghana’s first prime minister and president Kwame Nkrumah emerging from an impoverished background lacked funds to execute campaigns in his battles with the colonial British government for self-rule for the locals.</p>
<p>Rebecca Naa Dedei Aryeetey also known as Dedei Ashikishan was on the other hand an entrepreneur and political activist, who became a chief financier of the Convention People’s Party (CPP) – the party formed by Nkrumah after breaking away from the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC).</p>
<p>By age 30, Aryeetey was a business tycoon and crucially the flour queen in Accra, wealthy enough to own a huge house in Kokomlemle, a suburb of the capital, Accra. She earned her ‘Ashikishan’ nickname, which is flour in the Ga language thanks to the product she traded in.</p>
<p>She was influential, being the leader of the Market Mammies (Mothers) Association. Aryeetey was born in 1924 to father Ataa Ayite, who hailed from Ga (Asere) and Osu. Her paternal grandma Ama Richter hailed from Osu. Although she had basic education, she went straight into the flour business afterwards. She grew up in Ga (James Town British Accra).</p>
<p>The queen of the flour business in Accra campaigned and funded Nkrumah to win the Accra Central seat. Many reckon had Nkrumah lost that seat, he would never have become the Prime Minister of Ghana.</p>
<p>Market women served as the backbone of CPP in Accra thanks to Komla Agbeli Gbedemah, who mobilized them with Aryeetey leading the pack so that when Nkrumah was released from jail in 1951, having won the 1951 Gold Coast legislative election, there was a core group of supporters ready for him. She is said to have campaigned and funded Nkrumah against her own kinsman Odarkwei Obetsebi-Lamptey of the UGCC.</p>
<p>Aryeetey identified with Nkrumah’s vision and ideals for the country and people so poured money into CPP and as her financial contribution increased so was her influence in the party. Her closeness to Nkrumah was not favored by all. While in Nkrumah’s company in 1960 at a CPP party function in Ho, she got served with tea and passed on later after complaining of stomach pains.</p>
<p>Nkrumah was inconsolable at her funeral, according to reports. Eyebrows were raised when no postmortem was carried out to officially ascertain the cause of her death, despite her stature in the party.</p>
<p>The 50 pesewas coin as well as national stamp was reportedly issued in her memory while double-decker buses introduced in Accra, locally referred to as Auntie Dedei is apparently in reference to her.</p>
