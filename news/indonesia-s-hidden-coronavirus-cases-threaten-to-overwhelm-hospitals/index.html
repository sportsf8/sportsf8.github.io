It was just last month that Indonesia’s coronavirus cases stood at zero, with officials fiercely rejecting suggestions that infections were spreading undetected.</p>
<p>Weeks later, 78 fatalities have now been linked to the virus, the highest number in south-east Asia. Seven health workers are among those who have died.</p>
<p>While confirmed case have risen to almost 900, researchers have estimated that there could be tens of thousands of hidden infections across the country, and there is growing concern that medical facilities will be unable to cope in the event of a major outbreak.</p>
<p>Over the past week, two major hospitals have appealed for supplies, while some healthworkers threatened to go on strike after they were forced to wear raincoats for protection. As of Monday, as many as 42 medical staff were infected with coronavirus in Jakarta.</p>
<p>“I just pray and have faith so that I can stop worrying, even though sometimes that feeling (of worry) appears again,” Agnes Tri Harjaningrum, a paediatrician who works in state and private hospitals in the capital, told the Guardian. She fears the country could face a crisis similar to that experienced in Italy.</p>
<p>Donations of protective equipment and testing kits arrived from China on Monday morning, but by Tuesday night shortages remained in some of Jakarta’s hospital wards. Equipment is being prioritised for doctors who are directly handling patients, she said.</p>
<p>Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, was slow to carry out tests, having reportedly performed only a few hundred earlier this month. While cases were detected throughout February in most countries across south-east Asia, it was not until 2 March that the country of 264 million people confirmed its first infections. A study by Harvard University, which analysed air traffic from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, had raised questions over the country’s previous lack of cases. The health minister responded at the time by describing the analysis as “insulting” and stating the country was on high alert.</p>
<p>The president has since acknowleged the need for mass testing, which is being ramped up in priority areas. So far 2,863 have been tested.</p>
<p>On Monday, it was estimated by academics at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That could mean there are more than 34,000 cases. This is higher than the roughly 27,000 recorded in Iran – though the researchers also estimate that Iran may be identifying as little as 7.2% of its patients.</p>
<p>The researchers emphasise that these are rough estimates based on preliminary analysis and it is not yet peer reviewed.</p>
<p>There are some limitiations to the estimates. How a country’s demographics might affect the death toll from Covid-19, for example, has not yet been factored into the study. “Severity [of covid] is highly correlated with age, which means we need to account for it for it to be more accurate,” said Dr Timothy Russell, the lead author. With a median age of 28, Indonesia’s population is younger than many other affected countries.</p>
<p>According to official figures, the capital Jakarta, home to 9.6 million people, is among the worst hit, with hundreds of cases, while dozens of infections have also appeared in Banten and West Java.</p>
<p>Cases appear to be scattering. In West Papua, the easternmost province of Indonesia, three cases have been confirmed while 35 people have been put under surveillance because they have symptoms including pneumonia and have had contact with a confirmed patient.</p>
<p>Access to quality health care is limited in the province, especially in highland areas, and health workers are currently assessing patients online because of equipment shortages.</p>
<p>Analysis by Reuters suggests that the country’s health system is significantly less well resourced than that of Italy or South Korea, which have both faced major outbreaks.</p>
<p>Indonesia has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data, which is equal to about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>In 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.</p>
<p>Indonesia is converting the athlete’s village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital, which it is hoped will be able to treat 24,000 patients.</p>
<p>Modelling by the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit (EOCRU), reported by the Jakarta Post, has suggested that, without tough steps to contain the virus, there could be up to 71,000 infections by the end of April.</p>
<p>Jakarta’s governor has declared a state of emergency, and told businesses and religious groups to take measures to stop the spread of the virus. All tourism and entertainment venues have been closed, and public transport limited.</p>
<p>But while various lockdowns have been imposed in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, Indonesian president Joko Widodo has rejected calls for such measures. He has instead urged the public to stay at home and promised rapid testing. This is now being rolled out in three provinces, while 100,000 protective gears are also being distributed.</p>
<p>Zubairi Djoerban, head of the Indonesian Doctors Association coronavirus task force told the Guardian earlier this week that supplies will be distributed soon. “Private sector will help, businessmen will help.</p>
<p>“But in the field, please &hellip; the management must [match the] pandemic, meaning that it must be quickly-quickly-quickly-quickly.”

<p>The number of coronavirus cases is closing in on half a million worldwide. More than 472,000 have been sickened and 21,000 have died from the virus, and the areas most deeply in crisis keep shifting. Spain now has more coronavirus deaths than China , second only to Italy. Japan and New Zealand have recorded their largest single-day spikes in diagnoses. Coronavirus has also reached the UK&rsquo;s royal family, which announced that 71-year-old Prince Charles, next in line to the throne, has tested positive . In the US, an epidemiologist says virus deaths could reach their peak in three weeks . The American epicenter of the outbreak is New York City, where the number cases is doubling about every three days. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper has ordered a 60-day freeze on all troop movements overseas to prevent the spread of the virus. Follow the latest updates here.</p>

<p>Florida&rsquo;s attorney general&rsquo;s office is investigating claims that Norwegian Cruise Line downplayed and dismissed coronavirus risks when communicating with customers. According to a Miami New Times story based on leaked internal emails, Norwegian provided its sales force with inaccurate or misleading one-liners, like, &ldquo;The only thing you need to worry about for your cruise is do you have enough sunscreen.&rdquo; Norwegian told the newspaper it&rsquo;s &ldquo;committed to operating with integrity&rdquo; and is looking into the matter. Norwegian is among more than 50 cruise lines that have suspended operations to and from US ports because of the coronavirus pandemic. There are still dozens of cruise ships adrift at sea with no place to disembark amid the crisis. A Holland America ship with at least 77 sick passengers is expected to dock in Florida next week.</p>

<li>Great Barrier Reef</li>
</ol>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s Great Barrier Reef likely experienced its most widespread bleaching event on record , which could be a devastating blow to the already at-risk marine site. Bleaching happens when coral &ndash; which are living things &ndash; expel the algae that live in them as a stress response to warmer water. This greatly damages and often kills the coral over time. Scientists say the rapid warming of the planet and its oceans are to blame for these events. This marks the third mass bleaching event on the reef in just the last five years, and the last two ended up killing about half the reef&rsquo;s coral. The organisms can survive, if water temperatures go back down. Since this likely won&rsquo;t happen, scientists are greatly concerned for the reef&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p>Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition The best ways to cook veggies to maximize nutrition – What&rsquo;s the best way to cook your veggies to maximize their nutritional value? While methods like steaming are better than boiling, the answer depends on the vegetable. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition Steaming is best, especially for broccoli – As a general rule, keep cooking time, temperature and the amount of liquid to a minimum when cooking vegetables. That&rsquo;s why steaming is one of the best ways to maximize nutrients. It turns out that&rsquo;s especially true for broccoli. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition Microwaving is also a winner – When in doubt, microwave. That&rsquo;s because microwaving uses little to no water, and can heat the vegetable quickly, thus preserving nutrients such as vitamin C that break down when heated. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition Saute, don&rsquo;t fry – Sauteing in a bit of healthy cooking oil, such as extra-virgin olive oil, is a great way to cook many vegetables. Not only does it maximize flavor, but the addition of olive oil &ldquo;appears to increase the absorption of phytonutrients like phenols and carotenes,&rdquo; says Elaine Magee, author and corporate dietitian for Albertsons Companies. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition Roasting and baking – Roasting and baking is another healthy way to fix your vegetables. Again, adding some healthy fat such as olive oil is a great idea, Magee said, as many of the vitamins and nutrients in vegetables are fat soluble, meaning your body absorbs them better in the presence of fat. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition &lsquo;Griddling&rsquo; is great – Contrary to grilling, which normally involves some sort of charcoal, &ldquo;griddling&rdquo; uses a pan with distinctive raised edges and is normally done on the stove or in the oven.</p>
<p>Vegetables such as asparagus, griddled with a tiny bit of olive oil, can develop intense flavor and be quite healthy. It&rsquo;s also an especially good choice for green beans, broccoli, celery, Swiss chard and onions. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition It&rsquo;s no surprise that boiling ends up on the bottom of the vegetable nutritional preparation pile, because studies have shown for years the process leaches nutrients into the water. (That&rsquo;s OK if you&rsquo;re eating the broth with the veggies.) One exception: Carrots. Boiling and steaming i ncrease the levels of beta carotene. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition Wait to wash – To preserve water-soluble vitamins and minerals, wait to wash until right before you cut. You want those nutrients to stay locked in. Avoid soaking your vegetables, as that can remove key nutrients, such as vitamin C. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition To cut or not to cut? – Cooking vegetables whole preserves the water-soluble vitamins and nutrients. When that&rsquo;s not practical, be sure to cut them into large, uniform pieces that will cook evenly. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: The best ways to cook veggies to boost nutrition Cut, cook and use olive oil – Studies show that cutting and heating tomatoes opens up the cell wall of the fruit , which allows greater access to the health benefits of lycopene. Adding a bit of healthy fat, such as olive oil, also helps. Hide Caption 10 of 10</p>

<h3 id="video-reveals-lung-damage-in-us-coronavirus-patient-people-need-to-take-this-seriously">Video reveals lung damage in US coronavirus patient: &lsquo;People need to take this seriously&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200325000535-covid-19-lung-damage-video-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) A video shows the lungs of a man who had been asymptomatic a few days earlier.</p>
<p>Now, the patient has Covid-19 and his lungs are failing to function properly, said Dr. Keith Mortman, the chief of thoracic surgery at George Washington University Hospital. The Washington, D.C., hospital recently released a 3D video of the coronavirus patient&rsquo;s lungs.</p>
<p>The imagery shows extensive damage to the lungs of a generally healthy 59-year-old male with high blood pressure, Mortman said. Since becoming seriously ill, the patient requires a ventilator to help him breathe, but even on the highest setting, it&rsquo;s not enough. He also needs another machine that circulates and then oxygenates his blood, Mortman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a 70, 80-year-old immunosuppressed, diabetic patient,&rdquo; Mortman said. &ldquo;Other than high blood pressure, he has no other significant medical issues. This is a guy who&rsquo;s minding his own business and gets it &hellip; If we were to repeat the 360VR images now, that is one week later, there is a chance that the infection and inflammatory process could be worse.&rdquo;</p>

From the scan, it is clear that the damage isn&rsquo;t localized to a single area, but instead covers massive swaths of both lungs, showing how rapidly and aggressively the infection can take hold, even in younger patients. A patient with healthy lungs would have no yellow on the scan, he said.</p>
