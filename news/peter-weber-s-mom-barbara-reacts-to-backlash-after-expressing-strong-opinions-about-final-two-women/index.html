Peter Weber's mom stole the show on Monday night's dramatic first installment of the Bachelor finale.

Peter introduced his two final picks, Madison and Hannah Ann, to his family during the episode and his mother didn't hold back in telling the Bachelor exactly who he should choose.

Since the episode aired Barbara has been hit with backlash from Bachelor Nation fans. But the mother-of-two revealed on social media on Tuesday that she's not letting it get to her.

Peter Weber's mom Barbara doesn't care about the backlash after Monday's episode of The Bachelor where she had very strong opinions about who he should choose

Peter introduced his two final picks, Madison and Hannah Ann (pictured), to his family during the episode and his mother didn't hold back expressing she liked Hannah Ann the most

Fans of the ABC show left a barrage of comments on Barbara's most recent Instagram post and she took a moment to respond to someone who defended her.

The user wrote: 'Can people please leave her alone! Barb, I think you did the right thing,'

Barbara replied, 'Thanks but I ignore all negatives!!'

Madison Prewett ended up breaking up with Peter and leaving the show after her disastrous meeting with his parents.

After meeting her son's two favorites in Monday's episode, Barbara made it clear she wanted Peter, 28, to be with Hannah Ann Sluss.

'I ignore all negatives!!' Barbara replied to someone who defended her in the comments of her latest post

Barbara referred to Hannah Ann as an 'angel on earth' after meeting the two women.

'[Madison’s] not there for you, bud,' Barbara told Peter. 'But bud, you know what, I have to tell you something. I said a prayer last night. I said, "Lord, please, please guide Peter today and guide Madison to see where they’re at in this relationship," because you have a gem waiting for you who is madly, head over heels in love with you, and God put her there for you. I think God has answered my prayers and put the right person in your path.'

However, it may not be as clean cut as it seems, as a preview of the show's final episode shows Madison appear again after confessing regret over her decision.

Peter had been torn from the moment the cast arrived in Alice Springs, Australia, where he met up with his parents and told them how hard it had been to choose between the women.

Part two of the Bachelor finale airs on ABC Tuesday 8pm ET.

The parents: Barbara and Peter Weber Sr were charmed by Hannah Ann
