<h3 id="cal-baseball-alum-andrew-vaughn-trying-to-stay-ready-in-arizona">&ldquo;Cal baseball alum Andrew Vaughn trying to stay ready in Arizona&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/12/13/76/19447692/5/rawImage.jpg" alt="img">
Baseball, like much of the rest of society, has been idled for more than two months because of the coronavirus pandemic. Andrew Vaughn, like most everyone else, has tried to adapt and adjust.</p>
<p>“You definitely learn a lot about yourself,” Vaughn said in a recent phone interview. “You learn what you have to do when you have minimal resources. It’s definitely tough. Just kind of figuring out how to keep busy and stay active.”</p>
<p>The White Sox took Vaughn from Cal with the third overall pick in last year’s draft. He spent time at three minor-league levels in 2019, hitting a combined .278 with six homers in 205 at-bats.</p>
<p>The first baseman put together a decorated career with the Bears, highlighted by him winning the Golden Spikes Award, given to the nation’s top amateur player, as a sophomore in 2018. He also was a finalist for the award last year.</p>
<p>Vaughn is living with his girlfriend, Lexi Hickman, in a house in Litchfield Park, Ariz., near Glendale, where the White Sox have their spring training facility.</p>
<p>To stay in shape, Vaughn goes for runs, swims in his backyard pool and does push-ups and sit-ups. When he gets his exercise “depends on the heat,” he said. “It’s either getting it done early or getting it done late in the afternoon.”</p>
<p>Vaughn had been getting it done in spring training, when he was an invitee to big-league camp. In 13 Cactus League games, he went 7-for-23 (.304) with a homer.</p>
<p>His impressions from the initial taste of major-league spring training?</p>
<p>“The biggest takeaway is that I just told myself that I had to go out there and just play ball the way I know how,” Vaughn said. “It’s the big leagues, and everybody kind of thinks about it, like, ‘Oh, it’s a totally different game. It’s so much different.’”</p>
<p>Vaughn played his freshman season for the Bears under head coach David Esquer (now Stanford’s head coach) and his final two seasons under Mike Neu.</p>
<p>“I talked to Mike a couple of days ago,” Vaughn said. “He was so influential because he’s been there.”</p>
<p>Neu pitched in 32 games as a reliever for the A’s in 2003 and one game for the Marlins in ’04.</p>
<p>“Whenever I talked to him,” Vaughn said, “he would just tell me his experience and what there is to expect and kind of how he went about his business and how I could go about (mine). It was definitely nice having him in my corner.”</p>
<p>Neu, who had been Esquer’s pitching coach at Cal from 2012 through ’15, recruited Vaughn from Santa Rosa’s Maria Carrillo High.</p>
<p>Said Neu: “We just established a really good relationship. … I’m happy to help him, but I think he’s at a point where he’s done pretty well for himself doing what he does.”</p>
<p>What Vaughn did with the Bears was historic. In three seasons, he batted .374 with 50 homers. He became the highest-drafted player in school history.</p>
<p>Neu said that during the ’19 season, “I was really just trying at times to just soak it in with him, even taking batting practice or hitting in the cages, because you’re like, ‘Man, it’s pretty cool that you get to see a guy of this caliber every day and see what he does.’”</p>
<p>Vaughn, who bats right-handed, is the rare hitter who combines power with an excellent knowledge of the strike zone. He had 123 walks and 75 strikeouts in his Cal career. Neu noted this almost preposterous stat in Vaughn’s Golden Spikes Award-winning season of 2018: He had more homers (23) than strikeouts (18).</p>
<p>“He was as good as anybody could possibly be at this level,” Neu said. “Obviously, he’s got another level that he’s got to produce at, but at the college level, I would say it’s impossible to be better.”</p>
<p>When Vaughn will be able to get better at the pro level is, obviously, unknown. There’s a significant possibility the entire minor-league season will be canceled. There has been talk of the major-league season beginning around July Fourth, with teams having 50-man rosters, including 20-man taxi squads.</p>
<p>Vaughn takes it all with a few grains of salt.</p>
<p>“There’s really nothing to believe until something actually happens,” he said.</p>

<p>When something actually does happen, Vaughn plans to be prepared.</p>
<p>“I have to stay mentally driven,” he said, “knowing that there’s something in the future for baseball, and I just have to wait and see what it holds. I just have to stay ready. I just have to tell myself that I know that one day we are going to get back on that field.</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of when.”</p>

<h3 id="cbs-sports-predicts-cal-to-finish-11-1-this-year">&ldquo;CBS Sports predicts Cal to finish 11-1 this year&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZfa8T3J1Ek3jytjs1RBkJBzsn0=/0x66:5000x2684/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19940187/1190922672.jpg.jpg" alt="img">
It’s important to note right off the bat, I am very fond of the California Golden Bears football team for the 2020 season. I like Chase Garbers, and I really like the duo in the secondary. I even outlined the fact that there could be a ton of talent on this roster that has next-level chance.</p>
<p>Again, it’s important to note that I am fond of the California Golden Bears football team for 2020.</p>
<p>I am, however, not at all in a position to say that they can go 11-1 and challenge Oregon or USC for the Pac-12 title in 2020.</p>
<p>That is just what CBS Sports did, though.</p>
<p>In their recent ‘Pac-12 wins predictions’ piece by David Cobb, Cal is predicted to win the Pac-12 North with an 11-1 (8-1) record. Their full win-loss record even includes a prediction of a loss at the hands of USC, not Oregon, Washington, Arizona State, Utah or even Washington State — but USC.</p>
<p>We’ll get more to the full writeup on the Golden Bears, but I wanted to outline their other predictions before going too far.</p>
<p>They started it off by explaining how their predictions are done:</p>
<p>Predictions are based on talent returning, coaching turnover and recent recruiting success, among other factors. In some cases, the location of a game played a role in the prediction of who will win.</p>
<p>And with that, here’s how the conference is going to pan out in this prediction:</p>
<p>Pac-12 North</p>
<p>Cal: 11-1 (8-1)</p>
<p>Oregon: 10-2 (8-1)</p>
<p>Washington: 8-4 (6-3)</p>
<p>Stanford: 6-6 (4-5)</p>
<p>Oregon State: 5-7 (3-6)</p>
<p>Washington State: 3-9 (1-8)</p>
<p>Pac-12 South</p>
<p>USC: 10-2 (8-1)</p>
<p>Arizona State: 7-5 (5-4)</p>
<p>Utah: 8-4 (5-4)</p>
<p>UCLA: 6-6 (3-6)</p>
<p>Arizona: 4-8 (2-7)</p>
<p>Colorado: 3-9 (1-8)</p>
<p>There it is. The prediction for all 12 teams in the conference. Now, let’s get into the Cal part.</p>
<p>Wins: UNLV, TCU, Cal Poly, Utah, at Washington State, Oregon, at Oregon State, Washington, at Arizona State, Stanford, UCLA Losses: at USC Analysis: The Bears closed the 2019 season on a three-game winning streak with sophomore quarterback Chase Garbers slinging touchdowns and the defense playing some of its best football of the season. Now after three straight years of improvement under Justin Wilcox, Cal is poised for a breakout year. The Bears return more starters than any other team in the league and are giving an offense that struggled when Garbers was hurt last season a reboot under long-time NFL offense coordinator Bill Musgrave. The schedule is favorable, too, as the Bears play Utah, Oregon and Washington at home. A mid-season home showdown against the Ducks looms large as a potential swing game in the race for a division title.</p>
<p>Again, I am fond of this team. I am not 11 wins fond of a team’s success that is predicated so much on Chase Garbers’ success and health. Eleven wins in college football is tough to get to, especially in the Pac-12. I mean, come on, even Oregon’s talent-loaded team from last year had to use postseason play to get to 11 wins and they had the country’s best offensive line, a top-6 quarterback and an incredibly talented defense.</p>
<p>I don’t see 11 wins in the regular season from just about any one team in the conference and certainly not here, but that’s not even a slight towards the Bears. This conference is likely as close as it’s been in recent memory, in terms of preseason projections. But even still, I don’t see 11 wins.</p>
<p>How about you?

<p><img src="https://estaticos.elperiodico.com/resources/jpg/4/4/zentauroepp48922311-italian-mep-david-maria-sassoli-group-reacts-after-bei200525204818-1590432682644.jpg" alt="img">
Vincent Kessler</p>
<p>En poc més de 24 hores la Comissió Europea presenta la seva proposta de marc financer plurianual per al període 2021-2027 (MFF) i el nou fons de recuperació promès per la UE per impulsar l’economia europea després de la crisi de la Covid-19. Un paquet pressupostari que el president del Parlament Europeu, David Sassoli, confia que serà més generós que el fons plantejat per París i Berlín, de 500.000 milions, i que arribarà «amb prou diners» per arrencar «adequadament», assegura en una entrevista amb EL PERIÓDICO i altres mitjans de comunicació europeus en la qual apressa els anomenats ‘països frugals’ a deixar de banda la seva «miopia» i recolzar els països més afectats per la pandèmia.</p>
<p>-Àustria, Dinamarca, Suècia i els Països Baixos, els anomenats ‘frugals’, rebutgen un fons de recuperació amb transferències i proposen préstecs i un marc pressupostari per al període 2021-2027 limitat. ¿Veu possible trobar un compromís i esquivar el seu veto?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>¿Podem aturar la democràcia simplement perquè el dret de veto posa contínuament en qüestió els nostres mecanismes de discussió? Jo crec que no i per això apel·lo la responsabilitat dels països que han objeccions. Això no és un debat entre els països frugals i els països que malgasten, sinó més aviat dels països que han entès la gravetat dels desafiaments i els que no ho han fet. He de recordar que alguns dels països amb objeccions són dels països que més i millor utilitzen el mercat europeu que espero que sigui prou motivació per afrontar aquest desafiament. Si no, Europa avançarà a diferents velocitats. Espero que això no passi i que en les pròximes setmanes prossegueixi el treball per trobar un consens. .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>¿És suficient la proposta francoalemanya de 500.000 milions? ¿El Parlament Europeu bloquejaria qualsevol iniciativa si només inclou préstecs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tenim una proposta feta per dos dels grans països d’Europa, uns dels quals també és a punt d’assumir la presidència de la Unió Europea (Alemanya). És una proposta interessant però ens agradaria una cosa encara més ambiciosa. Tan ambiciosa com sigui possible. Creiem que la Comissió serà encara més ambiciosa del que hem sentit fins ara de França i Alemanya.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Però ¿rebutjarien una proposta només amb préstecs?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-Ho hem dit repetidament. Fins i tot (Angela) Merkel i (Emmanuel) Macron ho han dit i ho hem escoltat de diversos caps d’estat i govern. No n’hi hauria prou. Els desequilibris provocats per la pandèmia no són els mateixos a tot arreu. L’important és recolzar fermament la recuperació dels països amb més problemes. Seria molt miop imaginar que un país podria tirar endavant deixant enrere d’altres enrere o perjudicant-los. Seria absurd pensar que algú es pot salvar deixant els altres amb dificultats. El que hem de fer és sortir-nos-en junts, amb un mercat europeu més fort després de la crisi. Estem en una democràcia i és útil escoltar les opinions dels altres, però al final fins i tot ells entendran la importància d’ajudar els països i els mercats dels que tenen més problemes. Els països del sud són un enorme mercat per als països del nord d’Europa. Els ciutadans ho saben bé, però les empreses encara ho saben millor.</p>
<p>-Sobre el nou marc financer plurianual, si la Comissió Europea presenta un pressupost de l’1,07% del PIB, ¿seria acceptable per a l’Eurocambra?</p>
<p>-No podem prendre una posició en aquest moment perquè encara no està clar de quins números estem parlant. Cal recordar el que la Comissió Europea ja va proposar en el passat (1,114% del PIB). Anar per sota d’això posaria el Parlament Europeu contra la paret i no ens agradaria. Per això el pla de recuperació i el MFF s’han de presentar junts perquè tinguem una idea de les xifres globals.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>¿Què pensa de la proposta de deute perpetu de Pedro Sánchez? ¿Pot ser la solució al debat entre el nord i sud?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>És una molt bona idea, molt útil, per acompanyar la reflexió de la comissió. Pot ser un instrument molt útil segur. No obstant, el més important és que el deute es converteix en deute comú, que sigui un deute mutualitzat. La proposta francoalemanya aborda aquest aspecte i va més enllà. Estem molt satisfets de pensar que tenen la intenció de compartir el deute d’aquesta manera. Sempre hem dit que és important utilitzar tots els instruments, inclosos els bons emesos en els mercats financers, per finançar millor les nostres economies. Necessitem una cosa semblant a un nou pla Marshall per a Europa. Fa 70 anys algú va haver de pagar el pla per nosaltres. Avui som nosaltres els que hem de pagar la factura d’aquest pla, sigui quin sigui, i aquesta és una gran diferència amb el passat. Per tant, hem d’utilitzar tot el que estigui a la nostra disposició per augmentar els nostres recursos i les nostres possibilitats i capacitats. És l’única manera correcta de fer-ho.

<h3 id="sweet-magnolias-star-justin-bruening-breaks-down-cal--maddies-spark">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sweet Magnolias&rsquo; Star Justin Bruening Breaks Down Cal &amp; Maddie&rsquo;s Spark&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cal-maddie-sweet-magnolias-1014x570.jpg" alt="img">
He played a doctor on All My Children and a paramedic on Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy. Now Justin Bruening is getting into the swing of things as a baseball coach on Netflix&rsquo;s 10-episode drama Sweet Magnolias, based on the novels of the same name by Sheryl Woods.</p>
<p>The series stars JoAnna Garcia Swisher (Reba) as Maddie, Brooke Elliott (Drop Dead Diva) as Dana Sue, and Heather Headley (Chicago Med) as Helen. The women, best friends from high school, support each other through the many challenges of life. One challenge Maddie is facing: she&rsquo;s getting a divorce from husband Bill (Chris Klein), but also finds another chance at romance courtesy of her son’s coach, Cal Maddox, played by Bruening.</p>
<p>TV Insider chatted with the amicable Bruening about what attracted him to the role of Cal, his run as Matthew Taylor on Grey’s, his time in Pine Valley playing Jamie, the son of AMC legends Michael E. Knight (Tad) and Julia Barr (Brooke), and more!</p>
<p>I promise not to accidentally write &lsquo;Steel&rsquo; Magnolias in my copy.</p>
<p>Justin Bruening: I have a funny story about that. I said to my wife, Alexa [Havens, Babe, AMC] that I was offered this part in Sweet Magnolias. She said, &lsquo;Steel Magnolias?&rsquo; I said, ‘Yeah, that must be it.’ I went on iTunes, downloaded Steel Magnolias, and watched it. [Chuckles] I thought, this is not the same project I’m doing.</p>
<p>When I think of Netflix, I think of edgy series, but the tone of Sweet Magnolias has a family-friendly feel to it.</p>
<p>I think what [Netflix] wants is to have a show for everybody. Our show is one in a newer division that focuses on family-friendly stuff. There’s still a little bit of that Netflix edge, just not as much as on their other shows.</p>
<p>JoAnna’s character is attracted to her son’s high school coach, played by you.</p>
<p>Yes. Jo’s character is going through a phase of her life. She’s getting a divorce. Fate intervenes. It just so happens that [it’s with] her son’s baseball coach. She’s not looking for love. I’m not sure my character is either. [But] you can’t fight an attraction. There’s a spark there. Sometimes sparks lead to fires.</p>
<p>How do Maddie’s pals, Dana and Helen, take to Cal?</p>
<p>In the books, Cal is actually intertwined with all [of the women]. His main focus is with Maddie. Her friends are interested in her being happy. They’re in favor of whatever that is. They’re trying to push Maddie into her new life in a gentle, loving way. I meet Maddie first. But they all know about me. The whole town knows about Cal. He used to play baseball, he’s famous. There’s a little confusion as to why he’s in town.</p>
<p>How do Maddie’s children deal with her new relationship?</p>
<p>They’re dealing with their parents&rsquo; divorce and what their father has done. There’s Tyler (Carson Rowland), Kyle (Logan Allen), and Katie (Bianca Berry Tarantino) and they each deal with it in different ways. You’ve got an angsty teen developing into a man, the middle child who’s more the intellectual, and the fun little girl who doesn’t understand what’s happening. That’s what drives a lot of the story, their reactions. The story is set in the fictional town of Serenity, South Carolina, but I look at &ldquo;the town&rdquo; as our cast and crew, and it’s a joy to visit the town. I couldn’t wait to go to work.</p>
<p>What was your experience on Grey’s Anatomy like?</p>
<p>I remember watching the first episode of Grey’s when I was on AMC. Alexa wanted to watch it. At first, I was like, ‘Why are we watching this? This is what we do [on AMC]!’ But by Episode 2, I was hooked. I had auditioned 20 times for 20 different characters on that show. The casting director, Linda Lowry, told me there was one [earlier] role the producer wanted me for but she said, ‘Look, if you use him you can’t use him again so maybe save him for something else?’</p>
<p>I later got the part of Matthew but I had no idea who he’d be involved with. I guessed it was Sarah Drew’s character [Dr. April Kepner] based on how sweet and genuine he was. He’s a wholesome character. I think Alexa guessed it first. She said, ‘It’ll be that girl in the shooting.’ She remember the scene where a guy playing a shooter let April live.</p>
<p>You left Grey&rsquo;s once and come back. Is the door open for another return?</p>
<p>My character isn’t dead. Even on soaps, unless your head is separated from your body, there’s a way to find your way back. They didn’t kill me. Trust me, I asked. ‘I die in the next episode, right?’ They finally said, ‘Why do you think we’re going to kill you?’ I said, ‘You kill everybody!’ Fortunately, they did not kill me and I got to play on that show for a long time. It was one of the most fun roles of my career.</p>
<p>Maybe they’ll have you back.</p>
<p>I’m still a working paramedic.</p>

<p>You came back to AMC for the end of that show before it went off the air in 2011.</p>
<p>Yes. I left in 2007 but I came back for the final two episodes. I wanted to come back and pay tribute to my character and say goodbye to my family on that show. It was sad. They had moved the show to LA [from New York] already so a lot of our original crew wasn’t there. There were a lot of familiar faces behind the scenes, but not everybody that I’d grown to know over the four years I was there. That show was a legacy. Susan [Lucci, Erica] had been on since the second episode? She’s synonymous with that show. I loved working with Michael and Julia, who played my parents.</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>What did you learn from Michael?</p>
<p>Working with Michael was trial by fire. He’s very funny. He’s awesome. I remember my first day. I was so nerdy. I had my script binder and all my lines were highlighted. Michael and I started rehearsing. [Michael] has no script. He had the first line of the scene [but what he says is] not even remotely close to what’s in the script. I could feel the sweat forming.</p>
<p>Conal O’Brien was the director. I said to him, ‘I think I have the wrong script.’ He grinned at me and said, ‘Oh, no you don’t. Welcome to the world of Michael Knight.’ That was the most glorious thing Michael taught me – freedom. We had so many fun moments as father and son. He was a comfort. Whenever I had scenes with Michael, I was so thrilled, I knew we’d riff off each other. We’d have fun and the more fun I had, the more fun the audience would have.</p>
<p>I thought you couldn’t get more ironic in life that David Hasselhoff played Michael Knight on the TV series Knight Rider and he was once married to Catherine Hickland (Lindsay, One Life to Live), who later married Michael E. Knight, the actor, who played your dad. But then you were cast in the lead role on the revival of Knight Rider in 2008.</p>
<p>Yes. That was a fun little six degrees of separation. Michael, my Michael, was the first person I called when I got the job. I said, ‘I’ve got some news. I got a job. I’m doing the same thing – I’m playing the son of Michael Knight.’ He said, ‘You’re Knight Rider.’ He got it right away.</p>
<p>You were also cast as Steve Trevor in the Wonder Woman pilot by David E. Kelley that starred Adrianne Palicki but never aired.</p>
<p>Yes. I was very excited to get that job. I’m a huge comic book fan. I’m a comic book nerd. I’m in my office right now and it’s filled with Ghost Rider stuff. There’s Johnny Blaze, the original Ghost Rider, but I started reading it when it was revived with the character of Danny Ketch.</p>
<p>I read for Steve Trevor twice. David E. Kelley wrote so much humor into the show. Steve Trevor’s basically the damsel in distress. He’s the only one who can say, ‘My girlfriend is going to beat you up. Just wait till she gets here!’ Steve was capable in his own right, but he was the one getting saved. There was so much fun stuff. In one scene that didn’t make it in, [Diana and Steve] have a fight, a typical couple’s fight. I storm off and leave and then this huge bus flies by my head and I turned to her and said, ‘Really?’</p>
<p>See Also Our Season 17 Wish List for &lsquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy&rsquo; Season 16 came to an early end, but the good news is that we still have another season of the long-running ABC drama to look forward to.</p>
<p>Is there another role in the superhero world you’d like to play?</p>
<p>I would like to do the Daniel Ketch version of Ghost Rider. As his story developed, he became such a tortured guy. The original Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, made a pact with the devil, but Danny never did that. He just tried to save his sister and then he [became the Ghost Rider]. Later on, he becomes addicted to the power. There are fun things to explore. Hopefully someday.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts on Cal and Sweet Magnolias?</p>
<p>I view Cal as the Obi Wan Kenobi of Sweet Magnolias in the sense that yes, he’s young, but, as you’ll see, he’s been through [a lot]. On soaps, I always felt that the women characters were far more interesting than the men ever were because, generally, they had all the secrets. But this show is set in a small town so everyone knows everything about one another already. It’s the men who come into town who have the secrets. You get to explore their pasts which is always very interesting. A lot of things happened to Cal before he got to Serenity. He’s much wiser because of what he’s gone through. He gives advice and it’s sound advice. It makes him a good coach, a good person to turn to.</p>

<h3 id="predicting-pac-12-win-totals-cal-poised-to-break-out-in-2020-college-football-season-challenge-oregon-usc">&ldquo;Predicting Pac-12 win totals: Cal poised to break out in 2020 college football season, challenge Oregon, USC&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2019/10/19/89e7566a-cf54-4f95-92ec-e7a887ca431a/thumbnail/1200x675/d5648edb6647f95fd823bb57e8c98436/chasegarbers-1.jpg" alt="img">
The Pac-12 is brimming with intrigue as we get closer to the 2020 college football season. Some high profile coaches (like Kevin Sumlin at Arizona, Chip Kelly at UCLA and Clay Helton at USC) could be on the hot seat if things don&rsquo;t get turned around. Plus, some fresh faces have entered the fray (Karl Dorrell at Colorado, Jimmy Lake at Washington and Nick Rolovich at Washington State) to make for a compelling season with some clear-cut contenders as the conference looks to make the College Football Playoff for the first time in four years.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the season will begin on time and be played as expected. But assuming we get a full 12-game slate for each team, CBS Sports has taken a deep dive and come up with preliminary game-by-game predictions for all 12 teams in the league.</p>
<p>Predictions are based on talent returning, coaching turnover and recent recruiting success, among other factors. In some cases, the location of a game played a role in the prediction of who will win.</p>
<p>Check out the breakdown of the likely wins, losses and final record below for each team in the Pac-12 in the 2020 season:</p>
<p>Pac-12 North</p>
<p>Cal (11-1, 8-1)</p>
<p>Wins: UNLV, TCU, Cal Poly, Utah, at Washington State, Oregon, at Oregon State, Washington, at Arizona State, Stanford, UCLA</p>
<p>UNLV, TCU, Cal Poly, Utah, at Washington State, Oregon, at Oregon State, Washington, at Arizona State, Stanford, UCLA Losses: at USC</p>
<p>at USC Analysis: The Bears closed the 2019 season on a three-game winning streak with sophomore quarterback Chase Garbers slinging touchdowns and the defense playing some of its best football of the season. Now after three straight years of improvement under Justin Wilcox, Cal is poised for a breakout year. The Bears return more starters than any other team in the league and are giving an offense that struggled when Garbers was hurt last season a reboot under long-time NFL offense coordinator Bill Musgrave. The schedule is favorable, too, as the Bears play Utah, Oregon and Washington at home. A mid-season home showdown against the Ducks looms large as a potential swing game in the race for a division title.</p>
<p>Oregon (10-2, 8-1)</p>
<p>Wins: North Dakota State, Hawaii, at Colorado, Washington, Stanford, at Arizona, USC, Arizona State, Washington State, Oregon State</p>
<p>North Dakota State, Hawaii, at Colorado, Washington, Stanford, at Arizona, USC, Arizona State, Washington State, Oregon State Losses: Ohio State, at Cal</p>
<p>Ohio State, at Cal Analysis: Sure, the Ducks have to replace star quarterback Justin Herbert and several of top-tier offensive linemen. But when you recruit as well as they do, it&rsquo;s a manageable task. Entering their third season under coach Mario Cristobal, the Ducks have inked the top class in the Pac-12 in back-to-back years. If it can upset Ohio State in Week 2 &ndash; and that&rsquo;s a big if &ndash; then Oregon will immediately enter the conversation for a spot in the College Football Playoff. But even with a loss against the Buckeyes, Oregon will still be the team to beat in the Pac-12. Ultimately, a Cal team returning more starters than anyone in the league gets the nod at home against the Ducks.</p>
<p>Washington (8-4, 6-3)</p>
<p>Wins: Sacramento State, Utah State, Oregon State, at Utah, Arizona, Stanford, Colorado, at Washington State</p>
<p>Sacramento State, Utah State, Oregon State, at Utah, Arizona, Stanford, Colorado, at Washington State Losses: Michigan, at Oregon, at Cal, at USC</p>
<p>Michigan, at Oregon, at Cal, at USC Analysis: The Huskies are replacing a lot this season, including their head coach, quarterback, offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator, although the old one is still around. Jimmy Lake&rsquo;s promotion from directing the defense to head coach should help smooth the transition. So should three consecutive recruiting classes ranked third or better in the Pac-12. The return of most starters from a solid defense is nice, too. Unfortunately for Lake, his first season as coach starts against Michigan and includes road trips to Oregon, Utah, Cal and USC. But even with all the change and a tough schedule, the Huskies are still positioned to improve on their 4-5 league record from last season if first-year offensive coordinator John Donovan can identify a solid quarterback to replace Jacob Eason.</p>
<p>Stanford (6-6, 4-5)</p>
<p>Wins: William &amp; Mary, at Arizona, at UCLA, Oregon State, Colorado, BYU</p>
<p>William &amp; Mary, at Arizona, at UCLA, Oregon State, Colorado, BYU Losses: USC, at Notre Dame, Washington State, at Oregon, at Washington, at Cal</p>
<p>USC, at Notre Dame, Washington State, at Oregon, at Washington, at Cal Analysis: After Utah, Stanford is the Pac-12 program with the most continuity on its staff, and that should be more important than ever as programs enter the season without the benefit of spring practices. The Cardinal are coming off their first losing season in Shaw&rsquo;s ninth years. But quarterback Davis Mills appears poised for a breakout junior season, and the schedule is favorable enough that Stanford should be back bowling again in 2020. Winning a Sept. 26 game against UCLA should give the Cardinal enough leeway to reach six wins even if their misery at the hands of Washington State continues for a fifth consecutive season.</p>
<p>Oregon State (5-7, 3-6)</p>
<p>Wins: Colorado State, Portland State, Washington State, UCLA, Arizona</p>
<p>Colorado State, Portland State, Washington State, UCLA, Arizona Losses: at Oklahoma State, Arizona State, at Washington, Cal, at Stanford, at Utah, Oregon</p>
<p>at Oklahoma State, Arizona State, at Washington, Cal, at Stanford, at Utah, Oregon Analysis: With three offensive starters selected in the NFL Draft, the Beavers have a lot to replace from last year&rsquo;s squad that improved its win total from two to five in coach Jonathan Smith&rsquo;s second season. That offensive exodus will make taking another leap a considerable challenge. The defense returns most of its heft, including linebacker Hamilcar Rashed Jr., who set a school record with 14 sacks last season. Aside from Rashed, the unit wasn&rsquo;t great in 2019. But it&rsquo;s safe to assume the Beavers&rsquo; defense will pick up enough slack to help Oregon State reach the cusp of bowl eligibility as the offense regroups. A Friday night game at Stanford on Oct. 30 looms large for both teams. But Stanford gets the preliminary nod in that one, thanks to home field advantage.</p>
<p>Washington State (3-9, 1-8)</p>
<p>Wins: Houston, Idaho, Stanford</p>
<p>Houston, Idaho, Stanford Losses: at Utah State, at Oregon State, Cal, Utah, Arizona State, at Colorado, at UCLA, Oregon, Washington</p>
<p>at Utah State, at Oregon State, Cal, Utah, Arizona State, at Colorado, at UCLA, Oregon, Washington Analysis: Buckle up, because while the Air Raid may have departed with Mike Leach, the run and shoot is in under Nick Rolovich. The former Hawaii coach is bringing offensive coordinator Brian Smith with him, and they will be installing a system that rivals Leach&rsquo;s pass-heavy attack in aerial emphasis and entertainment value. But with the Cougars replacing quarterback Anthony Gordon and top receivers Eason Winston and Brandon Arconado, it may take some time for Rolovich to get traction, especially without the benefit of spring practices. Securing some momentum during an opening nonconference stretch against Utah State, Houston and Idaho will be critical for setting the tone in Year 1 of the new regime.</p>
<p>Pac-12 South</p>
<p>USC (10-2, 8-1)</p>
<p>Wins: New Mexico, at Stanford, Arizona State, at Utah, Cal, at Arizona, Colorado, Washington, at UCLA, Notre Dame</p>
<p>New Mexico, at Stanford, Arizona State, at Utah, Cal, at Arizona, Colorado, Washington, at UCLA, Notre Dame Losses: Alabama, at Oregon</p>
<p>Alabama, at Oregon Analysis: Even after the Trojans finished the 2020 recruiting cycle with the 10th-best class in the league, they still have enough talent to win the Pac-12. But a schedule that includes a neutral-site date with Alabama, on the road at Oregon and a regular-season finale against Notre Dame is daunting. Embattled coach Clay Helton is turning to former Texas defensive coordinator Todd Orlando to help the Trojans correct last season&rsquo;s woes, and there&rsquo;s enough talent back to make a turnaround feasible. Talent hasn&rsquo;t been Helton&rsquo;s problem, however, in his attempt to get USC in the playoff picture, and it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the Trojans making it over the CFP hump this season.</p>
<p>Arizona State (7-5, 5-4)</p>
<p>Wins: Northern Arizona, at UNLV, Oregon State, UCLA, at Colorado, at Washington State, Utah</p>
<p>Northern Arizona, at UNLV, Oregon State, UCLA, at Colorado, at Washington State, Utah Losses: BYU, at USC, Cal, at Oregon, at Arizona</p>
<p>BYU, at USC, Cal, at Oregon, at Arizona Analysis: Herm Edwards is back for Year 3 after proving some doubters wrong by taking the Sun Devils to a pair of bowl games. Now the former Jets and Chiefs coach is putting even more NFL pedigree on his staff by promoting former Bengals coach Marvin Lewis to co-defensive coordinator after Lewis spent last season in an advisory role. Lewis will have plenty to work with as Arizona State returns most of its starters from a decent unit. Offensively, Arizona State is replacing a lot more but does return quarterback Jayden Daniels, who tossed 17 touchdowns and just two interceptions as a freshman. A season-ending loss at Arizona might raise some eyebrows. But two years after after relinquishing a 19-point lead and losing in heartbreaking fashion at home, the Wildcats figure to put forth one of their best efforts of the season in that one.</p>
<p>Utah (8-4, 5-4)</p>
<p>Wins: BYU, Montana State, at Wyoming, at Washington State, at UCLA Arizona, Oregon State, at Colorado</p>
<p>BYU, Montana State, at Wyoming, at Washington State, at UCLA Arizona, Oregon State, at Colorado Losses: at Cal, USC, Washington, at Arizona State</p>
<p>at Cal, USC, Washington, at Arizona State Analysis: Utah&rsquo;s continuity is its strength. But while Kyle Whittingham returns for his 16th season as coach and both coordinators are back from last year&rsquo;s 11-3 team, the roster is undergoing a massive overhaul. Just two starters are expected back from one of the best defenses in the country, and big-time playmakers in quarterback Tyler Huntley and running back Zack Moss have graduated as well. The Utes will be back to prominence soon, but this season might be part of the bridge to get them there. If, somehow, they can knock off USC at home on Oct. 2, their odds at another division title will improve dramatically. But for now, that one is penciled in as a win for the Trojans.</p>
<p>UCLA (6-6, 3-6)</p>
<p>Wins: New Mexico State, at Hawaii, at San Diego State, Arizona, at Colorado, Washington State</p>
<p>New Mexico State, at Hawaii, at San Diego State, Arizona, at Colorado, Washington State Losses: Stanford, at Arizona State, Utah, at Oregon State, USC, at Cal</p>
<p>Stanford, at Arizona State, Utah, at Oregon State, USC, at Cal Analysis: The Bruins are fortunate to be facing two programs under first-year coaches during a sneaky challenging nonconference slate in September. Both Hawaii and San Diego State will be under new regimes after winning 10 games a piece in 2019. If the Bruins can take care of business against those foes on the road, there is a clear path to bowl eligibility in Chip Kelly&rsquo;s third season. The Bruins have not recruited to the level that Kelly&rsquo;s track record might suggest. But they have continuity at both coordinator positions, and it would be stunning if that does not translate to some marginal improvement after a disappointing start to Kelly&rsquo;s tenure.</p>
<p>Arizona (4-8, 2-7)</p>
<p>Wins: Hawaii, Portland State, Colorado, Arizona State</p>
<p>Hawaii, Portland State, Colorado, Arizona State Losses: Stanford, at UCLA, USC, at Washington, Oregon, at Utah, at Oregon State, Arizona</p>
<p>Stanford, at UCLA, USC, at Washington, Oregon, at Utah, at Oregon State, Arizona Analysis: After losing seven in a row to end the season and signing a class ranked last in the conference, there is nowhere to go but up for Arizona in 2020. Right? Kevin Sumlin is turning to former Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads to coordinate a defense that was bad last season. But after scoring just 27 points in its last three games, the Wildcats&rsquo; offense needs some work, too. Fortunately for Sumlin, Grant Gunnell put up some good numbers as a freshman and has enough weapons around him to take another big step as the full-time starter. A season-ending win over Arizona State at home would bring some comfort. But who knows if it would be enough to earn Sumlin a fourth year.</p>
<p>Colorado (3-9, 1-8)
