Lisa Nandy faces a backlash that could lose her the leadership race after Piers Morgan challenged her on GMB over why she ignored government advice to self-isolate if you show cold-like symptoms amid the coronavirus outbreak. Ms Nandy appeared on the show this morning with a stuffy nose and a slightly hoarse throat prompting Mr Morgan to ask: “You haven’t got a cold have you.” The Good Morning Britain host even asked whether she had been tested for the deadly virus.

Lisa Nandy slammed by GMB viewers over coronavirus run-in with Mr Morgan

In retaliation, the Labour MP for Wigan dug her heels in and insisted she was “coronavirus-free”, joking her symptoms were the result of the lengthy leadership race. “I’ve just got Labour leadership-itis,” she said. Express.co.uk readers were left outraged by the shock debate with many saying Ms Nandy should exit the leadership race. Writing on Facebook, furious Barry Buignet said Ms Nandy would lose supporters as a result of the interview. He said: “Oh dear Nandy I do believe you have just shot yourselves in the foot. It’s time to bow out gracefully from trying to become the ring master or mistress ( depending who you identify yourself as ) of the Labour Party circus.” And another angry viewer agreed: “She is unbelievable. I did support her but not now after listening to her being interviewed by Piers on GMB.”

Some Express readers say the GMB interview ruined Ms Nandy's shot at leadership

Michelle Mackie said Ms Nandy displayed weakness in avoiding questions: “Watched this and Piers was spot on. She made an absolute a*#e of herself! Scared to give an honest answer for fear of losing votes!” While Susan Goose suggests the Labour leader would have won support had she not fielded questions: “By her actions, she has lost many many more votes. We need strong leadership, not pathetic excuses.” Meanwhile, others denounced all three of the Labour leader candidates, Ms Nandy, Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey, vying to replace Jeremy Corbyn, as unelectable. Viewer Terry Mallen wrote on Facebook: “This present abour lot are a complete embarrassment and totally unelectable so far away from reality and the working class.” The disastrous interview was backed by co-host Susanna Reid who said Ms Nandy’s appearance on the show demonstrates the challenge presented to government to keep people at home once it introduces a blanket ban from work or school displaying any signs of illness.

Labour MPs in the leadership race: Lisa Nandy, Keir Starmer and Rebecca Long-Bailey

Ms Reid said: “We’re laughing about it now, but yesterday the Government said that within 10 to 14 days the official advice will be, even if you have a mild cold, you’re going to be asked to self-isolate. “The fact you are here today, and obviously that’s not official advice yet, is an indication that’s going to be really difficult.” But Ms Nandy said that when government advises to stay at home, she would do so and encouraged others to do the same. She said: “When the medical advice becomes, ‘if you feel at all unwell, stay at home,’ we need to have measures in place so that people can do that. “I will do that but other people don’t have the options that I have. If I do that, I’ll still get paid.” Another applauded Mr Morgan for probing Ms Nandy on whether the GMB team should “just take her word” on being coronavirus-free, writing on Facebook. : “You are right Piers (never thought I would say that), it is madness.” But not everyone condemned Ms Nandy’s actions, with some arguing she would have been criticised either way. One Express reader said if Ms Nandy hadn’t appeared on the show “Mr Morgan would have made jeering and ignorant comments about why she’d failed to turn up.”

Ms Nandy demanded an apology from Mr Morgan during the show

Meanwhile, another jested she “was worried that by not turning up for work she wouldn’t get paid - a bit like the rest of us”. And a third supporter of Ms Nandy highlighted the government does not recommend self-isolating just for a cold. Mary Bull wrote: “Seriously she had a slight cold. Coronavirus doesn’t cause running nose etc. Government doesn’t suggest if you have a cold to isolate. Best thing to do is read the symptoms.” Ms Nandy also became embroiled in a heated row with Mr Morgan over the issue of transgender rights. She demanded the host to apologise after he repeatedly asked her to say whether she felt it was “unfair” for athletes who now identify as female to compete in women’s sport. But her reaction to the journalist’s questions only further angered Express readers. “When a journalist gets told he should apologise for asking a perfectly legitimate question - it’s ridiculous!”, one person commented on Facebook. Ms Nandy, who has backed pledges from the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights that call for the expulsion of transphobic members from the party, said it was for sporting bodies to establish a commission to discuss the issue.

The number of coronavirus cases in the UK has shot up in recent days

But the back-and-fourth saw Mr Morgan demand a “straight answer” on the topic of mixing sexes in sports races, citing the example of New Zealand weightlifter Laurel Hubbard, a transgender woman who is now targeting selection for the Olympics having previously competed as a male weightlifter. He also posed a hypothetical question over whether world record-holding sprinter Usain Bolt should be allowed to compete against women if he decided to transition. Ms Nandy accused Morgan of being “irresponsible” and pitting women’s rights against trans rights. She said: “It’s for sport to have a proper commission to sit down and work out where those boundaries are. “I will not allow this to become a zero sum battle between two groups of people.
