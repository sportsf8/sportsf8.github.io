<p>This year, space fans may have seen July&rsquo;s full moon turn a shade darker than usual, as the third penumbral lunar eclipse of 2020 took place.</p>
<p>When? July 5</p>
<p>Total lunar eclipses</p>
<p>A total lunar eclipse, otherwise known as a &lsquo;blood moon&rsquo;, occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth’s shadow. At the distance of the Moon, this shadow appears like the bull’s eye at the centre of a dartboard.</p>
<p>The umbral shadow slowly creeps across the Moon’s disc until it engulfs it completely. You might think the Moon would disappear from view at this point but this is typically not the case. The Earth’s atmosphere acts like a lens, refracting or bending the Sun&rsquo;s red light to infill the otherwise dark umbra. This results in the Moon&rsquo;s usual bright white hue transforming into a deep blood orange.</p>
<p>Space fans will remember that the last total lunar eclipse graced our skies on January 21, 2019. In total the celestial spectacle - which was also a full moon and a supermoon - lasted five hours, 11 minutes and 33 seconds, with its maximum totality peaking at 5:12am.</p>
<p>While the next total lunar eclipse is not set to take place in the UK until May 16, 2022, three prenumbral lunar eclipses occurred this year on January 10, June 5 and July 5.</p>
<p>This type of eclipse takes place when the Moon moves through the outer part of the Earth&rsquo;s shadow, also known as the penumbra, causing a slight darkening of the lunar surface. Therefore, it is easily mistaken for a normal full moon and unlike a total lunar eclipse, it can be difficult to notice or observe.</p>
<p>Once in a blue moon</p>
<p>Does this well-known phrase have anything to do with the Moon? Well, yes it does. We use it to refer to something happening very rarely and a blue moon is a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>A monthly blue moon is the name given to a second full moon that occurs in a single calendar month and this typically occurs only once every two to three years. In 2020, the Hunter&rsquo;s Moon on October 31 will also be a blue moon because it is the second full moon to occur in October.</p>
<p>A seasonal blue moon describes the third of four full moons to occur in an astronomical season. In 2019, May&rsquo;s Flower Moon was a seasonal blue moon.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s lots of other moons, too - how many do you know?</p>
<p>Full moon: We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the sky at night.</p>
<p>New moon: Sometimes known as the invisible phase, as it generally can&rsquo;t be seen in the sky. It&rsquo;s when the Sun and Moon are aligned, with the Sun and Earth on opposite sides of the Moon. As a result, the side of the Moon that faces the Earth is left in complete darkness.</p>
<p>Black moon: Most experts agree that this refers to the second new moon in a calendar month, while some use the term to describe the third new moon in a season of four new moons. The last black moon took place on August 30, 2019, which was also a super new moon, and the next one is set to take place on August 19, 2020.</p>
<p>Blood moon: Also known as a total lunar eclipse. It&rsquo;s when the shadow of Earth casts a reddish glow on the moon, the result of a rare combination of an eclipse with the closest full moon of the year. There was one in the UK in January 2019, with the next one set to be visible over South America, North America and parts of Europe and Africa on May 16, 2022. Space fans in the UK won&rsquo;t be able to see every phase of this eclipse, but should be able to see it at totality when the Moon appears with a reddish-orange glow.</p>
<p>What is a supermoon?</p>
<p>Ever looked up at the night sky to see a full moon so close you could almost touch it? Well you&rsquo;ve probably spotted a supermoon.</p>
<p>The impressive sight happens when a full moon is at the point in its orbit that brings it closest to Earth. To us Earth-lings, it appears up to 30 per cent brighter and 14 per cent bigger.

<h3 id="the-emotional-meaning-of-the-august-2020-full-moon-is-about-freedom">&ldquo;The Emotional Meaning Of The August 2020 Full Moon Is About Freedom&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/shutterstock/2020/7/31/0750ea27-76bd-47f3-a38c-ac5ab35d6994-shutterstock-1336327220.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;fm=jpg" alt="img">
Similar to taking a deep inhale and exhale, the moon&rsquo;s waxes and wanes play a pivotal role in your emotional reality. When the moon reaches its peak of fullness — best known as a full moon — something needs to be acknowledged. Every lunation has a unique purpose, and the emotional meaning of the August 2020 full moon focuses in on your individual freedom and sense of belonging in the world.</p>
<p>On Aug. 3 at exactly 11:59 a.m. EST, August&rsquo;s full moon will adorn the night sky in the eccentric sign of Aquarius. In order to understand the overall potency of the astrological aspects taking place during this lunation, you have to understand the essence of Aquarius&rsquo; zodiac archetype. Governed by revolutionary Uranus — planet of chaos, technology, and rebellion — this air sign highlights your individual freedom and unique sense of belonging in the world. So if in Capricorn the sign&rsquo;s cardinal earth focuses on solidifying your long-term goals, Aquarius&rsquo; fixed air energy helps you tap in your higher mind in order to intellectualize and showcase your accomplishments.</p>
<p>Given that the full moon in Aquarius happens once every year, it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge the timing of this particular lunation as it is taking place during Leo season, which has everything to do with your soul&rsquo;s authenticity. Full moons are a call for balance, so this lunation is an opportunity to reflect on your individuality and how you can share your light with humanity.</p>
<p>Shutterstock</p>
<p>Full moons are a spiritual culmination from the heavens, and in the socially conscious sign of Aquarius, it&rsquo;s also an opportunity to make a difference in your community. When the moon is full, it sits directly opposite the sun, creating a symbol of the sacred masculine and divine feminine energies. But what happens when the sun in theatrical Leo directly opposes the moon in rebellious Aquarius? In addition to this being a call for balance, this is a time to surround yourself with like-minded groups of individuals in order to discover where you stand amongst the rest of your community. What inspires you to tap into your inner humanitarian spirit?</p>
<p>Think back to the new moon in Aquarius on Jan. 24, 2020. How have you evolved mentally, virtually, and socially? Remember, Aquarius is governed by Uranus, planet of technology, revolution, and unexpected changes. So anything related to innovation, progression, and social movements falls into the category of this fixed air sign. Keep in mind, change-maker Uranus has been transiting through Taurus since March 2019, and during this time, the &ldquo;Great Awakener&rdquo; has revolutionized your idea of normal, challenging your sense of security and your value systems.</p>
<p>Uranus will not only play a pivotal role in this lunation as Aquarius&rsquo; planetary ruler, but it&rsquo;ll also serve as a focal point in a challenging T-Square between the sun and the moon. Given that a full moon sheds light on whatever needs acknowledging and readjusting, this Uranus-ruled lunation will illuminate everything that&rsquo;s happening in the world today. Though it may sound vague considering the magnitude of the current events, because Aquarius is symbolic of the people, this full moon will mainly focus on human interaction and the way communities are connecting with one another.</p>
<p>Aggressive Mars will form a harsh square with Jupiter-Pluto retrograde in Capricorn, which will likely challenge people&rsquo;s faith, optimism, and will. Mercury, the planet of communication and thought process, will oppose structured Saturn, and this will also create a tug of war between the information currently being addressed versus what hasn&rsquo;t yet been revealed. Though the essence of Aquarius mainly revolves around society, the way you use your mind and process information will play a significant role during this time.

<h3 id="full-moon-august-2020-usa-time">&ldquo;Full Moon August 2020 USA Time&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.brevardtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/77_lro_fullmoon.jpg" alt="img">
There will be a Full Moon on Monday, August 3, 2020.</p>
<p>August 2020 Full Moon USA Time</p>
<p>Skywatchers will be able to see August’s Full Moon beginning with a moonrise over the Atlantic Ocean on Florida’s east coast around 8:35 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (with a few minutes deviation depending on your exact location.)</p>
<p>The moonset will occur around 7:31 a.m. EDT on the following morning.</p>
<p>The full moon will have a 99.9% illumination.</p>
<p>The moon will technically be at its fullest at 11:19 a.m. EDT which occurs before the moonrise and out of sight from U.S. viewers.</p>
<p>Full Moon Effects</p>
<p>For those planning a stroll along the beach to watch the Full Moon, August’s Full Moon will cause over a 4-foot high tide on August 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th which may increase the storm surge effects from Hurricane Isaias along the U.S. east coast.</p>
<p>The bright full moon will also make it harder to see the three meteor showers occurring in early August.</p>
<p>When is the best time to watch the August 2020 Full Moon?</p>
<p>Low hanging moons near the horizon appear larger to humans.</p>
<p>So, the August 2020 Full Moon will appear biggest to the naked eye on the U.S east coast during and just after the moonrise around 8:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.</p>
<p>Why is an August Full Moon called a Sturgeon Moon?</p>
<p>These moon names are associated with seasonal occurrences that happen in August.</p>
<p>Native American tribes that fished for sturgeon in the U.S. Great Lakes gave the August full moon this name.

<h3 id="all-zodiac-signs-can-expect-the-unexpected-under-augusts-full-moon">&ldquo;All Zodiac Signs Can Expect The Unexpected Under August&rsquo;s Full Moon&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2020/7/30/483b6ecb-98b0-4719-8bc4-4633458bfa44-bustle_fullmoon_orange.png?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;fm=jpg" alt="img">
With summer at its peak and Leo season 2020 in full effect, the Sun is definitely taking center stage lately. But on Monday, August 3, the August 2020 full moon will be rising in the skies and grabbing all the cosmic attention, because it&rsquo;s lighting up our social lives and delivering us some cosmic twists and turns, too. Expect the unexpected — because every zodiac sign will feel the freedom-seeking lunar energy in a unique way, and you&rsquo;ll want to know how the August 2020 full moon will affect you.</p>
<p>August&rsquo;s full moon takes place in visionary Aquarius, the zodiac&rsquo;s fixed air sign. Aquarius energy is focused on the collective, so it&rsquo;s all about our roles within friendships, social groups, and our communities at large. Under this full moon&rsquo;s energy, we have to consider the well-being of our communities as a whole, whether that&rsquo;s the cooperative efforts of your team at work, the power dynamics between you and your roommates, or the balance of trust within your squad of besties. We&rsquo;re likely to experience an emotional climax in relation to these parts of our lives under this full moon — so you might already feel some energy (or even tension) building up in any social groups you&rsquo;re part of. This luminary will offer us some clarity and perspective, and we&rsquo;ll be able to keep the collective good in mind as we make decisions about how to move forward.</p>
<p>This lunation has some challenging planetary aspects coming along with it, too — specifically in the form of a standoff between the full moon and the wild child planet Uranus, which brings unexpected emotional changes and a huge craving for freedom. We&rsquo;re in for some unpredictable emotional shifts, and we&rsquo;ll be torn between our need for freedom and our responsibilities to others — so it&rsquo;ll be important to be both adaptable and sensible.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the scoop on how the August 2020 full moon will affect each zodiac sign so you have a heads-up on what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a natural-born leader, Aries, and everyone knows it — but this full moon is going to challenge you to step back and share the torch with those around you. While you may feel like you&rsquo;ve got a solid grip on your current goals and general place in the world, this luminary&rsquo;s energy will open your eyes to the need to ask others for help. Don&rsquo;t think of this as giving away your power to others, but rather as enhancing it through the power of the collective.</p>
<p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>Try to go with the flow at work, Taurus, as the full moon could bring out some tension between you and your colleagues or highlight issues that have been lurking beneath the surface. Try to focus on what&rsquo;s best for the group dynamic — and keep your eyes and ears peeled for potential opportunities to take on something new or get some recognition for your work.</p>
<p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been wishing for a fresh burst of inspiration to get your mental juices flowing, this full moon is answering your prayers, Gemini! With this luminary in a fellow air sign, you&rsquo;ll be feeling as curious about the world and hungry for knowledge as ever. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you end up signing up for an online class or wind up on the phone with friends for hours discussing some far-out topic of interest.</p>
<p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve felt some tension within your most intimate relationships lately, the answer may lie in a need for more vulnerability. As as sensitive water sign, you&rsquo;ve got some seriously deep feelings, Cancer — and you tend to keep those feelings on lock out of fear of getting hurt. The energy of this full moon is asking you to open up to the people you&rsquo;re closest to, as that could be exactly what you need to feel free.</p>
<p>Leo (July 23 - Aug. 22)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re grappling with the desire to feel totally untethered and independent, while also balancing the one-on-one relationships that are important to you. The full moon in opposition to your sign highlights your need for freedom in partnerships, Leo — but have you ever considered that maybe your partner craves the same freedom? You might be in for some emotional surprises, so lean into open communication that allows you to express your feelings while keeping an open heart to your partner&rsquo;s, too.</p>
<p>Virgo (Aug. 23 - Sept. 22)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>Virgos love a good routine, but this full moon&rsquo;s erratic energy might be throwing a wrench in your schedule and throwing off your self-care game. It&rsquo;ll be hard to focus on your usual needs and rituals, as you&rsquo;re pulled toward other causes that could benefit from your wisdom and gentle advice. Find a balance by offering up your services while still taking care of yourself.</p>
<p>Libra (Sept. 23 - Oct. 22)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>This is an auspicious time to stay open to fresh, fun opportunities, Libra! With the full moon in a fellow social air sign&rsquo;s territory, you&rsquo;ll be feeling lighthearted and ready to connect with others — whether that&rsquo;s by swiping right on a few cuties to put some virtual date nights on your calendar or simply by prioritizing fun activities with friends. Focus on what brings you happiness, but don&rsquo;t be overly attached to the way things are — circumstances always change, but you can trust that the shifts will be for the best in the long run.</p>
<p>Scorpio (Oct. 23 - Nov. 21)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>No one has a perfect relationship with their roommates or family members, but you might feel particularly bogged down by your share of this drama under Monday&rsquo;s full moon. If there&rsquo;s some passive aggressive tension between the people you live with or your close family, expect for it to take center stage — and be ready to deal with it and make some compromises. Emotional turmoil within such an intimate sphere is tough for everyone, so try to make a happy resolution your goal.</p>
<p>Sagittarius (Nov. 22 - Dec. 21)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>Lean into your wit, adaptability, and communication skills under this luminary, Sagittarius — as you might find yourself in the middle of gossip or misunderstandings. Stay grounded and present in your truth, and don&rsquo;t get caught up in the allure of dramatic social games. By simply being communicative and honest, you&rsquo;ll be able to diffuse any drama with ease.</p>
<p>Capricorn (Dec. 22 - Jan. 19)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>Keep an eye on your finances this weekend, Capricorn. You might find yourself needing to spend a bit of cash or dole out a small loan to help someone you care about — or you may simply find that you&rsquo;re in a financial position to boost a cause that could really use some support and feel compelled to do so. Whether your cash flow shifts a little by choice or by circumstance, think through your decisions and be open minded. Remember that money comes and goes.</p>
<p>Aquarius (Jan. 20 - Feb. 18)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>Happy full moon in your sign, Aquarius! You&rsquo;re all about the collective good, but right now is actually a good time to focus on yourself. With your ruling planet Uranus forming a square aspect with this close-to-home luminary, you can expect to feel its unpredictable, freedom-loving energy on an ultra-personal level. You might feel compelled to totally change your look or overall vibe. Embrace the changes!</p>
<p>Pisces (Feb. 19 - March 20)</p>
<p>Margaret Flatley/Bustle</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re in full dreamland mode under this full moon, Pisces. You&rsquo;ll feel lost in a fantasy this weekend, but keep your third eye open and your spiritual antennae&rsquo;s perked — because the universe may be whispering some secrets in your ear and offering you an opportunity to feel even more deeply connected to the energy all around you. Not all change has to happen in the physical plane. Embrace your spiritual water-sign power and think about ways to use it as a tool to help others.

<p>August 1, 2020 – What’s Up for August? This month brings a bunch of opportunities to see the Moon posing with the planets, plus here come the meteors!</p>
<p>On August 1st, the Moon makes a lovely triangle with Jupiter and Saturn low in the southeast after sunset. The trio is visible all night, rising to its highest point in the south around 11 p.m. local time. If you miss them, there’s another chance at the end of the month, on August 28th, as the Moon swings back around in its orbit to join the planetary pair.</p>
<p>On August 9th, Mars will appear super close to the Moon before dawn. Look toward the south, high in the sky, and you can’t miss it – Mars is the bright, reddish point of light just right of the Moon. Weather permitting, this should be a beautiful sky, with the Pleiades, Orion, Aldebaran and Venus to the southeast.</p>
<p>On August 15th, in the hour before sunrise, look for Venus in the east, just a couple of finger widths apart from the crescent Moon. And if you take a look before the sky gets too bright, you’ll see the duo surrounded that morning by a ring of bright stars.</p>
<p>The annual Perseid meteor shower peaks on the morning of August 12th. The last-quarter moon will interfere with visibility of most fainter Perseid meteors this year, but you’ll still be able to see a few brighter ones, including the occasional “fireball.” The best time to look is in the pre-dawn hours on Aug. 12, but midnight to dawn any morning the week before or after should produce a few meteors. The Perseids generally appear to radiate from a point high in the north, called the “radiant.” But you need only point yourself generally toward the north and look up.</p>

<p>And while we’re talking meteors, did you know many of these “shooting stars” come from comets? Most of the annual meteor showers we observe take place as Earth passes through trails of debris left behind by active comets orbiting the Sun, casting off little bits of dusty debris in their long tails. The Perseid meteors come from a comet called Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the Sun every 133 years.</p>
<p>In July, a comet that was just discovered this spring by NASA’s NEOWISE mission made an appearance in our skies, wowing observers on the ground and even in space! This comet has a nearly 7,000-year orbit around the Sun, so it won’t be back this way for a long time, but it’s possible a meteor you see some night in the future might just be a little reminder of comet “NEOWISE.”</p>
<p>Here are the phases of the Moon for August. You can catch up on all of NASA’s missions to explore the solar system and beyond at nasa.gov. I’m Preston Dyches from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and that’s What’s Up for this month.</p>

<p>More skywatching info: Summer with Jupiter and Saturn, and fast-fading Comet NEOWISE</p>
<p>On the evening of the full Moon, as evening twilight ends, the bright planet Jupiter and the fainter planet Saturn will appear in the southeast, with Jupiter to the right about 19 degrees above the horizon and Saturn on the left about 18 degrees above the horizon. The bright star appearing closest to overhead will be Vega, the brightest of the stars of the “Summer Triangle,” appearing 72 degrees above the eastern horizon. The other bright stars of the “Summer Triangle” are Deneb, which will appear about 50 degrees above the horizon in the east-northeast, and Altair, which will appear about 43 degrees above the horizon in the east-southeast. The comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), if it is still visible with amateur telescopes, will appear almost due west at about 35 degrees above the horizon (but since it is a diffuse object, you may want to look later in the night when the sky has had a chance to really darken).</p>
<p>As the lunar cycle progresses, the background of stars and planets will appear to shift towards the west. This summer should be a great time for Jupiter and Saturn watching, especially with a backyard telescope. Jupiter was at its closest and brightest for the year on July 14, and Saturn at its closest and brightest on July 20, 2020, (called “opposition” because they will be opposite the Earth from the Sun). Both will appear to shift towards the west over the summer months, making them visible earlier in the evening sky (and friendlier for backyard stargazing, especially if you have young ones with earlier bedtimes). With clear skies and a small telescope you should be able to see Jupiter’s four bright moons, Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, and Io, shifting positions noticeably in the course of an evening. For Saturn, you should be able to see the brightly illuminated rings as well as the motions of Saturn’s moons, particularly the largest moon, Titan.</p>
<p>By the evening of September 1, 2020 (the evening just before the full Moon after next), as evening twilight ends (at 8:37 PM EDT for the Washington, DC area), the bright planet Jupiter and the fainter planet Saturn will appear in the south-southeast, with Jupiter to the right about 27 degrees above the horizon and Saturn on the left about 26 degrees above the horizon. The bright star appearing almost exactly overhead will be Vega, the brightest of the stars of the “Summer Triangle,” appearing 86 degrees above the eastern horizon. The other bright stars of the “Summer Triangle” are Deneb, which will appear about 62 degrees above the horizon in the east-northeast, and Altair, which will appear about 53 degrees above the horizon in the southeast. If you are one of the approximately 20 percent of the USA population living near areas dark enough you might be able to see the Milky Way running across the sky from south-southwest to north-northeast once the sky darkens to full nightfall. See the entry below for August 25 for more information on the Qixi Festival and Chinese legends related to these three stars and the Milky Way.</p>
<p>Daily Guide</p>
<p>August 1-2</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, if you have a clear view of the horizon in the east-northeast, you might be able to see the bright star Pollux about 7 degrees to the upper left of the planet Mercury. For the Washington, DC area, Mercury will rise at about 4:49 AM EDT and will be only about 2 degrees above the horizon at the time morning twilight begins at 5:04 AM.</p>
<p>Saturday is Lammas Day, a Christian holiday celebrated in some English-speaking countries that may have derived from earlier pagan celebrations. We currently divide the year into four seasons based upon the solstices and equinoxes, with summer ending on the autumnal equinox in September. This approximates summer as the quarter of the year with the warmest temperatures. The Celts and other pre-Christian Europeans celebrated “cross-quarter days” halfway between the solstices and equinoxes, and divided the seasons on these days. Using this definition, summer was approximately the quarter of the year with the longest daily periods of daylight, with summer traditionally ending August 1st (the middle of our summer). Names for this end of summer and start of the fall harvest season include Lughnasadh, Lughnasa, Lúnasa, Lùnastal, and Luanistyn.</p>
<p>On Saturday night into Sunday morning, the bright planet Jupiter will appear above the waxing gibbous Moon with Saturn appearing to the left to form a triangle. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will be about 17 degrees above the horizon in the southeast as evening twilight ends at 9:24 PM EDT. The Moon will reach its highest in the sky for the night at midnight on Sunday morning and Jupiter will set first in the west-southwest at 4:35 AM, followed by the Moon (at 4:49 AM) and Saturn (at 5:14 AM).</p>
<p>August 3: Full Moon</p>
<p>Sometime around Monday, August 3, 2020 (2020-Aug-03 23:36 UTC with 1 day, 14 hours, 25 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2018 BD), between 3 and 6 meters (8 to 19 feet) across, will pass the Earth at between 3.8 and 24.4 lunar distances (nominally 7.5), traveling at 9.41 kilometers per second (21,060 miles per hour).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the next full Moon will be midday on Monday, August 3, 2020, appearing opposite the Sun in Earth-based longitude at 11:59 AM EDT.</p>
<p>August 8-9</p>
<p>On Saturday night into Sunday morning, the planet Mars will appear near the waning gibbous Moon. For the Washington, DC area, the Moon will rise in the east Saturday night at 11:04 PM EDT, with Mars appearing less than 3 degrees to the left of the Moon. They will appear at their closest to each other early Sunday morning in the hour or so before morning twilight begins at 5:13 AM, with Mars appearing above the Moon.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, August 9, 2020, at 9:51 AM EDT, the Moon will be at apogee, its farthest from the Earth for this orbit.</p>
<p>August 11</p>
<p>Tuesday midday, the waning Moon will appear half-full as it reaches its last quarter at 12:45 PM EDT.</p>
<p>The Perseid meteor shower is expected to peak on Wednesday, August 12, 2020 (when we can’t see them from the Americas). The best time to look from North America should be late on Tuesday night, August 11, or early on Wednesday morning, August 12, 2020. The meteor shower summary earlier in this Moon Missive has more information on when and where to look.</p>
<p>August 12</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, the planet Mercury will be just rising about 30 minutes before sunrise, an approximation of when it will start being too close to dawn to see in the morning. Mercury will pass on the far side of the Sun as seen from the Earth five days later.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the planet Venus will appear at its greatest separation from the Sun as seen from the Earth in the morning sky, called its greatest western elongation. Because the angle of the line between the Sun and Venus and the horizon is becoming more perpendicular, the date when Venus and the Sun appear farthest apart as seen from the Earth is not the same as when Venus is highest above the horizon as morning twilight begins. This occurs in early September.</p>
<p>August 13</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, the bright star Aldebaran will appear about 4 degrees below the waning crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, Aldebaran will rise below the Moon in the east-northeast at 1:18 AM EDT, and will be to the lower right of the Moon in the east-southeast as morning twilight begins around 5:17 AM.</p>
<p>August 15</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, the bright planet Venus will appear below the waning crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, Venus will rise about 4 degrees below the Moon in the east-northeast at 2:50 AM EDT, and the pair will appear about 30 degrees above the horizon in the east as morning twilight begins around 5:19 AM.</p>
<p>August 16</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the bright star Pollux (the brighter of the twins in the constellation Gemini) will appear about 8 degrees to the left of the waning crescent Moon. For the Washington, DC area, Pollux will rise in the northeast at 3:29 AM EDT and the pair will appear about 20 degrees above the horizon in the east-northeast as morning twilight begins at 5:20 AM.</p>
<p>August 17</p>
<p>On Monday morning, the planet Mercury will pass on the far side of the Sun as seen from the Earth, called superior conjunction. Because Mercury orbits inside of the orbit of Earth, it will be shifting from the morning sky to the evening sky and will begin emerging from the glow of the dusk on the western horizon around August 29, 2020 (depending upon viewing conditions).</p>
<p>August 18: “Black Moon”</p>
<p>Tuesday evening, at 10:41 PM EDT, will be the new Moon, when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun and will not be visible from the Earth. This will be the third new Moon in a season with four new Moons, so (following the analogy for naming Blue Moons) some now call this a “Black Moon.”</p>
<p>August 19</p>
<p>The day of or the day after the New Moon typically marks the start of the new month for most lunisolar calendars. The seventh month of the Chinese calendar starts on Wednesday, August 19, 2020 (at midnight in China’s time zone, which is 12 hours ahead of EDT). In the Islamic calendar the months traditionally start with the first sighting of the waxing crescent Moon after the New Moon, although many Muslim communities now follow the Umm al-Qura Calendar of Saudi Arabia, which uses astronomical calculations to start months in a more predictable way. Sunset on Wednesday, August 19, 2020, will probably mark the beginning of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic year, one of the four sacred months in which warfare is forbidden. Sundown on Thursday, July 20, 2020, marks the start of Elul in the Hebrew calendar.</p>
<p>August 21</p>
<p>On Friday morning at 6:58 AM EDT, the Moon will be at perigee, its closest to the Earth for this orbit.</p>
<p>The 10-day celebration of Onam in Kerala, India, will begin on Saturday, August 22, and end on the day of the next full Moon on September 2, 2020.</p>
<p>August 22</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the bright star appearing to the lower left of the waxing crescent Moon will be Spica. For the Washington, DC area, as evening twilight ends at 8:54 PM EDT, the Moon will appear in the west-southwest at about 15 degrees above the horizon. Spica will set first at about 9:52 PM.</p>
<p>August 25</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, the Moon will appear half-full as it reaches its first quarter at 1:58 PM EDT.</p>
<p>There are approximately 7 days between each phase of the Moon, so the first quarter Moon tends to occur on the 7th day of a lunisolar month. Tuesday, August 25, 2020, will be the seventh day of the seventh month of the Chinese calendar. The seventh night of the seventh month is known as the double seventh festival, Qixi in China, Chilseok in Korea, Thất Tịch in Vietnam, and is sometimes called the Chinese Valentine’s Day. There are many variations on the legend, but basically, they involve the three bright stars we know as the “Summer Triangle” and the Milky Way. Vega represents the weaver girl and the bright star Altair represents the cowherd. They fall in love and neglect their duties, so the Goddess of Heaven puts a wide river in the sky, represented by the Milky Way, to keep them apart. They are allowed to meet only one night a year, on the seventh night of the seventh month, when the bright star Deneb forms a bridge across the Milky Way. In some versions of the legend, the bridge is formed by magpies, so this is sometimes called the Magpie Festival. The Japanese Tanabata or Star Festival is related, but is no longer tied to the lunisolar date (it is now celebrated on July 7th, the double seventh of the Gregorian Calendar).</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, August 25, 2020, the bright star Antares will appear to the lower left of the waxing half-moon. For the Washington, DC area, as evening twilight ends at 8:49 PM EDT, the Moon will appear in the south-southwest about 26 degrees above the horizon, and Antares will set first in the southwest at 11:48 PM.</p>
<p>August 28-September 2</p>
<p>On Friday night into Saturday morning, the bright planet Jupiter will appear near the waxing gibbous Moon, with the fainter planet Saturn appearing nearby. As evening twilight ends (at 8:44 PM EDT for the Washington, DC area) the Moon will appear in the south-southeast about 24 degrees above the horizon, with Jupiter appearing about 2 degrees above the Moon and Saturn appearing about 9 degrees to the left. The Moon will reach its highest in the sky for the night at 9:55 PM, appearing in the south about 26 degrees above the horizon. Jupiter and the Moon will set together in the west-southwest Saturday morning at 2:38 AM, with Jupiter on the right and Saturn above the Moon.</p>
<p>Saturday evening will be (for the Washington, DC area, at least) the first evening when Mercury will still be above the horizon about 30 minutes after sunset, an approximation of when it will start being visible in the evening sky after sunset.</p>
<p>Saturday evening into Sunday morning, the planet Saturn will appear near the waxing gibbous Moon, with the brighter planet Jupiter also appearing nearby. For the Washington, DC area, as evening twilight ends at 8:42 PM EDT, the Moon will appear in the south-southeast about 21 degrees above the horizon, with Saturn appearing to the upper right of the Moon and Jupiter appearing farther to the right. The Moon will reach its highest in the sky for the night at 10:49 PM and Jupiter will set first in the west-southwest Sunday morning at 2:34 AM.</p>
<p>Sometime in late August or early September, 2020 (2020-Sep-01 16:12 UTC with 8 days, 8 minutes uncertainty), Near Earth Object (2011 ES4), between 22 and 49 meters (73 to 162 feet) across, will pass the Earth at between 0.2 and 41.2 lunar distances (nominally 0.3), traveling at 8.16 kilometers per second (18,260 miles per hour).</p>
<p>The full Moon after next will be early on Wednesday morning, September 2, 2020.
