<p>MOUNT RUSHMORE NATIONAL MEMORIAL S.D. (CBS/CNN) — Kimberly Guilfoyle — the girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. and a top fundraiser for the Trump campaign who is the former spouse of California Gov. Gavin Newsom — has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a top official for the committee she leads.</p>
<p>“After testing positive, Kimberly was immediately isolated to limit any exposure,” said Sergio Gor, chief of staff for the Trump Victory Finance Committee. “She’s doing well, and will be retested to ensure the diagnosis is correct since she’s asymptomatic but as a precaution will cancel all upcoming events. Donald Trump Jr was tested negative, but as a precaution is also self isolating and is canceling all public events.”</p>
<p>Guilfoyle tested positive in South Dakota before she was set to attend the President’s event at Mount Rushmore, a person familiar with the matter and a campaign source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle was not with the President and Donald Trump Jr. has so far tested negative, the person familiar with the matter said. That source said Guilfoyle had not had recent contact with the President, but she was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was backstage for his rally there and, was also at his event in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle’s positive test was first reported by The New York Times.</p>
<p>A former Fox News personality, Guilfoyle assumed the role earlier this year of national chairwoman of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, where she is credited with expanding its ranks of fundraisers.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle and Trump Jr. had been in the upper Plains region hosting high-dollar fundraisers for several days, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle has “been with a lot of the campaign donors” in recent days, one source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Billed as a “Mountain West Ranch Retreat,” one event occurred in Gallatin Gateway, Montana, from Tuesday until Thursday, according to one of the people.</p>
<p>Another event was billed as the “Rapid City Roundup Retreat” in Rapid City, South Dakota, from Thursday to Friday.</p>
<p>The people said Guilfoyle was not seen wearing a mask during the events.</p>
<p>Born and raised in San Francisco, Guilfoyle married current California governor Gavin Newsom when he was a member of the city board of supervisors in 2001. Newsom was elected mayor of San Francisco in 2003 and the couple were divorced in 2006.</p>
<p>She is not the first person close to the President to test positive for the virus. A member of the Navy who serves as one of Trump’s personal valets tested positive in May. Additionally, eight Trump advance team staffers who were in Tulsa tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>All of Trump’s campaign staffers who worked on the rally in Tulsa were quarantining last week after interacting with several colleagues who later tested positive for coronavirus, CNN reported at the time. Campaign aides are tested before events, per the Trump campaign’s safety protocols.</p>
<p>The news of Guilfoyle’s test comes not long after Trump Jr. posted images that falsely suggested that masks and face coverings don’t help prevent the spread of the highly contagious virus.</p>
<p>Experts say wearing a mask or other face covering could reduce the transmission of Covid-19 by as much as 50%.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Trump Jr. posted an image on Facebook of a lab where scientists were working in certain hazmat suits known as positive pressure suits. Text on the image says, “This is what virologist wear to protect themselves from a virus. Don’t worry, though. Your bandana probably works too.”</p>
<p>The image is from 2017 and was taken at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province.</p>
<p>In posting the image, Trump Jr. wrote, “Solid point.” The post has received more than 40,000 shares and over 69,000 reactions on Facebook.</p>

Guilfoyle reportedly learned of the diagnosis in South Dakota ahead of the Mount Rushmore July Fourth event attended by President Trump.</p>
<p>Kimberly Guilfoyle, girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. and a top Trump campaign official, has tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle tested positive for the disease caused by the coronavirus while in South Dakota. It happened ahead of the July Fourth event held Friday at Mount Rushmore and attended by President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump.</p>
<p>The New York Times reports Guilfoyle traveled to South Dakota with Trump Jr., who tested negative. She was not aboard Air Force One with the president and first lady.</p>
<p>Sergio Gor, chief of staff to the Trump campaign’s finance committee, says Guilfoyle was immediately isolated after the positive result to limit exposure. He says she will be retested to confirm the diagnosis because she isn’t showing any symptoms of COVID-19, the disease the virus causes. Gor says Guilfoyle is doing well and canceling her public events.</p>
<p>Guilfoyle serves as a top fundraising official for the Trump campaign, according to the Times and CNN. She attended the president&rsquo;s indoor campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., two weeks ago, but it&rsquo;s not clear if that&rsquo;s where she was infected. She also attended the president&rsquo;s recent event in Phoenix, according to CNN.

Trump campaign member and Donald Trump Jr’s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle has tested positive for coronavirus after she attended the President’s Tulsa rally.</p>
<p>A journalist from the New York Times tweeted the news on Friday evening, according to reports from The Sun.</p>
<p>The reporter alleged that Guilfoyle tested positive ahead of attending President Donald Trump&rsquo;s Mount Rushmore event.</p>
<p>However, Guilfoyle was allegedly never with the president and neither was Don Jr who tested negative, according to a person familiar with what happened.</p>

<p>NEW - Kim Guilfoyle, girlfriend of Donald Trump Jr. and a top campaign official, tested positive for coronavirus in SD ahead of attending Mt Rushmore event, according to a person familiar w what happened. She was never was with POTUS, and neither was Don Jr., who tested negative. — Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) July 4, 2020</p>
<p>The journalist also confirmed that neither went to the event with Trump or travelled on Air Force One.</p>
<p>However, they are expected to drive back to the east coast to avoid contact with other people, the familiar source told the reporter.</p>
<p>Last month, Guilfoyle attended Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Around the time of the rally, eight Trump campaign staffers tested positive for coronavirus and dozens of Secret Service members were told to self-quarantine after two agents also tested positive.</p>

<p>The virus takes anywhere from two to 14 days to incubate, so after the rally, officials said it was too soon to attribute a spike in Oklahoma virus cases to the rally.</p>
<p>Following the event, several of the campaign‘s top officials decided to quarantine for a week instead of going into the office, two sources told CNN.</p>
