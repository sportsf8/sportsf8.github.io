<p>SUNDAY PUZZLE — Today we have a confection, thank goodness. Andy Kravis is amiable, funny and a mensch who has served as a Transgender Rights Project legal fellow for Lambda Legal. He has also brought us numerous crackling grids and riotous collaborators. Mr. Kravis walks that fine line between being accessible enough for new solvers (and those of us with tired brains) and clever and quirky enough for the jaded. There’s a lot to pick up on.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>The trope in the fill that strikes me today is really good pairs: PIRANHA and KOALA, TURNS ONTO and VEERS OFF, CATBERT and (just plain) BERT, CLINGY and GLOM; there are more, and they create a very fun rhythm to the grid. I think my only misdirect was “zeal” for PEEL, but I’m sure there were others.</p>
<p>72A: This one deserves a medal, though: WOWIE, right over MAUI.</p>
<p>96A: This is one of those quick sparks, once you get it! I wonder if there are more users these days of Tinder, the dating app, than there are lighters of actual MATCHES.</p>
<p>4D: Who would have thought this would be a debut? Supposedly, the origin of the BIG DANCE is back in the 1970s; I’m sure constructors get a little frisson of glee when they find a good term like this, previously unmined for solvers.

<h3 id="kamala-harris-front-runner-again">&ldquo;Kamala Harris, Front-runner (Again)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/12/us/12ambriefing-promo/12ambriefing-harris2-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Kamala Harris is emerging as the front-runner to be Joe Biden’s running mate for one reason above all others: She is the only female African-American possibility who has the political experience typical of vice presidents.</p>
<p>Biden has promised to choose a woman. The current reckoning with racism — as well as the importance of black turnout — has led many Democrats to say he should choose a black running mate. And Harris is a high-profile senator who has also been California’s attorney general.</p>
<p>All of the other potential black female candidates are lighter on national political experience than any modern vice president. Stacey Abrams’s highest job was in the Georgia state legislature. Susan Rice has never held elected office. Others have served as mayors or in the House.</p>
<p>Among them, only Harris would avoid debate about whether she was ready to take over as president, a relevant question given that Biden is 77 years old. Harris also has a classic vice-presidential skill — a talent for making a sharp case against the other party — and she seems to have a personal rapport with Biden.

<h3 id="variety-puns-and-anagrams">&ldquo;Variety: Puns and Anagrams&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" alt="img">
So what’s left? A whole lot of puns. Please feel free to refer to this guide to the variety of pun clues. A Panda is a little less strict in its adherence the rules of a cryptic crossword, but the tactics used are very similar. You don’t get the number of letters with each clue, and you don’t always get both sides of a clue either (“definition” and “wordplay”); in exchange, most clues are less obscure than in a cryptic, and you have crossed letters as you would in a regular crossword grid to make things easier to deduce.</p>
<p>There’s a wonderful variety of clues today. We can start with several double definitions, a type of puzzle that might be distilled to 100% purity at 19A, “Child’s joke.” What word means both “Child” and “joke?” I don’t KID — you can figure these out. Are you familiar with Bishop TUTU, the Peace Nobelist, at 34A? Did you think of Eddie Van Halen or Sam Maloof at 1D, to get ROCKER?</p>
<p>Then there are some homophones. I found 23A a bit blind, but easy enough to solve. Cries of terror are “Eeks,” sounds like EKES (in a cryptic, there would have been a definition like “barely gets by&quot;). At 59A, a Pennsylvania city, Erie, would be EERIE if empty (the “e” in empty makes that work as well, this clue is kind of a two-for-one). 51D is FOURTH; without the “U” it solves the proverb in the clue. 68A refers to Henry Higgins to make us think in a Cockney accent; at a red light, ESTOPS (“he stops,” of course, without the “h”). 62A is a tricky variation: A Hawaiian garland is a “lei,” add a Z and an I to get LAZY EYE. 44A sounds like “either” — OAR. One that’s not so tricky, I hope, made me cackle at 9D: Got LOX for your door, bagel store?</p>
<p>Containers are easy! They are one step back from anagrams, if you think about it, as you don’t need to rearrange any letters — just locate a phrase or word, in your clue, that makes for a good entry. Take 56A: Someone who “respects nobody” is a SNOB. 27A, look for a woman’s name in “sweet talker.” Oh, and 10D is a short container, as long as you know that ALTA is a place to ski in Utah. There’s another one in 58D that you can become by finding, and you’ll definitely regret not figuring out 36A. A little variation on this is an initialism — using the first letters of the words in a clue, as in 63D, where “you exclaim positively, at first” becomes YEP.</p>
<p>While you’re scanning the letters in a clue for hidden meaning, it’s a good time to check for deletions as well. Look for indications like “two-thirds” at 41D, where you’re being asked to use two-thirds of the letters in “raises” to make an investment choice — your IRA. At 42A, find a “section” in “Newspaper” to get APE. Look at “A&amp;E is missing” in 50D: “Indicate” becomes INDICT. At 1A, I suppose that RUSTLES fits this general category (think of a word for “no corrosion”). You can now see why 6D is ENTER. I think HAIFA at 49A works in this group (taking the “r” and the “d” from “hair fad”). 25A wants you to use every second letter in the first part of clue to get the entry — RETRO.

<h3 id="shifting-sounds">&ldquo;Shifting Sounds&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/03/crosswords/03wordplay-elm/03wordplay-elm-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
123A: Give doctors any and every award, but a documentary can get an OSCAR.</p>
<p>63D: My knowledge of crime families and international law degree terminology is paltry, so I had no idea what to put as the fourth letter of this entry. Because of its proximity to an affectionate description I use for my partner, HIMBO, I got a laugh at the notion of “carbo” here. Call me Creta Carbo, I want to be alone with my quarantine waffles. This clue actually refers to CARLO Gambino, who the Mob Museum refers to as “the face of organized crime in New York City,” but who I still can’t picture. LLB, at 75A, stands for “Legum Baccalaureus” or Bachelor of Laws; the double “L” is how Latin plurals are abbreviated, like “pp.” for pages.</p>
<p>Today’s Theme</p>
<p>Today’s theme consists of eight entries, at 23-, 29-, 58-, 76-, 107- and 117-Across, and 3- and 79-Down. Depending on the trajectory of your solve, the puzzle’s title — “Shifting Sounds” — might have been a giveaway, or it might have been a misdirect! Let me elucidate by explaining the first clue that I solved, at 3-Down, because that was the way the cookie crumbled for me.</p>
<p>It’s really because THEIR and AA MILNE were quick lit fill-ins for me, which led me to notice and get wrapped up in the interesting three-step dance of SHIPMEN, AHOY and KINSHIP. I jumped on “Bad shot by Dracula?” and answered it correctly — COUNTMISS — but for the wrong reason. I figured that “Shifting Sounds” was just an indication of homonyms (“Sounds”) that change position (“Shifting”) so COUNT MISS was the theme-ization of MISCOUNT, which isn’t the cleanest way to say “Bad shot” but it was good enough for me for a minute. I needed to fully solve another example for things to snap together correctly. At 23-Across, “Dog’s order at a malt shop?” looked like “hound” something right away (I wanted something that would transform to “newshound” by moving its parts around, if you catch my drift). I didn’t know what to do with HOUNDSHAKE — hound’s hake? Voilà: HOUND SHAKE is handshake, transformed; COUNT MISS is can’t miss. In other (spoken) words, you’re shifting “sands” to “sounds;” anywhere in the theme entries that you want to say “wa” say “wou” instead (you want phthongs? Read the constructor notes).</p>
<p>Even if you can wrap your head (or the mouth in your head) around the “shift” you need to make, none of the rest of the theme entries solve themselves. There’s a great mix of cultural references: Chess and the “magic kingdom,” to name a couple. My favorite was at 29-Across, where the clue referenced a show I knew absolutely nothing about but the entry is a beloved icon from “The Simpsons,” trying to stride the Scottish highlands — NED FLOUNDERS. Here’s evidence that “The Simpsons” touches every touchstone, including this puzzle, as there’s a clear reference to another theme entry.

<h3 id="the-wrong-way-to-fight-the-opioid-crisis">&ldquo;The Wrong Way to Fight the Opioid Crisis&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e333e877515bc0008266f27/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/200210_r35378.jpg" alt="img">
One morning in August, Toth responded to a call from an old brown brick apartment building north of Columbus. It resembled a two-story motel, with exterior staircases and iron railings. The referring detective told Toth that a woman and her boyfriend had fallen asleep together the previous night: “She wakes up this morning, about 8 a.m.—he’s fuckin’ dead.” The girlfriend was sitting outside with a neighbor, wearing a pink tie-dyed shirt, black leggings, and Nike slides. Toth, noticing that the woman had uncontrollable jitters, said, “Look at that leg.”</p>
<p>Upstairs, in Apartment H, the dead man lay face up at the foot of a mattress on the living-room floor. He was bare-chested, and wearing dungarees and dark socks. Foamy vomit had run from the left side of his mouth and down his face. The inside of his left forearm held needle marks.</p>
<p>The detectives looked around. The apartment was largely empty, but on a dresser they found a charred spoon, scales, baggies, and a razor blade. A heavy stick leaned beside the front door; in one corner was an aluminum bat. There was a deck of cards, a bunch of dice, and a scorecard pencilled with players’ names: Daddy, Baby. Baby was up by one.</p>
<p>Next to the body lay a pack of Marlboros and a purple lighter. A tiny photograph of a woman was taped to the pack. That’s how personal property is labelled in rehab, one of the detectives pointed out.</p>
<p>The woman in the photograph wasn’t the girlfriend—it was a neighbor, who was in jail. Toth put the girlfriend in the front seat of his unmarked police vehicle and asked for an explanation. Detective Chuck Clark, whose case it was, sat in the back, listening closely. The girlfriend told the investigators that whatever had killed her boyfriend must have come from elsewhere. She said, “I know he found something in that cigarette pack—I know it! I can feel it in my fucking soul!”</p>
<p>The detectives hadn’t found anything in the pack except cigarettes. Toth said, “You saw something in that cigarette pack.”</p>
<p>“I did not!”</p>
<p>“There! No more wobble.” Facebook</p>
<p>Twitter</p>
<p>Email</p>
<p>Shopping Cartoon by Jeremy Nguyen</p>
<p>The girlfriend claimed that she’d spent the night with her head on her boyfriend’s chest, which also seemed dubious: in many overdoses, loud “agonal” breathing precedes death. Another detective, listening at the car’s open window, finally murmured, “Code B,” which meant to arrest her.</p>
<p>Toth gave the woman one last chance. He said, “Your boyfriend is no longer here, and all we want to do is—”</p>
<p>“Figure out what happened,” she said.</p>
<p>Toth told her, “I think you know something.”</p>
<p>The woman, as if suddenly comprehending her precarious position, said, “Come with me.”</p>
<p>They all filed back into the apartment. In the bedroom, she reached into the closet and, sobbing, retrieved a baggie of beige powder from the overhead tracks of the sliding door.</p>
<p>She had made things better for herself by giving up the drugs, but worse by lying. The detective who wanted to arrest her told his colleagues, “I just don’t have the patience for that shit. She knew what fucking killed him.” (The man died of a combination of cocaine, fentanyl, and acetylfentanyl, a synthetic opioid that can be up to a hundred times more powerful than morphine; on the street, it’s known as Apache, Jackpot, and China White.)</p>
<p>At the very least, the detectives could charge the girlfriend with obstruction of justice and tampering with evidence. It was also within their purview to book her on involuntary manslaughter, and let the courts figure it out.</p>
<p>It fell to Clark whether or not to arrest the woman. Toth assured him that he’d back him whatever he decided. Clark thought for a moment, then said, “Personally, I don’t think she ought to be Code B’d.” With that, the woman escaped Jamie Maynard’s fate.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Jamie’s mom asked her, “Would you be alive right now if you had gotten off?” They were sitting in the family room of Frank and Debbie’s house one afternoon. Jamie thought for a minute and said, “Probably not.” She has now been sober for three years.</p>
<p>Whenever I visited the Bartons, Jamie’s parents always sat together quietly, on their sectional sofa, listening to their daughter describe her life. At one point, Debbie said, “I don’t understand the whole addiction thing, so then I get really mad.” Addiction, in her opinion, was “a choice.” Jamie told her mom, “It literally changes the chemicals in your brain.”</p>
<p>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, addiction is a complex brain disease—“a medical illness,” not a “moral failing.” Northeastern’s Action Lab notes that addiction “alters brain neurochemistry such that it compels a person to satisfy cravings despite recognized negative consequences.” In 2015, both Jamie and Courtney would have suffered “intolerable distress” at the prospect of being unable to use heroin; they were contending with a disease that had diabolically transformed their lives into what the NIDA calls “a landscape of cues and triggers, like a video-game environment cunningly designed to pose the greatest challenge to his or her willpower at every turn.”</p>
<p>A twisted distinction of overdose-homicide cases is that many defendants need the same mental-health and addiction treatments that are offered to survivors of an overdose. The laws purport to protect life, but they may actually increase fatalities: a witness to an overdose may be less likely to dial 911, for fear of being prosecuted. Most Good Samaritan laws, which provide immunity to people who call for help, don’t apply to overdose-homicide cases. According to the Northeastern study, the statutes “create a quandary for people calling 911: you (probably) won’t get in trouble if the person experiencing an accidental overdose event survives, but if death occurs, you’re calling the cops on yourself.”</p>
<p>While Jamie was in prison, her parents took care of her newborn daughter and her sons. (Timothy violated the terms of his parole, and is back in prison.) After she got out, she returned to living with them. She and Jeremy resumed their relationship. Three times a week, they attend an A.A. meeting together.</p>
<p>Even though Jamie is no longer incarcerated, her punishment, she discovered, has not ended. Her trafficking charge can eventually be expunged, but an F1—a first-degree felony—is for life. Barring a pardon or a special type of appeal, which she cannot afford, she will always be ineligible for certain housing and employment.</p>
<p>The state revoked her gaming license. Last August, desperate after months of looking for a job, she walked into a temp agency and told a supervisor the whole story. The agency found her a job as a janitor at a factory. Jamie got up at five-thirty every morning to mop floors and clean toilets. She was home by the time her kids got off the school bus. She took weekend and holiday shifts, for the overtime. In October, she received a promotion, to quality control, making $14.50 an hour. She would like a full-fledged job at the plant but has delayed applying, fearing that she’ll fail the company’s mandatory background check.</p>
<p>Jamie sometimes regrets not allowing her case to go to trial. She wonders if there shouldn’t be a less severe kind of criminal charge for defendants who are not high-level traffickers. She wonders, too, what a jury would have made of Courtney’s autopsy, which revealed that she died not strictly of a heroin overdose but, rather, of a toxic combination of heroin and alprazolam—Xanax. Other substances found in her bloodstream included the sedative lorazepam and the depression medication Trazodone.</p>
<p>In another case, in nearby Licking County, an appeals court recently overturned a conviction in a case involving a mixture of heroin and cocaine. And last year the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down a conviction because prosecutors failed to prove that the defendant knew that the heroin he’d given a schoolmate would kill him. Because overdoses are often medically ambiguous, defendants might be wise to reject a plea offer and take their cases to trial. Leukel, the Florida attorney, told me, “The hammer of the criminal-justice system carries so much weight, people are accepting responsibility for things they shouldn’t be accepting responsibility for.”</p>
<p>If more prosecutors began losing such cases, they might stop making overdose-homicide charges against low-level offenders, especially people struggling with drug addiction themselves. This past December, the family of a Franklin County man who died after a friend gave him heroin asked the court not to impose a prison sentence. Such a punishment, they said, would be “the worst possible outcome.” The dead man’s sister told the judge, “It could easily have been the other way around.” ♦

<h3 id="evan-birnholzs-july-28-post-magazine-crossword-split-ends">&ldquo;Evan Birnholz’s July 28 Post Magazine crossword, “Split Ends”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PELNV2SKQJBMNKVR3IAQFFJ43U.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Speaking of which, “mistake-free” is exactly what I was not last week. The clue for 121A in last week’s “Turn Signals” crossword originally read: [Author Calvino born in a country that nearly matches his name], and the answer was ITALY. This is incorrect. Italo Calvino was born in Cuba, not Italy. While this may not be the biggest error, a wrong clue is still wrong and I take responsibility for that. I’ve corrected the clue for the online version and the PDF that you can download, but either way, sorry for any confusion I may have caused.</p>
<p>Today’s puzzle has some unusual theme clues with incomplete fragments and a circled word spanning two adjacent Across entries:</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>23A: [Controversial legal trial, say / Enjoy a . . .] is CAUSE CELE BRE and 25A: [ . . . meal with someone / “Guys and Dolls” role] is AD ELAIDE . Spanning them is BREAD .</p>
<p>38A: [Job seekers’ event / Chance to gain an . . .] is CAREER EX PO and 42A: [ . . . advantage in tennis / Disdainful of others’ beliefs and practices] is INT OLERANT . Spanning them is POINT .</p>
<p>56A: [Piece of furniture that folds out / Exhibit . . .] is SLEEPER SO FA and 59A: [ . . . disloyalty / “That’s a no from me”] is “ I TH INK NOT .” Spanning them is FAITH .</p>
<p>78A: [Pain at the root / Inflict emotional . . .] is TOOTHAC HE and 80A: [ . . . pain / Temple designers, e.g.?] is ART S TUDENTS . Spanning them is HEARTS .</p>
<p>96A: [Potting mix brand / Begin work on . . .] is MIRACLE GRO and 99A: [ . . . a construction project / Former Judd Apatow series about college freshmen] is UND ECLARED . Spanning them is GROUND .</p>
<p>114A: [Site of a decisive 1815 battle / Make an . . .] is WATER LOO and 117A: [ . . . escape / Honor for an employee] is SE RVICE AWARD. Spanning them is LOOSE .</p>
<p>So what’s going on with those fragmented clues? It’s all explained by the central revealer at 69A: [Word that, when preceding this puzzle’s split words, forms the phrases with split clues], which is BREAK. The split circled words, when following the word BREAK, would satisfy the split clues on each line:</p>
<p>[Enjoy a meal with someone] is BREAK BREAD .</p>
<p>[Chance to gain an advantage in tennis] is BREAK POINT .</p>
<p>[Exhibit disloyalty] is BREAK FAITH .</p>
<p>[Inflict emotional pain] is BREAK HEARTS .</p>
<p>[Begin work on a construction project] is BREAK GROUND .</p>
<p>[Make an escape] is BREAK LOOSE.</p>
<p>Of course, you could just ignore those split clues altogether and still solve the puzzle since all answers have their own individual clues as normal. But I thought it’d be fun to add a cluing layer to the theme. The split answers have their own split ends, after all.</p>
<p>Speaking of “Split Ends,” eagle-eyed observers may have noticed that this is the same title of a previous Post Magazine crossword from September 2018. I agonized for a while about whether I should give this one a different title (like maybe “Part Time&quot;), but I decided to bring this title back for a couple of reasons: 1) The theme of today’s puzzle is different from the earlier one, and 2) I just felt that “Split Ends” aptly described the theme better than all the alternatives I considered. I’ll just make sure that if I put together a book collection of my crosswords that these two puzzles won’t appear in the same book.</p>

<p>Before the New Deal, the bulk of administrative-law cases dealt with matters such as land and patent grants, and military and civil-service employees. In both contexts, standard contractual principles of interpretation helped constrain the operation of administration law. The deference of 19th- and early-20th-century judges was not given to all administrative decisions, as the courts would later do in Chevron and Brand X, but only to those that followed consistent patterns of custom and usage. For example, Chief Justice William Howard Taft, in J.W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States in 1928, found an “intelligible principle” behind a statute that required that tariffs imposed on imported goods be designed to eliminate any unfair differential in price between domestic and foreign goods. The task there was manageable precisely because it was mathematical, so that the level of administrative discretion was necessarily constrained by the limited mission.</p>
<p>With the advent of the New Deal, the scope of the government mission became far broader, because for the first time it was possible to conceive of public ways to reorganize large segments of the economy, which by circumstance can be done only by administrative agencies. A quick look at a handful of relevant cases shows how the advent of new government powers diminished individual rights and transformed the legal and political landscape.</p>
<p>As an initial example, consider the allocation of the electromagnetic spectrum, the medium for radio communication, which had by that time become big business. In 1943, in National Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. United States, Justice Felix Frankfurter had to construe the deceptively simple words that defined the authority of the Federal Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934—“public interest, convenience and necessity.” Frankfurter read it broadly: “The Act does not restrict the Commission merely to supervision of the traffic. It puts upon the Commission the burden of determining the composition of that traffic.” The traffic officer sets the rules of the road, such that cars don’t crash and frequencies don’t interfere. But how does anyone determine the composition of the traffic? Frankfurter did not have a clue, so he blessed a broad delegation of that job to an equally clueless administrative agency.</p>
<p>With this maneuver, gone were the last vestiges of the non-delegation doctrine—the principle that Congress could not delegate its responsibility to write the country’s laws to administrative agencies—because no narrower grant of power could let the FCC look at some undefined range of supposedly relevant factors, as required by the statute. So when the FCC was forced to use “comparative broadcast hearings” to determine which of many applicants should receive a coveted government license, its ad hoc determinations made it difficult to articulate a sensible standard of judicial review. By 1965, the FCC had developed a decision process that rested on a list of seven malleable factors: diversification of control by media companies; full-time participation by station owners; proposed program service; past broadcast record; efficient use of frequency; character; and “other factors”—a meta-factor, as it were.
