<p>The villain from the iconic ’80s movie is all grown up and looking for redemption in this new YouTube Premium series.</p>
<p>“The Karate Kid” was one of the biggest film series in the 1980s. It had a good message to it, and a decent soundtrack as well. Every movie that you watched, you wanted to root for Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi; however in YouTube Premium’s web television series “Cobra Kai,” you will find yourself rooting for one of the main antagonists from the first “Karate Kid” movie.</p>
<p>“Cobra Kai” is the sequel and follow-up series to “The Karate Kid” franchise. It follows Johnny Lawrence, the main rival of Daniel LaRusso in the first movie, and how he has had a lot of problems since the events of the first film.</p>
<p>In the first episode, we see Lawrence barely getting by with a repair job, and then getting fired. LaRusso is more successful, as he owns his own car dealership chain. Lawrence then meets Miguel Diaz — his neighbor who has a lot of confidence issues and becomes one of the first students of the new Cobra Kai.</p>

<p>Cobra Kai brings in a new generation of students, both from the Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do gangs. One student nicknamed “Hawk,” a friend of Miguel’s who was a victim of bullying before joining Cobra Kai, unfortunately ends up becoming a bully after he turns against his long-time best friend, Demetri. This is a good example of what happened in the original movies when John Kreese’s former students ended up bullying LaRusso because of his influence. However, unlike Kreese, Lawrence does not encourage bullying, just defending oneself against bullies.</p>
<p>“Cobra Kai” also showcases a lot of girl power as well. In the original movies, the only time audiences really saw the female characters was as a love interest for LaRusso. Now, we see women fighting for the dojos and showing the audience that they are more than just a side story.</p>
<p>Some of the leading ladies include Sam, who is LaRusso’s daughter. She used to love doing karate with her dad when she was younger. Yet, in the first season, she is not as into it, as she is busy trying to fit in with the popular crowd. This even drives her to leave behind her former best friend, Aisha Robinson, and let the popular girls bully her.</p>
<p>However, in the second season she becomes interested in karate and joins Miyagi-do. Aisha then joins Cobra Kai as one of their first female students, showing that she is not to be messed with. She starts to become more confident and even finds the courage to stand up to those bullies. In the second season, a new character Tory joins Cobra Kai. She has had a rocky past, believing that if the world won’t show mercy to her family then she won’t show mercy to others.</p>
<p>In the show, La Russo finds himself thinking about his old mentor, Mr. Miyagi (sadly, actor Pat Morita, who played Miyagi in the original series, passed away in 2005 from kidney failure). In the second season, LaRusso opens his own karate dojo called Miyagi-do, shaping it in the way that Mr. Miyagi had done before.</p>
<p>In the movies, you probably hated Lawrence; now, you find yourself rooting for him and his redemption story. You find out why he became the way he was while he realizes the mistakes Kreese made with Cobra Kai, and is looking to not make those same errors. However, Lawrence gets a huge surprise near the end of the first season when his former mentor comes back after he was believed to be dead. Kreese seems like he wants to make amends with his former student; however, in the second season you will learn that Kreese — like in the movie — cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>You also see Lawrence’s son Robby Keene in the mix. He never really had a relationship with his father, so LaRusso ends up taking him under his wing and hosting him as his student. Prior to meeting LaRusso, Keene was skipping school and engaging in petty theft; it didn’t help that his mother was neglecting him, not noticing her son falling through the cracks. He gets a job at LaRusso’s dealership, although he initially applied so he and his friends could rob the place. However, over time, he starts to grow into a different person, eventually leaving his delinquent friends.</p>

<p>In the second season, a battle between two dojos ensues. Its Cobra Kai versus Miyagi-Do — two studios with very different teaching techniques. Eventually, it gets so intense that it ends with very dire consequences that you will have to watch. “Cobra Kai” also does not shy away from making references to the previous franchise with a mix of both modern and ‘80s music playing in the background, and Diaz wearing the Halloween costume Lawrence wore in the first movie.</p>
<p>Characters from the original movie also make appearances. There is also one moment in the tournament scene where Keene and Hawk are fighting and Hawk makes an illegal kick to Keene, thereby disqualifying him. It is very similar to when Bobby, another Cobra Kai student under Kreese, was forced to break LaRusso’s leg in the first movie. However, unlike Hawk, Bobby showed regret for his actions.</p>
<p>Bullying has also played a theme in “Cobra Kai,” much like its predecessor. Some of the main characters are the targets of bullies, but instead of using the typical “meet me outside at the schoolyard” threats — although there is plenty of that as well — they use cyberbullying: one instance being the popular girls making fun of Robinson. Lawrence handled the situation, though, by demonstrating the message that if you wouldn’t say it to someone’s face then you shouldn’t say it online.</p>
<p>You might also like: Why We Need Yoga With Adriene More Than Ever</p>
<p>Something that I hope happens in the next season is that both LaRusso and Lawrence bury the hatchet for good and merge their studios in order to finally take down Kreese once and for all. They both need to learn to let go of the past and move forward into the future if they are going to help the new generation</p>
<p>If you are looking for something new to watch and you are a fan of “The Karate Kid” then “Cobra Kai” is worth checking out. There are many throwbacks, rivalries and all the stuff that made “The Karate Kid” the awesome movie it is. It shows that no matter how many demons you may have and how many times you have been beaten down, you can always get right back up again, because “Cobra Kai never dies.”</p>
<p>For a limited time, “Cobra Kai” is available for free on YouTube Premium.

<p>The tv series Cobra Kai has impressed and entertained lovers of the original Karate Kid film series and audiences worldwide.</p>
<p>The series has received critical acclaim for bringing back actors Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso and William Zabka as Johnny Lawrence. This brand new narrative pays homage to the films and Mr. Miyagi and the performances of the new cast members.</p>
<p>Who will return?</p>
<p>Ralph Macchio and William Zabka are returning to reprise their iconic characters. Xolo Maridueña, Tanner Buchanan, Courtney Henggeler, Mary Mouser, Jacob Bertrand, Gianni Decenzo, and Martin Kove.</p>
<p>How did the previous season end? What is the plot of the third season?</p>
<p>Johnny Lawrence ended up losing possession of the Cobra Kai dojo into his former instructor, John Kreese.</p>
<p>A guilt-ridden Johnny goes to the shore, where he throws his telephone into the sand. He didn’t observe that he received a Facebook friend petition from Ali Mills Schwarber, the ex-girlfriend of Lawrence and LaRusso (she was seen in the first Karate Kid film).</p>
<p>The plot of the third season is not shown yet, and lovers are eager to find out what happens next. With Kreese back, it is going to be intriguing to see how Johnny and Daniel manage the circumstance.</p>
<p>When is season three releasing?</p>
<p>The next season is scheduled to premiere in late 2020 or ancient 2021. There is not any launch date that is fixed yet.</p>
<p>What do we expect?</p>
<p>Johnny Lawrence is at rock-bottom as a jobless handyman, thirty years after their final confrontation at the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament. The thought he squandered his life. When Johnny adopts Miguel, a child, he has the inspiration to restart the Cobra Kai dojo that is notorious.</p>
<p>The very first season encloses with Miguel’s triumph when he beats contestants and wins the All-Valley Karate championship. The next season concluded with a war. The next season was all about the increasing tensions between the pupil of Miyagi-Do dojos and the Cobra Kai.</p>
<p>The upcoming season will be tremendously exciting. We may see two rivals, Daniel and Johnny, keeping aside their differences and working together for the frequent good. On the other hand, Daniel’s spouse does not want him to continue with Karate.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will find out more regarding the origin and philosophy of Miyagi and the martial arts of Cobra Kai.</p>

<h3 id="youtube-relinquishes-atlanta-produced-cobra-kai-which-may-end-up-on-hulu-or-netflix">&ldquo;YouTube relinquishes Atlanta-produced ‘Cobra Kai,” which may end up on Hulu or Netflix&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/rf/image_large/Pub/p11/AJC/2020/05/30/Images/Cobra%20Kai%20season%202%20another%20shot.jpeg" alt="img">
YouTube has decided to drop Atlanta-produced “Cobra Kai” and has let the production company Sony shop it to streaming services, according to an exclusive story on Deadline.com.</p>
<p>The first two seasons of “The Karate Kid” sequel series are available on the subscription service YouTube Premium and has been embraced by both critics and fans alike. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 94% positive rating from critics and 97% positive rating from fans.</p>
<p>The series brings back Ralph Macchio (Daniel LaRusso) and William Zabka (Johnny Lawrence) playing their original 1980s era characters as middle-aged adults who haven’t quite gotten over the past.</p>
<p>The trio of creators (two of whom did “Hot Tub Time Machine”) were all fans of the original films and have been able to infuse the new series with humor without sacrificing the heart.</p>
<p>The first episode of season two is free for everybody and has been seen, at least in part, 85 million times with 319,000 thumbs up versus 46,000 thumbs down.</p>
<p>Season three was also shot in metro Atlanta (but set in California) last year. It is finished and ready to go.</p>
<p>With no new production for the past two-plus months, the pool of original scripted shows will soon start drying up. Deadline says there’s major interest from the likes of Hulu and Netflix in part because this show already has a sizable following.</p>
<p>YouTube launched its subscription service in 2015 and invested in some scripted shows but by 2018 decided to focus more on reality programming while changing its name from YouTube Red to YouTube Premium.</p>
<p>According to Deadline, YouTube cleared the third season but did not commit to a fourth. Sony is hoping any new streaming service home will be willing to go beyond season three.</p>
