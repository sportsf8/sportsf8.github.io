<p>Broadway may still be shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but fans hoping to catch the hit musical Hamilton can stream it online beginning July 3rd on Disney+. As TV critic Alan Sepinwall recently wrote of this new filmed version of the stage production: “Each song, each scene seems meant for now. It’s not that Lin-Manuel Miranda and his collaborators were prescient, but that we’re a nation built on tragedy as much as triumph, and history has a nasty way of repeating itself. Still, by changing the lens through which we view that history, Hamilton points the way to what we hope can be a better future.”</p>
<p>In our latest “In My Room” episode, actor Okieriete “Oak” Onaodowan — who originated the roles of Hercules Mulligan and James Madison in the hit show — shares his Hamilton audition experience, how he got his “Oak” nickname, his first time attending a Broadway show, his first time quitting a job, his first nude photo shoot. He also discusses performing in playwright Young Jean Lee’s 2009 production of The Shipment, his love of comic books (especially the Hulk) and more.</p>
<p>Onaodowan currently plays Dean Miller in the ABC drama Station 19 (created by Shonda Rhimes) and has a supporting role in John Krasinski’s forthcoming A Quiet Place, Part II, which is currently set to release in September.

<h3 id="okieriete-onaodowan-interview-on-what-hamilton-means-to-him-today">&ldquo;Okieriete Onaodowan Interview: On What ‘Hamilton’ Means To Him Today&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Okieriete-Onaodowan.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
As Hamilton‘s longest-tenured original cast member – playing the duel role of both Hercules Mulligan and James Madison – Okieriete Onaodowan was there that night in December of 2016 when then Vice President-elect Mike Pence arrived for a show. For Onaodowan, it wasn’t just that Pence was there. Yes, the headlines that night were that a number of people in the crowd booed Pence. But for Onaodowan, he couldn’t stop thinking about the people there who cheered for Pence. As in, why in the world are you at Hamilton in the first place if you’re cheering Mike Pence? When I asked Onaodowan what was going through his mind that night as he performed for this particular crowd, the word he said was “rage.” And he repeated it six times. This weekend, Hamilton will finally be available for home consumption through Disney+. It’s a recording from 2016, with the original cast members at (as Onaodowan says) at the height of their powers. Filmed mostly in front of a live audience (some shots had to be done earlier that day), this is the first time people will have full access to what was, even still this year before Broadway shut down, one of the most difficult tickets to obtain. Onaodowan still holds out hope that people who see this show can still learn something from it, even though, no, it sure didn’t do anything to change Mike Pence. And Onaodowan explains, in the wake of George Floyd’s death and this national moment, what Hamilton means to him today. I don’t know if anyone’s ever told you this, but getting tickets to Hamilton was not easy. [Laughs] No one has ever told me that before. They should really let the people performing know this stuff. I never knew. We went in December of 2016 and you were one of the last original cast members still there. You were getting a lot of applause, like an athlete on a retirement tour. That’s a great analogy. That’s what it kind of felt like. It was like that, in his final season, and I want to do a backflip somewhere like, “Yep, I’m done. We’re out.”</p>
<p>So obviously a lot of people wanted to see this, and it’s important for people to see this. And they moved up the date. But should something like this had happened earlier? Or does this feel like the right time? I feel like what we’re experiencing is like eight things converging at once. It’s like, every week, for me, I think the significance of this dropping has changed. For a while it was COVID, and after George Floyd was murdered, the meaning, again, changed why it’s released early as opposed to later. And with where we are right now, I think it’s important for people to get this message: the message of it’s your duty stand up and say, “This is what America should be.” Not only that, you should work tirelessly to make sure that happens through legislation, through writing, through understanding the laws and making sure laws are passed. That’s basically what Hamilton did. The first number, you see him stand on a box and you see Burr push him out the way. And then he uses his words to break down what he’s saying and break down the crazy madness of what he’s saying and tell the people, “This is not it. This is not what your country should look like. This is not how the people who lead you should sound.” That sounds eerily reminiscent of what protesters are doing right now, of all shades and colors in response to the murder of George Floyd. That message, I think, is vital for people to come home to after a long day of their Twitter feed and Instagram feed and seeing all this madness and hearing the things that that man in the White House says and does. To put on entertainment and also get some medicine – also get some empowerment and also get a message that says, “It is now we have to do this. You have to speak up.” You mentioned the man in the White House. Where you still there when Mike Pence came to Hamilton? Yes, I was. What were you thinking that whole night? I mean, I can imagine… Rage. Just rage. Just rage, rage, rage, rage. Because in the beginning of the show, he entered and there were a lot of people cheering as well. There’s a Venn diagram of people who love Hamilton and people who love the man in the White House. It was just hard as an artist to think what I’m doing is promoting this message, in black and brown skin, telling our founding fathers’ story, and yet there were still people in there who are celebrating the arrival of Pence. It’s complicated and it’s hard. It’s really, really hard to know sometimes you may put art out, but it’s not necessarily interpreted the way that it’s intended. It’s actually not stopped me from still putting it out. It was a very tough and difficult show. It shouldn’t stop you. You said it’s difficult to wrap your mind around it… It’s hard. But how did you? Because the entire message of what you’re trying to say is the polar opposite of what this man represents.</p>
<p>You just do it. Exactly. And it’s hard to then perform for people that you saw cheering him, and now are in the front row looking at you. It’s like, “Yeah, dance for me.” But the whole point is you do it. How do you do it? You do it, like anyone who’s done anything that’s hard to any degree. Your purpose, your spirit and your will should take over. And my love and the intention behind creating the art, I will just focus on. I will have those feelings of apprehension and all that stuff, but at the end of the day, I know at my core why I’m doing it. You focus on that, focus on what got you there and what will keep you going. The people cheering wasn’t really in the press much. Because obviously the President made a big deal about people booing. But I imagine sitting that it might have been difficult to put on a show for those people who stand against everything with what the show means. It’s complicated. When Hillary came, people booed. People cheered and people also booed. I feel like I was able to see why Targets are on fire in that moment. It’s because people really do have a different definition of what this country needs, and it couldn’t be more representative in that room. But you do it anyway because there is a chance – and it’s the difference between people who hold faith in their heart and hold resentment – is there is a part of me that still hopes it’s like, “Well, we don’t know. All the data says this, but maybe Pence may turn around and do something different at the end.” That was one of the things. I was like, “I just have to focus on that today. I just have to focus on that instead, and hope and hope and hope.” I want to believe in the humanity of people that might still be in there and think, “Well, maybe he’ll learn a lesson from this.” And it just never seems to happens. I’m very pessimistic about these things. I mean, but this is hindsight. In the moment, that’s what I believed. It was tough, at least we got through it. History has shown us that was correct, it did not change his mind. My job is to perform. That’s it. Just to perform, regardless who’s out there, people out there or not. He was out there and it’s like, “I still have to do the thing.” Now, have you seen what’s going to be on Disney+? What a weird question to ask you. “Have you seen Hamilton?” [Laughs] That is weird. We had an opportunity to see the link. But Disney’s, to keep it super tight, we literally had 24 hours, just 24 hours to watch it and I wasn’t able to see all of it. I saw half of the show and, from what I saw, it’s just remarkable, again, to see it. In theater, we can never truly see what we make because when we step out, it’s going to change. Your understudy’s on, so everyone’s performance is different. It was lovely to see, to really see our show. I’ve seen versions of the show, but it was remarkable just to really see what everyone actually saw. And for me, it was just exciting to see the homeys do their thing because we’re normally backstage when someone’s on stage, or we’re onstage when someone’s having a moment. It was great to look and just to see what I’ve been hearing, to be able to look and see them in the moment and not just have to listen backstage or catch a glimpse from the sides. That was special. Were you given a heads up before that performance? Like, “This is going to be the performance of record, basically, for the rest of eternity”? Yeah, we shot it over like three days. So, yeah, we had a heads up. There was a lot of prep. There was a lot of talking. At the end of the week, some of the footage you see is, we shot it, and then actually performed that night. Some footage from that night, some footage is from a Monday where we had cameras on stage. It was a whole thing. And we had five days total of shooting, three days of actual performances, and then two days of catching things here and there. So yeah, we were prepped and we were ready and we were told, but it was beautiful because at that point, it was so ingrained in our bodies. It was just kind of perfect. We were cooking with gas. We were comfortable. I feel we gave one of the best shows because it was just right in the pocket.

<h3 id="what-time-does-hamilton-release-on-disney-plus-for-how-long-will-it-be-available-film-premiere-features-nj-talent">&ldquo;What time does ‘Hamilton’ release on Disney Plus? For how long will it be available? Film premiere features N.J. talent.&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/wobMfv6xeLCspZ6RTzdkijFYRFc=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/UFJOOCHTCZBH7HNOVS46LKNGRM.JPG" alt="img">
The big day is finally here for “Hamilton” fans — #Hamilfans — along with anyone who has longed to see the Broadway hit but hasn’t been able to catch the show.</p>
<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “Hamilton” was originally supposed to come to movie theaters, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused Disney to change its plans.</p>
<p>Unlike a string of movies whose premiere dates have been pushed back by as much as a year, “Hamilton” has been fast-tracked.</p>
<p>Disney announced in May that it would bring the film version of the Broadway show to Disney Plus on Friday, July 3. The streaming debut means the film arrives 16 months ahead of schedule. (In February, Miranda announced the production would debut in theaters Oct. 15, 2021.)</p>
<p>See below for the exact time(s) of the premiere and more.</p>
<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s gift in an ‘upside down’ world</p>
<p>“Hamilton,” which features non-white actors playing the Founding Fathers and other major characters, won 11 Tonys, including best musical, as well as a Grammy and a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
<p>Thomas Kail, the director of the Broadway show, filmed the production at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in June 2016, when Miranda still occupied the role of Alexander Hamilton.</p>
<p>“I’m so proud of how beautifully Tommy Kail has brought ‘Hamilton’ to the screen,” Miranda said in a May 12 statement announcing the Disney Plus premiere.</p>
<p>“He’s given everyone who watches this film the best seat in the house,” he said. “I’m so grateful to Disney and Disney Plus for reimagining and moving up our release to July 4th weekend of this year, in light of the world turning upside down. I’m so grateful to all the fans who asked for this, and I’m so glad that we’re able to make it happen. I’m so proud of this show. I can’t wait for you to see it.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Robert Iger, Disney’s executive chairman, said that no other work of art in the last decade has had the impact that “Hamilton” has.</p>
<p>“In light of the extraordinary challenges facing our world, this story about leadership, tenacity, hope, love and the power of people to unite against the forces of adversity is both relevant and impactful,” Iger said. “We are thrilled to bring this phenomenon to Disney Plus on the eve of Independence Day, and we have the brilliant Lin-Manuel Miranda and the team behind ‘Hamilton’ to thank for allowing us to do so more than a year before planned.”</p>
<p>The ‘Hamilton’ cast</p>
<p>Here’s the full list of main cast members for the film version of “Hamilton”:</p>
<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton, the nation’s first secretary of the treasury (who died in a New Jersey duel).</p>
<p>Daveed Diggs as Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>Renée Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler</p>
<p>Leslie Odom Jr. as Aaron Burr</p>
<p>Christopher Jackson as George Washington</p>
<p>Jonathan Groff as King George</p>
<p>Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton</p>
<p>Jasmine Cephas Jones as Peggy Schuyler/Maria Reynolds</p>
<p>Okieriete Onaodowan as Hercules Mulligan/James Madison</p>
<p>Anthony Ramos as John Laurens/Philip Hamilton</p>
<p>Okieriete Onaodowan, who plays Hercules Mulligan and James Madison in the film version of &ldquo;Hamilton&rdquo; premiering on Disney Plus. Onaodowan grew up in West Orange.Alex Remnick | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com</p>
<p>What time is the ‘Hamilton’ premiere? How long will it be available?</p>
<p>Don’t think July 3 means midnight on July 3 — that’s not the case for everyone. Viewers here on the East Coast may choose to watch the next day instead of in the middle of the night (unless they have been counting down the seconds, of course).</p>
<p>“Hamilton” is set to premiere at 3 a.m. ET and 12 a.m. PT on Friday, July 3, according to a Disney Plus spokeswoman.</p>
<p>There will also be a watch party on Twitter where cast members will be tweeting along. The party starts at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT on Friday, July 3. You can follow along at the hashtag #Hamilfilm.</p>
<p>As for how long “Hamilton” will be on Disney Plus? So far there’s no end date for the film, so feel free to watch it on repeat to your heart’s content, or save it for another day.</p>
<p>Disney Plus is $6.99 a month or $69.99 a year alone, and $12.99 a month in combination with Hulu and ESPN Plus.</p>
<p>Calling all HAMILFANS: ⭐️ Tune in to the Hamilton watch party tomorrow starting at 4:00pm PT/7:00pm ET! ⭐️ #Hamilfilm https://t.co/XqxEg1HDUG — Disney+ (@disneyplus) July 2, 2020</p>
<p>N.J.‘s ‘Hamilton’ star</p>
<p>Okieriete Onaodowan, who grew up in West Orange, plays larger-than-life spy Hercules Mulligan and the more quiet James Madison in the film version of the Broadway production.</p>
<p>“Ideally I wanted it to be a double take,” Onaodowan told NJ Advance Media in 2016. “I wanted you to forget and that at some point realize it’s the same person.”</p>
<p>Onaodowan, 32, originated the roles during the show’s off-Broadway run at The Public Theater before “Hamilton” came to Broadway in 2015.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other New Jersey connections in the story of Alexander Hamilton, one being that his fatal duel with Aaron Burr took place in Weehawken July 11, 1804.</p>
<p>Onaodowan recently told Uproxx that the film version of the show was captured over three days of performances.</p>
<p>The alumnus of West Orange High School was performing in November 2016 on the night Mike Pence, then vice president-elect, was in the audience.</p>
<p>Tonight, VP-Elect Mike Pence attended #HamiltonBway. After the show, @BrandonVDixon delivered the following statement on behalf of the show. pic.twitter.com/Jsg9Q1pMZs — Hamilton (@HamiltonMusical) November 19, 2016</p>
<p>Onaodowan told Uproxx he felt “rage” at the time as people in the crowd cheered for Pence.</p>
<p>“It was just hard as an artist to think what I’m doing is promoting this message, in black and brown skin, telling our Founding Fathers’ story, and yet there were still people in there who are celebrating the arrival of Pence,” he said. “It’s complicated and it’s hard.”</p>
<p>At the end of the show, Brandon Victor Dixon, who played Aaron Burr, delivered a message to Pence.</p>
<p>“We, sir — we — are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,” he said. “But we truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.”</p>
<p>President Donald Trump called the statement harassment in a tweet and demanded an apology.</p>

The #Hamilcountdown continues! As the world gets ready to experience the phenomenon that is Hamilton from their homes, BroadwayWorld is checking in with its stars ahead of the release on Disney+.</p>
<p>Not sure how to tune in on July 3rd? Let BroadwayWorld be your guide!</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s guest needs no introduction&hellip; Hercules Mulligan Okieriete Onaodowan! Richard Ridge chats with Oak about favorite Hamilton memories and how the show changed his life.</p>
<p>How excited are you that Hamilton was filmed?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited now more than ever with what&rsquo;s happening today. With the murder of George Floyd, people really need to understand that to make great change, not only do we have to speak about it, but we have to write about it. What made Hamilton Hamilton was that he stood on a box and spoke up. A lot of people- old people, middle-aged people- are in the streets saying the same thing. I think America should not look the way that it looks. So that&rsquo;s the most exciting thing about this film coming out&hellip; I take pride that that&rsquo;s in it&rsquo;s DNA.</p>
<p>What does it mean to you that Hamilton will be reaching such a wide audience?</p>
<p>It means more people might really understand that the birth of this nation was from people saying, &ldquo;This is not the America that I know. This is not the way it should be.&rdquo; And speaking out and fighting for it&hellip; many countries around the world still struggle with this. We&rsquo;re more advanced than other countries and some other countries are still in the throws of that, so I think it&rsquo;s a message to everyone all over the planet needs to hear.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve taken so many people of so many different ages and races to come see the show and I just want you to talk about what makes Hamilton more relevant than ever in these times that we are currently living in&hellip;</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;ll circle back to the first question. That&rsquo;s what makes it so relevant: the message. The message saying &ldquo;Speak up! If you don&rsquo;t believe this is how things should be, use your voice, be as loud as you can, and most importantly find like-minded people!&rdquo; I think another great message is that you don&rsquo;t have to do it alone. It takes the work of many to create one great thing. The show is a testament of that as well.</p>
<p>Have you seen it yet Oak?</p>
<p>I have not had a chance to finish it yet. They gave us a very very short window of time. It&rsquo;s very hush-hush! They literally gave us 24 hours to watch it with the link and unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to see all of it in that 24-hour span. From what I saw though, it was great!</p>
<p>Who will you be watching it with?</p>
<p>By myself, just so I can fully have the experience. It&rsquo;s interesting. What we do in theatre is unlike film or any other medium. We can never really truly see the work that we made because we&rsquo;re in in. So even when we step out to watch an understudy perform, we can never truly see what it is. So this will be an experience I&rsquo;ve never had and I want to be by myself so I can just have it and I don&rsquo;t have to think, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Let me have it first for myself to see what it&rsquo;s like. It&rsquo;s such a wholly knew experience for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always said to actors I wish you could step out of your skin and see what we see as an audience member. I can&rsquo;t wait for you to see the impact that your performance and everyone&rsquo;s performance and the impact Hamilton has on people.</p>
<p>Yea and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m most excited about. I think it&rsquo;ll be good for people who didn&rsquo;t necessarily want it to be known that they&rsquo;re gonna see Hamilton or maybe hated on Hamilton quietly by themselves. I like the idea that they can now watch it alone and really get an idea of what it was.</p>
<p>How has Hamilton changed your life?</p>
<p>In every way shape and form. As artists, we will always do what we do. It&rsquo;s just whether or not we have the spotlight on us, you know? For actors that came out of nowhere, it&rsquo;s like&hellip; no they&rsquo;ve been doing good work for a long time, it&rsquo;s just fortunately now there&rsquo;s a spotlight on them. I think we&rsquo;ve all changed because we&rsquo;ve been working at such a high caliber. Hamilton was a lovely way to say, &ldquo;Hey, look at these hard-working people. Everyone pay attention to these hardworking people.&rdquo; We had that light&hellip; it just opened doors. It opened many many doors that would have taken me longer to open.</p>
<p>At what point during the process did you realize how important the show was gonna be?</p>
<p>The interesting thing about theater is you never know. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen readings or workshops of something and thought this is amazing and then it just disappears. By the time it gets to Broadway it&rsquo;s been modified and changed. So for me, I was like, &ldquo;This is really dope!&rdquo; from the first time I heard the demo. When I really realized that the rest of the world agreed with me was at The Public Theater. It was one week Weird Al came, the Clintons came, Dick Cheney came, Busta Rhymes came and Qtip came. I was like: &ldquo;What?!&rdquo; There&rsquo;s nothing I can think of in the world that would have all of those people nodding yes. When that happened, I was like, &ldquo;Ok, this is a thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What do you remember about that first performance at The Public with an audience that night?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rough, cause I can&rsquo;t! [Laughs] I don&rsquo;t actually know cause I can&rsquo;t really remember remember. In hindsight, I feel like it was more of an excitement to just see what this is, because in theatre the last member of any production is the audience. You don&rsquo;t know what you have until it&rsquo;s done in front of people. I feel like that first night was the final nail in the coffin. The final dotted I, the last little bit that we needed to know exactly what is this really. So it&rsquo;s just excitement and pure curiosity.</p>
<p>Talk about the audience and some of those favorite moments for you meeting audience members.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re so effusive with their love&hellip; theatre fans. I&rsquo;m a big comic book fan and there&rsquo;s a lot of parallels with them that they&rsquo;re just dedicated and loyal. There&rsquo;s not many people for the most part, before Hamilton&hellip; musicals were a niche thing. They&rsquo;re just very loyal and dedicated and my favorite memory is this couple who are historians. They would come and give me these old books about James Madison. I have an old book that was published in like 1912 or 1920 about his life. They were historians and just so excited. They would bring their students and come backstage and I grew to know this couple. They&rsquo;re just so loving and warm. I put a lot of value in old things, weathered things, so I was just so moved that they would share this with me. I&rsquo;d say that would be my favorite interaction.</p>
<p>It must be really great too because I thought I knew everything about American History until I saw Hamilton and I realized there was so much more going on that you don&rsquo;t really learn about it school. Did you know the whole story of Hamilton before you got involved in this?</p>
<p>I knew nothing of American History because I didn&rsquo;t pay attention to American History in school. Because I did not see myself in American History in school. So I learned a lot. I think the one thing I took away from this musical- really learning how the inception of this country was and really learning what went into it and how it just didn&rsquo;t include me. It just didn&rsquo;t include black people at all in its inception. And learning of all the things it did include, and how all the laws were formed&hellip; all the things Hamilton wrote in and just realizing that all this came from like three minds! It came from a few dudes&rsquo; ideas and we&rsquo;re still governed by that today. It just kind of blew my mind.</p>
<p>If you could sum up the best part of the experience of working on Hamilton what has it been for you?</p>
<p>The cast. This group of people. It&rsquo;s almost as if you took the hardest working person from every show and just put them in that room. Every person in that room was always the hardest working person in their shows. That&rsquo;s why. Every time I had a dope idea like, &ldquo;We can do this!&rdquo; There were five people already saying yes and, and vice versa. We really were working and figuring out how to maximize finding the best way and we didn&rsquo;t stop. Everyone everyday showed up and gave everything they could and was fully focused and dedicated to one goal. I have never seen that before in my entire career- so many people dedicated to one thing.</p>
<p>Many people who are going to see Hamilton have never been to anything live. They&rsquo;ve never been to the theater to see something live happen in front of them. Because of Hamilton they&rsquo;re now entering this world of live theatre, it&rsquo;s gonna change their lives forever&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s incredible, because at my core and at my heart, I come from a theatre background and as an actor, that is home. It meant the world to see kids excited about theatre. That&rsquo;s the great thing about Hamilton for me is to see young people who wouldn&rsquo;t normally think theatre is cool being really excited about how it works and getting involved. I think the movie is kind of a dope live version of something. Everyone&rsquo;s so used to listening to the record, but you love a live version for all the nuances, all the idiosyncrasies, all the differences that you wouldn&rsquo;t expect. I think for a lot of people they&rsquo;ll realize that&rsquo;s the appeal of going to live theatre. I think some folks think it&rsquo;s musicals are just the track. They don&rsquo;t understand how alive it is; how much it breathes; how much it&rsquo;s different. I think this is the best way they can highlight it by listening to the record and then watching it and saying, &ldquo;Oh, I loved the fact that that wasn&rsquo;t exactly on beat!&quot;, &ldquo;I loved the fact that he paused a little bit in this moment!&rdquo; &ldquo;I love the fact that they did it differently!&rdquo; And then hopefully that will make them want to go see things and experience those subtle nuances and changes that happen naturally.</p>

Kelly Clarkson performed a powerful rendition of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quiet Uptown&rdquo; from the hit Broadway musical Hamilton on her Thursday show ahead of the musical&rsquo;s release on Disney Plus.</p>
<p>The talk show host also interviewed some of the original cast members, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr., and Daveed Diggs.</p>
<p>Kelly Clarkson&rsquo;s latest &ldquo;Kellyoke&rdquo; cover has us reaching for the tissues.</p>
<p>On Thursday&rsquo;s episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, the singer and host performed a haunting rendition of &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quiet Uptown&rdquo; from the hit Broadway musical Hamilton.</p>
<p>This content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p>
<p>Kelly&rsquo;s powerhouse voice was a perfect fit for the heart-wrenching song, which she also previously recorded for The Hamilton Mixtape, a 2016 album featuring famous artists covering songs from the musical. Kelly&rsquo;s new cover comes ahead of the highly anticipated debut of a filmed version of the musical on the Disney+ streaming platform on Friday.</p>
<p>Kelly also welcomed several members of the original cast to her show on Thursday, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Leslie Odom Jr., Daveed Diggs, Phillipa Soo, Okieriete Onaodowan, and Christopher Jackson.</p>
<p>The host asked the stars to spill some &ldquo;family secrets,&rdquo; and learned that Leslie regularly hosted wild dance parties offstage while Lin-Manuel was performing.</p>
<p>“I would look over and be like, ‘What’s happening stage right?’ and they’d be like…,” Lin-Manuel explained with a laugh, waving his hands in the air to imitate his cast mates dancing.</p>
<p>Lin-Manuel also revealed that Daveed took shots of liquor directly out of the golden gramophone after the cast won for Best Musical Theatre Album in 2016.</p>
<p>This cast sure knows how to have a good time! We love seeing them all together again and we can&rsquo;t wait to catch Hamilton on Disney+ this weekend! In the meantime, we&rsquo;ll be playing Kelly&rsquo;s &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Quiet Uptown&rdquo; cover on repeat for as long as our hearts can stand it.</p>
