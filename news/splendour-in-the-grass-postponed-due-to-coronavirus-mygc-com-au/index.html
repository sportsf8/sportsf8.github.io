<p>Byron Bay’s iconic Splendour In The Grass has been postponed following moves to ban mass gatherings of more than 500 people.</p>
<p>The festival, originally set down for July, has been rescheduled to October 23-25.</p>
<p>Up to 50,000 people were expected to attend the event which will celebrate its 20th year.</p>

<p>“Health and safety is our number one priority. After careful consideration and consultation with our artists, crew and stakeholders, in these unpredictable times we have decided, as a precautionary measure, to move Splendour in the Grass 2020 out of the winter months,” organisers said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are not expecting any major upsets to the line-up thanks to the incredible support of the artists playing Splendour. Flume, The Strokes and Tyler, The Creator who have all confirmed their attendance for these new dates alongside most others.</p>
<p>“As this is moving quickly and we work through the detail there will be some programming changes but we are confident that rescheduling to October — a one off Spring edition of Splendour — is the best way to ensure we present the Splendour experience you all know and love.</p>
<p>“We understand that many of our patrons have already made plans for July and we trust local accommodation and travel providers will act in the best interests of all to accommodate these changes without penalty. Huge thanks for your ongoing support and we’ll see you in October.”</p>
<p>Anyone who has already purchased tickets but is unable to attend the rescheduled event will be able to apply for a refund.</p>
<p>Organisers plan a new ticket release in coming weeks.
