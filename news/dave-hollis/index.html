<p>撰文：郭誠涵／微光日常</p>
<p>當新冠肺炎疫情剛開始爆發時，人在日本的我，因為兩個妹妹都在北京，而得以及早接到消息。家人們密切地跟進疫情發展，並且見證了它從中國蔓延到全球。我幸運地能用家人們的抗疫經驗，平衡日本社會相對遲滯的反應；而當中國漸漸控制住疫情時，我稍感安心──知道妹妹們已經歷過我正在經歷的一切，從結果看來，平安脫險是可能的。</p>
<p>然而，近日的一則臉書貼文，卻讓我的心在數月以來初次跌落谷底。寫下這則貼文的是一位來自紐約醫院加護病房的年輕護理師 KP，在這則 1,700 字的貼文裡，他深入描寫自己如何度過這段日子。細節之外，這則貼文的核心，在於調解個人期望與現實落差的艱難：待在垂死病患身邊的各種情緒、無法提供援助的痛苦、擔心自己也送命的恐懼，以及這一切如何在每一天、或許每一小時，蠶食著他對醫療體系與這個世界的信念。這段文字令人不忍卒睹，也令我心碎。</p>
<p>此刻住在日本感覺像是身處一個平行次元。當然，這個國家較諸其他國家，一直都有那麼點超現實；但如今這種感覺更甚以往。當整個世界數周來都在極盡所能地踐行社交距離，日本才在 3 月底宣布奧運延期之後，跟上世界的步伐。無怪乎疫情在日本益發嚴重，而這感覺一點也不「真實」。</p>
<p>KP 的貼文，令人感到一切都真實了起來。</p>
<p>我一直試著讓生活保持輕鬆，用每日規律來製造某種正常。孤身在異國，堅守社交距離並不容易，但一些簡單的快樂（比如在陽光的沐浴下泡杯茶）讓隔離的日子變得可以忍受。</p>
<p>我和許多人一樣，花了大量時間在追憶過去生活的樣子，並且盼望著疫情過去。但隨著時間推移，無所事事地坐在那裡、腦中重複播放著這些想法，變得越來越困難。當然，我們並非在前線承擔壓力，我們只負責「坐冷板凳」（完全就是字面上的意思）（註），但我要求自己得有更多反思。</p>
<p>自然地，我們可以得出很多簡單的結論。過去幾個月的時間，加速從傳統工作模式過渡到遠端／電話工作。公司和組織只花了數月，就達成了新一階段的數位化，而這在過去通常得花數年才能完成。然而當我們為科技進展所帶來的成功鼓掌，也被迫檢驗和重估健保系統的穩固性。我想你我都能同意，我們從中學到了嚴厲的一課：當這一切都結束，對很多國家來說，與其修補原本的系統，打造新系統最為可行。</p>
<p>「在迫切地回歸日常之際，也利用這時間，思考哪一部份的日常值得你迫切回歸。」圖／Shutterstock</p>
<p>那麼，個人又能從這次經驗中學到什麼呢？</p>
<p>我對 KP 貼文的其中一段印象深刻：</p>
<p>「我今年 24 歲。是紐約市加護病房的護理師。目前還很健康，所以寫遺囑對我來說，應該是連想都不用想。但就在昨天，我終於接受事實，明白自己死亡的可能性，在機率上比我過去想像的還要更有說服力。」</p>
<p>這讓我震撼，不過不是因為死亡的迫近，而是為我們竟從未認真思考過這件事：</p>
<p>無論在什麼年紀，我們都傾向閃避死亡的話題。在醫療資源和科學研究的幫助下，人類的平均壽命在過去幾個世紀不斷增加。但沒有人曾真正破解出一種技術，能具體衡量或預測一個人生命的長度。為什麼有些人的心臟就是停止了跳動，而有些人卻彷彿騙過了命運？一定程度的預防措施和健康習慣也許能延年益壽，但公平地說，人生路上最大的挑戰之一，是我們永遠無法確知我們將在何時、以何種方式死去。</p>
<p>一般人面對這個議題的心態是乾脆忽略。既然多花時間和腦力也無法增加「破解密碼」的可能性，最簡單的方法就是忽略。是的，我們都認知到死亡不可避免，但從沒有多想，也假定不會發生在今天，或者是最近的任何時刻。</p>
<p>這為我們想要如何度過人生，以及如何為不同需求與責任分出優先次序定調。記得自己曾一次又一次地，掙扎著平衡學業、工作和與家人相處的時光，或者其他我自認高度重視的優先事項。後面兩項通常必須因其他「更迫切的事物」被置後，而我合理化一切的依據，是假定人生還有很多時間。</p>
<p>如果說有什麼是這次新冠肺炎在我身上留下的印記，那就是意識到必須重估這個心態，並且承認自己一直對死亡視而不見──我們永遠不知道明天將如何，而生命在這些轉瞬而逝的時刻中可能終結。持續上升的死亡人數、前線作戰者的自白，和無盡的救護車警笛聲，都持續地提醒著我們這一點。</p>
<p>當然我們現實上無法將每一天都當作最後一天在過，但也不應過得彷彿自己的生命永無盡頭──這就是我在疫情中學到的一堂課。</p>
<p>這段日子裡主導我的兩種情緒──在未知的壓力下為自己的性命擔憂，和感到被愛、被照顧或者純粹活著的小確幸──都強化了這個新的價值觀。恐懼驅使我探尋什麼是我所珍惜的，而微小的幸福提醒了我生命需要的何其地少，並確定過去的那些執念已完全無關緊要，真正重要的事物成為了新的優先事項。</p>
<p>我仍希望我們都能平安度過疫情──也許這將在經歷過幾次情緒的雲霄飛車，和一些艱難的決定後到來，而那時我們都將更變得更好、更堅強。</p>
<p>「在迫切地回歸日常之際，也利用這時間，思考哪一部份的日常值得你迫切回歸。」──Dave Hollis</p>
<p>譯註：一語雙關。英文原意指球員在比賽中未被派上場，也指在職場上被冷落、被邊緣化；此處指防疫期間，平民百姓非前線人員，只能在家隔離、無法正面抗疫，也真的只能「坐在家裡」。</p>

<h3 id="get-out-of-your-own-way-by-dave-hollis-book-review">&ldquo;Get Out of Your Own Way, by Dave Hollis book review&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HXGBYDTKBQI6VK7PAIHQQ2R7VM.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
“Now that’s a master class in effective passive-aggression. And thank God for that,” Dave writes, strangely triumphant. Passive-aggression can be effective, no doubt. But only in Hollisville will you find somebody who’ll tell you it’s the path to a healthy marriage.</p>
<p>And yet, a whole lot of people want to be in Hollisville. Rachel’s two self-help books, “Girl, Wash Your Face” (2018) and “Girl, Stop Apologizing” (2019), have sold millions of copies, serving as the backbone of a media and lifestyle company that includes podcasts, clothing, journals and motivational conferences, where VIP tickets can go for more than $1,000 a pop. (Those on a budget can watch the Hollises do their best Kelly-and-Ryan gabfest routine on Facebook Live.)</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The daughter of a Pentecostal preacher, Rachel Hollis originally used women’s church groups as the model for her brand of motivational speaking. Over time, though, her rhetoric has become less churchy and more Oprah you-go-girl — with a more aggressive spin. There’s no room for excuses here, Hollis tells us in her books, live appearances and relentless social media posts: We’re all going to wake up before dawn and punch complacency in the face.</p>
<p>In 2018, Dave left his job as head of global distribution at Disney to serve as CEO of Rachel’s burgeoning empire, becoming more of a fixture at her events. In that light, “Get Out of Your Own Way” is mainly an act of brand extension, an attempt to bring men into the fold. Like “Girl, Wash Your Face,” “Get Out of Your Own Way” is broken down into chapters meant to debunk the “lies we tell ourselves.” Adapted for guys, this includes: “My Work Is Who I Am,” “Failure Means You’re Weak,” “I Need to Parent Like My Parents.” His wisdom on these matters, per the Hollis brand, is almost entirely self-generated: The occasional expert insight comes from other self-help books like “The 5 Love Languages” or business-leader airplane reads.</p>
<p>What Dave Hollis lacks in authority he tries to make up for in attitude, adopting a persona as the grown-up frat boy who’s been brought down to earth. Mostly down to earth, anyway. Chapters often open with a boast of some sort: He was “a great baseball player growing up”; he’s negotiated deals that “involved the biggest names in brands and entertainment”; he was “valedictorian at my high school”; he was “a nerd growing up.” (Yes, that’s a boast. In 2020, being a “nerd” just means you like Marvel Comics movies, and Dave was literally responsible for getting those movies into theaters.) Naturally, he faces reckonings for all those boasts, but his humblings are always about how he found his way to newer, shinier things to boast about.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>It’s in talking about his learning process that things get odd with Dave Hollis. He seems to take a masochistic pleasure in Rachel’s tough-love lectures, sharing an always-be-closing email she sent him demanding that he step up his game: “You are massively talented — and it’s not going to be enough to get you where you want to be or this company where we want it to go. We grow like warriors as fast as our business does, or we’ll never turn it into what we know it can be. I love you.” (This message, he writes, was “magic.” )</p>
<p>But Dave’s path to enlightenment usually only requires Dave. The Hollises promote a philosophy of hardcore bootstrapping — there is little that’s wrong with you that can’t be fixed by digging deeper into yourself. That includes problem drinking, which Dave learned to manage after another drill-sergeant lecture from Rachel (“Stop talking about it and start doing something about it. You are in control of your life.”), a home gym, and buddies who “encourage me to drink the crap out of my sparkling water.”</p>
<p>Hollis acknowledges that help can sometimes be useful. He mentions his coming around to therapy in a reformed-caveman sort of way. (“Who needs therapy? Before I went, I was positive I knew the answer. Crazy people. Weak people. Broken people. . . . Not men.”) And in the sole chapter that reflects some genuine humility — truly, he could have written a whole book about it, a good book — he’s thankful for the support system that guided him and Rachel through their oft-frustrating efforts to adopt a child.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But the Hollis way is to attract a crowd, not create a community. The main path to glory in Hollisville is steroidal self-reliance, rooted in extreme honesty about your shortcomings. Honesty is a virtue of course, but for all the Hollises’ talk about extreme candor, their vulnerability is almost always a function of image management. Success, Dave writes, demands “being conscious at all times of how your actions and your hoped-for reception align to deliver the personal brand you aspire to.” Vulnerability is meaningful only to the extent that it sells. One senses that if vulnerability stopped selling for the Hollises, they’d soon pivot to selling something else.</p>
<p>Every chapter of “Get Out of Your Own Way” closes with a takeaway section headlined “Things That Helped Me.” At first this seems like an act of modesty, an acknowledgment that what worked for him won’t necessarily work for you. But ultimately it’s narcissistic, a way for him to tell stories about his ongoing “growth” and “fulfillment” — the mountains he climbed, the revenue targets he hit — and frame it as actionable advice. Success, in Hollisville, isn’t becoming a better person who’s more engaged with the world. It’s craven careerism. It’s admiration and money. It’s running your flaws through a sparkly Instagram filter. It’s thinking you’re improving when spite dangles off your wife’s wrist.</p>

As we ease into the next phase of this pandemic and the new normal it seems appropriate to reevaluate what is important in our lives. There were a lot of interesting messages presented on social media in the past few months. The one that caught my eye was a quote by motivational speaker Dave Hollis who said, “in the rush to return to normal, use this time to consider which parts of normal are worth rushing back to.”</p>
<p>This idea draws in to question the lessons we learned about ourselves and life as we faced change at a rapid and often confusing rate. Adjusting to new routines and recommendations, with more time on our own, allowed many of us to explore what means the most to us and what perhaps we may be able to live without. I hear people talking about knowing they want to make more time for friends and hugs. How happy they are to have slowed down and not felt compelled to be involved in so many events that they sacrifice time for themselves. Others shared that they worked on projects at home, considered growing food or supporting local food suppliers and businesses. I also heard stories of people simply getting through it. All of these experiences are okay. Exploring new options in your life does not have to be a big project with huge noticeable results or big changes. It can simply be to sit with the less complicated and make room for you and the things you enjoy. These changes might not necessarily mean that you do more, it might actually mean you do less. As you reflect on the past three months and life moving forward consider the following questions:</p>
<p>What do you want to hang on to, what can you let go?</p>
<p>What surprised you about pandemic life?</p>
<p>What changes do you want to make in your life?</p>
<p>The months ahead may be difficult for many. Our economic structure is not strong, individuals are worried about their futures and we are still uncertain about what lies ahead. Taking this into consideration I ask you to ponder what you learned about yourself so far and your ability to handle what comes. Sometimes a reminder that you have gotten through every difficult challenge to date can be helpful. Try to avoid pretending that everything is okay and pushing thoughts and feelings aside, they have a way of catching up with you. There is not a single event in history that we have not bounced back from. As a society we are far more resilient than we may feel in the moments of crisis.</p>
<p>As this column comes to a close, I would like to take a moment and send appreciation to all the individuals who asked for help during the past few months or who took time to invest in themselves and their mental wellness. This might have been in the form of talking to a friend or professional. Reading a book or listening to a podcast or in finding time alone to reflect on life. Choosing you and engaging in self compassion is admirable. I would also like to send a thank you to all the professionals and volunteers who are diligently working within the field of mental health during this pandemic. To all the counsellors, therapists, child and youth mental health counsellors, social workers, addictions counsellors, psychiatric nurses, mental health clinicians, crisis line volunteers, psychologists, life coaches, RCMP members and affiliates, community liaisons, pastors, psychiatrists and physicians, support workers and anyone who gave time and energy to support someone in need of emotional or mental health care, you are amazing and your efforts over the past few months have not gone unnoticed.</p>
