<p>Kim Soo-hyun is returning to the small screen for the first time in five years with tvN’s new romantic comedy series It’s Okay to Not Be Okay set to start airing next week.</p>
<p>The upcoming weekend series is the first television role for the 31-year-old since he was discharged from the military last July. His most recent TV credits include The Producers in 2015 and My Love From the Star in 2013.</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting for so long, I’m really nervous but also excited to come back,” Kim said Wednesday during a promotional media event. The event was livestreamed due to concerns over COVID-19.</p>
<p>In the series about people living with mental illness, Kim plays Gang-tae, who works as a caretaker in the psychiatric ward of a hospital. Gang-tae, who also cares for his autistic brother at home, is reluctant to pursue any romantic relationships.</p>
<p>Actress Seo Ye-ji plays Mun-young, a bestselling children’s book author who has a personality disorder. While Mun-young is apparently unable to love anyone, Gang-tae seems to be able to melt her cold heart as the two become a source of healing for each other.</p>
<p>“(Mun-young) pursues a unique style. It’s not to show off herself but it’s like a defense mechanism. She’s telling people to not to approach her or talk to her,” Seo said.</p>
<p>Actor Oh Jeong-sae, who recently won best supporting actor on television at the Baeksang Arts Awards for his role in the KBS drama When the Camellia Blooms, stars as Gang-tae’s older brother Sang-tae. Rookie actress Park Gyu-young stars as a nurse who falls for Gang-tae.</p>

<p>“I think the title says it all. I feel everyone, including myself, in this world is a little bit mad in some ways and I wanted to take the chance to think about whether this is actually bad or not,” the series’ director, Park Sin-woo, said.</p>
<p>Park previously produced the 2018 series Encounter, featuring Song Hye-kyo and Park Bo-gum, and SBS’ Don’t Dare to Dream, starring Gong Hyo-jin and Cho Jung-seok.</p>
<p>Quoting screenwriter Jo Yong, Park said the drama was “an apology to people with disabilities”.</p>
<p>“We often judge other people and hurt them, and the writer says she wrote the script based on her own experiences, wanting to face those people properly,” the director said.</p>
<p>“I hope that, after watching the 16 episodes, people will want to befriend disabled people rather than trying to help them,” Oh said.</p>
<p>“I wanted to show how Gang-tae is healed of his inner wounds,” Kim said. “There are many different stories and forms of love in the drama, and I hope the viewers can also heal their own wounds following them,” Kim said.

During a press conference for It&rsquo;s Okay to Not Be Okay, the main leads Kim Soo-hyun and Seo Ye-ji spoke candidly on how it was to work with each other. Read below to know what the co-stars had to share on their working experience.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;re inching closer to the premiere date of the highly-awaited tvN drama, It&rsquo;s Okay to Not Be Okay, a press conference for the series was held in South Korea and in attendance were cast members Kim Soo-hyun, Seo Ye-ji, Oh Jung-se and Park Kyu-young along with director Park Shin-woo. For the unversed, It&rsquo;s Okay Not To Be Okay is based on Moon Kang-tae and Go Moon-young. The former is a community health worker at a psychiatric ward while the latter is a children&rsquo;s storybook writer with an antisocial personality disorder.</p>
<p>One thing that fans are looking forward to is the sizzling chemistry between the leads - Soo-hyun and Ye-ji. The trailer and teasers that have come out so far promise us a rebellious, spooky love story that we are going to be instantly hooked on to. During the press conference, when Soo-hyun was asked about his working experience with Ye-ji, the 32-year-old actor gushed, &ldquo;We feel very comfortable with each other normally but when she’s acting in front of the camera, it’s like Go Moon-young immediately comes out. I get goosebumps. I receive energy from her in that way and feel greatly motivated by her.</p>
<p>Ye-ji mirrored her co-star&rsquo;s stance as the 30-year-old actress added, &ldquo;As he just said, we’re very comfortable together but when he starts acting, he gets incredibly focused. It’s made me think, &lsquo;That’s why he&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Kim Soo Hyun,&rsquo;&rsquo; and he’s a great help to me.&rdquo;</p>

tvN’s upcoming drama “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” has released new stills of Kim Soo Hyun and Kang Ki Doong, who play best friends in the drama.</p>
<p>“It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” is the love story of Moon Kang Tae (Kim Soo Hyun), a community health worker at a psychiatric ward, and Go Moon Young (Seo Ye Ji), a children’s storybook writer with antisocial personality disorder. Oh Jung Se will play Moon Sang Tae, Moon Kang Tae’s older brother who has autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p>
<p>In the drama, Moon Kang Tae lives a far-from-leisurely life, and as a result doesn’t get along well with others, nor does he form deep relationships. But he does have his best friend Jo Jae Soo (Kang Ki Doong), the one person he shares his life’s ups and downs with. The two became friends when they were younger and both delivering chicken, and unlike Moon Kang Tae, Jo Jae Soo is incredibly talkative and can’t stay quiet for more than three seconds.</p>
<p>In the new stills, the two friends appear to be hashing big plans and show off their ease with each other as they celebrate and Jae Soo pulls a smile out of his quiet friend.</p>
<p>“It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” premieres June 20 at 9 p.m. KST.</p>

<p><img src="https://6.viki.io/image/7f6996a3b8524b39a5cf7c63998ab3fc.jpeg?s=900x600&amp;e=t" alt="img">
The cast of “It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” talked about working on set together and more!</p>
<p>“It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” is a “slightly strange romantic comedy” with Kim Soo Hyun playing Moon Kang Tae, a community health worker at a psychiatric ward, and Seo Ye Ji playing Go Moon Young, a children’s storybook writer with antisocial personality disorder. A press conference for the tvN drama was held on June 10, featuring Director Park Shin Woo and actors Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Ye Ji, Oh Jung Se, and Park Gyu Young.</p>
<p>The drama includes fantasy elements and features famous fairy tales such as “The Red Shoes” and “Bluebeard,” as well as tales for adults that were made just for the show. Director Park Shin Woo said, “The female lead character is a writer of cruel fairy tales. The drama is similar to such fairy tales in that they both blur the distinction between normal and abnormal, and common sense and senselessness.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that he thinks that everyone in the world is a bit crazy, and that the drama will give people the opportunity to reflect on themselves. “The core message of the drama is, ‘You have to look at people as they are,'” he said.</p>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun is making his return with his first starring role in a drama since he was discharged from the military. When asked if he’s changed after experiencing military life, Kim Soo Hyun said, “I went to the military late in life. That was really advantageous for me. It felt a bit like a break, and most importantly, my physical stamina improved. That gives me a bit more freedom. There are still things I’m lacking when it comes to acting, but I think that those aspects make up for that a lot.”</p>
<p>“At the same time, I’ve also become more nervous,” he continued. “This is my first time doing this kind of thing in such a long while. I even feel awkward holding a mic.”</p>
<p>Someone commented that his good looks haven’t changed at all, and Kim Soo Hyun joked in reply, “I’m taking a lot of vitamins, and I’m grateful because you edit my photos well.”</p>
<p>When asked about casting Kim Soo Hyun, Director Park Shin Woo said, “What specific reason would I need to cast Kim Soo Hyun? Do I even need to say?”</p>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun shared that the title of the drama had caught his eye (the literal Korean title of the show is “I’m Psycho but It’s Okay”). He also said, “The character Moon Kang Tae has been hurt a lot, and I wanted to resonate with people by conveying his pain.” He said, “I’m going to do a good job of explaining his healing process.”</p>
<p>Seo Ye Ji was asked to describe her character Go Moon Young as a shape, and she chose the words “cutting” and “sharp.” She said, “She’s a cold person with no empathy, but regardless of how many scars she has, she’s very defensive.”</p>
<p>She explained that while Go Moon Young spends a lot of time making herself look good, it’s a method of self-defence rather than her being ostentatious. She said, “I think of it as a kind of armor; she’s saying to others, ‘This is the type of person I am, so be quiet. Don’t speak to me.'”</p>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun said about starring alongside Seo Ye Ji, “We feel very comfortable with each other normally, but when she’s acting in front of the camera, it’s like Go Moon Young immediately comes out. I get goosebumps.” He added, “I receive energy from her in that way and feel greatly motivated by her.”</p>
<p>Seo Ye Ji commented, “As he just said, we’re very comfortable together, but when he starts acting, he gets incredibly focused. It’s made me think, ‘That’s why he’s ‘The Kim Soo Hyun,’ and he’s a great help to me.”</p>
<p>Oh Jung Se plays the role of Moon Sang Tae, who is a very talented illustrator on the autism spectrum, while Park Gyu Young plays Nam Joo Ri, a nurse with a one-sided crush on Moon Kang Tae. Park Gyu Young shared, “I’m happy to be working together with senior actors that I admire.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the premiere, many drama fans have been excited to see Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se play brothers. Oh Jung Se said that while he’d been expecting filming to be difficult, he ended up experiencing a lot of emotions naturally.</p>
<p>“While saying my lines, I ended up saying the word ‘hyung,'” explained Oh Jung Se, referring to a term used by a man towards an older brother or male friend. “Psychologically, Moon Sang Tae’s younger brother is like a hyung to him,” he said. “I’ve experienced a lot of emotions and I’m thinking of him as a hyung.”</p>
<p>Kim Soo Hyun also said, “We were really shy with each other at first, but after working together on set, something built up between us even though we weren’t talking to each other a lot, since he’s really witty and fun.”</p>
<p>“When I heard about the show, the director, and the cast, I thought to myself, ‘This is already all set,” added Kim Soo Hyun. “I’m working hard with the intention of just observing what’s already perfect.”</p>
<p>He also said, “I hope that we’ll get viewership ratings of 15 percent. Park Shin Woo will make that happen.”</p>
<p>“It’s Okay to Not Be Okay” premieres on June 20.</p>
