<p>Floyd Mayweather&rsquo;s uncle Roger passed away earlier this week</p>
<p>Floyd Mayweather has posted a touching tribute to his late uncle Roger on social media. On Tuesday night, it emerged that the former two-weight champion and ex-trainer of &lsquo;Money&rsquo; had passed away at the age of 58.</p>
<p>The former WBA and lineal super featherweight champion&rsquo;s health had been deteriorating for several years, with diabetes plaguing towards the end of his life? Roger played an instrumental role in moulding Floyd into arguably the greatest boxer of all time and is considered by many to be one of the best coaches the sport has ever seen. And Floyd has posted a touching tribute to his late uncle on Twitter in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The 43-year-old uploaded an old photo of them with the accompanying caption: &ldquo;RIP Roger “BLACK MAMBA” Mayweather.&rdquo; JUST IN: Boxing news: Potential new Anthony Joshua fight date, Conor McGregor return</p>

<p>Floyd followed that tweet up with an even older picture of himself during his amateur days, which showed Roger standing in his corner. The snap&rsquo;s accompanying caption read: &ldquo;#TBT Thanks for always having my back Uncle Roger! RIP Black.&rdquo; Floyd attributes most of his success in the ring to the lessons he learned from Roger, whose passing he&rsquo;s labelled a &lsquo;terrible loss&rsquo;. In a statement on his official website, he said: ”My uncle was one of the most important people in my life inside and outside of the ring.

<p>&ldquo;Roger was a great champion and one of the best trainers in boxing. Unfortunately, his health was failing him for several years and now he can finally rest in peace. &ldquo;Roger meant the world to me, my father Floyd Sr., my uncle Jeff, everyone in and around the Mayweather Boxing Gym and the entire boxing world. It is a terrible loss for all of us. &ldquo;We are thankful for all the love and well-wishes we have already received as word traveled about Roger&rsquo;s passing. &ldquo;It helps me to see that he was able to touch so many people through his life in boxing, because he gave so much to the sport, which was his first and longtime love.&rdquo;</p>
