The US Investment grade bonds segment on TrackInsight is massive, with 238 ETFs included and over $ 575 Bn of assets under management. All these ETFs suffered to various extents from the important outflows recorded between March 12th and March 23rd, during which investors withdrew $ 29,8 Bn from the segment. Still, one ETF stands out from the others in the current inflow trend: the iShares Investment grade bond ETF. Indeed, when the US Federal Reserve decided to step in the market by buying corporate debt, they picked BlackRock to manage the purchases. Not surprisingly, this ETF has widely benefited from this decision, recording more than $1 Bn of inflows every day last week. Beyond the flows, the FED’s move last Monday had another impact on the ETF which saw its price soar to end the day well above its NAV, by 5$ per share.</p>

The Federal Reserve dramatically expanded its lending programs meant to unclog credit on Monday by expanding its facilities to include different types of municipal and corporate debt.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee said the Treasury and mortgage security purchases it approved a week ago are basically unlimited, according to the Wall Street Journal. It plans to buy $375 billion worth of Treasury securities and $250 billion worth of mortgage securities this week. It will also start buying commercial mortgage-backed securities that were issued by government-supported entities.</p>
<p>The Fed has been buying up mortgage-backed securities since the last recession to ensure that banks are able to provide financing to borrowers. The Fed’s purchase of mortgages allows banks to continue to originate new ones.</p>
<p>The Fed will also launch a trio of new lending facilities, including the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility. The central bank previously used this in 2008 to support business credit and consumer markets.</p>
<p>Another facility will lend to investment-grade companies, and the third will buy corporate bonds issued by highly rated companies in the corporate bond market. All three are meant to support $300 billion in new financing.</p>

<h3 id="treasury-liquidity-dries-up-fed-makes-it-rain">Treasury Liquidity Dries Up. Fed Makes It Rain.</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WUuOH5WHou9agIUn0flg9Q--~B/aD03Nzg7dz0xMjk2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/bbac2fce8ff665e30f1da2d15f5a1e75" alt="img">
(Bloomberg Opinion) &ndash; On Tuesday, I published a column with the headline “U.S. Treasuries Are Not Supposed to Trade Like This.” It showed that since the federal government began issuing 30-year bonds in the 1970s, yields had never whipsawed as much as they did in the previous three trading sessions.</p>
<p>I thought I had the reasons figured out. The Federal Reserve would cut its key lending rate to zero in short order? That’s still the base case. Foreign bond buyers are panic buying? Indeed, Japanese investors just bought a record amount of overseas bonds. A recession seems likely? It sure does.</p>
<p>But behind the scenes, there was an even more sinister cause for alarm: A stunning lack of liquidity in what’s often billed as the world’s deepest and most liquid bond market.</p>
<p>The magnitude of this issue is just now coming to light thanks to analysis from some of the biggest U.S. banks, which serve as primary dealers to the Fed. Investors were wondering aloud what was happening in Wednesday’s trading session, when stocks plummeted but Treasury yields climbed, creating the worst day for the combination since 2008.</p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. strategists have some answers. It comes down to leveraged investors, who buy cash Treasury securities and hedge the interest-rate risk with futures contracts. Because the bonds themselves are less liquid and more costly to hold on balance sheets, they’re cheaper than futures. In other words, it’s a strategy that brings in easy profits — provided, of course, that those investors don’t need to suddenly offload debt into a volatile market.</p>
<p>“Yields appear to have been overwhelmed by liquidity concerns,” the strategists wrote. To be specific, this is the vicious cycle they see potentially emerging without some sort of Fed or Treasury intervention:</p>
<p>“The risk in the current environment is that sustained illiquidity of the UST market … could cause leveraged UST investors to reduce their Treasury positions on a large scale. This would essentially result in a Treasury ‘supply shock’ as these funds reduce their positions &amp; force dealers to sell those positions in a very illiquid market. Significant position reduction from one large leveraged UST investor would likely lead to a cascading effect whereby U.S. Treasury yields rise sharply and force liquidations from other similar investors. This would worsen conditions for dealers to intermediate risk in the U.S. Treasury market, exacerbate the rise in U.S. Treasury yields, and further cheapen Treasuries.”</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for word of the liquidity crunch to reach the Fed’s ears. On Thursday, it unveiled a series of actions “to address temporary disruptions in Treasury financing markets” that are tantamount to a return to full-blown quantitative easing.</p>
<p>In a statement, the New York Fed said it would offer $500 billion in a three-month repo operation on Thursday. It will do the same on Friday, in addition to another $500 billion in a one-month operation. It also said that rather than buy $60 billion of Treasury bills a month as planned, starting Friday, it would conduct purchases “across a range of maturities.”</p>
<p>“These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak,” the New York Fed said in its statement. “The terms of operations will be adjusted as needed to foster smooth Treasury market functioning.”</p>
<p>To see just how out of whack the $16.9 trillion Treasury market has become, particularly the long bond, check out the following two charts that Bloomberg News’s Liz Capo McCormick and Alyce Andres published in an article (which you should read in full):</p>
<p>Trading conditions have become so bad, in fact, that investors are being warned not to trust certain yield levels on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note. “Until retail sales next Tuesday, managers should view the range from .73% to .89% as a signal of general trading distress rather than economic or Fed fundamentals,” Jim Vogel at FHN Financial wrote. The yield reached that upper bound in late trading Wednesday. “Even a clear announcement from Washington shouldn’t send rates quickly into that zone for the next two weeks.”</p>

<h3 id="the-stock-buyback-binge-may-be-over-for-now">The Stock Buyback Binge May Be Over. For Now.</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/24/business/24buybacks01/24buybacks01-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Investors have long been enamored with buybacks for that reason — even the announcement of such a program would often send a company’s stock price shooting higher — and companies have preferred them to paying out dividends. But critics of buybacks say they’re a poor use of company cash that could instead be invested in long-term growth and workers.</p>
<p>Companies in the S&amp;P 500 stock index spent more than $2 trillion buying back their own stocks over the last three years, which helped solidify the status of corporations as the single largest source of demand for American stocks. But the recent slump has mostly wiped out the gains; more than $8 trillion in shareholder value has vanished over the past month.</p>
<p>Republicans who had pushed for the tax cuts said they would increase economic growth, prod companies to invest and raise wages for workers. But the results were mixed: Wages did rise, but growth in the gross domestic product didn’t accelerate meaningfully. And investment slumped, in part because of last year’s trade war with China. Democrats pointed to the boom as proof that the law was a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy — over 80 percent of household stock ownership is controlled by the wealthiest 10 percent of American households.</p>
<p>Now, with both the president souring on the practice and critics in Congress turning up the heat on buybacks as they hammer out the details of a stimulus bill, investors have grown leery, too.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, they’ve jettisoned stocks of companies that are the among the largest buyers of their own shares. From the market’s peak on Feb. 19 through the close of trading on Monday, the S&amp;P 500 buyback index — which measures the performance of the top 100 companies with the highest buyback activity — fell 42.5 percent. That performance was worse than the regular S&amp;P 500 index, which was down roughly 34 percent.</p>
<p>“It’s significantly underperformed,” said Ben Laidler, chief executive of Tower Hudson Research, a financial markets research firm in London. “The market is certainly worried about this for some of those stocks.”</p>
<p>Buybacks might shrink for the foreseeable future because companies would rather save their cash and don’t want to be singled out for criticism by politicians, analysts said. Already this year, announcements of new plans for buybacks are down more than 35 percent — in dollar terms — according to data from Birinyi Associates, a financial markets research group.</p>

Receiving Wide Coverage &hellip;</p>
<p>Fed actions</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve “cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero Sunday and said it would buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in an urgent response to the new coronavirus pandemic,” the Wall Street Journal reports. “The Fed’s rate-setting committee, which delivered an unprecedented second emergency rate cut in as many weeks, said it would hold rates at the new, low level ‘until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track’ to achieve its goals of stable prices and strong employment.”</p>
<p>“We have responded very strongly not just with interest rates but also with liquidity measures today,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a press conference Sunday night. Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, New York Times, Washington Post</p>
<p>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell Bloomberg News</p>
<p>“The Fed also announced a handful of additional actions Sunday, including lowering the primary credit rate by 150 basis points to encourage banks to lend via the discount window and urged financial institutions to use their capital and liquidity buffers to lend to people and businesses affected by the coronavirus,” American Banker reports.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for the Fed’s “rare and dramatic Sunday evening move” may have been “companies around the world are drawing down their credit lines at the same time, forcing banks to cough up large sums of money on short notice and further straining a financial industry already hammered by sinking interest rates,” the Journal says.</p>
<p>“Banks routinely sell their corporate customers revolving credit lines that serve as backup in case businesses run into cash crunches. The problem now is that the world-wide patchwork of lockdowns and travel restrictions aimed at containing the coronavirus pandemic is causing a wide variety of businesses to scramble for cash all at once to make payroll and cover operating costs as sales plunge.”</p>
<p>Separately, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said “he would ask Congress to reinstate powers that were used during the 2008 financial crisis to support the economy as the coronavirus threatens to grind business activity in the United States to a halt,” the New York Times says “The comments suggest that the White House is bracing for a widespread downturn that could harm sectors well beyond the travel and cruise ship industries, and that the federal government could need to return to the type of crisis-era measures that were ultimately scaled back by lawmakers in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.”</p>

<p>No more buybacks</p>
<p>The largest banks in the U.S. that are members of the Financial Services Forum agreed to suspend stock buybacks until at least July and instead “pledged to put their capital to use helping consumers and businesses struggling with the rapid economic slowdown caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak.” Wall Street Journal, Financial Times</p>
<p>Separately, the commodity prepayments business, “an important corner of trade finance, is becoming riskier for banks and traders dealing with fallout from the coronavirus-inspired market rout and the recent crash in oil prices,” the Journal reports. Global banks most active in the business are Rabobank, Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro and Société Générale.</p>
<p>“Banks extend credit to companies and privately held trading houses, which in turn lend billions of dollars to oil producers by paying upfront for future deliveries of oil and other commodities. Banks get paid back when traders take delivery of oil. But the coronavirus pandemic has weakened global oil demand. The drop in oil prices means the volumes of oil being delivered no longer meet the size of payments promised to the banks, heightening the risk of renegotiation of deals. In this environment, the deals ultimately become less lucrative for banks — and to a lesser extent traders.”</p>
<p>“Regional banks with big energy-lending portfolios” are “especially vulnerable” to the crash in oil prices,” the Journal reports. “U.S. and Canadian banks have more than $100 billion in loans outstanding to energy companies. Larger banks also are on the hook for billions of dollars in loans to the energy industry, but they are relatively less exposed because their balance sheets are much bigger and their lending businesses more diversified.”</p>
<p>“So when exactly does a coronavirus-triggered corporate market meltdown officially turn into a full-blown financial crisis?” the Financial Times asks. “That’s a question many market participants, and banks in particular, must be asking themselves.”</p>
<p>“The fact is that the banking system has already been pulled into the corporate credit crisis that many people predicted would be the cause of the next big market downturn. It’s all too easy to see how the problems of individual companies — technology firms, retailers, airlines and insurance companies — could be passed to individual banks and then to countrywide banking systems. Ultimately, they could spread throughout the global financial system, leaving central bankers once again the lender of last resort, standing between us and another global financial crisis.”</p>
<p>“The deep level of fear that has set in on Wall Street — as weeks of market gyrations have wiped trillions of dollars of wealth — has also permeated people’s personal lives,” the New York Times reports, noting that “customers at a Bank of America branch in Midtown Manhattan, the financial heart of New York, were lining up to take cash out of their accounts — sometimes tens of thousands of dollars at a time. So many people sought huge sums that the bank branch, at 52nd Street and Park Avenue, temporarily ran out of $100 bills to fulfill large withdrawals. The shortage hit after a rash of requests for as much as $50,000.”</p>
<p>“We don’t keep large amounts of cash in big bills in the branches because it’s dangerous for our employees and there is low demand,” said Bill Halldin, a BofA spokesman, who “said the bank had enough cash available at its branches to meet its clients’ needs.”</p>
<p>Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase said Friday “that they have employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus,” Reuters reports. “Citi said that one employee was confirmed to have the virus, and JPMorgan confirmed that two of its employees do. The announcements followed similar news from banks such as Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and others, as the flu-like virus continues to spread in the United States and worldwide.”</p>
<p>Quotable</p>
<p>“The coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States. Global financial conditions have also been significantly affected. The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools.” — Statement from the Fed, announcing its decision to cut the federal funds rate and buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities</p>

Chapter 11 bankruptcy that wipes out shareholders is the correct solution for collapsing share-buyback queens. US airlines already know this from experience. It works.</p>
<p>The Trump administration is putting together a rumored $850-billion stimulus package that will include taxpayer funded bailouts of Corporate America, according to leaks cited widely by the media. Trump in the press conference today singled out $50 billion in bailout funds for US airlines alone. A bailout of this type is designed to bail out shareholders and unsecured creditors. That’s all it is. The alternative would be a US chapter 11 bankruptcy procedure which would allow the company to operate, while it is being handed to the creditors, with shareholders getting wiped out.</p>
<p>So get this: The big four US airlines – Delta, United, American, and Southwest – whose stocks are now getting crushed because they may run out of cash in a few months, would be the primary recipients of that $50 billion bailout, well, after they wasted, blew, and incinerated willfully and recklessly together $43.7 billion in cash on share buybacks since 2012 for the sole purpose of enriching the very shareholders that will now be bailed out by the taxpayer (buyback data via YCHARTS):</p>
<p>Share buybacks were considered a form of market manipulation and were illegal under SEC rules until 1982, when the SEC issued Rule 10b-18 which provided corporations a “safe harbor” to buy back their own shares under certain conditions. Once corporations figured out that no one cared about those conditions, and that no one was auditing anything, share buybacks exploded. And they’ve have been hyped endlessly by Wall Street.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 companies, including those that are now asking for huge bailouts from taxpayers and from the Fed, have blown, wasted and incinerated together $4.5 trillion with a T in cash to buy back their own shares just since 2012:</p>
<p>And those $4.5 trillion in cash that was wasted, blown, and incinerated on share buybacks since 2012 for the sole purpose of enriching shareholders is now sorely missing from corporate balance sheets, where these share buybacks were often funded with debt.</p>
<p>And the record amount of corporate debt – “record” by any measure – that has piled up since 2012 has become the Fed’s number one concern as trigger of the next financial crisis. So here we are.</p>
<p>In 2018, even the SEC got briefly nervous about the ravenous share buybacks and what they did to corporate financial and operational health. “On too many occasions, companies doing buybacks have failed to make the long-term investments in innovation or their workforce that our economy so badly needs,” SEC Commissioner Jackson pointed out. And he fretted whether the existing rules “can protect investors, workers, and communities from the torrent of corporate trading dominating today’s markets.”</p>
<p>Obviously, they couldn’t, as we now see.</p>
<p>Enriching shareholders is the number one goal no matter what the risks. These shareholders are also the very corporate executives and board members that make the buyback decisions. And when it hits the fan, there is always the taxpayer or the Fed to bail out those shareholders, the thinking goes. But this type of thinking is heinous.</p>
<p>Boeing is also on the bailout docket. Today it called for “at least” a $60-billion bailout of the aerospace industry, where it is the biggest player. It alone wasted, blew, and incinerated $43 billion in cash since 2012 to manipulate up its own shares until its liquidity crisis forced it to stop the practice last year, and its shares have since collapsed (buyback data via YCHARTS):</p>

<p>If Boeing’s current liquidity crisis causes the company to run out of funds to pay its creditors, it needs to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Under the supervision of the Court, the company would be restructured, with creditors getting the company, and with shareholders likely getting wiped out.</p>
<p>Boeing would continue to operate throughout, and afterwards emerge as a stronger company with less debt, and hopefully an entirely new executive suite and board that are hostile to share buybacks and won’t give in to the heinous clamoring by Wall Street for them.</p>
<p>No one could foresee the arrival of the coronavirus and what it would do to US industry. I get that. But there is always some crisis in the future, and companies need to prepare for them to have the resources to deal with them.</p>
<p>A company that systematically and recklessly hollows out its balance sheet by converting cash and capital into share buybacks, often with borrowed money, to “distribute value to shareholders” or “unlock shareholder value” or whatever Wall Street BS is being hyped, has set itself up for failure at the next crisis. And that’s fine. But shareholders should pay for it since they benefited from those share buybacks – and not taxpayers or workers with dollar-paychecks. Shareholders should know that they won’t be bailed out by the government or the Fed, but zeroed out in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>The eventual costs of enriching shareholders recklessly in a way that used to be illegal must not be inflicted on taxpayers via a government bailout; or on everyone earning income in dollars via a bailout from the Fed.</p>
<p>The solution has already been finely tuned in the US: Delta, United, American, and other airlines already went through chapter 11 bankruptcies. They work. The airlines continued to operate in a manner where passengers couldn’t tell the difference. The airlines were essentially turned over to creditors and restructured. When they emerged from bankruptcy, they issued new shares to new shareholders, and in most cases, the old shares became worthless. The new airlines emerged as stronger companies – until they started blowing it with their share buybacks.</p>
<p>Companies like Boeing, GE, any of the airlines, or any company that blew this now sorely needed cash on share buybacks must put the ultimate cost of those share buybacks on shareholders and unsecured creditors. Any bailouts, whether from the Fed or the government, should only be offered as Debtor in Possession (DIP) loans during a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing where shareholders get wiped out.</p>
<p>In other words, companies that buy back their owns shares must be permanently disqualified for bailouts, though they may qualify for a government-backed DIP loan in bankruptcy court if shareholders get wiped out. Because those proposed taxpayer and Fed bailouts of these share-buyback queens are just heinous.</p>
<p>The eeriness of the whole situation may leave permanent marks on consumers and business-decision makers. Read… Lockdown in San Francisco, Silicon Valley &amp; the East Bay: We’re to “Shelter in Place.” What it Means Now &amp; Long Term</p>
